Trade negotiations across different levels have tended to put an overriding emphasis on increasing market access (MA) and trade flows per se often without adequate reference to a balancing of development costs and benefits. Trade-related obligations have had direct and indirect implications on exercise of policy space in several countries and often without any accompanying increase in MA, underlining the need to exercise caution where tangible trade offs for policy space do not exist.20 The Sao-Paulo consensus during the 11th Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 2004, highlighted that countries should bear in mind the development goals and objectives, and take into account the need for appropriate balance between national policy space and international disciplines and commitments in trade, investment and industrial development.21 Striking the right balance however is not easy as the UNCTAD World Investment Report (WIR), 2001 noted as well: \u2018too much policy space reduces the value of international obligations; too stringent obligations place excessive constraints on the national policy space. Finding the right balance is the challenge\u2019. 22 3.1 Understanding policy space The usage of the term \u2018policy space\u2019 is often traced back to discussions at UNCTAD acquiring an \u2018official\u2019 sta- tus when it was defined in the Sao Paulo Consensus, 200423 document as \u2018the scope for domestic policies, especially in the areas of trade, investment and industrial development\u2026 often framed by international disciplines, commitments, and global market considerations\u2019.24 While the term itself may be of recent vintage, policy space in a broad sense has been practiced by most developing countries inter alia for broad economic strategy and specific policies. It embodies international policies, which underlie the work of the UNCTAD since long and is a \u2018fusion of three key principles in international law\u201925: \uf06c Principle of Sovereign Equality of States, which refers to the binding nature and application of interna- tional rules and disciplines dependent on the equal exercise of national sovereignty by participating States. \uf06c Right to Development. \uf06c Principle of Special Treatment for Developing Countries, which relates to provision of special and dif- ferential treatment in order to be responsive and accommodating to specific development needs and circumstances rather than be based on a one-size-fits-all approach. Policy space may also be understood as the scope for domestic policies to ensure equity, strategic intervention and regulation especially in the areas of trade, investment and industrial development. It can be framed, constrained or expanded by the international commitments, agreements and disciplines that states 19 The term \u2018policy coherence\u2019 is a multi-dimensional term which can lend itself to varying meanings. The term is used here in the context of \u2018reinforcing coherence between national development strategies and global processes and discipline as well as policy coherence among and within the various sectors of the global economy that impact on development prospects of developing countries especially important in the context the interface between the international trading system and the international monetary and financial system\u2019.

Trade in services often takes place via the movement of primary factors of production (people or capital) or via other technologies, which substitute for factor movement, like direct connections through telecommunications and the internet. Consumers may also move to buy services at the place of their production.29 Trade and investment in services has grown at a faster rate than merchandise trade, and has been mainly driven by lower transport costs, advances in telecommunications and information technology and gradual reduction of barriers. The GATS agreement of the WTO, for the first time, brought the services sector in the ambit of the international trading system. GATS offered a four fold categorization of services supply: \uf06c Mode-1: cross-border movement of the service (\u201ccross border trade\u201d) e.g.: e-learning, virtual universities. \uf06c Mode-2: cross-border movement of the service consumer (\u201cconsumption abroad\u201d); e.g.: tourism abroad, students going abroad to study. \uf06c Mode-3: cross-border movement of the corporate service provider through investments (\u201ccommercial presence\u201d); e.g. a particular country allowing foreign companies to buy domestic enterprises, setting up offices, franchises with local organizations. \uf06c Mode-4: \u201ccross border movement of natural persons\u201d; e.g. nurses, teachers and others working abroad temporarily. In principle, the overall architecture of GATS was intended to follow the \u2018request\u2019 and \u2018offer\u2019 mode and the positive listing approach wherein countries retain the flexibilities to voluntarily select both the extent and pace of liberalization in keeping with their developmental goals and needs. References to policy space were made specifically in the preamble to the GATS agreement, besides Article IV and Article XIX. The preamble notes that the objective of an early achievement of progressively higher levels of liberalization of trade in 26 This principle states that every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith. This principle is provided for in terms of the treaty law in Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969, and is subscribed to by all States both as a matter of treaty law and as a matter of customary international law. Applicability of the pacta sunt servanda principle is implicit in para 8 of the Sao Paulo Consensus, when it speaks of the need for \u201cappropriate balance between national policy space and international commitments\u201d. 27 South Centre (2005). 28 Also see Warren (1996). 29 Findlay and Guo (2007). 8 services through successive negotiating rounds while seeking to secure an overall balance of rights and obli- gations needs to respect national policy objectives. Also, the preamble recognizes the right of governments to regulate and introduce new regulations on the supply of services within their territories to meet national policy objectives. Article IV, dealing with the increasing participation of developing countries, mandates that negotiations of specific commitments shall be facilitated in sectors and modes of supply of export interest to developing countries. Article IV.3. also notes that special priority shall be given to the LDC members in the implementation of Article IV by taking particular account of the serious difficulty of the LDCs in accepting negotiated specific commitments in view of their special economic situation and their development, trade and financial needs. Article XIX.2. states that the process of liberalization shall take place with due respect for national policy objectives and the level of development of individual members overall and in individual sectors. Also, it lays down that there shall be appropriate flexibility for individual developing countries for opening fewer sectors, liberalizing fewer types of transactions, progressively extending MA in line with their development situation and when making access to their markets available to foreign services suppliers attaching access conditions aimed at achieving the objectives referred to in Article IV. The GATS agreement in Article XXI relating to modification of schedules however, erects in practical terms, prohibitively high barriers for withdrawal of commitments if the actual experience of liberalization of the country is not found to be beneficial in particular sectors and modes. Article XXI.2 (b) in particular mandates that in the event of a scenario of modification of schedules, countries would need to make com- pensatory adjustments on a MFN basis.

These modalities state explicitly that the LDCs shall be provided maximum flexibility and shall form the basis for the negotiations. Specifically, the scope of the modalities suggested that restraint would be exercised for removal of MA conditions which LDCs need for achievement of development objectives. Paragraphs 3 and 9 of Annex C of the Hong Kong Ministerial Text (HKMT), mandate members to pursue the \u201cfull and effective implementa- tion of the LDC modalities\u201d.31 Further, in paragraph 26 of the HKMT, it is stated that in light of the particular economic situation of LDCs, including the difficulties they face, the LDCs are not expected to undertake new commitments in GATS. However, as shall be discussed in subsequent sections, in reality the LDC modalities have yet to be realized in practice except in some isolated instances.32 However, the original architecture of GATS has come under increasing strain by industrialized countries led by the European Union (EU) during the Doha negotiations. Since the Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005, the industrialized countries succeeded in introducing a number of important changes in the HKMT which effectively have served to modify the original intent and approach especially with 30 Visit http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres03_e/pr351_e.htm, accessed 25 November 2007. 31 Visit http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min05_e/final_text_e.htm, accessed 25 November 2007. 32 Norway, for instance, has stated that by way of implementation of the LDC modalities, it has withdrawn all requests to LDCs in services negotiations.

With reference to Mode 3, Annex C of the HKMT dealing with services mandated that in order to accelerate the progress of negotiations, new and improved commitments be made relating to: \uf06c Commitments on enhanced levels of foreign equity participation which by implication would lead to a reduction in the domestic equity participation. \uf06c Removal or substantial reduction of economic needs tests which would again open up the field for foreign firms to expand their presence in developing countries. \uf06c Commitments allowing greater flexibility on the types of legal entity permitted which would affect a country\u2019s right to regulate provision of services in the interests of national development as existed in the preamble to the GATS text agreed to in the Uruguay Round.

Although the plurilateral (along with the bilateral and multilateral) approach was envisaged under Article XIX.4 of GATS, it was not invoked formally as this approach contained prescriptive language and \u2018obliges\u2019 countries to \u2018consider\u2019 requests while submitting revised offers on an MFN basis.

Mode 3 is economically the most important mode and is estimated to account for more than half of all trade under GATS.36 The economic importance of this mode can be gleaned from the fact that cross border sup- ply of services can be undertaken for limited services, and access regimes in both Mode 1 and 4 are often linked to some form of commercial presence.37 Not only do the services sector constitute the most important segment in the industrialized countries, the current list of Fortune 500 companies contain more service related companies and fewer manufacturing companies seeking new markets through commercial presence in developing coun- tries than in previous decades.38 In this light, the Study sought to focus attention on the preliminary analysis of commitments on Mode 3 to assess the scope and depth of commitments by Asian countries. 36 Adlung and Roy (2005). 37 Adlung and Roy (2005). 38 Visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_economy, accessed 25 November 2007. 11 Though services trade has been growing in the world, differences exist in services trade indicators of different regions. Services contribute to over 70 percent of employment in industrialized countries and 35 percent in developing countries. Since the year 1990, the share of services in GDP has risen to 72 percent in industrialized countries and to 52 percent in developing countries. However, services represent no more than 20 percent of total trade on Balance of Payments basis.39 Though these figures suggest that the services trade is stronger for industrialized nations, it is important to note that the annual growth rate of services export is eight percent for developing countries, as compared to six percent for industrialized countries. Also, though the share of developing countries in world services export increased from 18 percent to 24 percent from 1990 to 2005, it is only Asia\u2019s share of services trade that has increased while export shares of Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa have been stagnant.40 Table 1 shows Asia as the third largest exporter and importer of services, after Europe and North America.

Much has changed since then with a Pricewaterhouse Coopers survey in 2006 suggesting that two major Asian economies, China and India, are the two most attractive locations for FDI in emerging markets (WIR 2006). In recent years, the trend in services trade has been that of its concentration in some Asian developing countries. In 2003, 12 leading exporters of services among developing countries accounted for 71 percent of services export of all developing countries. The group of leading services exporters from the developing world included Asian countries like China, India, Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Thailand (UNCTAD 2005:3). Singapore and Hong Kong (SAR, China) are the other countries from Asia which have become major service providers. Table 3 shows the manner in which export and import of services in Asian countries has risen over the period 1980 - 2006. 13 Table 3: Change in value of exports and imports of services Country 1980 1990 2000 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 China - 5855 30431 39745 46734 62434 74404 (e)86376 Hong Kong (SAR, China) - - 40430 44601 46555 55157 62175 (e)69059 Republic of Korea 2570 9637 30534 28388 32957 41882 45375 51874 Mongolia - 48 78 184 208 338 (e)414 (e)447 Bangladesh 211 392 815 849 1012 1083 1245 1296 India 2971 4625 16684 19478 23397 (e)29235 - - Sri Lanka 231 440 939 1268 1411 1527 1540 1676 Source: UNCTAD Handbook of Statistics, 2006-07. (e) - estimated The expansion of trade in services in Asia is mirrored in the available foreign investment data, with the majority of foreign investment in the region now directed at service industries. In this context, FDI trends for the Asian countries acquire relevance. The services sector in South Asia, East Asia and South-East Asia has been receiving increasing FDI flows driven by large deals in financial services, particularly in China, and in other services such as telecommunications. Foreign banks and financial institutions invested about US$ 12 billion in China\u2019s banking industry in 2005, compared to US$ three billion in 2004. The services sector is attracting the attention of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in developing countries of Asia. 14 The countries of the focus of this analysis are listed in Table 5 with dates of their accession to the WTO.

The majority of these countries were founding members of the WTO in 1995, as well as members of the GATT. Mongolia acceded in 1997, and Jordan, Oman, Cambodia, China, Nepal and Saudi Arabia negotiated their GATS schedules later in time. As NACs, it is sometimes suggested that they were under greater pressure to liberalize their services sector. The case of NACs would also be examined in subsequent sections. 5.

They work as a negative threshold - no horizontal commitment implies that no restrictions other than those listed in the schedules apply. Countries without any indication of horizontal commitments have chosen not to impose any general limitation and, therefore, their restrictions and qualifications are confined to those listed in the sectoral schedules for the sectors included. Horizontal commitments do not cover sectors that have not been subject to sectoral commitments.

Normally, sectoral commitments are more restrictive than those that are made horizontally, for any given sec- tor. If that is not the case, the extension of liberalization would have to be expressly stated in the schedule. Horizontal restrictions in MA or pre-establishment conditions are mostly control and ownership limita- tions. NT commitments are more common at the horizontal level. The majority of countries included land ownership limitations. Most countries also included other types of NT restrictions, such as on technology transfer and training requirements, but more often, on subsidies and incentives. 5.1.2 MA commitments Under GATS, member countries have been provided with an option to allow the entry of foreign services providers (exporters) under a predetermined set of conditions for accessing the markets of the importing countries. As has been discussed in the introduction, MA under services is a much more complex area than under goods, as it relates to the area of government regulation/policies which are generally aimed at attain- ment of domestic policy objectives and not trade policy per se. Scheduling market access limitations is hence critical in exercise of policy space. Each sectoral commitment has two columns where countries fill in the measures they apply in terms of: \uf06c MA: Under GATS, there are six types of MA measures, listed in Article XVI, which can be summarized as quantitative restrictions (QRs), limitations in the type of legal entity or joint venture and limitations on foreign-equity participation. The latter refers to the limits on the extent of foreign capital in the sectors that are scheduled, as conditions for establishment. \uf06c NT: This, according to Article XVII, refers to any discriminatory measure other than the conditions or qualifications set out in the country schedules that may serve to modify the conditions of competition against foreign service providers. Countries may schedule measures relating to both MA and NT. In cases where the measures are not covered under both MA and NT, the same needs to be inscribed, according to Article XX.2, in the MA column. This explains the larger variety of measures covering MA, as well as the larger number of other measures found listed in the MA column of country schedules. Illustratively, the types of restrictions found in the MA column are listed below: 16 \uf06c Economic needs tests (ENTs) \uf06c Environmental, cultural, and historical concerns \uf06c Experience/certification/rating/size of investor41 \uf06c Joint venture (JV)/foreign-equity ceiling42 \uf06c Foreign-equity ceilings \uf06c National board members43 \uf06c Licensing/number of service providers44 \uf06c Prudential risk management45 \uf06c Residence/nationality requirements \uf06c Forms of establishment \uf06c Need for local agent \uf06c Limits on business scope \uf06c Geographic limitations \uf06c Import limits \uf06c Unbound It is possible to find, in each sectoral commitment, one or more restrictions\u2014for example, a licensing requirement along with a geographic limitation and a foreign-equity ceiling. In such cases, each restriction is taken as an individual annotation or record. However, some types of restrictions are incompatible as they have the same direct implications\u2014for example, a licensing requirement and an ENT or a joint venture requirement and a limitation in the form of establishment. 5.1.3 Full Commitments Full commitments in MA are represented by a \u2018none\u2019 entry beside the scheduled sector. A \u2018none\u2019 entry es- sentially implies that the country has not exercised its right to apply any MA restriction or conditions on the delivery of services in its territory by a foreign services supplier. Members intending to build in developmental policies and wishing to keep them in place need to list them in their schedule only if these policies constitute a barrier or discrimination against foreign suppliers. However, countries need to take a dynamic and futuristic view of and in this sense it should be clear that the same development objective might require the application of different policies and, therefore, MA restrictions in different periods of time. A full commitment will impede that possibility in the future. In sectoral terms, most full commitments have been made in business services, tourism and construction. 5.2 Use of MA measures In order to facilitate the understanding of the schedules, the variety of possible measures can be grouped into four types: 1.

ENTs and environmental, cultural and historical concerns.46 5.2.1 MA restrictions: Control limitations Control limitations, while allowing foreign ownership up to a certain threshold, tend to limit the capacity of the foreign investor to control the corporations in a specific sub-sector. Such restrictions normally target strategic planning and policy making at the corporate level, focusing on the types of decisions that are taken by the board of directors. The sectors targeted by control limitations are business services, construction, communications, finance, health and tourism. Unless specified in the schedule, other types of arrangements such as manage- ment and exploitation contracts, build operate transfer (BOT) schemes, etc., involving foreign enterprises, are not covered by these restrictions. Control limitations are, by far, the most frequent. Moreover, various types of control limitation restric- tions normally appear together; yet national board members requirements are to be found only with another type of control limitation restriction. China, India, Nepal, the Philippines and Thailand are the main users of control and ownership limi- tations. Thailand includes a foreign-equity participation limitation across the board. Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Pakistan and the Philippines have also introduced restrictions horizontally. However, China, India, Nepal, the Philippines and Thailand are seen to apply these measures in differ- ent ways. First, the scheduled foreign-equity ceilings vary greatly among them: 1. The Philippines and Thailand have limited foreign control and even limited the number of nationals on the boards of directors of corporate entities. These countries also have horizontal commitments that affect foreign control, so the ceilings on foreign ownership are lower at the sectoral level. 2. China and India have generally committed to foreign control stakes (51 percent in India, and fully foreign owned in China), except in the telecom and transport sectors. 3. Nepal allows foreign control stakes across the board, with foreign-equity ceilings up to 80 percent. The cases of China and Nepal are of great interest. Both scheduled progressive phase-outs, of up to eight years, so as to allow increasing ownership of foreign firms in their services sectors. Both countries have committed themselves to allow foreign investors to control the companies invested in by them. However, China\u2019s commitments also include the need for joint ventures with a local partner. Nepal, on the other hand, requires local incorporation (with a local partner in control of a very small part of the capital). This type of schedule has been used previously\u2014around the beginning of the current decade\u2014by India for selected sec- tors in its schedule (business services, construction, health and tourism). In the case of China and Nepal, the objective of the commitments is not to retain control of the sector, but to encourage foreign entry and control, not through acquisition of existing businesses, but through creat- ing new businesses (promoting greenfield investment), enabling the creation of partnerships with the local businesses, and, possibly, increasing technology transfer to the local partner. 46 ENTs, by definition, is a quantitative limitation. However, these were grouped separately as they may also imply a variety of measures. Often, they are also defined by an explicit development objective. They may also appear along with other quantitative measures, a direct proof of their separate nature. 18 In contrast, India, Philippines and Thailand do not allow incorporation of new foreign businesses. Foreign-equity limits must then apply to financial operations so as to enable raising of capital for the develop- ment of existing local companies, as was the norm at the time when privatization first occurred in key services sectors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c69c52dd-ab85-4c84-abfb-cca22a92c416": {"__data__": {"id_": "c69c52dd-ab85-4c84-abfb-cca22a92c416", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63b7ada928be8a99cab3979f4965cae700d7d48d751003b572a8880ff03d8ffa"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f3650de-d0d9-493d-9180-e6f3307cda30", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74779b2de66477cd5487c7abdd5752fc178e529f58dd7cef4800ab5d1a25a24d"}}, "hash": "829a58ead3095f0dadad4e52be4c4719491626b332de2c6f98515c9623fa1d22", "text": "5.2.2 MA restrictions: Quantitative limitations\u2014reducing competition and risks All Asian countries included such measures when scheduling their telecom, banking, insurance and other financial services sub-sectors, which are prominent in the schedules and are subject to the largest number of restrictions as compared to other sub-sectors.

In the telecommunications sector, all the registered restrictions are intended to limit the number of service providers that can compete in the market (licensing). Licensing is widely used in the telecom- munications sub-sector, in order to ensure the profitability of the competitors. 2. In the financial sector, the objective seems to be security and risk avoidance. This may explain why licens- ing restrictions accompany other measures relating to the certification of the quality, experience and reliability of the service provider. Some measures that help to avoid balance-of-payment risks also are included. In other sectors, these types of measures are used marginally, mostly to ensure that the new entrants will make a difference in terms of the projects involved and their engagement in the local economy. 5.2.3 MA restrictions: Limitations in the forms of establishment This category of restrictions includes those measures that limit the capacity of the foreign juridical person to decide, in a particular country: \uf06c The type of legal entity, and, therefore, legal capacity of the subsidiary; and \uf06c The scope of commercial activity. This limitation can apply to the type of service or client, amount of the contracts and geographic area of activity. Therefore, entry is allowed, but these types of limitations will define the basic features of the busi- ness model in a given country, otherwise decided by the shareholders of the entity. The variety of forms and purposes of these limitations are very wide. By their substantial features, the limitations can be divided into two groups: \uf06c Those that impose a specific type of legal entity: limitations in the forms of establishment, JV require- ments (with and without foreign-equity ceilings) and need for a local agent. These measures are incom- patible (that is, they cannot appear at the same time). \uf06c Those that limit the foreign investors\u2019 market operations: business scope and geographic limitations. Limitations on business scope normally forbid the foreign investor from engaging in the provision of certain services within the sector (by contract volume, type of buyer, etc.). Geographic limitations are mostly applied through a limit on the number of branches in the local market, which, by itself, constrains the geographic scope. 19 These types of restrictions have been used by a limited number of countries in the case of limitations in the form of establishment. On the other hand, Indonesia and the Republic of Korea impose horizontal restrictions in the form of commercial presence: \uf06c Indonesia requires that any kind of foreign commercial presence should be in the form of a representa- tive office or a joint venture with a foreign equity ceiling of 49 percent. \uf06c The Republic of Korea restricts foreign commercial presence through the acquisition of outstanding stocks of existing domestic companies, which basically leads to the need for setting up new business facilities towards incorporation of any commercial interest in the country. Therefore, these countries have shown preference for forms of establishment that imply greenfield investment which if channelled appropriately can have beneficial employment linkages in the host economy. Though they tend to be used across the board, the preferred sectors are professional services, banking, insur- ance, construction, maritime transport and audiovisual services. However, a further analysis of the composi- tion of restrictions by sub-sectors reveals a marked preference for limitations in the form of establishment for professional services, while limitations on business scope and geographic limitations are mostly used in banking and insurance. In the case of professional services, limitations in the form of establishment are normally used to limit the ability of the foreign service provider to penetrate the market. The limitations may imply that only natu- ral persons, partnerships and other non-limited liability companies, with limited resources, can access the market. These types of limitations, combined with restrictions under Mode 4 horizontal commitments can significantly reduce MA, particularly when combined with a nationality/residence requirement. With regard to banking and insurance, limitations in the form of establishment will only allow repre- sentations and agencies, and, in many cases, limited number of branches and limited scope of businesses. The obligation to use a local agent will produce a similar effect. This situation is common in the schedule of the Republic of Korea when targeting specific sectors in which full foreign participation, even through greenfield investment, is not welcome. This is the reason for a more mixed composition of restrictions in the banking and insurance sub-sectors, compared to professional services. 5.2.4 ENT: Another way of limiting MA ENTs can appear in various forms.

At the same time, they seem to be the most restrictive, as they restrain access to the market under generally unspecified or discretionary criteria. Within the services sector, they are mostly used to regulate the entry of natural persons as service providers, but are also to be found covering a range of specific activities. 5.3 Trends in the use of MA restrictions From an examination of the main types of MA restrictions used by countries, it can be seen that independently of the number of sectors scheduled, there is a tendency towards less usage of control and ownership mea- sures. This conclusion is based on the fact that apart from the LDCs, the prevalence of control measures is very limited in Cambodia, China, Hong Kong (SAR, China) and Singapore. In the case of Nepal, as mentioned earlier, foreign-equity ceilings are not used with the main purpose of retaining local control. It seems that control measures have been targeted to serve as the main constraints for foreign participation. On the other hand, 20 full MA commitments are more common among NACs. In these cases, developing countries will not be able to use restrictions to limit the ability of foreign investors to penetrate their markets. However, the possible negative impact of this trend can be offset by the use of other types of limitations which while granting MA in principle, shape the way in which the foreign company engages in the local economy. These are basically limitations in the form of establishment and in business scope. As compared to limitations on control and ownership, limitations in the form of establishment may have a more positive effect insofar as they can promote greenfield investment and competition and tech- nology transfer, more flexibly, than control limitations. Other practices can have the same final effect. For example, the need for local incorporation would, in effect, ban the acquisition of local companies. The decision on an appropriate context specific combination of measures relating to the form of estab- lishment which integrates the best interests of both investors and local communities is a strategic judgement and often complex one to make. For example, in hotel services, granting full ownership would not in itself attract foreign suppliers if other, more preferred forms of engagement, such as management contracts, are not allowed. Joint venture requirements may not work as a stimulus for technology transfer if the local partner is unable to absorb foreign technology, and in fact, may deter the provision of key services to the rest of the economy. Limitations in business scope can induce foreign investors to fill in a market niche as part of a com- prehensive industrial development strategy. They also can be used to avoid crowding out local companies from a specific segment, as, for example, in the case of Cambodia, which allows foreign-owned hotels only if they are rated three star or higher. 5.4 NT commitments The principle of NT is an obligation intended to ensure that the member country does not discriminate be- tween the foreign service suppliers of the member countries and the domestic service suppliers. It is not across the board obligation, and members are free to choose both specific sectors, and also lay down specific conditions and qualifications under which NT would be provided to suit their own national development policy objectives and context and state of development of their services sector. In other words, both in terms of the sectoral coverage and substantive content, members have the policy space under GATs to choose their NT obligations and commitments. Under NT, for all the sectors inscribed in its Schedule and subject to the conditions and qualifications set out therein, each member is obliged to accord to services and service suppliers of any other member, in respect of all measures affecting the supply of services, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own like services and service suppliers. In order to meet this requirement, a member can provide formally identical treatment or formally different treatment to that it accords to its own services and service suppliers. The main idea is that in either case, the treatment would be considered less favourable if it serves to modify the conditions of competition in favour of services or service suppliers of any other member. The GATS also has a list of General Exceptions (Article XIV) wherein members are permitted to exercise in contravention of the Agreement subject to the fact that the measures do not constitute arbitrary or unjusti- fiable discrimination between countries where like conditions prevail or seen as a form of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b49a1f3b-7d69-4841-8289-6c75fc05d0d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "b49a1f3b-7d69-4841-8289-6c75fc05d0d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a23b4c7e8fbe35fde845a1905d614092a5cf17792e88d1cb575f7b79de0f9111"}, "3": {"node_id": "d4026b47-610a-4cf5-b032-ff69b360bc1a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "309d90c268aec009d01524b791a034c03f5e9e066fa5269e1565b2bf4d2b152a"}}, "hash": "364b5a5ddab899941c6977fc486946f6ef365a77d2a390635bf5c2ae1ed56fb1", "text": "disguised restriction on trade in services.

Cambodia, India, and Sri Lanka include performance requirements (training requirements) horizontally. Subsidies and incentives exceptions were used by Bangladesh and Hong Kong (SAR, China), while Cambodia, China, Republic of Korea and Nepal introduced them in their horizontal commitments. Land ownership restrictions were scheduled at the horizontal level by many countries. However, limitations in land ownership do not mean limitations in land use. The sectoral schedules show the wide variety of policies used by developing countries in the region in order to achieve specific developmental objectives. 5.5 Most Favoured Nation exemptions The principle of MFN constitutes a general obligation by the member state to extend the most favourable treatment affecting trade in services accorded to any of its trading partner\u2019s to all the other members im- mediately and unconditionally. The provision laid down under Article II of GATS serves to ensure that it\u2019s not less favourable than what is accorded to other member states. The basic principle of the Agreement is that specific commitments are applied on an MFN basis. Measures inconsistent with the MFN obligation can be maintained subject to reviews after every five years in principle up to a period of 10 years at the entry into force of the GATS. Any subsequent exemption to MFN can only be granted under the waiver rules laid down in the WTO Agreement. MFN exemptions are also to be a subject matter of negotiations in the current and future rounds of trade negotiations. Preferential treatment to members of free trade agreements are however, permitted under Article V of GATS with some criteria such as having substantial sectoral coverage laid down, and it is not necessary for any country to list them out in their GATS schedule. Asian countries have only targeted a limited number of sectors and sub-sectors (audiovisual services, banking, construction and related engineering services, cultural and sporting services, maritime transport, telecommunication services, road transport and recreational services). Within these, audiovisual services, banking, maritime transport and telecom account for most of the MFN \u201csectoral\u201d exemptions. Considering the types of benefits that would accrue to members, in more than half of the records, countries are likely to ease MA requirements. The rest of the exemptions either provide for NT in terms of rates and fees applied to foreign telecom and maritime companies or NT in terms of subsidies and incentives for foreign companies working in audiovisual services under co-production arrangements. 22 This section provides a succinct analysis of the impact that GATS has on the flexibilities of countries to exercise policy space to enhance the qualitative and quantitative growth of their services sector in the larger macro- economic context. Countries that satisfy both the attributes listed below are a part of such analysis: \uf06c Services sector should be contributing in the range of 30 percent to 55 percent of GDP (this is to ensure that service-dominated economies such as Singapore, Hong Kong (SAR, China) and Jordan do not distort the picture). \uf06c The ratio of trade in services to GDP should not be higher than 25 percent.

For provision of mobile services, only four private operators are to be issued licenses in addi- tion to the government operator. Bangladesh has also reserved Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) satellite services for exclusive supply by the government operator. These commitments clearly show that Bangladesh has been conservative with respect to making com- mitments on the telecom sector. \uf06c Tourism and travel related services: Bangladesh has made commitments only with respect to estab- lishment of hotels in this sector. It requires that all foreign investors who set up hotels in the country incorporate their business in Bangladesh in accordance with local laws. Foreign equity to the extent of 100 percent is allowed in setting up of hotels. 6. Analysis of schedules of commitments: broad trends in use of policy space flexibilities 23 6.1.2 Autonomous liberalization and trends in FDI Telecommunications Bangladesh\u2019s telecommunications sector was monopolized by the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB), under the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, till 1989. In recent times, the government has significantly reduced its role in the telecommunications sector and removed restrictions on FDI therein. The Bangladesh Telecommunication Act 2001, as well as the Telecommunication Policy of 1998, seeks to encourage foreign investment in the telecom sector. Six private firms47, each of which includes foreign investors, are licensed to provide cellular phone services in Bangladesh. Other telecommunication services also no longer have government monopoly. The large unmet demand for telephone lines has resulted in this sector having a very large potential for expansion. Telecommunications services are expected to attract considerable investment from both large and small investors. In 2002, the telecom sector grabbed 23 percent of all FDI, while rest of the services shared 4 percent of the pie. However, expansion in the sector is still constrained by the ability of the BTTB to provide the necessary inter-connectivity. Financial services The Trade Policy Review (TPR) (2006) for Bangladesh notes that foreign banks are encouraged to take a role in the provision of banking services given the lack of funds for development in the country. They are allowed to conduct the same business as local banks. However, in order to operate a branch, foreign banks are required to obtain a license from the Bangladesh Bank (BB), the central bank of the country, which is given only if there is reciprocity between the foreign bank\u2019s home country and Bangladesh. Insurance business is also open to private investment since 1984. However, till 2006, the American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) was the only foreign insurance company operating in Bangladesh. Other sectors In air transport, since late 1996, the private sector has been allowed to compete with the state airline on all domestic passenger routes and on national and international cargo routes. Domestic routes are reserved for the national airlines. In 2005-06, about 18 foreign and two national airlines offered scheduled passenger services to and from Bangladesh, while non-scheduled cargo services were carried out by eight international and domestic operators. International air traffic from Bangladesh is growing at around six-seven percent a year. The state-owned airline \u2018Biman\u2019 and international airlines operate 75 and 100 weekly international flights, respectively. However, despite the move towards liberalization, six foreign airlines decided to cease their operations in Bangladesh. 6.1.3 Policy space and commitments under GATS Services accounting for 52.4 percent of Bangladeshi GDP (World Bank 2007) are critical in defining the growth path of its GDP. Wholesale and retail trade; transport, storage and communications, community, social and personal services; and real estate and business services continue to be the important service sectors in Ban- gladesh. The services sector employs about a third of the labour force (mainly in trade, hotel and restaurant services). 47 List of cellular mobile phone operators are available on the official website of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC). 24 The quantum and quality of commitments made by Bangladesh at the WTO in comparison to the autonomous commitments made by it in the same sectors and across various other sectors does not suggest that Bangladesh has abdicated its policy space, while liberalizing its services sector under GATS. Moreover, Bangladesh has also not made any offers as a part of the GATS (2000) negotiations.

During the year 2006, gross domestic investment as a percentage of GDP exceeded gross domestic savings as a percentage of GDP by approximately five percentage points. This shows that foreign investment is critical in complementing the gaps that are left uncovered by domestic savings into the investment space. Around one third of the total employment in Bangladesh is dependent on services (Muqtada 2003). In spite of efforts made in the area of manufacturing, employment opportunities in the manufacturing sector of Bangladesh have not risen. Moreover given the dependence of local manufacturing on exports, labour is increasingly being displaced by technology in Bangladesh to ensure export competitiveness. Services, which constitute a lion\u2019s share of economy, therefore need to grow at a pace that can absorb the growing literate Bangladeshi population to avoid brain drain. Shortage of investible capital in the services sector, therefore, has emerged as a concern. A strategic opening up to foreign investment inflows in areas that can create scale effects and trigger employment in downstream and upstream sectors is a possible policy option. As far as commitments under GATS are con- cerned, Bangladesh has shown a preference for retention of policy space and a tailoring of the schedules to its development context. There is a lack of services related trade data in Bangladesh and thus a proper assessment of risks and benefits needs to be undertaken before liberalizing other individual sub sectors in Bangladesh. 6.2 Cambodia 6.2.1 Comments on Mode 3 commitments Cambodia has scheduled commitments for eleven sectors. \uf06c Accounting, consulting and tax services: Cambodia provides MA and NT to foreign firms providing ac- counting, auditing and taxation services. \uf06c Legal services: According to the Cambodian Law on the Bar adopted in 1995, foreign lawyers cannot rep- resent clients, conduct activities to attract clients or publish commercial advertisements. However, they are permitted to work in commercial association with Cambodian lawyers. The commercial association requirement does not apply when legal services are provided in the area of foreign and international law. \uf06c Architectural and engineering services: Cross-border supply for architectural services is not restricted and NT is granted. Foreign citizens can provide engineering and integrated engineering services. \uf06c Telecommunications services: For the most part, access to Cambodia\u2019s telecommunications services market is not restricted. Private participation in mobile services, e-mail, electronic data interchange and code and protocol conversion is allowed and NT is accorded. In addition, Cambodia is committed to permitting licensed suppliers of mobile communications services to choose which technology to use for such services. Cross-border supply for voice telephone services, circuit-switched data transmission and private leased circuit services are allowed only over circuits leased from Telecom Cambodia, a public sector entity. This restriction will be eliminated by January 2009, and foreign participation of up to 49 percent equity will be allowed. Cambodia is making preparations to create an independent regulatory body. 25 \uf06c Audiovisual services: Cambodia does not prohibit foreign firms from distributing foreign films and vid- eotapes. \uf06c Distribution services: No limitation on MA or NT is imposed on foreign firms wishing to engage in distri- bution services; i.e., wholesale trade and retailing services. Like other business activities, foreign firms are required to register with the Ministry of Commerce to obtain a business license. \uf06c Educational services: Foreign participation in educational services is not restricted. \uf06c Insurance services: Licensed insurance companies including foreign companies can provide all types of insurance products. Cambodia\u2019s insurance sector is governed by the Law on Insurance of 2000. \uf06c Banking services: Cambodia allows foreign firms to operate as either 100 percent owned subsidiaries or as branches. The 1999 Law on Banking and Financial Institutions and subsequent regulations guarantee foreign banks rights and obligations equal to local banks. The law imposes no restrictions on foreign ownership of banks. \uf06c Health-related services: Cambodia permits cross-border investment in hospital services. For commercial presence, foreign ownership and management of private hospitals and clinics is permitted as long as at least one director, for technical matters, is Cambodian. Foreign firms are allowed to provide dental services through joint ventures with Cambodian legal entities. \uf06c Tourism and travel related services: Cambodia does not restrict foreigners\u2019 participation in this sector. Foreign companies may establish a commercial presence to operate hotels, restaurants, travel agencies and tour operator services, provided they register with the Ministry of Commerce for business licenses. Except for a few strategic sectors (transport and telecommunications), Cambodia has eliminated re- strictions for MA.

The Cambodian government actively solicits foreign private investment to boost its economic devel- opment. At the autonomous liberalization level, Cambodia\u2019s 1994 Investment Law, amended in 2003, accords NT to all foreign investors. However, the Cambodian Constitution restricts foreign ownership of land. Foreign investors may use land through concessions, unlimited long-term land leases and renewable limited short- term leases. 48 Visit http://phnompenh.usembassy.gov/uploads/images/nccimQfzXrVvgejbz8lziw/Nat_Trade_Est.pdf, accessed 25 September 2007. 26 6.2.3 Policy space and commitments under GATS According to the World Bank, services contributed around 39.1 percent to the GDP of Cambodia during 2005. Important components of the services sector in Cambodia are trade, transport, communications, tourism, real estate and business services. Cambodian economy is gradually diversifying and, like Bangladesh, Cambodia is also seen to be lack- ing domestic capital and technical expertise that can help it to diversify rapidly and efficiently in services sectors. Tourism is the key service sector of Cambodia contributing for more than two-thirds of its services sector revenue. Cambodian administration has taken active steps to liberalize commercial presence of foreign entities in its tourism sector by not only making commitments at an autonomous level but also under GATS. It is important to note that Cambodia and Nepal were amongst the first LDCs to join the WTO since its creation in 1995.49 The accession process spanning nine years was not informed by any comprehensive re- search or public debate on the costs and benefits of joining the WTO. There was ignorance, at large, amongst the civil society and the country\u2019s parliamentarians about the substance of negotiations.50 Analysts have noted that in the process of accession, Cambodia was pressurized by WTO members to make concessions that are far deeper than the levels of commitments made by LDCs which are already members of the WTO.51 The idea, perhaps, was to create an ambitious template for future members seeking to accede to the WTO. The GATS commitments as discussed previously are in line with the ambitious MA commitments un- dertaken by the country. Cambodia has made deep MA commitments under GATS and aligned its domestic legislations to comply with its GATS commitments. Cambodia has not made any offers as part of the GATS (2000) negotiations. While a deeper analysis of the human development implications is beyond the scope of this paper, it can be said that the nature of commitments in the schedules even in critical sectors providing public goods like health and education, indicate that the country has had to surrender its policy space to meet the WTO accession requirements. 6.3 Peoples\u2019 Republic of China 6.3.1 Comments on Mode 3 commitments China has made heterogeneous and specific commitments in nine sectors (business services; communication services; construction and related engineering services; distribution services; educational services; environ- mental services; financial services; tourism and travel related services; and transport services) which are dif- ficult to summarize, as in the case of other countries. In its horizontal commitments schedule, MA limitations with regard to commercial presence include minimum equity requirements on MA for foreign equity held in a joint venture (at least 25 percent of the reg- istered capital of the joint venture).

The limitations in forms of establishment applied both horizontally and vertically imply a preference for greenfield investment over acquisition of existing Chinese companies. This also demonstrates a marked preference for JVs, allowing control, but with Chinese interests involved. In its MFN exemptions, China lists maritime transport (international transport, freight and passengers); the parties concerned may, through bilateral agreements, establish entities to engage in business in China, \u201csubject to Chinese laws on joint ventures and on foreign-capital enterprises for ships owned or operated by carriers of the parties to the agreement\u201d. In addition, China has listed cargo-sharing agreements with Algeria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Thailand, US and Zaire. 6.3.2 Autonomous liberalization and trends in FDI In China, services are characterized by state involvement through state owned enterprises and restrictions on involvement of the private sector. There is gradual liberalization in the Chinese services sector with certain ser- vices activities, particularly wholesale and retail, catering, real estate, storage and transport, having a sizeable private sector presence. However, equity restrictions or prohibitions still operate for most of the services. China\u2019s TPR of 2006, has noted that, \u201cin liberalizing services, China has tended to follow closely its commitments under the GATS rather than liberalize autonomously, although its GATS commitments tend, in general, to be more extensive than those of other developing countries.\u201d Telecommunication services Before China\u2019s accession to the WTO, the Chinese telecommunication market was closed to foreign inves- tors. At present, foreign investment in the sector is regulated by the \u201cProvisions on Administration of Foreign Invested Telecommunications Enterprises\u201d (promulgated by Decree No. 333 of the State Council on 11 Decem- ber 2001 and effective as of 1 January 2002). These provisions brought foreign equity limits in conformity with China\u2019s GATS commitments. Foreign equity up to 49 percent for basic telecom services and up to 50 percent for value-added telecom services was allowed. Further, the largest Chinese and foreign investor in a foreign invested enterprise (FIE) was allowed to hold up to 30 percent equity of the enterprise. For an FIE to obtain a telecom services license, the Chinese partner must submit a proposal to the appropriate authority, along with the project proposal, a feasibility study report and the relevant documents certifying the compliance of the foreign and Chinese investors with the provisions and other conditions in the Regulations on Telecom- munications. Under China\u2019s GATS commitments, there are foreign equity restrictions (25 percent for fixed line and 49 percent for mobile services), and for some services, geographic restrictions. However, in practice, foreign in- vestment in fixed line and mobile services falls below these limits. In value-added services foreign investments are encouraging with around 80 percent of enterprises having domestic non-public or foreign ownership. 28 Financial services Restrictions on the operations of foreign banks have declined gradually. Foreign banks came to China in the early 1980s, but were allowed to do so only through representative offices. Since then, reforms have gradually opened up the sector and foreign banks are permitted to establish branches in China. However, this is still subject to restrictions which can be geographic, product or client specific in character. After its accession to the WTO, China has committed to permit foreign investment in the banking sector without geographic or client restrictions by the end of 2006. The \u201cRegulations on Administration of Foreign Financial Institutions and its Implementing Rules\u201d deter- mine the rules under which foreign and foreign-funded banks may operate in China, while the \u201cAdministrative Rules Governing the Equity Investment in Chinese Financial Institutions by Overseas Financial Institutions\u201d regulate equity investment by foreign financial institutions. These rules place a series of restrictions in the way in which foreign financial institutions operate in China. Foreign equity in the financial services sector is restricted and follows China\u2019s GATS commitments, which commit to a gradual opening up of the sector to foreign competition.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b99d9668-83a5-493a-9dac-00f82d805d61": {"__data__": {"id_": "b99d9668-83a5-493a-9dac-00f82d805d61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "acda751fc4ef63227cef479b293f6f4996c5939c5123b899ae607d5adea120b8"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3e7e3cf-f1c8-40f0-bd5c-4c9457f042c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef56cc7844ed9bb11af86500dc921f2c95705cd8ae62e5ba3b6166365de900c5"}}, "hash": "624539026b148c1bcf3dc7bd638a7ba863794c3194cc0b7841f72b5f89154951", "text": "Equity held by a single overseas financial institution in a Chinese financial institution is not allowed to exceed 20 percent.

Among them, 133 were permitted to conduct business in the local currency, 15 were allowed to operate on-line banking, 41 were allowed to deal in derivatives and five were permitted to conduct trust business under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme. By the end of 2004, 18 Chinese cities were open to foreign banks to provide local currency services, and two of these cities opened up to foreign banking one year ahead of schedule. Local currency business was opened to foreign banks in two other cities in December 2005. In an attempt to encourage investment in the less prosperous parts of the country, the review and approval procedures for foreign bank branch applications in China\u2019s Western and North-Eastern areas were relaxed for conducting local currency business. Under these relaxed requirements, instead of assessing the profitability of each individual branch when considering the application, the regulatory authority would con- sider the profitability of all Chinese branches of the foreign bank. A \u201cgreen passage\u201d has thus been established for foreign banks wishing to provide services in Western and North-Eastern regions. China\u2019s TPR of 2006, notes that the government has concentrated efforts on improving governance and raising supervisory standards to international levels as well as increasing transparency and competition in the sector, with increase in foreign presence being one way of achieving these goals. The Bank of America currently holds nine percent shares of China Construction Bank (CCB), while Asia Financial Holdings Private Limited, a company belonging to the Singapore government\u2019s holding company, Temasek, holds 5.1 percent of CCB shares. This is indicative of China\u2019s willingness to allow foreign investments in its financial services sector. In the insurance sector, out of a total of 80 providers, there are 37 foreign providers, most of which are branches, and few are joint ventures. The foreign insurance providers were subject to geographic restrictions until the end of 2004, and they are not allowed to write compulsory insurance, like motor third party liability. In 2004, foreign non-life insurance companies accounted for little more than one percent of non-life insurance 29 premiums in China, while foreign life insurance companies had little more than two percent share of the life insurance market. Foreign insurance companies are permitted to enter the market as 100 percent foreign-owned subsid- iaries for non-life insurance and up to 50 percent foreign-owned for life insurance. With regard to MA through commercial presence, foreign non-life insurers were initially to be permit- ted to establish branches and joint ventures with maximum of 51 percent foreign ownership. However, within two years from China\u2019s accession to the WTO (December 2003), foreign non-life insurance providers were to be permitted to establish themselves as wholly owned subsidiaries, and the TPR for China indicates that this took place on schedule. Foreign life insurers are permitted to establish through joint ventures, but their ownership is restricted to 50 percent of total equity. In addition, the \u201cRules on Administration of Insurance Companies\u201d restricts a single foreign shareholding to 20 percent and all foreign shareholding in such joint ventures to 25 percent. Transport services In January 2005, there were 28 independent civil airlines in China, all considered to be national carriers. Of the 28 carriers, 18 were state-owned or partially state-owned, and eight have foreign equity participation. Regulations stipulate that foreign equity in a domestic airline must not exceed 49 percent. According to the \u201cProvisions on Foreign Investment in Civil Aviation\u201d, foreign investors may not exclusively own and operate airports and airport services and a Chinese national must have majority control. For foreign investments in maritime transportation, general regulations are contained in Maritime Transportation Regulations, and detailed regulations are provided in the \u201cAdministrative Rules on Foreign Investment in the International Maritime Transportation Industry\u201d, which became effective on June 1, 2004. Joint ventures with FDI are allowed to engage in international shipping services, international shipping agency services, international ship management services, loading and unloading of international shipments and international maritime container freight station and container yard services; joint ventures and wholly foreign-owned enterprises may offer routing services for their own or operated vessels and international maritime cargo warehousing services. Requirements, application documents and procedures are in general similar to those for domestic enterprises.

In 2005, there were over 200 FIEs involved in port services in China. 6.3.3 Policy space and commitments under GATS Services contributed to 41.1 percent of China\u2019s GDP in 2006 (World Bank 2007). Major service activities include wholesale and retail trade and catering services, finance, insurance and social services. 30 Historically, the services market in China has been heavily regulated with significant restrictions on access to foreign services\u2019 providers. In general terms, the Chinese WTO commitments represent the \u2018most radical services program ever in the WTO history as well as in liberalization history\u2019 (Xuan 2003). It has been argued that the wide range of commitments agreed to by China under GATS cannot simply be equated with an unfounded and risky enterprise leading to a rather dramatic loss of policy space. Rather there existed an endogenous Chinese reform logic of providing political cover for the Chinese government to resist well organized protectionist, but inefficient Chinese state owned enterprises which were opposed to attempts at economic reform (Xuan 2003). It is beyond the scope of this paper to analyze the balance of considerations of whether or not China agreed to take on these commitments on account of endogenous logic or accession related pressures. China has submitted revised offers as part of the ongoing GATS (2000) negotiations, but the same is not yet de-restricted and has hence not been referred to in this analysis. As discussed in the section on autonomous liberalization and as seen from the TPR for China, the pace and quality of autonomous liberalization on Mode 3 issues in the realm of services has been defined by the commitments made by China during its accession to the WTO. This phenomenon needs to be analyzed in the context of the growing aspiration of China to make services the fulcrum of GDP growth. The growing ecological hazards in China resulting from two plus de- cades of manufacturing led growth are now making China focus on the services led growth model. Chinese authorities seem to have utilized GATS as a platform to implement the first round of services sector reforms at the domestic level without sacrificing their capacity to regulate the unfolding liberalization. This is sup- ported by China\u2019s commitments in the educational services sector. As noted in China Daily, \u201cAlthough China has promised foreign education institutions access to its educational service market via a \u201ccommercial pres- ence\u201d and \u201cmajority ownership,\u201d this does not necessarily mean foreign educational institutions can violate China\u2019s existing non-profit principle for the educational industry. China only promises \u201cMA\u201d and a guarantee of \u201cmanagement rights.\u201d Foreign educational institutions launching non-profit schools and other educational institutions in China may enjoy tax concessions or make moderate profits by organizing lawful activities; the profits, however, must be used to further their educational services in China and cannot be used as economic returns or distributed as bonuses to the administrative and teaching staff\u201d.52 6.4 India 6.4.1 Comments on Mode 3 commitments India has scheduled commitments in six services sectors (business, communication, construction, financial services, health services and tourism). \uf06c Business services; construction and related engineering services; health and related social services; tour- ism; and travel related services: Foreign investments are allowed through incorporation with a foreign equity ceiling of 51 percent. \uf06c Communication services: Commitment in telecommunication services, subject to licensing require- ments and with a foreign-equity ceiling of 25 percent.

India shows a typical case of selective liberalization.

In finance and telecommunications, India\u2019s schedule provides a great deal of room for selected policies, allowing some foreign competition, but without jeopardizing the future development of the local industry. 6.4.2 Autonomous liberalization and trends in FDI Business services Engineering services are a significant input in various activities that are open to foreign investment, but restrictions placed by India\u2019s GATS commitments for MA in this sub-sector continue. Commercial presence is allowed through incorporation, with a foreign equity ceiling of 51 percent. India did not make any GATS commitments with respect to legal services and foreign investment is still not allowed in this sector. Financial services Financial services, particularly banking and insurance continue to have a significant presence in state-owned companies, but competition is being encouraged in this sector. Restrictions on foreign banks have been relaxed. In 2006-07, of the 89 scheduled commercial banks, 29 were foreign banks.53 All commercial banks, including foreign banks, are still required to allocate a certain percentage of net lending (40 percent for domestic banks and 32 percent for foreign banks) to priority sectors (including agriculture and small-scale industries).54 Structural reforms have continued to increase the competitiveness of the banking sector and reduce risks. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India\u2019s central Bank, has been introducing prudential requirements to align the banking sector with international practices. Banks were required to implement the Basel II capital adequacy framework by March 2007. However, this requirement has been postponed to March 31, 2008 for foreign banks operating in India. In February 2005, the RBI formulated the \u201cRoadmap for Presence of Foreign Banks in India\u201d and the \u201cGuidelines on Ownership and Governance in Private Banks\u201d. Measures have also been adopted to gradu- ally lift restrictions on foreign banks, while certain limits on foreign competition will remain until 2009. For example, although in 2003-04 the aggregate foreign investment limit was increased from 49 percent to 74 percent in domestic private banks identified by the RBI for restructuring, the RBI has not laid down any criteria for identifying weak private-sector banks in need of restructuring, nor has it identified any bank for restructur- ing. In addition, the 49 percent limit remains for other private-sector banks until 2009. 53 Visit http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Publications/PDFs/80008.pdf, accessed 24 November 2007. 54 Visit http://rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_ViewMasterCirculars.aspx?Id=3648&Mode=0, accessed 24 November 2007. 32 Furthermore, under India\u2019s GATS commitments, foreign banks were allowed to access the Indian mar- ket only through branches (i.e. wholly owned subsidiaries or joint ventures were not allowed). Restrictions were also imposed on the number of banking licences (12 per year for new entrants as well as existing banks), and on the value of the banking system\u2019s assets in the hands of foreign banks (15 percent of total assets). The Roadmap issued by the RBI in February 2005, divided foreign participation in the banking sector into two phases. In the first phase, foreign banks were allowed to establish wholly owned subsidiaries, in addition to branches. At present all 29 foreign banks in India are branches. So far, no foreign bank has set up a wholly owned subsidiary in India. In the second phase, to commence in April 2009, foreign banks may be permitted to enter into M&As with any private bank in India, subject to the overall investment limit of 74 percent. The insurance industry in India is still dominated by state owned enterprises. Competition in the indus- try is constrained by the relatively high entry barriers. Foreign investment is restricted to 26 percent of total investment, though it is believed that the government is considering raising this limit to 49 percent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c7d75cc-74a0-4782-b2eb-f54167462819": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c7d75cc-74a0-4782-b2eb-f54167462819", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "327e2204b2c681a013082cb0006fa3acb5f0f63a0284da05e87f5b63de3206fb"}, "2": {"node_id": "32caa6bb-7f4c-4898-a970-9926ae41f7b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "322870dae1694db3a34d05910a44a6951c5ea0bedc7492969dcd1451e91938bb"}}, "hash": "236399d724f659c62462b55db449aa4759cfe9c9ab573aada888a7ee05533853", "text": "Telecommunication services Restrictions to foreign investment have been relaxed since 2000, with 100 percent foreign ownership allowed for internet service providers (ISPs) without gateways, infrastructure providers providing dark fibre and elec- tronic and voice mail services.

Construction and related engineering services The policy focusing on improving road connectivity across India has brought about significant investment in road development. Up to 100 percent FDI has been permitted in the road sector since 1997. International competitive bidding is used for projects financed by international lending agencies and for larger projects for which sufficient numbers of domestic consultants or contractors are not available. Presently, there are 46 foreign contractors from 27 countries working on 85 different projects sanctioned by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). NT is provided to foreign investors, though for registration purposes, proof of resi- dence is needed. Transport services India had not made commitments at GATS under transport services, but has been slowly liberalizing this sector as well. Rail transport is reserved for the state and is a state-owned monopoly. However, private participation and foreign investment is permitted in many non-core areas and activities, including hospitality (tourism and catering) and construction and management of freight terminals and operations. Public private partnerships (PPPs) are being encouraged in infrastructure construction projects. Reform measures have also been adopted to increase the competitiveness of maritime transportation services.100 percent foreign investment is allowed in the shipping sector, including coastal shipping. In the ports sectors as well, foreign investment restrictions have been relaxed. There is no approval requirement for up to 51percent foreign investment in projects providing supporting services to water trans- port. Automatic approval is granted for proposals with up to 100 percent foreign equity in construction and maintenance of ports and harbours; and the private sector is invited to participate in open tenders on a BOT basis. 33 In the air transport sector, although foreign investment by individuals has now been substantially liberalized with up to 49 percent foreign equity participation being permitted in the domestic sector and up to 100 percent in the case of non resident Indians, foreign airlines are not allowed to invest in the domestic sector. This constitutes a barrier both to foreign investment and the technology transfer that it can bring. Health services India allows 100 percent ownership for FDI, subject to approval by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board for investment in the Indian healthcare market by international investors. Indian private-sector operators have been setting up hospitals as joint ventures in collaboration with foreign investors (e.g. from Singapore and Malaysia). So far, India has not undertaken any GATS commitments in medical and dental services. 6.4.3 Policy space and commitments under GATS Services contributed 54.7 percent to India\u2019s GDP in 2006 (World Bank 2007). The growth and employment trajectory of India is being defined by services for more than half a decade. Services have put India on the global map of international investment flows and trade. It is therefore not surprising to see India taking mea- sures to infuse confidence within the international community about its readiness to engage on international platforms to create more predictability and stability about its services liberalization programme. India is therefore one of the few developing Asian countries which has made revised offers as a part of the ongoing GATS (2000) negotiations. In the Doha Round, India has submitted both initial and revised offers. In its revised offer, India has included commitments in a number of new sectors or sub-sectors, and improvements to existing commitments in a number of sectors. However, India has received several plurilat- eral requests from groups wherein India is expected to improve upon its Mode 3 commitments on a sector by sector basis and ensure that horizontal limitations in MA and NT do not undermine the Mode 3 commitments. (Das 2006). New commitments in the revised offer include, inter alia, air transport services; architectural, integrated engineering, and urban planning and landscape services; construction and related engineering services; dis- tribution services; educational services; environmental services; life insurance services and services auxiliary to insurance; recreational, cultural and sporting services; tourism services; and veterinary services. Improve- ments to existing commitments include asset management and other non-banking financial services, banking services, computer and related services, construction and related engineering services, engineering services, research and development services and basic telecommunications and value-added telecommunications services. It is evident that India has moved beyond its GATS commitments in some sectors by increasing the amount of foreign investment allowed, for example in banking and health services. However, in some other sectors like engineering services it has not made any changes. With respect to legal services, foreign invest- ment is still not allowed.

While India is scheduling commitments under the GATS (2000) negotia- tions, it is also taking efforts to create regulatory institutions that can effectively regulate the outcomes of such scheduling in the future. 34 A common condition for foreign investment in most of the sectors scheduled by India is incorporation of the company in India and a limit on foreign equity investment. The requirement of local incorporation ensures that in the case of violation of legal provisions, the representatives of the locally incorporated office can be made accountable. Limits on foreign investment ensure greater partnerships between Indian and foreign investors, and facilitate transfer of business know-how. \u2018Commitments on enhanced levels of foreign equity participation\u2019 under Mode 3, have raised concerns including about commercialization of social services such as higher education and health facilities. Also, the ability of developing countries to regulate foreign service providers may be impacted since under GATS a similar regulatory treatment would have to be extended to foreign service providers as applied to domestic ones.55 6.5 Indonesia 6.5.1 Comments on Mode 3 commitments Indonesia has submitted GATS commitments under six service sectors (business, telecommunications, con- struction, finance, maritime transport and tourism). As a horizontal restriction, Indonesia has committed to grant MA to foreign investors only through representative offices and JVs with a foreign-equity ceiling of 49 percent. It has also scheduled NT restrictions in land ownership, professional qualification requirements and taxation. The criteria, scope and procedures of the qualification requirements have not been included. \uf06c On all its service sectors, Indonesia has placed more restrictive foreign-equity ceilings than the 49 per- cent of the horizontal commitments (when local incorporation is allowed), except for tourism, where full ownership is granted, based on geographic limitations. \uf06c Communication services: Indonesia also limited foreign equity participation in all sub-sectors to 35 percent. The number of telecommunications suppliers is limited (Indonesia reserved many sub-sectors in telecommunications for PT Telkom, PT Indosat and PT Satelindo) sometimes under public monopoly, by a licensing system. \uf06c Transport services: MA has been granted only for representative offices in maritime transport, and under temporary unions of companies or joint operation in business services. \uf06c Financial services: Full foreign ownership is allowed in the non-banking financial sector, if the existing company is listed on the stock exchange, while granting access to other forms of establishment. In bank- ing, foreign banks are allowed to establish one branch in the country. \uf06c In MFN exemptions, Indonesia has provided for preferential short-listing for construction companies from the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries for government-funded projects. In banking, licences are to be granted only to JV banks under reciprocity basis. Standards and qualification requirements, applied not only to the foreign investor, but to the Indone- sian party, ensures the capacity needed for effective technology transfer, and where the capacity is lacking, as in the non-banking financial sector, employment and training requirements would tend to enhance it. Conditions imposed in the tourism sector also seem to complement and enhance the local supply of services in disadvantaged regions. 55 Visit http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2227/stories/20060113002104400.htm, accessed 28 November 2007. 35 6.5.2 Autonomous liberalization and trends in FDI Financial services With respect to the GATS, Indonesia bound its multilateral obligations at less than status quo in the financial sector. It is believed that this reflects the Indonesian government\u2019s dual objectives of trying to encourage foreign investment in the financial sector while providing national suppliers the time to develop necessary market infrastructure and institutional capabilities in order to create a well-functioning national market in line with the principle of progressive liberalization. Foreign interest in the sector has been strong, and by the end of 2005, foreign investors owned an estimated 40 percent of Indonesia\u2019s banking sector assets.

Telecommunication services Foreign investments are welcomed in the Indonesian value-added telecom market. Indonesia has been un- dertaking significant reform of its telecom policy. Over the past decade, a set of first generation reforms has resulted in increasing private sector and foreign participation. The provisions of Indonesia\u2019s Telecommunications Law have guided reforms to end monopolies and open basic telecommunications services to majority foreign ownership. It lifted Telkom\u2019s and Indosat\u2019s respec- tive monopolies on domestic and international services in 2002 as a first step towards introduction of full competition by the end of 2006, a target which has been moved forward from 2010. The law lays out goals that exceed many of the commitments Indonesia agreed to under the WTO Basic Telecommunications Agreement (for example, maximum foreign investment limit of 35 percent for tele- communications services companies).The law also removed previous requirements that prospective foreign investors have to partner or enter into a revenue-sharing arrangement with a state-owned enterprise. Transport services Government Regulation No. 20 (1994) allowed up to 95 percent foreign investment in shipping ventures. This is far above the 49 percent limit on foreign equity prescribed in Indonesia\u2019s horizontal commitments under GATS. Other services Foreign law firms seeking to enter the market are required to establish a joint venture with a local firm and in order to practice, all lawyers have to hold Indonesian citizenship and a degree from an Indonesian legal facility. Foreign investments in the retail and wholesale sectors are permitted, but on the condition that the investor enters into a partnership agreement with a small-scale Indonesian enterprise. There is also a ban on all foreign investment in the broadcast and media industry. 36 Foreign construction firms can form joint ventures with local partners in areas where the government considers that a local firm is unable to do the work. 6.5.3 Policy space and commitments under GATS Services contributed 46.3 percent to Indonesia\u2019s GDP in 2006 (World Bank 2007). Wholesale and retail trade dominates the Indonesian services sector, followed by transport, storage and communication, real estate and business services and financial services. Indonesia submitted its conditional initial offer in the WTO services negotiations in April 2005. The offer does not significantly change Indonesia\u2019s existing GATS commitments, which cover about one third of all services sub-sectors and come with significant limitations on MA, such as joint venture requirements and for- eign equity caps. In the offer, Indonesia has proposed commitments in a number of professional and business services; telecommunications; construction and engineering services; educational services; financial services; health services; tourism; and maritime cargo handling. Together with other ASEAN members, Indonesia is seeking progress in the negotiation of Emergency Safeguard Measures (ESM) under Article X of the GATS. Indonesia did not submit a revised offer. It has also refrained from scheduling its largest services sector, viz. wholesale and retail trade sector even in its conditional initial offers made under GATS (2000) negotia- tions. Indonesia\u2019s earlier experience of banking sector liberalization during the 1990\u2019s, considered as the trig- ger of the protracted financial crisis in 1997, underlines the need for putting in place appropriate safety nets and other regulatory and institutional frameworks while making its offers (Warouw 2006, 97-111). In line with its cautious approach, Indonesia has made initial offers conditionally on the outcome of negotiations on ESM (Warouw 2006). Indonesia has taken the lead in suggesting a possible framework to govern the application of ESM for trade in services.56 6.6 Republic of Korea 6.6.1 Comments on Mode 3 commitments The Republic of Korea has committed to eight services under GATS (business, communication, construction and related engineering services, distribution, environmental, financial, tourism and transport). \uf06c Business services: In accounting and taxation services, sole proprietorships or incorporated partnerships licensed by the appropriate authority are permitted. \uf06c Communication services: For telecommunication services, a service supplier is required to be a licensed Korean juridical person. Also, it is stated that largest shareholder of Korea Telecom (KT) must be the government and aggregate foreign shareholding must not be more than 20 percent till December 31, 2000, and no more than 33 percent beyond that date. Republic of Korea is committed to allowing 100 percent foreign shareholding in many telecommunication sub-sectors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3129ddf5-de80-47fd-89eb-cd9158bc33f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "3129ddf5-de80-47fd-89eb-cd9158bc33f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8f28bba994f79907256cb257d3d563fb9f3a8a8035301eec7210a8e05ea9c79"}, "2": {"node_id": "81948696-b69f-445f-a665-58c2cc421c68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a45b1341151f0663de4de663d10a75f0818445193a723e73cffdd001a75780cd"}}, "hash": "aba7631b589f9bf8d77667e7c83e54b707cc93448b6da46d665c8b9e8d6e498b", "text": "\uf06c Construction services: The Republic of Korea is committed to permitting joint ventures with local com- panies and allowing the establishment of branches in a phased manner. 56 Visit http://www.ictsd.org/issarea/stsd/Resources/Docs/ASEAN_ESM.pdf,accessed 25 November 2007. 37 \uf06c Distribution services: The Republic of Korea subjected provision of certain distribution services (like wholesale trade centres, wholesale markets with floor space of more than 3000 square meters, etc.) by foreign investors to ENT.

In the provision of maritime transport for passenger and freight, there were no restrictions except that the Republic of Korea unbound itself from establishment of registered company for the purpose of operating a fleet under the national flag of the Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea bound itself to open up the domestic market to foreign companies creating new businesses. However, this seems only completely true for business and tourism services, while a wide and tailored range of limitations exists for other sectors, shaping the way in which new competitors will affect the market, such as in construction and environmental services. In strategic sectors, such as transport, finance and telecom, other, more stringent, limitations were put in place. Though there is a marked preference for NT limitations to be scheduled horizontally in Asia, the Repub- lic of Korea makes more use of their potential in order to ensure that, on the one hand, there will be enough space to design development policies coherent with the Republic of Korea\u2019s international commitments and on the other, that the quality and involvement of the newcomer will positively affect industrial enhance- ment. 6.6.2 Autonomous liberalization and trends in FDI Financial services The financial sector of the Republic of Korea has been considerably restructured. This is especially true for banking where policy reforms have focused since the Asian financial crisis. The entry, including location or type of services offered, of foreign bank branches in the Republic of Korea is unrestricted. The licensing requirements for foreign subsidiaries are the same as for domestic banks, and are in fact less stringent for foreign branches. With regard to foreign investment, full foreign equity is allowed in banks, subject to special permission. Foreign equity has risen, on average, from under 10 percent in 1998 to 30 percent in September 2003. A few banks in the Republic of Korea are majority foreign owned. There is no limit per se to the number of banking licenses, including foreign licenses, which can be issued if the prudential requirements for a licence are met. There is also no restriction on foreign ownership of non-bank institutions, including securities compa- nies and investment trust companies. Prudential regulations apply equally to domestic and foreign financial institutions, in accordance with internationally accepted standards. 38 In 2003, 39 foreign banks in the Republic of Korea operated 61 branches. Though entry of foreign bank subsidiaries in the Republic of Korea is unrestricted, none operated till 2003. However, market penetration of foreign banks has improved from representing 6.1 percent of assets in 2000 to 7.3 percent in 2003. The operation of foreign banks is still subject to certain other conditions like a separate licence must be obtained for each foreign branch, requirements relating to minimum operating funds and requirement of having expertise in the international banking business. Foreign insurers, including foreign branches, can obtain license to operate in the Republic of Korea. They are however, subject to the restriction of maintaining funds of at least Won 3 billion (I USD equals 1039 South Korean Won), if they want to do business with both Koreans and foreigners, or Won 500 million if mostly with foreigners, and Won 100 million if only with foreigners. At the end of 2003, of the 23 life insurance companies, three were foreign branches and five were foreign subsidiaries. There were 26 non-life insurers, of which 11 were foreign branches. Telecommunication services Telecommunications in the Republic of Korea has traditionally had a \u201crelatively high degree of government intervention and insufficient competition\u201d.57 The sector has been gradually deregulated and opened to com- petition, including from foreign providers, since the mid 1990\u2019s. All telecommunication markets are open to new entrants since 1998. The government no longer has any commercial interest in telecommunications after fully privatizing the dominant carrier, KT,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2d3b74d-84d2-453c-98e2-b8c1003da464": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2d3b74d-84d2-453c-98e2-b8c1003da464", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f154d5c7bbdfc8ba4e560972cc1e04ad68fc7d1e1ae9e8df2faeda5b242b542"}, "3": {"node_id": "7fefacc4-7d8f-4447-b1f7-3a41909e7159", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab44f03017af7bee87d53487499ac881e8805a2022b40f56755c93e31b024d38"}}, "hash": "765bdf0164a3e37c91e32f9bd71a1244bd7abcc37c275c05e6ea99c9625640ab", "text": "in May 2002, when it sold its remaining 28 percent equity. The ceiling on foreign ownership of KT was also raised from 33 percent to 49 percent, as for other facility based service providers. The individual ownership limit of 15 percent was removed in August 2002. No foreign ownership limits apply to special telecom service providers or to value-added telecom service providers. The Republic of Korea has unilaterally liberalized its foreign ownership regime beyond its WTO obligations, and its telecom- munications sector has industrialized at a remarkable pace, reflecting the rapid spread of high-tech services and greater competition. Transport services In maritime transport, licensing of foreign shipping branches in the Republic of Korea has been relaxed, and foreign ownership of Korean vessels is allowed. Foreigners can also participate in coastal transportation of goods and passengers between North and South Korea as a minority (less than 50 percent) joint venture with a South Korean shipping company. 6.6.3 Policy space and commitments under GATS Services contributed 57.2 percent to the Republic of Korea\u2019s GDP in 2006 (World Bank 2007). The Korean eco- nomic structure is transforming with the emergence of a strong services sector. Hi-tech services account for a lion\u2019s share in the Korean services sector given the value they unlock on being supplied. Given the decline of employment and growth in its manufacturing sector, the Korean government is focusing on boosting the competitiveness of its services sector \u201cto foster high-end services including finance, logistics, design and consulting. This will create quality jobs as well as making direct contribution to enhancing manufacturing competitiveness. In particular, upgrading and fostering education, culture, tourism and leisure services are called for from multi-faceted aspects\u201d.58 57 \u201cTrade Policy Review of Republic of Korea\u201d, WT/TPR/S/137, dated 15 and 17 September 2004, available at www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/ tpr_e/s137-4_e.doc 58 Ministry of Finance and Economy and Economic Information and Education Center, Korea Development Institute (2006). 39 The Republic of Korea submitted revised offers as a part of the ongoing GATS (2000) negotiations. This revised conditional offer covers improvement of MA or enhancement of transparency through clarifica- tion of the initial offer in horizontal commitments and services sectors in business services (legal services, veterinary services, services incidental to manufacturing), telecommunication services, distribution services, educational services, financial services and transport services. It improves upon the Republic of Korea\u2019s GATS commitments by placing fewer restrictions on foreign investors. The Republic of Korea has liberalized its financial and telecommunications sector significantly. Its revised offer indicates that it intends to ease restrictions on foreign investment in other service areas as well. The degree of liberalization in the Republic of Korea\u2019s services sector is comparable to that of the industrial- ized countries (Jong 2000). The Republic of Korea has been a proponent of \u201cbenchmarking\u201d in the services negotiation along with EC, Japan and Switzerland, which as discussed in the introduction, sought to set quantitative and qualitative targets for liberalization, in order to force the pace of negotiations which was not accepted by the developing countries on the grounds that it was contrary to the intent and purpose of the GATS agreement. The EU is the Republic of Korea\u2019s second largest trading partner and is currently engaged in talks for a bilateral free trade agreement. This may perhaps help to explain the liberal nature of commitments undertaken by the Republic of Korea in GATS. 6.7 Kyrgyz Republic 6.7.1 Comments on Mode 3 commitments The Kyrgyz Republic has made significant GATS commitments in 11 service sectors, including telecommunica- tions and financial services, during WTO accession. However, it has not specified any horizontal commitments for service supply through Mode 3. \uf06c Business services: The Kyrgyz Republic has kept itself unbound in medical, veterinary services, services in the sphere of industrial property, real estate services and services incidental to fishing. In services incidental to energy distribution, there are no restrictions except for services on distribution of electric energy.

Foreign bank ownership is increasingly high at over 60 percent. 15 banks have foreign equity, of which 11 are majority overseas owned.

While no ENTs are applied in approving applications, applicants must submit a business plan that includes an assessment of the bank\u2019s economic feasibility and provides the strategy, directions and scope of its activities for the first three years of operation. Foreign banks can offer the same services as Kyrgyz-owned banks, and the number of branches or their location is unrestricted. In the insurance sector, the 49 percent limit on foreign equity in insurance companies has been re- moved in line with Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s GATS commitments where it committed to remove this MA limitation by early 2002. Telecommunications The telecommunications market has been liberalized in line with the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s WTO commitments. As per the Trade Policy Review, the Kyrgyz Republic has \u201cfull\u201d competition in all major telecommunication markets.59 The monopoly on international and long distance calls of the majority state owned national carrier, Kyrgyz telecom, was terminated from February 2003, in line with the country\u2019s GATS commitments. The Rus- sian company, Saima Telecom, and Winline provide competing fixed line services, such as local, long-distance and international calls and data transmission. There are several foreign-owned operators of cellular and pag- ing services, and the first foreign ISP was licensed in early 2003. There are no overseas ownership restrictions, and foreign and domestic operators enjoy the same rights, including access to the public network. While call back services are still prohibited, its anti-competitive impact has been diminished by the telecommunication sector\u2019s liberalization. Transport Transport services, other than road, are heavily regulated in the Kyrgyz Republic. Inter-city road transport is largely privatized. Five year licenses are given to operate inter-city and urban bus services and foreigners can apply for grant of such licences. No restrictions on foreign equity exist. Tourism According to Kyrgyz authorities, foreign investment in tourism has increased and is unrestricted. Foreigners can freely provide tourism services, and many of them do. A law was proposed restricting foreign ownership of tourist facilities to 49 percent, requiring the investment manager to be a Kyrgyz national and limiting the number foreigners in management to one-third, but it was not passed. 59 \u201cTrade Policy Review of Kyrgyz Republic\u201d, WT/TPR/S/170, dated 9 and 11 October 2006, available at www.wto.org/english/ tratop_e/tpr_e/s170-04_e.doc. 41 6.7.3 Policy space and commitments under GATS As a former centrally planned economy, the Kyrgyz Republic had practically no market for goods and services and the regulatory structure was underdeveloped. However, it did not receive the developing country status in the process of accession to the WTO despite the fact that it has a low GDP per capita with high poverty.60 In 2006, the services sector accounted for 46.9 percent of the GDP of Kyrgyz Republic (World Bank 2007). Among services, the largest sub-sectors in 2005 were wholesale and retail trade, transport and com- munications, education, construction and real estate. During 2005, while the gross domestic capital formation as a percentage of GDP was 14.4 percent, the gross domestic savings in Jordan as a percentage of GDP was - 4.7 percent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03bdb314-1c57-4e08-bdb0-19a910705d6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "03bdb314-1c57-4e08-bdb0-19a910705d6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06a787d9e745c234b13585b235182bda2e3eb505cb652ed76ad3af2e8f359929"}, "2": {"node_id": "ccf55b74-c5d1-48d4-9b78-2d78c0ebe7b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a7043c48be9c2fc5b129a91fa28cc0b0f12365a4745d5e967831079aae32688"}}, "hash": "f50365c4fbdf3bb50428927c01c2af82e6af3156570f421676ed3aab47850aac", "text": "This shows the dependency of the Kyrgyz Republic on international capital for financing the growth of its GDP and hence its services sector, a phenomenon similar to that faced by Jordan (World Bank 2006).

In 2005, the government opened up certain service sectors to foreign investment. Progress has been made in allowing private operations in some sectors that were previously government monopolies, such as telecommunica- tions and civil aviation. Licensing and regulations have been simplified, and 100 percent foreign ownership has been allowed. In order to comply with its WTO commitments, Nepal recently opened service industries and a few other sectors to foreign investment. These sectors include business and management consulting, accounting, engineering and legal services, travel and trekking services, tourist lodging, international retail sales services and production of alcohol or cigarettes. However, foreign investment is forbidden in the defence sector. 43 In these recently opened service sectors, permitted foreign investment limits range from 51 to 80 percent while the balance of the investment is reserved for Nepali nationals in order to form a joint venture with a foreign investor. Though foreigners are generally free to establish and own business enterprises, the form of participa- tion is restricted in some cases. For example, foreign banks have not yet been allowed to open wholly-owned subsidiaries or branch operations in Nepal. 6.8.3 Policy space and commitments under GATS Services contributed to around 40 percent of Nepal\u2019s GDP in 2006 (World Bank 2006). With its accession to the WTO and liberalization commitments submitted under GATS, the country seems ready to increase this share significantly. Though Nepal\u2019s schedule of commitments reveals plans to liberalize 11 services sectors, this should not be misunderstood to be an automatic shrinkage of its policy space. Adhikari (2005) believes that Nepal has been able to maintain its policy space through selective liberalization and by specifying conditions on MA and NT: \u201cA few cautious approaches taken by Nepal include: a) capping foreign investment in most sectors at 51 percent; while in some others at 66-67 percent and only in two sectors at 80 percent; b) the requirement that a majority of the board members of basic telecom providers be Nepali nationals; and in the case of financial in- stitutions, composition of the board be proportionate to the shareholding pattern; c) allowing foreign banks, with minimum \u2018B\u2019 rating by a credit rating agency to establish branches in Nepal for wholesale banking (not retail banking); d) incentives and subsidies be available only to enterprises wholly owned by Nepali nationals; e) not allowing foreigners to purchase or own land in Nepal; and f) movement of natural person be limited to intra-corporate transferee at the executive, manager or specialist levels with a provision that the number of such transferees shall not exceed 15 percent of the number of local employees in the firm\u201d. Nepal did not submit revised offers as a part of the ongoing GATS (2000) negotiations, and the govern- ment has been moving towards competition in most sectors of the economy in accordance with its GATS commitments. As a NAC to the WTO, as in the case of others, Nepal has agreed to far reaching commitments in the services sector which would have significant post-accession implications, given the importance of services for macroeconomic performance and national development (Sauve 2005). It has been argued that the schedule of commitments of Nepal unmistakably shows an investor-friendly orientation with only narrow limitations included to guide FDI into priority sectors and activities that are expected to have strong develop- mental effects. However, the limitation on entry through new businesses and conditions for the participation of Nepalese nationals and domestic businesses has been introduced to ensure that Nepalese citizens benefit from new technologies introduced by foreign investors (Sauve 2005). 6.9 Pakistan 6.9.1 Comments on Mode 3 commitments Pakistan has made commitments in six service sectors (business, communication, construction and related engineering, financial, health and tourism services). It has scheduled a horizontal limitation on MA by placing a foreign equity ceiling of 51 percent in all services sectors.

It appears that too much attention has been given to foreign control, instead of other types of industrial policy measures that would discriminate among investors and types of investment, unless these concerns have been included in the licensing criteria, of which we are not aware. 6.9.2 Autonomous liberalization and trends in FDI The Pakistani government, at an autonomous level, has been consistently reducing state involvement in the services sector to encourage private investment in several activities. The Pakistan government\u2019s investment policy is geared towards encouraging foreign investment in all sectors of the economy. Foreign investment in Pakistan is fully protected through the Foreign Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act 1976, Protection of Economic Reforms Act 1992 and Foreign Currency Ac- counts (Protection) Ordinance, 2001. The Foreign Investment Act of 1976, provides that foreign investment will not be subject to higher income tax levels. A series of government agencies, most recently the Board of Investment in 1994, have been created to provide a one-stop interface between investors and Pakistani authorities. Mandatory foreign investor registration with the Board of Investment has been eliminated. However, foreign investors are still required to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Pakistan\u2019s central bank. Previous requirement that foreign investors seek provincial government clear- ance for project location has also been removed. Reduction in FDI restrictions Restrictions on FDI in services have been progressively eased. Foreign investment at 100 percent equity on a repatriable basis is allowed in the services, infrastructure and social sectors. In June 2004, foreign investment in the services sector was further liberalized by removing the condition that a foreign investor has to accumulate 45 a minimum 40 percent Pakistani equity within five years of the initial investment. Now, the foreign investor can retain 100 percent equity for the lifetime of the investment. Minimum allowable equity investment in the non-financial services sector has been reduced from US$ 300,000 to US$ 150,000. Foreign investors are permitted to bid on the privatization of state-owned industries and financial institutions on terms equivalent to those offered to local investors. Communications services Full NT and legal protection has been provided to foreign investment in all but designated \u201csensitive\u201d sec- tors, which includes broadcasting. However, despite the exclusive rights of state entities in broadcasting and audiovisual, audiovisual services have been opened to joint ventures with foreign investors. There are no restrictions on FDI in telecommunication services and the liberalization process has been gaining ground since 2003. Private sector involvement in telecommunications has increased in activities other than the fixed line services. The government has identified telecom as a key sector for attracting overseas investment. Foreign investors in the telecom sector Egypt\u2019s Orascom which has investments in Mobilink, Nor- way\u2019s Telenor and the UAE-owned Warid Telecom were recently awarded GSM licences and two Luxembourg- based groups, Instafone and Paktel, are competing along with state-owned Ufone (Stewart 2004). The PTCL was privatized in 2006, paving the way for further competition in this sector. Financial services Through a change in the policies of the SBP, there are presently no restrictions on the number of branches a foreign bank can have. Like local banks, foreign banks are also required to submit an annual branch expansion plan to the SBP for approval. The SBP approves new branch openings based on the bank\u2019s net worth, adequacy of its capital structure, future earning prospects, credit discipline and the needs of the local population. Other services Investments in tourism, housing, construction and information technology sectors are being encouraged by granting \u201cindustry\u201d status to them. This implies that enterprises in these sectors are eligible for lower tax and utility rates than the commercial sector (which includes banks, insurance companies and other businesses). 6.9.3 Policy space and commitments under GATS Services contributed around 52.9 percent to the GDP of Pakistan in 2006 (World Bank 2007) with a high", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5437a1ea-ace6-4836-8511-de6daf4c78fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "5437a1ea-ace6-4836-8511-de6daf4c78fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba1cbc9b7835ad1569526a5893848128856e0ecb8c0f16bc740f8132103d1827"}}, "hash": "ba1cbc9b7835ad1569526a5893848128856e0ecb8c0f16bc740f8132103d1827", "text": "level of contribution coming from low end services. The services growth story in Pakistan is therefore volume driven rather than value driven. The unilateral liberalization process has involved relatively deeper commitments than at the GATS levels, and Pakistan has sought to preserve some policy space in its depth of commitments rather in coverage of sectors per se. In order to unlock value of its services, Pakistan requires foreign capital that can provide requisite technology and expertise. This could be one of the reasons for Pakistan adopting an ambitious autonomous liberalization regime in comparison to the commitments it has made under GATS. For example, Pakistan allows 100 percent foreign ownership at an autonomous level in all sectors in comparison to the horizontal ceiling of 51 percent foreign equity, introduced by it vis-\u00e0-vis its scheduled services under GATS. Given the far reaching liberalization commitments undertaken Pakistan has also been arguing for adequate ESM. 46 6.10 Philippines 6.10.1 Comments on Mode 3 commitments The Philippines submitted commitments in four service sectors (communication, transport, financial and tourism sector). It significantly expanded commitments on financial services and on basic telecommunica- tions. However, it did not accept the Fourth (basic telecommunications) or Fifth (financial services) Protocols of the GATS. As a horizontal restriction on MA, the Philippines require all executive and managing officers to be citizens of the Philippines. The country also limits participation of foreign investors in the governing body of any corporate entity to proportionate share of foreign capital in such entities. Limitations on acquiring land have also been specified. NT limitations relating to peso borrowing by foreign firms are also specified. \uf06c Communication services: Only those corporations where at least 60 percent capital is owned by Filipinos are permitted to obtain authorization for operation of a public utility in all communications services. Provision of telecommunication services requires other certificates as well, like Franchise from Congress of the Philippines, and Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from the National Telecommuni- cations Commission. \uf06c Financial services: In all sub-sectors of financial services, the appropriate regulatory authority in the Philippines decides whether public interest and economic conditions justify the establishment of com- mercial presence. In the banking sector, at least 70 percent of the banking assets in the country are required to be held by domestic banks with majority Filipino ownership. Limitations on the number of licenses and branches and their locations are also specified. Prior authorization is also required for a series of other banking activities. For many other financial services as well, foreign equity is limited to 40 percent. However, in life and general non-life insurance, foreign equity of 51 percent is allowed in voting stock of an existing local company or locally incorporated insurance company. Non-Filipino board members are restricted to one-third of the total strength of the board. \uf06c Tourism and travel related services: Foreign equity in tourism accommodation facilities is limited to 40 percent. However, there are no limits on foreign equity for a specialty restaurant which is not part of the facilities of a hotel. \uf06c Transport services: In transport services as well, those corporations where at least 60 percent capital is owned by Filipinos are permitted to obtain authorization for operation of a public utility in all transpor- tation services sectors. In passenger and freight transportation by road, the entry of new investors is subject to the ENT. The two factors considered for the purposes of the test are, first, the need to provide protection to investments of operators in un-served areas and second, the route measured capacity test for number of vehicles. 6.10.2 Autonomous liberalization and trends in FDI Financial services The Philippines requires that 70 percent of bank assets must be held by domestic banks. Foreign banks are thus allowed to hold only 30 percent of bank assets. However, in 2004, foreign banks and their branches accounted for barely 14 percent of the bank assets in the Philippines. 47 The Philippines government has followed a policy of \u201cbank rationalization\u201d in recent years to reduce the number of small banks and consolidate the banking sector. In the year 2000, it issued a three year moratorium against the establishment of new banks in the country. This moratorium was intended to encourage bank buy outs, and was extended in duration. The ceiling of 60 percent of foreign ownership in domestic banks was lifted till June 2007, to allow foreign investors to own 100 percent of a bank. This was made subject to authorization of the Monetary Board in the Philippines.

However, foreign banks continue to have a significant presence as reflected in the ownership of private domestic commercial and universal banks. In 2003, less than half of these banks were 100 percent Filipino owned, and of the top 20 banks, only seven remained fully Filipino owned. Share of foreign equity is generally moderate, with only four of the top 20 banks with more than 20 percent. The TPR (2005) of the Philippines notes that the banking system in the Philippines in 1999 was more liberal than its GATS commitments. Though the moratorium could have reduced competition in the banking sector, it is difficult to measure its impact. In the insurance sector, 17 out of 141 insurance companies had majority foreign investment and five were domestically incorporated branches. Foreign insurance companies are allowed to operate as branches, subsidiaries or joint ventures if they had figured in the list of top 200 foreign companies in the world for the past 10 years. No limits on foreign equity have been placed. Foreign branches provide mainly non-life insur- ance, while foreign-owned companies offer both life and non-life policies. The insurance industry was opened up to 100 percent foreign ownership in 1994. However, minimum capital requirements increase with the degree of foreign ownership. Although there are no foreign ownership restrictions regarding the acquisition of shares of mutual funds, current law restricts membership on boards of directors to Philippine citizens. Tourism The Philippines government recognizes tourism as a top foreign exchange earner and allows 100 percent foreign equity in accommodation facilities, travel agencies, tour operators and organization of professional conferences. Full foreign equity is allowed in restaurants and domestic market enterprises if minimum paid up capital exceeds US$2.5 million and US$200,000 respectively, otherwise it is limited to 40 percent. Tourist transport services are constitutionally limited to Filipinos, and some other businesses dealing with tourists classified as retail services may be subject to a 40 percent investment ceiling. For tourist projects valued at a minimum of US$ 5 million, foreigners are allowed to lease land for 50 years instead of the usual period of 25 years, renewable for another 25 years. These measures indicate some progress beyond GATS in the tourism sector for the Philippines. 6.10.3 Policy space and commitments under GATS The services sector contributed to 53.2 percent of the Philippines\u2019s GDP in 2006 (World Bank 2007) and is the leading employer in the nation. The leading services sectors in the Philippines are tourism, communication, construction and finance. While the Philippines has been taking giant strides with respect to liberalizing their tourism and insurance sector at an autonomous level, they have preferred to remain conservative while open- ing these sectors under GATS. Moreover, the Philippines has not submitted any revised offers in the ongoing 48 GATS (2000) negotiations. Like the other ASEAN countries, the Philippines too has been demanding move- ment in the development of an ESM for services which has not progressed, in order to protect themselves from an import surge in services. 6.11 Sri Lanka 6.11.1 Comments on Mode 3 commitments Sri Lanka scheduled commitments in only three services sectors (communication, financial and tourism services). Sri Lanka\u2019s specific commitments in the Uruguay Round covered only tourism. Subsequently, it participated in extended negotiations on basic telecommunications and financial services and accepted the GATS Fourth Protocol (basic telecommunications) and Fifth Protocol (financial services) on 27 November 1997 and 20 January 1999, respectively. While specifying horizontal commitments, Sri Lanka has notified a list of sectors where foreign invest- ments are not permitted (like pawn brokering, retail trade with a capital of less than US$ one million and businesses providing personal services other than for export of tourism). It also limited foreign equity up to 40 percent in a company proposing to carry out business activities relating to construction and residential buildings, mass transport, telecommunications, education, professional services, freight-forwarding, travel agencies and shipping agencies. \uf06c Communication: The monopoly on basic fixed wire telephony services (international) of the majority state-owned Sri Lanka Telecom was scheduled to last until at least 2000, when issuance of another licence would be conditional on satisfactory progress in tariff re-balancing. Sri Lanka also reserved the right to issue no new licences for mobile services until at least 2000 and to retain the duopoly on basic telephony services supplied by Wireless Local Loop (WLL) for five years (i.e. 2002). Foreign equity caps were scheduled, at 35 percent for Sri Lanka Telecom and 40 percent for other operators unless the Board of Investment (BOI) approved higher levels (up to 100 percent) on a case-by-case basis.

Moreover, the entry for direct insurance provides for new establishments to be subject to government licensing. The relevant criteria are not further specified in the schedule. Foreign equity participation throughout the financial service sector is limited to 49 percent, except for reinsurance and retrocession where Sri Lanka has not accepted any bindings on commercial presence. \uf06c Tourism: No restrictions specified apart from those applicable horizontally. 6.11.2 Autonomous liberalization and trends in FDI Financial services In 2002, out of 23 commercial banks in Sri Lanka, 12 were foreign banks. Foreign equity limits were raised from 49 percent to 60 percent in 2000, and eliminated in May 2002. There are no restrictions on foreign competition in banking, including from overseas branches, and foreign suppliers receive national treatment. However, a restriction which limits the scope of FDI even when 100 percent equity is allowed, is that foreign commercial banks are allowed to open branch offices in Sri Lanka subject to an ENT and approval by the Central Bank. Foreign investors are allowed to hold 100 percent equity in local banks subject to limits on individual share ownership. 49 Liberalization in the Sri Lankan financial services sector has extended to insurance as well. The state no longer has any commercial role in insurance. Foreign investment restrictions have been removed and limits on overseas re-insurance eased. Entry of insurance companies is unrestricted. Foreign branches must be lo- cally incorporated firms under the Companies Act of 1982. However, it is to be noted that resident Sri Lankans are prohibited from obtaining foreign insurance policies except for health and travel. Telecommunication services The state monopoly in basic telecommunications no longer exists and 100 percent foreign equity is allowed in the sector in Sri Lanka. As part of its liberalization programme, Sri Lanka adopted a new National Communica- tions Policy in 2003, which included provision of a liberal licensing regime to allow unrestricted competition from new, including foreign, entrants. However, the government indefinitely suspended the policy in August 2003, and the implementation status of the policy could not be ascertained. Transportation services The only restriction on foreign registered operators providing domestic air services in Sri Lanka is that 60 percent of their directors must be Sri Lankan. In shipping, the only foreign investment restriction is the for- eign equity limit of 60 percent for shipping agencies. However, state intervention in transportation remains substantial. The provision of air services is still dominated by the majority state-owned national carrier, Sri Lankan Airlines. Another state-owned company has the monopoly on airport services. Though some private- sector involvement was allowed in the provision of port services in 1998, since then there have not been any significant reforms. 6.11.3 Policy space and commitments under GATS Services constituted 57.1 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s GDP in 2006 (World Bank 2007). Sri Lanka is a net service exporter with transportation and tourism accounting for majority of services exports. Other major services include wholesale and retail trade, transport and communication, banking and insurance. Tourism has wit- nessed rekindled foreign investment following the domestic peace initiatives. More efficient services delivery is a government priority, but several state utility monopolies exist, often incurring large losses. Notwithstanding the limitations inscribed in Sri Lanka\u2019s schedule, services liberalization is believed to be the key to attracting foreign investment and developing infrastructure in the country. Sri Lanka allows 100 percent foreign investment in the following services: banking, finance, insurance, stock-brokering, construc- tion of residential buildings and roads, supply of water, mass transportation, telecommunications, energy production and distribution, professional services and the establishment of liaison offices or local branches of foreign companies. These services are regulated and subject to approval by various government agencies. The screening mechanism is non-discriminatory and, for the most part, routine. This move towards liberaliza- tion goes beyond Sri Lanka\u2019s commitments at GATS and removes foreign equity restrictions on many sectors that had been placed therein. It may be mentioned that Sri Lanka believes that the GATS Article IV must effectively raise developing- country participation in the services trade. It has suggested that industrialized countries be required to pro- vide meaningful access in services of export interest to developing members, and to limit their liberalization requests to developing countries. Sri Lanka has moved beyond its GATS commitments by removing the cap on foreign equity in a num- ber of sectors including telecommunications", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7bb825ff-128e-49d0-8775-213c94541952": {"__data__": {"id_": "7bb825ff-128e-49d0-8775-213c94541952", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99571306c23acdbdf81037458bd21f313a2b4475d47636e4f9e1ae586ecd16fb"}}, "hash": "99571306c23acdbdf81037458bd21f313a2b4475d47636e4f9e1ae586ecd16fb", "text": "and banking. It has not submitted any new offers in the GATS (2000) negotiations. 50 6.12 Thailand 6.12.1 Comments on Mode 3 commitments Thailand\u2019s GATS schedule covers all major service sectors except health. \uf06c Foreign equity limitations of 49 percent on commercial presence are scheduled for a range of professional services, such as legal, accounting and architecture, as well as for certain construction, education, environ- mental, tourism, recreational, cultural, sporting, maritime, rail and road transport services. \uf06c In other sectors, foreign equity limitations range from 20 percent to 49 percent for telecommunication services, and 25 percent to 49 percent for most banking and non-banking financial services (including insurance). \uf06c In financial services, although new branches are subject to discretionary licensing, \u2018grandfathering\u2019 provisions allow foreign bank branches operating in Thailand before July 1995, to open up two more branches. Access through locally incorporated banks is limited to the acquisition of shares of existing banks and foreign equity participation is limited to 25 percent. \uf06c Thailand has also listed MFN exemptions on telecommunications, transport and professional services. Thailand has emphasized ownership over other considerations. Services markets, except in infrastruc- tural services where more restrictive conditions were imposed, are quite open to foreign competition, but still, Thailand has retained its ability to implement WTO-consistent discriminatory industrial policies, even if foreign-equity ceilings were to be lifted. It is also one of the few cases where MA and NT are strongly linked. There is the impression that the overall emphasis is not on MA by itself, but in its relation to NT and the industrial and developmental policies embedded within. 6.12.2 Autonomous liberalization and trends in FDI Financial services Foreign equity limits were relaxed in 1997, for 10 years to allow foreign ownership of up to 100 percent (previously 25 percent) in commercial banks, finance companies and credit financiers. After 10 years, foreign investors were to be allowed to purchase additional equity or participate in equity recapitalization of financial institutions, unless their equity holding is less than 49 percent. Foreign investors who increased their equity to over 49 percent during this 10 year period were not required to sell their shares, but would not be able to purchase additional shares. In 1999, 22 foreign bank branches operated in Thailand. In 2001, three of them closed down and brought down the number of foreign bank branches to 18 in 2002. However, relaxation of foreign equity limits resulted in substantial majority ownership of four Thai commercial banks. At the end of 2002, foreign banks held 16 percent of total commercial bank assets of Baht 6.5 trillion (I USD equals around 33.5 baht) and this share has continued to rise. An encouraging step towards increasing foreign investments in the financial sector was taken in Janu- ary 2004, when the Thai Cabinet approved a new Financial Sector Master Plan (FSMP). This Plan was designed to increase competition by eliminating regulatory boundaries within the financial sector. The Plan classified financial institutions as either commercial banks able to provide all financial services except insurance, securi- ties trading and brokerage; or retail banks, which would focus on small and medium-sized enterprises and 51 lower-income customers. According to the Plan, retail banks can provide virtually all types of financial transac- tions with the same exceptions as commercial banks. The Plan allows foreign banks to operate as full branches under the same conditions as Thai commercial banks, but without the option of opening branch offices, or subsidiaries, which would also operate as Thai commercial banks. Over time, the Plan foresees foreign banks receiving permission to open 3-5 branch offices outside Bangkok, but no timeframe is specified. Thailand\u2019s TPR (2003) noted that the government\u2019s three-stage plan to encourage foreign investment in insurance which started in 1997, did not go beyond its second stage. At the first stage, 25 percent foreign equity participation in a joint venture with a local firm was allowed (in 1997). However, certain insurance com- panies exceed the 25 percent limit since they started operations in Thailand before the legislation became effective in 1992. They were allowed to keep their higher foreign equity participation under \u2018grandfathering\u2019 provisions. The largest life insurer in Thailand, with over half of the market, has a majority foreign ownership since this firm entered the Thai life insurance market before the enforcement of the current Life Insurance Act, and its acquired rights have been protected under grandfathering provisions. If proposed amendments get the nod of the parliament, the limit of foreign equity participation will increase to 49 percent, thus marking completion of the second stage. The contemplated third stage allows majority foreign equity participation within ten", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09553b51-e14a-4e25-8f19-3ad4aeed4065": {"__data__": {"id_": "09553b51-e14a-4e25-8f19-3ad4aeed4065", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "194a8520579fee340a516f64411cd98b6e62a3b37a7c1109e10b8dbc4b306c68"}}, "hash": "194a8520579fee340a516f64411cd98b6e62a3b37a7c1109e10b8dbc4b306c68", "text": "years after the completion of the second stage liberalization. The bill is being considered at the ministerial level. However, this bill is indicative of the liberalization process in Thailand and the fact that Thailand has been pursuing domestic reforms which go beyond the commit- ments made by it at the GATS. Telecommunications Thailand launched a Master Plan for Telecommunications Development in 1997 to fully liberalize basic tele- communications by 2006. Existing concessions to foreign participants were to be converted to licences to encourage what the authorities saw as \u201cfree and fair\u201d competition in telecommunications. The Telecommunications Business Act 2001 reduced the foreign equity cap from 49 percent to 25 per- cent. However, the government announced in May 2002 that it would raise the ceiling back to 49 percent. Transportation Foreign investment in domestic land, waterway or air transportation, including domestic airlines, is restricted under the Foreign Business Act (1999) and is closed to non-Thai nationals or companies with majority foreign equity, unless approved by the cabinet. While the Act permits foreign equity participation of up to 60 percent (or 75 percent on a case-by-case basis), if two thirds of the firm\u2019s board of directors are Thai nationals, specific transport legislation seemingly prohibits majority foreign equity. In the case of domestic shipping and avia- tion, sectoral legislation also stipulates minimum Thai equity levels of 70 percent. Land ownership Although non-Thai businesses and citizens are not permitted to own land in Thailand unless the land is on government-approved industrial estates, and Thailand has submitted land ownership restrictions on foreign- ers, there has been some relaxation of this restriction. Under the 1999 amendment to the Land Code, foreign- ers who invest a minimum of 40 million baht (around US$ one million) are permitted to buy up to 1,600 square meters of land for residential use with the permission of the Ministry of Interior. Though many foreign businesses sign long-term leases instead, and then construct buildings on the leased land, this move towards liberalization of the GATS commitment is still noteworthy. 52 6.12.3 Policy space and commitments under GATS Services contributed 44.4 percent to Thailand\u2019s GDP in 2006 (World Bank 2007). The large share of FDI which goes into services is concentrated in the finance and retail trade. Transportation and communications are the other important services sectors. Thailand has introduced autonomous reforms, including higher foreign equity limits in banking. How- ever, foreign investment in most other service sectors remains limited to 49 percent ownership. In its latest TPR of November 2003, the WTO has taken note of Thailand\u2019s steady progress towards trade liberalization, and has observed that regulatory reforms geared to make domestic markets more competitive will raise productivity and attract FDI. Thailand has made a revised offer as part of the ongoing GATS (2000) negotiations, but the same have not been de-restricted and are thus unavailable in the public domain. Thailand seems to have liberalized beyond its GATS commitments in financial sector, and has also eased foreign land ownership restrictions subject to minimum investment. However, for other services sectors, there have not been any significant levels of liberalization as yet. The Thai Board of Investment has recognized basic transportation, infrastructure and services as key areas where investment needs to be promoted. In addition to legal limits on foreign ownership in certain sectors, Thai firms employ defences against foreign investment primarily through cross- and stable-shareholding arrangements. Such defences against hostile takeovers are typically applied against all potential investors, rather than against foreign potential investors alone. Companies are permitted to specify more strict limits on foreign ownership than those estab- lished by the government. In general, limits on foreign ownership and participation in the Thai economy have eased since the Asian Financial Crisis. 53 The experiences of the acceding countries to the WTO constitute a new and emerging area of research. The process of accession to the WTO has attracted attention not only in terms of the process per se with respect to its complexity and duration, but also in terms of outcomes and impacts such as benefits of WTO membership post accession, \u2018costs\u2019 faced by acceding countries in terms of relatively more stringent rules and so on.65 A particular concern has been raised with respect to the higher benchmarking and an attempt by the Working Party members to set ambitious templates for countries wanting to join the WTO in the future. Also, it has been claimed that benefits accruing from the developing country status have not been realized in practice despite the fact that most of these countries ranked low on per capita GDP and have a large proportion of their population", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42717339-f861-4761-8a82-37063c8c053a": {"__data__": {"id_": "42717339-f861-4761-8a82-37063c8c053a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a9a574a318415455fcdcfb5764a7219b3a4c70fcf6b62b943574df99fe97459"}, "3": {"node_id": "03739833-f226-4f61-a757-1b47afd69306", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c755e9c831c52c886cd03b03556f339be8a3f2e275ff2d594dfffc33629fd18"}}, "hash": "e199c4c795cc643f4b0cdaba9c620fcbf1eeb4da9751b38caf8f2097504ffeb5", "text": "below the poverty line.66 In this context, it is useful to note that a higher benchmarking of the commitments entered into by the acceding countries would have implications for the 31 countries that are in different stages of accession on count of precedence. (24 countries have completed the process of accession). In this section we shall undertake a preliminary analysis of the Mode 3 component of the schedules of NACs viz. Cambodia, Nepal, China and Kyrgyz Republic and compare the same to select developing country schedules. The point of enquiry is fairly restricted, but illustrative in some ways of the range and extent of obligations which the NACs have committed themselves to in the process of accession. Previous research on variance between the total number of subsectors committed between different countries has shown that Nepal and Cambodia, both LDCs who acceded to the WTO post 1995, have committed to 76 and 93 sub sectors respectively as opposed to the 20 subsectors which were committed to on average by the LDCs during the Uruguay Round.67 Here, the total number of sectors/subsectors committed as also and the extent of NT and MA limitations in the schedules are used as the \u2018proxy for price\u2019, which NACs have paid in order to become a WTO member. In addition to this analysis, it is also useful to undertake a qualitative analysis of the nature of MA and NT limitations which can be another useful way of understanding the commitments of the NACs. 7. Policy space in GATS and select experiences of the newly acceding countries to the WTO 65 For a more detailed discussion on the issue, see for instance, Evenett, Simon, J. and Carlos A. Primo Braga (2005). \u201cWTO Accession: Lessons from Experience\u201d.

Trade Note 22, International Trade Department, World Bank. 54 The schedule of specific commitments of the NACs exhibits the following features: [1] To reiterate the point raised previously, the sectoral and sub-sectoral coverage is more extensive than that of other developing countries. Thus, Cambodia has scheduled commitments in 11 sectors, China in 9 sectors, Nepal in 11 sectors and Kyrgyz Republic in 11 sectors. Sectors committed to liberalization include health, education, environmental services and financial services. The commitments for Bangla- desh (2), India (6), Pakistan (6), Philippines (4) and Sri Lanka (3) are much reduced. [2] An examination of the horizontal commitments of the NACs reveals again that barring some land owner- ship restrictions in the case of Cambodia, China and Nepal and restrictions on movement of natural per- sons, there are no limitations on market access or national treatment for foreign investments. In the case of Nepal, the need to obtain government permission prior to investing in the country has been listed as a national treatment limitation and a requirement for environmental impact assessment clearance for all services related activities. In the schedule of India for instance, collaboration with public sector enter- prises or government undertakings as a joint venture partner, preference to the foreign service provider offering the best terms for transfer of technology has been listed as a national treatment limitation. Malaysia again for instance has listed out a series of MA restrictions related to mergers and acquisitions and has NT restrictions if land is sought to be acquired for speculative or non-productive purposes which may conflict with the interest of the state. Also, preferences for indigenous population (Bumiputera) or indigenous status companies and institutions/trusts to meet the objectives of the National Economic Policy or National Development Policy have been kept unbound. Similarly, the Philippines has specified MA limitations which limit foreign equity in all sectors (except insurance) to a minority stake. Also, it has listed out NT conditions on accessing of domestic credit by foreign firms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03739833-f226-4f61-a757-1b47afd69306": {"__data__": {"id_": "03739833-f226-4f61-a757-1b47afd69306", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a9a574a318415455fcdcfb5764a7219b3a4c70fcf6b62b943574df99fe97459"}, "2": {"node_id": "42717339-f861-4761-8a82-37063c8c053a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e199c4c795cc643f4b0cdaba9c620fcbf1eeb4da9751b38caf8f2097504ffeb5"}}, "hash": "7c755e9c831c52c886cd03b03556f339be8a3f2e275ff2d594dfffc33629fd18", "text": "Also, it has listed out NT conditions on accessing of domestic credit by foreign firms.

Cambodia Market Access In legal services, the only MA restriction is related to commercial association with Cambodian law firms and restrictions on direct representation of clients in court. In specialized medical services, provision of services is permitted through joint ventures with Cambodian judicial services. In telecom services, the only MA limitation is of the requirement that the local shareholding has to be up to 49%. In banking and other financial services, commercial presence is granted only through authorized financial institutions and some services are subject to establishment of regulatory laws. In health services, the only MA limitation is related to the presence of one Cambodian director for technical matters. In tourism and travel related services, there are MA limitations relating to equity ceilings and economic needs criteria being met. National Treatment There are no NT restrictions except for a limited time exception of up to January 2009 in a few sub-sectors, which are set to expire in any case. 55 Nepal Most of the MA restrictions relate to foreign equity ceilings varying between 51% - 80%/joint venture require- ments and subject to the service provider being incorporated in Nepal. NT restrictions are mostly not scheduled with the exception of the telecom services wherein it has been mentioned that the majority of the board of directors of a joint venture should be Nepali nationals and NT limitations obtained on education services funded from state resources. China Market Access In the sectoral commitments, China has placed geographic (retailing services for instance) and quantitative MA restrictions in line with the countries\u2019 needs, some of which are time barred and would be removed in predefined periods following the accession of the country. In sectors such as accountancy, licensing require- ments have been listed out. Several sub-sectors have a joint venture requirement while permissive of majority shareholdings and some have minimum asset requirements in order to operate in China. In basic telecom services, ceilings of upto 50% have been set out as a condition for establishment. For construction and related engineering services China has put in an interesting requirement that for Chinese invested construction proj- ects, depending on need, permissions of the concerned provincial government would be required. This has meant a role for the provincial governments as well, albeit in a limited sense. For banking and other financial services, China has put in minimum asset requirements between USD 10-20 billion for establishment. National Treatment NT restrictions relate to minimum residency requirements. Majority of the personnel (for example in medical and dental services) are subject to nationality requirements. There are some regulatory conditions attached to onshore oil field services. Kyrgyz Republic Except for real estate services, services incidental to fishing, services related to distribution of electric en- ergy, postal services, air transport services (except maintenance and repair of aircraft) which have been kept unbound in Mode 3 for both MA and NT, there are no limitations on MA and NT. Primary education, higher education, and adult education services are funded from state resources. Additionally, there are no horizontal limitations on Mode 3 commitments as well and the services schedule can be seen as extensive market liber- alization commitments. While it is difficult to generalize across countries, it does appear that nearly all the NACs have not taken recourse to the flexibilities embedded in the GATS architecture to schedule limitations even in sectors such as health, education and environment, which are critical from the point of view of human development and therefore need appropriate government regulation. In some instances, the sectors have been opened up without the benefit of adequate experiences in either the setting up or maturing of the regulatory institu- tions, a typical case of placing the cart before the horse. Indeed, the GATS flexibilities were mainly intended to offer options to each country to be selective and adopt a sui generis approach to opening up in the services sector. This has obvious implications for policy space to operationalize developmental goals as in practice it is impossible for any country to reverse any of the commitments entered into in the WTO. 56 8.1 Looking ahead The services sector has emerged as a fulcrum of developmental dynamics in a number of Asian economies. Not only has the services sector become strategic in its contribution to GDP growth across Asia, but it is increasingly expected to also bear the responsibility of providing an inclusive character to GDP-growth. Given economy-wide efficiencies and positive spillover effects of a fully developed services sector, services are rec- ognised as a backbone for development having a catalytic character", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fe3b279-4192-4d23-abc1-12dc314fd675": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fe3b279-4192-4d23-abc1-12dc314fd675", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Space and Investment Rules under GATS: Select Asian Experiences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-space-and-investment-rules-under-gats-select-asian-experiences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bff13469e0c1fd5303c5eba8154f545a22bbbe7f27fb8f4a2f39dae9985a3d91"}}, "hash": "bff13469e0c1fd5303c5eba8154f545a22bbbe7f27fb8f4a2f39dae9985a3d91", "text": "for boosting all round growth. Understanding trends in the liberalization of the services trade needs to take into account liberalization at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels for a comprehensive assessment. There has been an ongoing debate as to whether or not liberalization of the services trade would constrain the policy space and capacity of governments to regulate services to achieve vital human development objectives. At another level there has been the issue of the nature and extent to which governments have sought to utilize the policy available in the investment rules under GATS, while scheduling their commitments with a special focus on NACs to the WTO. Within the limitations outlined earlier, this study attempts to offer some insights to this cluster of issues. UNCTAD (2006) in its study suggests that reliance on GATS schedules alone, underestimates the extent to which countries have opened up their services sectors to FDI. The analysis of autonomous liberalization commitments on a host of services made by countries included in the sample, shows that FDI-liberalization commitments undertaken by them at an autonomous level are deeper in comparison to the commitments undertaken by them under GATS on the same set of services. This study therefore echoes the conclusions drawn by the UNCTAD (2006) analysis. In comparison, the commitment made by the sampled countries under GATS while moving further on the autonomous liberalization route in the larger macroeconomic context of galvanizing domestic savings and capital formation shows that: \uf06c The GATS process has the potential to enable the developing countries to encourage capacity creation of their local workforce, as evidenced in some of the sectoral schedules of the countries examined. Nepal for instance has sought to protect local entrepreneurship by encouraging joint ventures between for- eign investors and Nepalese nationals. Similar provisions can be found in Sri Lanka where the only the restriction on foreign registered operators providing domestic air services in Sri Lanka, is that 60 percent of their directors must be Sri Lankan. 8. Conclusion 57 \uf06c Larger and powerful developing countries like China have utilized the GATS process to signal the level of restraint they would like to exercise when opening key sectors such as banking in the context of achieving their social goals of universal banking. The Republic of Korea too, has restricted market access of foreign banks to its markets by attaching a number of conditions such as requirement of a separate licence for each foreign branch, requirements relating to minimum operating funds and the requirement of having expertise in international banking business. India has also selectively liberalized its services sector. \uf06c Further, the GATS process has allowed countries to keep themselves unbound in services where they believe they lack sufficient regulatory framework. Nepal for instance has kept itself unbound for a series of financial services until it is better to carry out an assessment of its domestic preparedness. \uf06c In general, it does appear for the selected countries that the GATS framework has succeeded in permit- ting commitments to retain sufficient space for development policies, as NT is, in many cases, unbound, and some NACs have been able to include horizontal restrictions. However, in the case of some NACs the coverage of NT measures seems limited to certain sectors and countries and quantitative limitations have not been utilized in their schedules. The NACs\u2019 schedules show that market liberalization through GATS has been wider in the number of sectors involved, and deeper, in the extent of full commitments, both in terms of MA and NT. Moreover, important sectors for human development such as health, educa- tion and environmental services, have been systematically liberalized barring some exceptions. Overall, based on inter-country comparison of schedules it appears that the NACs may have been subject to greater pressures for liberalization and opening up. \uf06c Efficient supply of services arguably is a sine qua non for promotion of economic growth promoting human development. While liberalization offers opportunities for increased economic growth and de- velopment, an un-regulated liberalization process can threaten developmental goals such as universal access to essential services. Accordingly, the Sub-Commission on Human Rights in its Resolution 2001/4 called upon \u201cgovernments and international economic policy forums to ensure that, in the formulation, interpretation and implementation of policies in relation to the liberalization of trade in services, the liberalization of trade in services does not negatively impact enjoyment of human rights by all persons without discrimination\u201d.68 \uf06c Services liberalization in Mode 3 is expected to lead to increased opportunities for foreign investment.

Hence, while preservation of policy space can enhance human development, it is also believed that \u201ca world trade regime friendly to human development would provide domestic policy space and give developing countries flexibility to make institutional and other innovations. Such policy space should take precedence over MA considerations, even as the trade regime continues to recognize that MA can make an important contribution to human development in specific situations and for specific sectors and issues\u201d. 69 68 United Nations Social and Economic Service (2001). 69 Malhotra (2004). 58 References Adlung, Rudolf and Martin Roy (2005). \u201cTurning hills into mountains?

Full foreign ownership allowed in the non- Banking Financial Sector, if the existing company is listed on the stock exchange, while grant- ing access to other forms of establishment. In Banking, foreign banks allowed to establish one branch in the country.

Included land ownership restrictions, limitations in NT for incentives and subsidies, tax breaks, and research and devel- opment subsidies. Also scheduled minimum investment requirement of 50 million won (US$ 40,000). Of the 34 sub-sectors taken into account, 21 scheduled in Business Services, Telecommunications, Construction, Distribu- tion, Environmental Services, Financial Services, Tourism, and Transport. Communica- tion Services (other than Telecommunications), Recreational Services, Education, and Health were not included. By making use of horizontal restrictions, a strong sectoral differen- tiation in the schedule is seen, tailoring a wide range of options to each sub-sector. For example, the Republic of Korea commits without further limitations in Business and Tourism Services, except for very specific professions where some kind of limitation exists. At the same time, it makes use of ENTs and other types of limitations for very different sub-sectors. Apart from the horizontal restrictions in Column 2, no further restrictions included, and \u201cnone\u201d scheduled, except in the following sectors: l\ufffd Construction: \ufffd - Limits on business scope, by limitations on contract amount per contract. \ufffd - Local content through a compulsory subcontract system. l\ufffd Unbound for Maritime Transport.

These partnerships between government and private sector are resulting in a wide range of initiatives to help build people\u2019s resilience to the impacts of climate change and disasters. These include SMS quizzes to raise public awareness about climate change and disasters, community training for disaster-resilient construction, and establishing new community-operated Food Banks. Partners in these projects are being assisted by the Pacific Risk Resilience Programme (PRRP). The consequences of climate change and disasters are experienced by all sectors of society; private and public. All sectors therefore benefit from, and have a role to play in, responding to climate change and disaster risk management (CCDRM). This includes ensuring such risks are integrated into routine planning, budgeting and implementation of development activities. Private sector engagements that successfully harness the Private sector businesses in Tonga are assisting Mu\u2019a residents to build risk-resilient community halls. (Photo: MORDI TT) combined resources of the public and private sectors can create cost-efficiencies and greater impact for public CCDRM initiatives, and also support innovative change in risk governance processes. PRRP encourages partnerships between government, commercial enterprises and other entities as part of its focus on strengthening the ways national, sub-national and community structures and systems work together to better manage the impacts of climate change and disasters. The success of integrating CCDRM into development planning hinges on strong partnerships and relationships at all levels. Engaging the private sector PRRP is assisting to broker partnerships between government and the private sector. For example, to reduce risks to communities through the delivery of cost-effective services and improved accessibility to CCDRM activities, and to encourage engagement in self-regulation to either gain a competitive advantage as a `first-mover\u20191 or to reduce the incentives for Government to regulate therefore retaining market flexibility. PRRP adopts a three-phase process to broker durable partnerships between the public and private sector, with a focus on delivering cost-effective services for CCDRM. Phase 1: Piloting - identify parties well placed to work together, facilitate their union and, where required, provide funding to trial the relationship. Phase 2: Researching - commit to monitor, evaluate and adapt pilot projects. Undertake targeted research to determine whether pilot projects met PRRP\u2019s private sector engagement criteria, and to understand the factors that have contributed to this success or failure. Phase 3: Developing platforms - through the piloting and research process, establish platforms that define good-practice approaches and procedures for enabling CCDRM partnerships between private and public sector in Pacific Island communities. Pacific Risk Resilience Programme (PRRP) Working towards resilient communities in the Pacific Fast Facts May 2015 1 First-movers are initiators or the first to enter a new market or technology whereas Early Adopters are an early customer of a given company, product, or technology. PRRP works with Pacific Island nations and their people to consider the risks they face from climate change and disasters and include those risks in their usual plans for development. Communities can become more resilient to climate change and disasters if routine government, community and other planning takes these risks into account. This risk governance approach is delivered through a partnership between the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and international non-government organisation Live & Learn Environmental Education (LLEE), and supported by the Australian Government\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). PRRP is being delivered in four countries: Fiji, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu.

The structural change and economic reforms that have been adopted in many Asian countries during the last two decades add new dimensions to the linkage between macroeconomic policies and poverty reduction. With these considerations as well as in the context of supporting the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo has carried out a series of policy-oriented country case studies and thematic studies on the linkages between macroeconomic policies, growth and poverty reduction in the context of identifying and promoting more pro-poor macroeconomic policies in the region. These country case studies covering Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Samoa, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam contain: (i) a descriptive narrative of basic trends in economic aggregates, inequality and poverty, explicitly geared to the assessment of macro-level policies, (ii) a \u201cpolicy audit\u201d, namely, an assessment primarily of the impact on poverty of the macroeconomic and adjustment policies, and (iii) an elaboration of feasible policy alternatives that would be more effective in reducing poverty and inequality. Each of these country case studies was prepared by a team of international consultants, national consultants and UNDP advisors covering 6-8 macro policy issues such as fiscal policy, monetary policy, exchange rate, trade liberalisation, financial liberation, privatisation, etc. These case studies have already been presented and discussed at national and regional levels as well as published and disseminated widely. The objective of this publication is to bring together the main findings of the above mentioned case studies which can serve as an important advocacy and dissemination tool. This synthesis report could not have been prepared without the generous contributions of many individuals and institutions. At the outset, I would like to express my appreciation to the author of this synthesis study as well as authors of the country case studies and thematic studies, focal points from UNDP country offices, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo and UNOPS-Asia office for their support and diligence in preparing these studies.

Fifteen country case studies2 and nine thematic studies on macroeconomics of poverty reduction were prepared. These studies have produced a wealth of data on specific countries and valuable conclusions on effects of macroeconomic policies on poverty reduction, which can helpfully frame and guide future discussions on macroeconomic policy choices in the region. This paper reflects the perspectives and ideas presented by contributors, drawing on the overall conclusions of the country and thematic studies commissioned. However, the many capable scholars who contributed understandably came to different conclusions, or at least differing emphases, on some points. This paper aims to draw a set of common conclusions based on the country and thematic studies. This paper addresses fiscal and monetary policy, exchange rate policy, international trade and investment policy, privatisation and management of public enterprises, and financial liberalisation. This paper also addresses important cross-cutting issues, emphasising the need to recognise that policy choices in seemingly distinct areas have consequences for the poor which depend on how they are combined. The inter-temporal sequencing of policies has considerable implications, and that what complementary policies are adopted (including microeconomic interventions to ensure broad-based asset distribution and appropriate support for agriculture) can be crucial to ensuring that the policy framework as a whole is pro-poor. For reasons of space, it has not been possible to refer in detail to individual country studies; footnotes refer the interested reader to country studies that illustrate specific points. Individuals interested in particular country experiences should consult the country studies directly for the wealth of information that they contain. The policy lessons of these studies may be summarised as follows. First, there is ample evidence to support the view that the government has a vital role to play in poverty reduction. While nurturing the growth of private entrepreneurial and managerial capabilities, governments must develop their own capacities to act in order to protect the poor and not shy away from active policies and interventions where these may be required. A private-property centred market system cannot, in isolation, be expected to generate pro-poor growth. 2 Specifically, this means that governments: In fiscal policy, must adopt balanced taxation policies, spending where necessary to foster development or protect the poor. The overall combination of taxation and expenditure policies should be progressive. In monetary policy, must be guided in setting interest rates and money supply growth by the requirements of economic stabilisation and development (recognising the crucial developmental role of credit), rather than by arbitrary or imported inflation targets. In trade policy, should pursue gradual and managed integration with the world economy, instituting social safety nets to protect the population, especially the poor, from economic shocks associated with trade, whether of a one-time or an ongoing nature. In exchange rate policy, should select among different regimes, including fixed, floating, or partially managed floats, depending on pragmatic considerations, recognising the potential developmental importance of export competitiveness and the need to avoid the emergence of conditions in which speculative attacks will be attractive. In management of the external account, exercise caution in liberalisation of the capital account and consider taxation of flows or quantitative measures where required to manage the inflow or outflow of potentially destabilising portfolio investment flows. In privatising state-owned enterprises (SOEs), take account of revenue implications of privatisation, construct effective standing safety nets to provide for workers who are likely to undergo periods of unemployment after privatisation and ensure that appropriate regulatory regimes are in place to ensure adequate competition and efficient pricing in privatised industries. 3 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy Lessons for Pro-Poor Lessons for Pro-Poor Lessons for Pro-Poor Lessons for Pro-Poor Lessons for Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy Macroeconomic Policy Macroeconomic Policy Macroeconomic Policy Macroeconomic Policy The theory of the second best as a framework The theory of the second best as a framework The theory of the second best as a framework The theory of the second best as a framework The theory of the second best as a framework for pro-poor policy for pro-poor policy for pro-poor policy for pro-poor policy for pro-poor policy In 1956, Lipsey and Lancaster set out the theory of the \u2018second best\u20193, describing how, when the optimal conditions associated with a specific control variable fail to be attained in an economic model, the best policy response may be to change other variables to something other than those assumed to be optimal.

This framework has recently been used to good effect by Dani Rodrik in analysing policies of economic growth. Rodrik and others have argued on the basis of empirical evidence that adopting the policies generally assumed to be the \u2018first best\u2019 can lead to sub-optimal results.4 In such a context, experimental \u2018search\u2019 for the best policies or the use of \u2018growth diagnostics\u2019 (which attempts to identify where the constraints to growth are, and how these can best be overcome) become the central tools of development policy.5 From the standpoint of such a perspective, the most pro-poor macroeconomic policies must necessarily be discovered in a context-specific manner on the basis of appropriate experimentation, and through pragmatic observation and problem solving. It is against this background that the detailed conclusions laid out below for specific thematic areas are best understood. 4 Fiscal and Monetary Policy Fiscal and Monetary Policy Fiscal and Monetary Policy Fiscal and Monetary Policy Fiscal and Monetary Policy We begin our more detailed enquiry into pro-poor macroeconomic policies by considering fiscal and monetary policies. It has been widely argued in recent decades that fiscal conservatism is an essential requirement for creating a macroeconomic environment conducive to growth and stability. In particular, there has been a considerable emphasis on the maintenance of low budget deficits and inflation rates. However, pro-poor policies must by definition not merely promote growth, but promote growth that benefits the poor. Such policies may include a supportive public investment programme and progressive tax and transfer systems. Countercyclical policies, although potentially important to achieving various goals, may not always be classifiable as pro-poor policies.6 Progressive taxation and expenditure are among the fiscal tools that can support poverty reduction, but in many developing countries their effective scope, and the capacity to implement them, are limited. The usefulness of a progressive tax system in particular is constrained by the administrative limitations of the tax system, which is often heavily reliant on relatively regressive indirect taxes, because of the few \u2018tax handles\u2019 available. For example, a country with a large agricultural sector or informal sector may find it difficult to monitor and thus tax individual incomes arising from these sectors. In contrast, it may find it relatively easy to levy customs and excise duties or sales taxes on formal sector enterprises, which are more visible by virtue of being formal, and concentrated in urban centres. Given the constraints on progressive taxation, a robust, pro-poor public investment programme may require contained deficit spending. The effects of such deficits must be considered in context. Governments that single-mindedly focus on deficit targets without considering growth or poverty objectives may risk stagnation. Contrastingly, deficit-financed public investment can be ultimately self-financing. In recent decades, many countries in Asia and the Pacific implemented a series of tax reforms to mobilise domestic resources. Though these reforms indeed helped in raising tax-GDP ratios in some countries (such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam) they have not helped in securing additional resources in many other countries (including China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka). As a result, some of these countries have been compelled to make major cutbacks in public expenditure in order to contain fiscal deficits. Of the two broad 5 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy components of government expenditures \u2013 current and capital \u2013 it is the capital expenditure that has declined significantly in most of the countries studied. For example, in countries such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka, capital expenditure as a percentage of the GDP has fallen by almost a factor of one-half. It is likely that in such cases the trends in fiscal policy have exerted a negative influence on growth.7 The size of the fiscal deficit (as a percentage of the GDP) has fallen in most of the countries studied, with the exceptions of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and India. However, the path to fiscal adjustment has been achieved in different ways. Some countries such as Bangladesh have opted to use part of their revenue gains to bring down their fiscal deficit and the remaining part to raise the level of public expenditure. Some other countries, like Viet Nam, have managed large increases in the revenue to GDP ratio, but have combined this with limits on public expenditure to achieve significant lowering of the fiscal deficit.8 Only in a few of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8033865-fcb8-44a7-800b-53901cf8589e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8033865-fcb8-44a7-800b-53901cf8589e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy: Lessons from the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1af6fb2119fef4cb97c3d3daad26e125775d19e880f7cb9a57648915a97fa51c"}}, "hash": "1af6fb2119fef4cb97c3d3daad26e125775d19e880f7cb9a57648915a97fa51c", "text": "case study countries (Mongolia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) was the deficit so large as to require its reduction to be a policy priority. The other countries satisfied the so- called golden rule of fiscal policy (that if governments cover current expenditures by current revenues, public investment can be responsibly financed by borrowing or through development assistance). It is also interesting to note that countries such as India and Sri Lanka have been able to achieve relatively high rates of growth (in excess of 5 percent) despite carrying large fiscal deficits (above 5 percent of GDP) in the 1990s. In these countries, there is no clear evidence of a \u201ccrowding out\u201d effect as the overall rate of investment has gone up during the 1990s. In Viet Nam, fiscal deficits were high in the 1980s due to a relatively high level of public investment expenditure. This strategy was perhaps one of the contributing factors to the high economic growth, which enabled a rapid expansion of revenues and substantial containment of the fiscal deficit in the second half of the 1990s, leading to a period characterised by macroeconomic stability and high growth. In contrast to this, Pakistan, possibly under pressure of the IFIs, undertook steep fiscal adjustment during 1990s, largely through cutbacks in total public expenditure (including capital expenditure). This may have been one of the reasons for the relatively slow growth of the Pakistani economy in the 1990s. The relationship between deficits and inflation will be elaborated below in the discussion of monetary policy. In no country that was part of the study were policy alternatives found to be so limited that actively pro-poor fiscal policies were deemed infeasible. 6 The Importance of Public Investment-Led Growth Public investment is a crucial fiscal instrument for promoting growth and countering poverty. It serves three important objectives: the expansion of productive capability, the management of effective demand, and furthering distributive goals. Public investment can create assets that foster earning opportunities for the poor. These may include public works and schemes that aim to create employment or distribute productive assets, and schemes that may not target the poor specifically but that help to raise the wages of the poor by contributing to labour market demand or setting wage floors. Public investment may include the creation of infrastructure and social sector assets. For example, improved transportation infrastructure can give the poor increased access to markets and lower production costs of informal and small-scale enterprises. Investment in schools and health clinics ultimately increases the productivity of the poor, and can enhance their ability to effectively participate in the political system. The case for public sector investment must address the criticism that it crowds out private investment. In the Asia-Pacific region, rising government expenditure does not appear to have had crowding-out effects, for private investment grew faster than public investment in the 1990s. In many countries of the region buoyant private investment has gone hand in hand with major increases in public investment. Examples of this complementary relationship are seen in China and Viet Nam. Some evidence points to \u2018crowding in\u2019 through a multiplier effect and the impact of profit expectations and cost reductions associated with improved infrastructure. Countries that have limited the investment role of the public sector, such as Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal, and Pakistan have experienced an inferior investment performance by the private sector.9 Indonesia is a particularly clear case in which low public investment has been associated with weak private sector performance. The country studies are uniform in emphasising public sector investment\u2019s often positive effects. The studies assert that, to varying degrees in each country and sector, the net effect of public investment is to attract private investment through the \u2018multiplier effect\u2019 on effective demand, by enhancing profit expectations, and by reducing costs of enterprises through improved infrastructure. It is suggested that there are strong \u2018second best\u2019 arguments for public investment, as it can help to counter the effects of poor financial intermediation, supply side bottlenecks and/or demand side constraints.10 7 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy Increasing public-sector investment need not imply increasing overall public expenditure. Pro- poor fiscal analysis has often focused on expenditure-switching policies which reallocate funds. Inter-temporal tradeoffs must play a role in assessing whether expenditure switching is pro- poor. Although increases in social expenditure are often pro-poor, shifts in spending away from \u2018economic\u2019 investments (such as public infrastructure) may reduce the long-term growth potential of the country which can have detrimental effects on the poor in the intermediate and long run.

The ability to undertake such policies in turn presupposes the availability of adequate \u2018fiscal space\u2019, broadly defined as a government\u2019s ability to undertake adequate levels of effective expenditures in a sustainable manner. In turn this implies, inter alia, the ability to raise adequate taxes and to borrow at reasonable costs.11 Governments should pursue improvements to tax regimes but note the risks involved in the implementation of systematic reforms. It has been very popular in recent years to argue for a Value Added Tax (VAT), in place of taxes on international trade and specific sales and excise taxes, in order to diminish both cross-border and inter-sectoral distortions. However, the introduction of the VAT may not be a \u2018revenue-neutral\u2019 action, and this can carry substantial implications. Where the informal sector is large, the VAT applies only to a fraction of economic activity. Its introduction in place of other indirect taxes can therefore create revenue shortfalls. Moreover, in such conditions the introduction of the VAT creates a distortion in favour of production in formal sector enterprises, which are eligible to claim tax rebates for which informal sector enterprises are ineligible.12 Notwithstanding efforts to mobilize domestic resources through appropriate tax regimes, developing countries are likely to be financially constrained. However, a developmentally- oriented fiscal policy may require some deficit spending in order to finance investments that possess a \u2018development payback\u2019. While sustained borrowing to finance consumption is unsustainable, borrowing to finance productive investment need not threaten macroeconomic stability, and in particular need not necessarily be inflationary, as will be discussed below. The objections to increased public spending are rooted in an ideology that 8 would sharply restrict the role of the government. Our disagreement with this position has been expressed earlier. Monetary Policy for Pro-Poor Development? During the 1990s monetary policy tended to be less expansionary in the majority of the countries studied. The rate of expansion in money supply has been generally lower or similar to that during the 1990s, with the notable exceptions of Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Consequently, real interest rates were relatively high in the 1990s, and have fallen only in the recent years. The tightening of monetary policy throughout the region appears to have been largely motivated by the objective of containing inflation. It is, therefore not surprising that inflation rates have been lower in the majority of countries studied in the 1990s. A few countries such as Indonesia and Pakistan have experienced higher inflation, arising in the latter case from the pressure exerted on the money supply by runaway government borrowing in the first half of the 1990s. In the case of Indonesia, inflation spiralled in the aftermath of the East Asian financial crisis.13 The case studies indicate that the correlation between increases in the monetary supply and inflation was loose, perhaps reflecting excess demand for money due to financial deepening. Some of the studies also cast doubt on the validity of the causal link between (broad) money stock and inflation. Inflation in Asia and the Pacific seems to be considerably influenced by cost push factors. The case studies raise concerns about possible overemphasis on low inflation targets and their possible adverse effects on economic recovery. This point is highlighted by the following select quotations from the country reports: While lower inflation\u2026is a positive indicator\u2026a near-zero inflation rate may be symptomatic of demand deficiency leading to capacity underutilisation\u2026 Targeting for a too-low inflation rate\u2026can sometimes result in overkill. Production contraction can happen if prices are not flexible downward, which may be the case not only for industrial production, but also for many subsistence-type activities where the price\u2026may be determined somewhat inflexibly like the so called subsistence wage...Yet another problem with pushing inflation too low is that it will make it difficult to bring about the large relative price changes that the structural adjustment policies aim at. (Bangladesh study, p. 38). The point is not that the authority has to fight inflation at any price \u2026. Rather, it has to face the tough question of how far to go with fighting inflation, knowing that with ongoing deflation an economy might face greater risk of entering into the chain of rising unemployment, falling demand, and reduction in the level of national income\u2026This restricted policy should not be seen as the only way out, without flexibility. The inflation rate\u2026has remained low since 1995. 9 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy We can even say that it is too low, showing a deflationary trend throughout the period from mid 1999 to 2001\u2026Different studies provide that the threshold inflation for developing countries that maximize", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "317bcb48-e59c-4660-87c6-9054985f21bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "317bcb48-e59c-4660-87c6-9054985f21bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy: Lessons from the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eed38df316b389d1861e715f00724ad791eb7df08d78f8311b248558337994c2"}, "3": {"node_id": "a609d636-d5aa-428c-b73a-c0714ed7e940", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e9462bdb7d5c145c6cb129bddbe882f0518167412d488f7057009180c09e8eda"}}, "hash": "2eb24806c55f1f824b024a0fdbae4088abfc4e7fb52fdd09edcc59fbbe0bf68a", "text": "output is about 10 percent to 15 percent.

(Indonesia study, pp. 15, 19) These concerns are not unfounded. Most of the country reports recommend an expansionary monetary policy to facilitate fiscal stimulus, enhance investment and foster Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) growth. The Bangladesh report states that macroeconomic policy should aim at softening physical infrastructure and access to credit constraints (p. 33). The China report (p. 78) concludes, \u201cIn line with \u2018pro-poor\u2019 monetary policy approach, additional money supply could be used more actively to support small and medium sized financial institutions, which may be more suitable \u2026 in addressing the credit needs of the private sector and small and medium-sized enterprises. Also, the central bank could increase its lending support to the development of rural cooperative financial organisations,\u201d (p. 78). Similarly, the Indonesia report highlights the need for economic policies to foster agricultural and SME growth since the majority of poor livelihoods are tied to agriculture, and SMEs possess potential to generate employment for the poor. It also recommends measures to improve SME access to the capital market. The Cambodia report provides detailed empirical evidence to refute the argument that an expansionary monetary-fiscal policy mix is necessarily inflationary. It argues that in Cambodia underemployment is endemic, while land generally remains underutilised. It asserts that the industrial sector operates below capacity and the country suffers from poor infrastructure, giving rise to conditions in which public investment does not crowd out private investment. Poor countries are typically revenue-constrained. A robust programme of public investment 10 can entail fiscal deficits and thus raise the spectre of inflation. A conventional view is that poor countries should aim for monetary stability, above all maintaining low inflation\u2014usually defined in the single digits\u2014through avoidance of deficit spending accompanied by high interest rates if necessary, and a tight money supply. This view is believed by its supporters to be favourable to the poor, who, it is assumed, are hurt by inflation that will erode the value of their incomes, and to impede economic growth overall, which is thought to be aided by stable price expectations. It is widely agreed that hyperinflation harms the poor by eroding the value of their incomes. However, the studies suggest that moderate inflation may not hurt the poor as much as is often believed, and in specific cases may even benefit them, for at least two reasons. First, strategies for reducing inflation which restrict aggregate demand and output may diminish employment. This consequence of anti-inflationary policies may be more salient for the poor than the real wage increasing effect of reduced inflation. Second, inflation can benefit the poor by reducing the real value of their debts. This having been said, it is essential to be attentive to the consequences of inflation for the real incomes of the poor in specific country contexts, as these may differ a great deal depending on structural parameters such as the level of monetisation of the economy, the extent to which the poor have access to \u2018inflation hedges\u2019 and whether \u2018core\u2019 inflation of essential items is affected differently by monetary expansion than are other components of inflation.

An important basis for the criticism of even moderate inflation is that it has a tendency to become ever higher, ultimately resulting in hyperinflation with its attendant economic and social costs. However, this fear is not adequately borne out empirically. At inflation rates 11 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy below 40 percent per annum, there is a weak correlation between the rate of inflation and the likelihood of subsequent hyperinflation. A fixation on bringing about low single-digit inflation cannot be justified by fear of subsequent inflation. There appear to be strong pro-poor arguments in favour of a moderately expansionary monetary policy over the intermediate and long term. Moreover, in the face of adverse shocks\u2014 whether of supply or demand\u2014monetary policy may play an important role in stabilising output. Monetary policy is a key tool for managing demand shocks. Because the export base of many developing countries is very narrow they may be especially subject to such external shocks, which have knock-on effects on domestic consumption and investment. Monetary policy can help to counter-balance these effects of demand shocks. Demand shocks cannot be absorbed by exchange rate adjustments, which attempt to mitigate reductions in export demand through price reducing measures. In the case of many developing countries, the Marshall-Lerner elasticity condition for such depreciation to be revenue enhancing may not be met. This leaves monetary policy as a vital policy tool. Supply shocks are arguably more common in developing countries than demand shocks, and in these cases as well, monetary policy is needed to stabilize employment for the poor, accepting moderate inflation as a trade-off where necessary. An orthodox view is that central banks should have both \u2018goal\u2019 and \u2018instrument\u2019 independence so that it may pursue monetary stability credibly, without being unduly influenced by the government\u2019s fiscal policy objectives. However, such independence can be counter-productive from the standpoint of the objectives of pro-poor macroeconomic policy. Banks with both goal and instrument independence, staffed with \u2018inflation hawks\u2019 (as explicitly recommended in the literature in favour of central bank independence) may choose very low inflation targets that have an adverse impact on employment and growth objectives. A better policy in many instances may be to give the central bank instrument autonomy but to have its goals guided by the overall economic objectives implied by the poverty reduction strategy of the government. 12 In the last two decades, most developing countries have changed their exchange rate regimes in major ways, often in response to conditionalities applied by the Bretton Woods institutions or as part of their implementation of open economy policies. The overall direction of the regime changes has been towards greater flexibility of exchange rates, accompanied by what has often been considered a complementary policy, liberalisation of capital accounts. In the studied countries, no pattern emerges in the relationship between exchange rate regimes and macroeconomic performance. Movements in nominal exchange rates corresponded roughly with inflation in several countries, permitting us tentatively to conclude that by allowing nominal depreciation in the face of inflation, most countries could maintain their competitiveness. It can be difficult to evaluate the effects of different types of exchange rate policies on macroeconomic outcomes for various reasons, including the following: First, there can be major discrepancies between how countries classify their exchange regime, and how they operate in reality: for example, what is reported as a flexible exchange rate regime is often pegged in practice.16 Second, the effectiveness of exchange rate policies cannot be determined in isolation. The effects of exchange rate policy are dependent on the fiscal and monetary policies pursued. Third, there is a problem of \u2018endogeneity\u2019 or \u2018reverse causation\u2019: just as exchange rate regimes influence macroeconomic outcomes, the choice of regime can be determined by macro conditions.

First, exchange rate policy cannot be discussed in a vacuum; it must be closely coordinated with monetary policy.

Where governments have control over exchange rates, they may employ devaluation to reduce the risk of balance of payments crises. Devaluation can enhance international competitiveness and boost export demand. However, devaluation can cause both inflation and economic contraction by reducing the overall demand for domestic goods. In highly indebted countries it will raise the domestic cost of meeting the external debt-servicing burden. Devaluation may also affect income distribution by lowering real wages (through its effect on the cost of imported wage goods) and thereby enhancing profits. Whether government control over exchange rates provides an effective tool will depend on the nature of the crisis. For instance, as mentioned, devaluation of a currency may not help in a balance of payments crisis, but only cause stagflation. In such a situation, an expansionary monetary policy can complement exchange rate policy. The best course is, generally, for governments not to delay exchange rate adjustments. When currency valuation appears to be high enough to threaten a balance-of-payment crisis, governments should initiate an orderly downward adjustment, so as not to lose competitiveness and to avoid a disruptive economic crisis. Yet, even a coordinated exchange rate and monetary policy is insufficient: a country faces the prospect of recession following a sudden devaluation regardless of its monetary policy if its capital account is fully open and the devaluation is perceived as revealing a willingness to undertake future devaluations. Whether devaluations encourage inward FDI and portfolio investment depend in part on their effect on such expectations. Even in the absence of a crisis, many less developed countries do not have an adequate institutional and legal framework to handle capital flows nor are they attractive for such flows. Thus, capital account opening in many cases increases capital outflows, rather than inflows. To counterbalance this tendency, countries may have to have high domestic interest rates that adversely affect domestic investment, especially in SMEs. Under a flexible exchange rate, high interest rates can spur demand for domestic currency leading to nominal appreciation and loss of competitiveness. Under a fixed exchange rate system, accumulation of foreign currency by the central bank will cause monetary expansion and inflation, if inflows of foreign exchange are not fully sterilised (which may be unavoidable due to the limits to such a strategy). In either case there will be real appreciation. Capital inflows, although desirable, are not costless; managing capital flows can absorb significant government resources that could have been used for pro-poor programmes. Also, the prospect of capital flight can restrict a country\u2019s ability to use fiscal and monetary policies to address investment in infrastructure, priority sector development and human development. 14 Government\u2019s ability to pursue expansionary macroeconomic policies to counter the contraction effects of devaluation can be limited in the presence of capital mobility. A country may need to impose some control on short-term capital mobility to gain control over monetary and fiscal policies, because any intervention the government can make can be dwarfed by the effects of massive capital outflows. A sound approach may be to institute some capital controls (targeting short-term portfolio capital and not long-term FDI) until stability returns, to enable the government to pursue an expansionary policy to counter the contraction effect of devaluation. Given the vulnerability of pegged currencies to crises, and the lack of perfectly effective policies to counter these crises, is a flexible exchange rate not preferable? Perhaps not: flexible exchange rate regimes are characterised by marked increases in volatility. It is sometimes thought that these increases in volatility can adversely affect exports by increasing transaction costs or adversely affect FDI, but there is mixed evidence in this connection. Stability of the exchange rate does not in itself constitute a pro-poor policy. It must be helped to support the goal of long-term growth. If we take as given that manufacturing export-led growth is an important tool for lifting people out of poverty, a somewhat undervalued currency (from the perspective of balance of payments equilibrium) may be desirable in the long-term. Achieving the twin goals of short-term stability and long-term undervaluation of the exchange rate may require active management.

Is this, however, a feasible combination? Policy Objectives and Options The famous trilemma of exchange rate policy is that a country cannot simultaneously purse goals of international financial integration, monetary independence and control of the exchange rate: it has to give up at least one. Thus, the options available to a country are: (i) Exchange rate stability and monetary independence, without financial integration; known as the exchange rate stability approach; this strategy requires capital controls (ii) Financial integration and monetary independence, and no pegged exchange rate, known as the \u2018real targets\u2019 approach 15 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy (iii) A pegged exchange rate and financial integration, but no monetary independence, known as the nominal anchor approach Different exchange rate regimes can be implemented in support of these different options. An absolute fixed exchange rate regime (AFER), adopted under (iii) reduces potential transaction costs for imports and exports, which can have economic benefits; on the other hand, this approach can require high real interest rates, which may impose high costs on domestic producers, and encourage speculative capital flows and, indeed, speculative attacks. A country with AFER can lose its monetary policy independence. This also can have implications for fiscal policy: countries adopting AFER sacrifice real resources to obtain the currency of another country as a reserve against speculative attack, possibly at the cost of forgoing other expenditures that might have served important social objectives, including reducing poverty. An AFER enhances the credibility of the government by imposing restrictions on the government\u2019s ability to finance deficits through borrowing from the central bank and monetisation, thus keeping inflation low and improving the balance of payments. But such strict limitations on deficit spending can have negative effects for pro-poor public investment, and a very low rate of inflation is not necessarily important to the poor. A pure floating exchange rate regime (PFER), adopted under (ii), enhances competitiveness by permitting currency depreciation in response to falling export demand. However, it leaves a currency subject to short-term oscillations the presence of which may increase transactions costs. A fixed but adjustable exchange rate regime can be employed to minimise the disadvantages of AFER and PFER; however such an approach cannot eliminate the difficulties associated with the polar approaches which it mixes. A developing country pursuing nominal stability must avoid harmful real exchange rate appreciation. Exchange rate depreciation can be an important tool for maintaining export competitiveness and, more generally, robust aggregate demand. The role of exports in industrial \u2018learning by doing\u2019 gives special importance to this point. 16 International Trade and International Trade and International Trade and International Trade and International Trade and Investment Policies Investment Policies Investment Policies Investment Policies Investment Policies Gains from international trade can in principle contribute to poverty reduction, if gains in national income are sufficiently sizable, and well distributed, to lift individuals out of poverty. The view that trade liberalisation reduces poverty thus rests on two assumptions: that a liberalised trade regime in less developed countries will lead to gain in national income, and that these gains will in fact benefit the poor. Both of these assumptions are not always certain to hold, however. We will examine each in turn in this section. Two opening comments are in order. First, it is difficult to measure trade \u2018liberalisation\u2019, since different scholars have used different indicators of trade-related policy reforms in Asia and elsewhere. Measures of protectionism often employed have included the unweighted or trade-weighted average import tariff, an index of effective protection, an average index of non-tariff barriers, indices of exchange rate misalignment, and the black market premium. In earlier decades, developing countries most frequently used non-tariff measures as the main instruments of controlling trade, through for example, employing negative lists specifying banned items, and imposing import quotas and licensing requirements. Because of the many different instruments of protection that have been employed it is difficult to arrive at uncontroversial measures of protection. Nevertheless, available data indicate that there has been a substantial degree of trade liberalisation in Asian countries in recent decades. Second, liberalisation is in practice a complex process involving staggered reductions in tariffs, quotas and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "024c8920-1949-4c6a-a2ac-e3889b045010": {"__data__": {"id_": "024c8920-1949-4c6a-a2ac-e3889b045010", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy: Lessons from the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4fb198da5cd37223414cfc4424803ded22536cbd232c2ade10e17d8b9e1df509"}}, "hash": "4fb198da5cd37223414cfc4424803ded22536cbd232c2ade10e17d8b9e1df509", "text": "other barriers to trade. There is no universal path of external sector reforms and each such path is likely to have distinct effects, inter alia because the effects of trade policy are substantially dependent on complementary policies (exchange rate policy in particular). Policies that provide sustainable access to foreign exchange and the resulting ability to import intermediate inputs, capital goods, and wage goods may be required to support rapid domestic growth. Other complementary policies may be required in order for liberalised trade to be effective at reducing poverty, and to be politically sustainable, even where it generates aggregate economic gains. In practice, countries have usually simultaneously undertaken other economic reforms such as privatisation and deregulation of industrial, financial, product and labour markets, so that where growth has occurred it is difficult unambiguously to attribute it to trade liberalisation. 17 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy All the countries considered here underwent substantial trade liberalisation through shifts from quantitative restriction on imports to tariffs and progressive reduction of tariffs, along with the reduction or removal or export subsidies. Import tariffs, on average, at the end of the 1990s were one-sixth the level prevailing at the beginning of the decade in Bangladesh, about one-half in India, and one-third in Pakistan. Simultaneously, most countries allowed their currency to depreciate in real terms with the exception of Bangladesh and China. Most countries experiences an upsurge in exports. The growth rate of exports in India and Viet Nam more than doubled. Stagnation of exports was observed only in the case of Pakistan. In South Asia, trade (exports plus imports) as a percentage of GDP, which stagnated at about 21 percent between 1980 and 1990, has increased rapidly in the 1990s to reach 34 percent in 2003. In East Asia and the Pacific, the trade-GDP ratio has increased from 29 percent in 1980 to 45 percent in 1990 to 81 percent in 2003. Not only did Asia-Pacific as a region experience increases in rade, but it did so more than other developing regions of the world.37 The share of the Asia-Pacific region in world\u2019s merchandise exports has more than doubled from 5.0 percent to 11.2 percent during 1990-2003. The region\u2019s share in world merchandise imports also nearly doubled from 5.4 percent to 10.2 percent in the same period. Similarly, Asia\u2019s share in world services exports increased by 75 percent from 3.6 percent to 6.3 percent. A more interesting story emerges when comparing trade performance across sub-regions within Asia. While East Asia and the Pacific\u2019s share in the world\u2019s merchandise exports of goods more than doubled during the period 1990-2003, South Asia increased its share by only 43 percent. On the other hand, South Asia did reasonably well in services trade. While its share in world services trade has more than doubled from 0.8 percent to 1.7 percent during 1990-2003, East Asia increased its share from 2.9 percent to 5.6 percent in the same period. Among the country studied, only two countries (namely Mongolia and Pakistan) witnessed declining shares in global merchandise trade. Thus, the available data clearly indicates that Asia-Pacific developing countries have out-performed the other developing countries by a wide margin in terms of their share of world trade. This high level of trade integration implies that international trade is of considerable and growing importance in the region\u2019s economies, although it is of lesser importance than in certain other regions. The country studies note that trade-GDP ratios increased markedly over the recent period during which trade liberalisation took place. There is evidence of export growth and export diversification. 18 The Effect of International Trade on Economic Growth In some instances trade liberalisation appears to have been accompanied by sustained (although not always increased, growth). However, it is not always straightforward to determine whether trade liberalisation is the result or the cause of observed growth.17 The doctrine of comparative advantage holds that countries can increase their real income and welfare by specialising in the production of products in which they have a comparative advantage. Where growth in aggregate national income occurs, it may be of two kinds: static (a one-time rise in income that is not accompanied by an increase in intermediate and long-run growth rates) and dynamic (an increase in the intermediate and long-run rate of growth of income). Standard international trade theory supports the view that static gains will result from trade liberalisation for all countries, thanks to the specialisation, and resulting efficiency gains, that it will make possible. Standard economic theory also recognises, however, that there may some be reasons why trade liberalisation does not result in greater national income.18 One such scenario is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b5c2b79-961e-4f1e-ad15-f03c218f957b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b5c2b79-961e-4f1e-ad15-f03c218f957b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy: Lessons from the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56eb60e1d48fd7f9b62510128021835ce78cfa0a764ddc05bd68aedf3caf039c"}}, "hash": "56eb60e1d48fd7f9b62510128021835ce78cfa0a764ddc05bd68aedf3caf039c", "text": "that in which a country has market power; the imposition of trade restrictions in such a context may increase national income as compared to free trade. It is true, of course, that such measures will benefit only one country and will diminish world income. The doctrine of comparative advantage is based on several such assumptions and gains its strength from a focus on one-time efficiency gains. Empirical evidence on whether trade liberalisation is associated with increases in economic growth is decidedly mixed.19 It seems plausible that in order to achieve the large beneficial effects on poverty touted by its advocates, trade liberalisation must also generate dynamic gains: that is, to permanently increase the rate of growth of national income. The theoretical basis for holding that international trade is likely to lead to such gains is weaker than the basis for the view that it leads to one-time efficiency improvement. Long-run gains are sometimes argued to come about through increased competitive pressure for innovation and productivity improvements, through creating improved incentives for innovation through the widening of the market, and by providing better access for inputs and ideas that play a role in technical innovation. On the other hand, trade liberalisation may lead to allocations of resources that are statically but not dynamically optimal, for instance by diminishing the demand for domestically produced industrial goods and thus impairing the acquisition of industrial capabilities, or by diminishing government revenues from customs and excise duties [customs duties have commonly been one of the largest sources of tax revenue for developing country governments] and thus 19 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy impairing the ability of government to undertake growth-enhancing activities. A country may end up specialising in slow-growing sectors, although it could have gained long-term benefits by investing early in sectors with rising demand. There may be insufficient private investment in such sectors in a fully liberalised economy due to the presence of externalities among firms (which do not fully internalise the benefits of long-term spillovers in the acquisition of technological, managerial and marketing capabilities), and the use of trade policies may provide one avenue for creating appropriate incentives for such activity. In many of the countries studied, export promotion has focused on obvious, common sectors such as textiles, and industrial policies appear to have been poorly chosen and implemented.20 The impact of trade liberalisation on economic growth may depend on complementary country characteristics and policies, e.g. infrastructural quality, and human capabilities, and the quality of institutions. Development strategies that aim to use exports as an engine of growth must rely on rapid rates of growth of world trade or on increasing shares of world markets\u2014factors that are beyond government control. The world economy has been supportive of export- oriented strategies in recent decades, in a number of prominent cases. However, these have also very often been instances in which active policies of export promotion in the context of industrial policies have been pursued. The Effect of Trade- Generated Changes in Income Distribution on Poverty A growing literature identifies several key linkages between trade liberalisation and poverty. Trade alters relative product and factor prices, and its net effect on poverty reduction depends on the signs of these relative product and factor price changes. For example, if exports are primarily of labour-intensive manufactures, then growth in exports could cause increases in relative wages of unskilled and semi-skilled labour, thereby contributing to poverty alleviation. This may have been the experience of East Asia in earlier decades. However, during the 90s, trade growth seems sometimes to have led to the emergence of urban \u2018enclaves\u2019, with beneficiaries consisting primarily of those directly involved in export activities and the limited auxiliary service functions that developed around these activities. For example, information technology exports from India and exports of garments from countries such as Bangladesh and Cambodia have remained restricted to a few urban centres. In the case of Bangladesh and Cambodia, exports may not have not contributed much to value-added because of high import content. The absence of backward and forward linkages has meant that the employment generation due to export expansion has not been as significant as hoped. 20 Recent findings on the effect of trade liberalisation on poverty, after controlling for the rate of economic growth, are ambiguous. The direct effect on the incidence of poverty of trade liberalisation does not appear to be significant in the Asian context (Pasha and Palanivel). The Asian experience on the impact of export performance on poverty is in line with some recent empirical studies based on global data.

Aggregate national income growth will not reduce poverty unless the poor share in the gains. Such sharing cannot be regarded as automatic. We must recognise relevant structural differences between developed and less developed economies. Less developed economies are marked, inter alia, by relative labour abundance, lower skill levels, and segmented labour markets, and poor infrastructure. The Stolper-Samuelson theorem suggests that trade liberalisation will increase wages in countries with relatively abundant labour.21 If the preconditions of the theorem were satisfied, one would expect trade liberalisation to disproportionately increase the income of the poor, insofar as their main asset is their labour. However, the assumptions of the theorem are restrictive and it cannot straightforwardly be generalised to more complicated cases better approximating reality. There is little consensus as to whether trade liberalisation causes increases in employment and wages in practice. Recent careful empirical studies of the effects of trade liberalisation on developing country labour markets have failed to resolve the ambiguity. LDCs, including those in the region, are characterised by a relatively small urban formal sector producing manufactured goods and services, dwarfed by the informal urban sector and the agricultural sector. The poor, who are also likely to lack education and connections, are disproportionately engaged in the informal sectors, which produce non-tradable goods (subsistence farming and personal services), demand for which may not notably increase as a primary consequence of trade liberalisation. In agriculture, lack of capital and economies of scale relative to international producers can diminish the international competitiveness of local farmers in LDCs, as cheap agricultural imports compete with local products, lowering prices. Analysis of the case study countries suggests that trade reforms generally failed to promote substantial increases in agricultural exports and may even have adversely affected cultivation. Indonesia moved from being an agricultural success story in the late 1980s, with significant food surpluses and rice exports, to becoming a food importer with stagnant domestic production by the end of the 1990s. The Cambodian example suggests that even an apparently good performance in terms of agricultural exports 21 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy can be associated with the exclusion of certain cultivators from the benefits of such trade. Large farmers appear to have benefited more from export growth. It is not surprising therefore that in Cambodia, agricultural trade liberalisation has apparently not been strongly associated with rural poverty reduction. Viet Nam is the only country among the case study countries in which agriculture appeared to exhibit strong overall output growth throughout the 1990s. In China, agriculture is widely recognised as the sector most adversely affected by the terms of accession into the WTO, which have caused increases in import competition for producers of some important domestic crops. The effect upon Chinese farmers is still unknown and possibly massive. In Bangladesh and Nepal, the issue of trade liberalisation is complicated by the long and porous border both countries have with India. For cultivators in these countries this makes India\u2019s trade policies possibly just as significant as their own. In both of these countries, agricultural performance has been poor, and in addition to the reduced viability of cultivation the problem of very large underemployment in agriculture remains significant. More generally, it is clear that the agricultural sector seems to have played a limited role in overall export growth to date.22 This may reflect the constraints of the current international market for agriculture commodities, in which subsidies and tariffs applied by developed countries are important factors. The quality of employment in export industries can be weak. It has been suggested that the net effect of trade integration on manufacturing employment could also be negative, at least in the short term, because export production may be less employment intensive than local production that is displaced by imports. There is some evidence that the service sector, rather than the industrial sector, has now emerged as the sector providing refuge for individuals who cannot make a living in agriculture. Across much of Asia, labour force participation rates appear to have declined in the 1990s.23 It appears that the effect of aggregate growth on the incomes of the poor depends significantly on the extent to which the workers who benefit directly from freer trade increase their consumption of the services of workers in sectors with weak links to international markets. Poor infrastructure and geographic isolation, which contribute to segmentation of the economy, will be factors in this. It is notable that regional inequalities have increased during some successful export driven development experiences. 24 Even the urban poor may fail to benefit from", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62400807-8c29-47a8-a37e-a7420dd54ebf": {"__data__": {"id_": "62400807-8c29-47a8-a37e-a7420dd54ebf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy: Lessons from the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c28e728b8be0a5a7011962af60f3bb221207d16e505dad103e147d15e496ee81"}}, "hash": "c28e728b8be0a5a7011962af60f3bb221207d16e505dad103e147d15e496ee81", "text": "22 trade-driven economic growth if those workers who do benefit from increased incomes expand their consumption of imported goods rather than local services.25 The overall result of greater international trade can be output growth with insufficient employment generation. One reason why increased trade may not lead to pro-poor growth is that high rates of growth are matched by very high import growth in almost all economies. Some literature on trade liberalisation indicates that in the initial stages of trade liberalisation, a country\u2019s balance of payments may worsen, because when import and export restrictions are reduced, a rise in imports may occur faster than the export supply response. However, available evidence indicates that balance of trade as percentage of GDP improved in most of the countries studied in the 1990s as compared to the 1980s levels. Only Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Nepal experienced worsening trade balance in the 1990s compared to levels in the 1980s. While the theory of competitive advantage suggests that imported goods will be less costly than the locally-made ones that they replace, the prices of other (exported) commodities can rise, both because of increased foreign demand and increased local demand caused by rising incomes for some. 26 The effects of trade liberalisation on public finance are also complex. As discussed elsewhere in this paper, public expenditure is critical to poverty reduction. Trade liberalisation can potentially have a negative public finance impact for a number of reasons. Most importantly, as already noted, tariffs on internationally traded goods are one of the primary and most reliable sources of tax revenue for developing countries, which may have few tax handles available to them; the larger the informal relative to the formal sector, the greater the degree to which this is typically true. It has also been argued that implementing WTO agreements creates a fiscal burden.27 On the other hand, the static and dynamic gains from trade may result in increased tax revenues. Sequencing of liberalisation of exports and imports is important to maintain competitive real exchange rates, improve balance of payments and increase growth. 23 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy Privatisation and the Management Privatisation and the Management Privatisation and the Management Privatisation and the Management Privatisation and the Management of Public Enterprises of Public Enterprises of Public Enterprises of Public Enterprises of Public Enterprises Privatisation has been urged on developing countries as a way to improve public finances, spur growth and even reduce poverty. Unfortunately, there have been relatively few careful empirical studies of its effects. To the extent that the consequences of privatisation have been studied, its distributional and social welfare consequences have been largely overshadowed by a focus on \u2018efficiency\u2019 which is understood narrowly in terms of output and profits. Privatisation can have several different aspects including a) privatisation of common lands, minerals, forests and other natural resources; b) partial or wholesale privatisations of state-owned enterprises (SOEs); and c) provision for private sector participation in sectors previously under public control such as water and electricity utilities, services (such as telecoms), and infrastructure. Whether privatisation has, in specific countries, enhanced growth, efficiency or poverty reduction, requires empirical research. Unfortunately, the case studies reveal a lack of systematic data on privatisations, especially in sectors that may be expected to have considerable impact on the poor, such as services, utilities and infrastructure. Thus, while we can draw some conclusions on the effects of privatisation, they are perforce on the basis of inadequate data. It is helpful to assess privatisation\u2019s impact on poverty through its effect on three intermediate factors: efficiency in production, labour markets, and fiscal balance. The final impact of privatisation on poverty depends on its impact on these indicators and the implications of this impact for poverty reduction. Privatisation of Rural Assets and Common Resources The ownership structure of productive assets in the rural sector is of crucial significance in poverty reduction, because there is typically extensive poverty in rural areas. Landlessness and ownership of marginal land are associated with this poverty. One form that land reform has taken has been to seek to privatise commonly held or state-owned land. This form of land privatisation can have an impact on poverty where it effectively entails progressive asset redistribution, because the de facto prior use patterns of existing communal 24 or state-owned land were inegalitarian (a presumption which may not always be correct). Whether such privatisation has brought long-run benefits also depends on whether new owners exercise their right to sell land and on the purposes to which these gains are put.

In China, land continues to be owned and managed by village governments or collectives. The case studies suggest that privatisation may produce positive results if it is carried out through asset redistribution in environments where the initial distribution of assets was highly skewed and rural poverty was high. However, in Mongolia, the privatisation of livestock, the main productive asset for most rural households, is reported to have increased inequality. The case studies also provide some examples of privatisation of common resources having adverse impact. For example, it is suggested that local communities in Cambodia have been harmed by privatisation of common forests, and fisheries have been damaged by siltation and chemical runoff, and that these concessions had a neutral or negative fiscal effect.28 It is also suggested that privatisation, considered strictly as giving individuals ownership, is less effective in reducing poverty than giving the same individuals long-term use rights.29 Finally, we can say that broadening asset ownership for rural communities is not sufficient to reduce poverty unless supporting public investments are made to ensure and enhance the productivity of these assets through the provision of infrastructure and services such as road and transport networks, irrigation systems and watering facilities for livestock. With regard to privatisation and access to common resources, the Cambodian and Mongolian case studies highlight the drawbacks associated with market-based resource management systems in the rural sector. State-owned Enterprises In recent years, the assumption that the degree of efficiency of an enterprise is dependent on the form of ownership has contended for influence with the notion that ownership is less important than the conditions under which an enterprise is subject to competition and regulation. Indeed, the case studies do not unequivocally show that privatisation improves the performance or efficiency of SOEs. For example, the Bangladesh, Nepal, China and India 25 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy case studies all report mixed outcomes. The role of the competitive and regulatory environment needs to be carefully analysed. It must be recognised that privatisation does not involve just the retreat of the government\u2014 far from it. Rather, it requires the state to take on new responsibilities, and acquire new capacities. Public sector officials will have to develop more sophisticated skills and greater knowledge of industrial and market environments in order to regulate newly private markets.30 This proposition has been often neglected by proponents of privatisation, who have frequently ignored the fact that developing countries may not have sound institutions to govern the market and that they may not have markets with high levels of competition. The degree of effective competition is determined not just by the number of actual or potential market participants, but by a variety of factors, including access to finance, technology and skills, degrees of horizontal and vertical integration, etc. \u2018Regulation\u2019, in turn, encompasses anything that the government might do to limit to or prescribe actions of private enterprise. Efficiency can be defined in different ways. It has often been conflated with the attainment of output objectives, without regard for social goals that could plausibly be integrated into the efficiency concern. The apparent efficiency (understood in the narrower sense just described) of both public and private enterprise in a country can owe a great deal to general macroeconomic conditions. Sifting out the effect of ownership from other factors can be difficult. Overall conclusions can, therefore, be difficult to draw. Effects of Privatisation on Labour Markets In most countries\u2019 studies, privatisation was accompanied by expansion of the informal labour markets and substantial layoffs. Available data suggest the closure rate amongst privatised SOEs was over 20 percent.31 This naturally leads to large short-term job losses in urban areas and can contribute to poverty. There is some suggestion that workers laid off from SOEs are likely to be older and less skilled, and thus more difficult to re-employ. Many unemployed workers shift to the informal sector, where social protections are much less. The long-term effects on poverty of these spikes in unemployment will depend on whether there is subsequent growth of private-sector employment. Naturally, whether this growth occurs depends on a host of macroeconomic conditions beyond the scope of privatisation policy. However, to minimise the effects of privatisation on poverty in the short-term, basic social safety nets should be put in place prior to privatisation. Indeed, if private enterprises in general provide a lower level of social protection, certain social services such as health care 26 and retirement provisions can be maintained or developed by the government.

Privatisation can affect fiscal performance in three ways, though: a) sale proceeds against net cost of privatisation, b) foregone or offloaded profits/losses of SOEs, and c) the contribution of privatised enterprises to tax revenues. With respect to sale proceeds, in general the expectations of governments appear not to have been realised in the case study countries except in China and Indonesia. In Bangladesh, for example, net proceeds were usually negative.32 There are several possible reasons for this, including corruption in the sales, or lack of investor interest (perhaps due to generally poor economic conditions). If the latter is the main problem, sales might simply be delayed until conditions improve, rather than heavily discounting assets. Privatisation also has costs including severance payments, legal fees, and the cost of running the privatisation agency, all of which affect the net gains of the government from a given privatisation exercise. Many SOEs make accounting profits, and as a result have a positive effective on the government\u2019s fiscal position. Whether these profits are lower than those which privatised enterprises would make, of course, is a distinct issue. Moreover, it is necessary to take account of the distributional and social welfare objectives that may be served by SOE in determining the revenue impact of privatisation. If the pursuit of these objectives by SOEs is a factor that generates direct or opportunity costs, it is not straightforward to assess the economic and revenue impact of privatisation. These objectives must be achieved after privatisation through other subsidies or interventions, which will in turn have their own costs. As for tax revenues, absence of information on the contributions of privatised enterprises is a major source of concern, but it is impossible to draw conclusions. Such anecdotal evidence suggests that the taxes paid by newly privatised enterprises do not compensate for the loss of direct revenue to the government; however, this may be due as much to lack of administrative or political capacity of the government to collect taxes as from the economic performance of such businesses. To privatise an enterprise is to create a political constituency (the new owners) in favour of minimal taxes and regulation. It can reasonably be expected that this constituency will assert itself, employing the resources of the newly-privatised enterprises to help them achieve their objectives. 27 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy Financial Liberalisation Financial Liberalisation Financial Liberalisation Financial Liberalisation Financial Liberalisation Financial liberalisation is the process of diluting or dismantling regulatory control over institutional structures, instruments and activities of agents participating in the financial sector. The argument for financial liberalisation is that it encourages competition between financial firms leading to greater efficiency in financial intermediation, and thus to greater aggregate savings and a lower cost of credit, thereby encouraging investment and economic growth. The argument is also sometimes made that a lowered cost of credit will especially benefit the poor, who have high levels of indebtedness and who may have few sources of credit with which to ensure adequate consumption and to engage in productive investment. Credit, arguably, ought to be considered a quasi-public good in the manner in which other nominally private goods such as education are sometimes considered, due to the large developmental spillovers associated with it. Many developing-country governments have treated it as such: public institutions and policies have been constructed to provide it, especially to priority sectors. Government involvement in the financial sector, like the government\u2019s role elsewhere, has been often criticised as inefficient. However, the need for some government intervention, or at least regulation, is perhaps more clear in the financial sector than in any other, because the critical importance of finance for growth is matched by the economic chaos that can follow from instability in the sector. Indeed, developed countries maintain high levels of regulation of the financial sector. The move from an undeveloped financial sector into a developed one requires that the government take on new roles requiring new expertise. Financial liberalisation can consist of a host of different policies, including: Removing obligations to direct credit and restrictions on interest rates Reducing controls over the investments that can be undertaken by financial agents (e.g. permitting banks to participate in the insurance or the mutual fund business); Expanding the sources of funds and forms of borrowing, (e.g. making it easier to issue commercial paper or certificates of deposit in the domestic market).

It is not possible here to address individually the effects of each of these and other policies, although we will attempt to look broadly at the effects of such liberalisation. Potential Dangers of a Liberalised Credit Market: Misallocation, Cost, and Fragility A key problem of financial liberalisation is that the private rate of return may differ from the \u2018social rate of return\u2019\u2014that is, lending or investment that would have the greatest impact on social objectives such as poverty reduction is not necessarily that which will provide the greatest return to private investors. Indeed, some such lending may be perceived to carry such high risk that private lenders would provide credit only at prohibitive interest rates. Thus, in a privatised and unregulated financial sector, socially valuable poverty-reducing investments may not be made. A) Misallocation of Credit For example, a completely privatised capital market may not provide sufficient investment in infrastructure. Although it is necessary to long-term economic growth, infrastructure can have a very long gestation period, high costs, high risks and diffused benefits, making it potentially unattractive for private capital investors. Government intervention to complement private investment or directly to provide investment in needed infrastructure can thus constitute an important contribution to creating the conditions for economic growth. Similarly, state-owned financial institutions, such as development banks, may direct credit to specific sectors, such as agriculture or small-scale enterprises in which the poor are engaged; or to manufacturing that creates low-skill jobs that the poor may take up. The principal rationale for development banks is the failure of private financial agents to provide certain kinds of credit to certain kinds of clients. Development banking is required because social returns can exceed private returns in these activities. Industrial development banks can help local industries achieve economies of scale and agricultural development banks can advance subsidised credit to small and marginal farmers (who could be excluded by commercial banks and forced to rely on expensive informal sources of credit). When state-owned financial institutions are privatised, the government is no longer able to allocate credit directly to priority sectors, although it may require private lenders to undertake lending to priority sectors. 29 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy B) Prohibitively High Cost of Credit When privatisation is undertaken in the absence of regulations of credit, the composition of loan portfolios will be determined by profit-making imperatives. Privatised institutions are likely to be more risk-averse, and to have more stringent collateral requirements, than public institutions pursuing social objectives, and thus to limit investment by those who have inadequate capital. Where unregulated private actors such as individual money-lenders do lend to the poor, it can be at prohibitively high rates of interest, in contrast to government-directed credit institutions pursuing social objectives which, if they function effectively, may lend at lower interest rates than the prevailing market rate, which they may do deliberately in order to facilitate the take-up of credit and the growth of enterprises they desire to foster. Advocates of financial liberalisation argue that the possibly higher risk-aversion of private lenders can be offset if the liberalisation package also includes easier conditions of entry into the financial sector that increase competition, thus holding down rates of interest. However, this need not necessarily occur. Where financial liberalisation allows domestic and foreign players to acquire firms, it can trigger a process of consolidation, resulting in fewer players in the market and reduced competition, especially where public actors withdraw. The cost of credit can thus rise, affecting pro-poor growth by shifting the composition of incremental investment away from projects benefiting the poor. Poverty reduction can thus be slowed both by the privatisation of institutions and by the dilution of rules that direct credit to \u201cpriority sectors\u201d such as agriculture, urban small scale enterprises and rural non-agricultural activities. A tactic governments might adopt to hold down the cost of credit to the poor after privatisation is to cap rates of interest that can be charged, thus attempting to ensure the availability of credit at reasonable rates while undermining the incentive of banks to compete for the highest rates of return by taking on the most", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ce12b92-cc6c-4e5f-b961-a44fe33ddf92": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ce12b92-cc6c-4e5f-b961-a44fe33ddf92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy: Lessons from the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d7074e12854bf300671a17e2f2e24d46876ae8ffc56de86daf913f95192bb41"}}, "hash": "8d7074e12854bf300671a17e2f2e24d46876ae8ffc56de86daf913f95192bb41", "text": "risky loans, and ensuring prudent loan selection. Of course, an adverse consequence of such an approach will be credit rationing. However, such rationing can occur even in unregulated contexts.33 C) Increased Fragility of Financial Markets and Risk of Market Failure Liberalisation can mean freeing banks to offer a greater range of financial assets to their customers. Under a liberalised regime, banks change from being the principal bearers of financial risk to generating financial assets that transfer risks to a portfolio of institutions willing to hold them. 30 Such liberalisation can increase the risk of financial market failure. Orthodox neoclassical theory of financial markets is based on three assumptions: that markets are competitive, that sufficient information is available to all market participants, and that these participants act adequately \u2018rationally\u2019, on the basis of this information. These conditions ensure that financial markets function efficiently, in which case abrupt re-valuations of assets without underlying changes in underlying \u2018fundamental\u2019 factors would be unlikely. The combination of access to perfect information and competition between suppliers of capital and borrowers ensures that capital is allocated to the best projects (i.e. those with the highest rate of return, at a realistic rate of interest). These assumptions need not hold true, however: competition may be undermined, and information, since it has strong public-good characteristics, is not necessarily profitable to create or distribute and can therefore be insufficiently supplied. Of course, government-owned development banks may also experience a high rate of default thanks to high-risk lending or inappropriate loans made due to political influences, corruption, and other factors leading to government failure. Even in developed economies, lack of accountability and political interference can lead banks to make bad loans with an ultimately high cost. Following liberalisation in less developed countries, including the relaxation of regulation, inexperienced banks may make poor lending decisions or dally in new financial instruments that neither they nor consumers fully understand. Some fear that in a short-termist attempt to attract deposits, banks may offer unrealistic rates of interest, or lend imprudently. The government may try to prevent or mitigate such occurrences through appropriate regulation, although it cannot be assumed that it will always have the capacity to do so. Where banks do fail, depositors (including the poor) are at risk of losing these savings unless the government steps in to cover losses. Where governments intervene in this way, the cost to public finances can be high and a moral hazard can be created that encourages risky behaviour on the part of banks in the future. However, refusal to intervene could have an adverse affect on poverty and generate a mistrust of the formal financial sector that will return small-scale savers to informal, low or negative forms of saving while failing fully to channel available savings into the most productive investments. This thicket of considerations may make some question the rationale for privatisation: state- owned banks, backed by the finances of the government, are less vulnerable to collapse; where they do make bad loans it may not be costlier than the bail-outs of private institutions in the face of market failure. 31 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy The Importance of Sequencing The Importance of Sequencing The Importance of Sequencing The Importance of Sequencing The Importance of Sequencing of Policies of Policies of Policies of Policies of Policies All of the above sections on diverse macro-economic policies have referred to the interdependence of such policies. In many cases, policies that are categorized distinctly are so intertwined that their effects cannot be effectively analysed independently of others. Because our entire exercise here concerns the effects that it may reasonably be anticipated that specific policies will have on the poor, we must look carefully at each of these of interdependences. One type of interdependence is worthy of special mention precisely because it is often overlooked: inter-temporal interdependence. Policies that are interdependent may often have to be implemented in a particular order to be effective. For example, the literature on trade liberalisation indicates that in the initial stages of trade liberalisation, a country\u2019s balance of payments can worsen, because when import and export restrictions are reduced, the rise in imports may occur faster than the export supply response. Thus, it could be desirable to liberalise export and import regimes in a staggered fashion, or to liberalise imports of capital goods and intermediate inputs used in export production prior to liberalising other imports, as a tactical means of maintaining a competitive real exchange rate and viable balance of payments.

It cannot be assumed that such markets will emerge instantaneously and spontaneously. Indeed, rather than creating greater opportunities for private enterprise, hasty and unplanned privatisation could even undermine private enterprises that depend on the public services that suddenly disappear. For instance, small-scale agricultural producers who may for lengthy periods have relied upon government-provided agricultural extension services such as provision of seeds, veterinary services, maintenance of wells, and assistance during droughts, may not readily be able to maintain production when these services are precipitately withdrawn. Such a phenomenon appears to have occurred in Mongolia, where the government retreated rapidly from such activities, leading to the collapse of rural agricultural markets, according to one of the case studies. 34 In some instances it may be possible for such services ultimately to be privately 32 provided, and in other instances active government support (at the least) may be necessary to ensure their continuance. Services with a strong public good aspect (such as agricultural extension services) are likely to be of the latter type. Establishing Regulatory Regimes An important sequencing consideration involves the importance of creating regulatory regimes\u2014e.g., tax laws, labour, and financial regulations\u2014prior to government withdrawal from direct involvement in the production and provisioning of goods and services and privatisation. In many cases creation of such regulatory regimes will constitute a new area of endeavour for the government, and must be undertaken well in advance of other economic reforms. If monitoring and enforcement regimes are not in place prior to the need for them, the economic and political costs of implementing them may become higher. For example, because many publicly owned enterprises are profitable, after accounting for one-time sale-generated revenues, privatisation can reduce ongoing government revenues. The adverse implications of this reduced revenue for public finance, and in turn poverty reduction, can be offset by the creation of appropriate taxes on these privatised assets or the income that they generate. Such a tax system must include both creating a suitable legal framework (e.g. creating an effective mechanism of corporate taxation) and developing the capacity of the government to enforce the legal regime. Macroeconomic changes such as privatisation also inevitably create political interests. In the case of privatisation, a newly powerful class of owners (or more powerful, if existing economic elites avail themselves of the opportunity of privatisation to acquire former SOEs), whether domestic or foreign, will employ its economic and political power to resist taxation. These interests may resist taxation and regulation no matter when the regime is inaugurated but may be more likely to succeed once their interests in doing so are made more concrete through privatisation. Thus, countries planning for the privatisation of SOEs must not only consider the effect of this on public revenue and how a new tax regime may offset the government\u2019s loss of profits, but would do well to ensure that the new tax regime is in place, and indeed that a cadre of officials is trained to enforce the regime, well before the sale of SOEs takes place. SOEs in developing countries play a significant role in the creation and development of formal labour markets and in setting labour standards, because of their pursuit of \u2018stakeholder\u2019 objectives going beyond profits, their susceptibility to political pressure, and other factors. Where investment is liberalised and SOEs are privatised, there may be incentive for the newly private 33 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy enterprises to increase profit by diminishing real wages and labour standards. It may therefore be desirable to ensure that privatisation is complemented by the creation of an effective system of national labour standards monitoring and enforcement. As with new tax regimes, clear economy-wide labour standards promotion mechanisms should be in place in advance of privatisation, and governments must ensure that a sufficient number of public officials are trained to monitor and enforce adherence to these labour standards and that courts are equipped to deal with related legal actions. Where the government chooses, under a privatised regime, to continue to direct credit or to provide preferential interest rates for specific sectors, these policies will have to be accomplished through subsidy or regulation. To be effective, a suitable governmental framework for promoting these aims should be in place before privatisation takes places, so that purchasers understand the terms under which they can expect to operate.

Agriculture will be discussed again below, but from the perspective of sequencing, we emphasise here the importance of having social safety nets in place to cushion economic dislocation of the poor engaged in agriculture. Similarly, it is essential that adequate social safety nets, including unemployment benefits and job re-training measures, are put in place before privatisation. We cannot say with certainty whether privatisation increases or decreases in employment, since in the long-term this will depend on the extent of subsequent overall employment growth. There is some suggestion that workers laid off from SOEs are likely to be older and less skilled, and to suffer subsequent downward mobility, but this evidence is extremely limited.35 Regardless, it is only prudent for any pro-poor policy to encompass provisions for social safety nets well in advance of changes that may affect employment levels. 34 Whether macroeconomic policies have the effect of reducing poverty does not depend on these policies alone but also on what complementary policies are employed. In particular, such complementary measures encompass suitable microeconomic interventions. We consider here two especially important kinds of complementary measures in particular, although it is possible to think of many others. Asset Distribution Individuals\u2019 capacity to benefit from opportunities to participate in markets and a supportive macroeconomic framework can depend on their possession of adequate assets \u2014 which they may employ either directly, as a means of production for the market, or indirectly (e.g. as collateral used to procure loans for investment in physical capital or human capabilities). From this standpoint, the possession of a relatively egalitarian initial asset distribution, ensuring the possession of assets which are adequate for persons to arrive at the \u2018starting gate\u2019 of a competitive market economy, is essential to the success of pro-poor macroeconomic policies. Policies that ensure a broad-based initial distribution, or the ability to procure such assets over time, are therefore essential to maintaining a pattern of growth which is inclusive and poverty- reducing. Policies that can be used to achieve such an initial distribution of assets, or to bring about a more egalitarian distribution of assets over time include land reforms, investment in human capabilities (in particular, basic education and health care), the provision of credit and the creation of cooperatives for production and marketing. The Special Role of Agriculture Agriculture is a subject worthy of special consideration for at least two reasons. First, it is important to note that agriculture is a source of livelihood and not just a sector of production. This idea has figured significantly in WTO negotiations, and has been especially emphasised by certain countries (in particular, India). Complementary Measures Essential Complementary Measures Essential Complementary Measures Essential Complementary Measures Essential Complementary Measures Essential to the Success of a Pro-Poor to the Success of a Pro-Poor to the Success of a Pro-Poor to the Success of a Pro-Poor to the Success of a Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy Macroeconomic Policy Macroeconomic Policy Macroeconomic Policy Macroeconomic Policy 35 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy Second, despite the focus on rapid industrialisation as the key to economic growth and poverty reduction, the majority of the poor in the countries studied are still engaged in agriculture. Any policy changes, for good or for ill, that affect agriculture will therefore have a disproportionate effect on the poor. In addition to the role of agriculture as a source of livelihood, it must be recognised that most agricultural commodities are foods, which are essential for survival. Agriculture is therefore of great significance to the poor on both the \u201cproduction side\u201d and the \u201cconsumption side\u201d and must accordingly figure centrally in the design of pro-poor macroeconomic policy. Although there is not space here to elaborate such considerations in details, we briefly note the following examples of methods through which this special role of agriculture has sometimes been taken note of in the past, and can be taken note of in the future: Schemes for stabilisation of agricultural prices on both the production and the consumption sides, through maintenance of buffer stocks, public systems of food procurement and distribution, and other mechanisms Use of price indices in macro-economic management which emphasise the importance of essential commodities, especially food The application of import tariffs where required to protect employment in agriculture The safeguarding of foreign exchange sufficient to meet essential commodity import requirements, especially of food. 36 Conclusions Conclusions Conclusions Conclusions Conclusions We have shown that there are a great many complexities that have to be taken into account in the design of pro-poor macroeconomic policies.

Expenditure switching in favour of social sectors at the expenses of vital economic sectors may have medium and long-term adverse implications for the poor. However, fiscal buoyancy may make such difficult choices unnecessary. Monetary Policy Avoid extremes of conservatism and expansionism in monetary policy, neither prioritising extremely low inflation nor permitting hyperinflation Seek consistency between monetary and fiscal policy through appropriate coordination between government monetary and fiscal institutions, including the central bank Develop directed credit programmes for employment-intensive SMEs, agriculture and rural industries, even when overall credit growth needs to be restrained, to avoid adverse impacts on employment. Central banks should have instrument autonomy subject to their pursuit of the overall economic objectives dictated by the poverty reduction strategy of the government. Exchange Rate Policy The choice of what exchange rate system to adopt depends on a country\u2019s characteristics: a country that has been characterised by high inflation and 37 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy macroeconomic instability may adopt the absolute fixed exchange rate, for a period of time. In the slong term, follow an intermediate exchange rate regime, one that combines some control over exchange rates with monetary independence and some control over capital flows. The pursuit of nominal stability does not end up bringing about excessive real exchange rate appreciation. A country should be able to switch approaches in times of crisis: when there is a negative shock or when a boom ends, a country should be able to adjust its exchange rate downwards\u2014the \u2018real target\u2019 approach. International Trade and Investment Policy Trade liberalisation is associated with increased trade volumes (ratios of trade to GDP), but its relations both to long-term growth and to poverty reduction are not well established. There is some evidence in all the case study countries that the linkages between export sectors and the rest of the economy are such that the poverty-reducing effects of export growth may be limited. Export promotion and import liberalisation are distinct policies with distinct consequences for aggregate income and distribution. Successful growth-enhancing and poverty-reducing efforts at export promotion appear historically to have been accompanied by a range of complementary policies, including import substitution policies in particular areas, selective fiscal incentives, preferential access to credit, and a government role in coordinating private actors. Export-orientation may or may not be enhanced by trade liberalisation. There is no single path to external sector reforms. Each country must develop its own path depending on resource endowments and constraints. It is particularly important that trade liberalisation must be coordinated with other macro reforms, especially industrial and exchange rate policies. Privatisation Policy The evidence in the case studies does not appear to show that the outcomes of privatisation have been unambiguously positive. Asset concentration took place in some governments after privatisation. Privatisation of rural assets appears to have led to the collapse of rural markets in Mongolia as markets failed spontaneously to emerge to fulfill the functions previously undertaken by the government, as had been hoped for by supporters of the privatisation. 38 Evidence on enterprise performance drawn from literature outside the case study countries is mixed. It appears that this may often over-emphasise the revenue- generation effects of privatisation and the potential to use this revenue for social purposes. SOEs in developing countries play a significant role in the creation and deepening of formal labour markets and in setting decent labour standards. Privatisation can undermine this role in some instances, as well as lead directly to layoffs and subsequent casualisation. However, no blanket statement is possible concerning the effects of privatisation in this regard, as the role of SOEs in establishing and sustaining labour market norms has varied across countries.36 Financial Sector Liberalisation Studies of the 1997 Asian financial crisis show that many years of poverty reduction through economic growth were reversed in just a few months. Although the Asian crisis was caused primarily by volatility in national capital accounts due to international investment flows, as opposed to failures of domestic banks, it dramatised what the abrupt constriction of credit can", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "689811b5-c733-4ce4-81d9-681d7bdaf568": {"__data__": {"id_": "689811b5-c733-4ce4-81d9-681d7bdaf568", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy: Lessons from the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0b5e14baa1b1fcf73bb28b4912db721cf94d581fac51f07bed7f6708c71af9c"}, "3": {"node_id": "754b1723-195e-480e-b0f8-a1d52dfe2e6b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b65b866115014b38064948236ca5a7c29d17589255db12c0d792dce4ab277ed"}}, "hash": "57eec8a440d725946e949497a7b305da2723459d44beae2ad2a0ac366870ca5e", "text": "do to economic growth. Many firms were forced to close, increasing both unemployment and poverty. The case studies show that reforms associated with liberalisation can cause a contraction in credit provision to \u2018priority\u2019 sectors and a rise in real interest rates paid in these sectors. A simultaneous move away from directed credit and differential interest rates may bring about recession in specific sectors (for instance, the agricultural sector) which had previously benefited from directed credit, even if such an outcome does not result in the aggregate economy. Directed credit\u2014either through state-owned institutions or through regulation of privately-owned institutions\u2014can be beneficial to retain. Subsidised credit can combine the task of promoting productive investment with that of improving asset and income distribution and generating employment in semi-urban and rural areas and have a notable impact on poverty. Arguably, the best insurance against failure in the financial sector is that liberalisation is gradual and carefully sequenced so as to permit the development of government expertise in regulation. More than other sectors, financial markets are vulnerable to panics and crashes, and require the development of adequate financial knowledge, on the part of regulators and market actors generally, without which liberalisation can lead to fragility of financial institutions or of the financial system as a whole. 39 Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy Overarching Lessons Public investment plays a crucial role in sustaining a high level of growth and ensuring that its benefits are widely distributed. It can be inappropriate to emphasise fiscal balance over the provision of \u201cdevelopmental stimulus\u201d, especially when fiscal deficits are maintained in a range that is low to moderate and are used to finance development promoting investment. The attainment of extremely low inflation should not be a goal in itself. Central banks must take into account the governments\u2019 overall economic objectives, including those related to employment and growth, in establishing monetary targets. Complete convertibility of the capital account is frequently inadvisable for developing countries, because of their relatively small size in the world economy, and the propensity of financial markets to \u201cmanias, crashes and panics\u201d. The adverse impact of events such as speculative attacks on exchange rates and internationally \u201ccontagious\u201d asset price deflation episodes can be limited if a degree of non-convertibility is maintained. Export promotion may not always be enhanced by trade (especially import) liberalisation. it can be valuable to maintain \u201cpolicy space\u201d for commercial policy to be employed in pursuit of developmental objectives, although such measures must be employed with care. Moreover, complementary policies which enhance the capabilities of firms and workers in a broad-based manner are essential if export oriented policies are to be successful in promoting growth and to have a pro-poor character. Privatisation is best undertaken with care, taking note of potential adverse consequences. It must be prepared for adequately with appropriate sequencing and the implementation of suitable complementary policies. Effective poverty reduction can require that government maintain a direct or indirect role in the provision of credit to social priority sectors For reforms to have a pro-poor dimension, the government must strengthen its capabilities in new areas, developing tax regimes, social safety nets, and measures to promote labour standards. Agriculture requires special consideration in macroeconomic and trade policy design, in recognition of its role as a source of livelihood It can be hoped that the absorption of such lessons by policymakers in the region and their context-specific application will make for more effective policies that serve the interests of the masses of people, most especially the poorest. 40 Bibliography Bibliography Bibliography Bibliography Bibliography Country Case studies on the Macroeconomics of Poverty Reduction (Half of the studies are published and the remaining half of them in typescript; they are arranged in alphabetic order of the country name).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "754b1723-195e-480e-b0f8-a1d52dfe2e6b": {"__data__": {"id_": "754b1723-195e-480e-b0f8-a1d52dfe2e6b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pro-Poor Macroeconomic Policy: Lessons from the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0b5e14baa1b1fcf73bb28b4912db721cf94d581fac51f07bed7f6708c71af9c"}, "2": {"node_id": "689811b5-c733-4ce4-81d9-681d7bdaf568", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pro-poor-macroeconomic-policy-lessons-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57eec8a440d725946e949497a7b305da2723459d44beae2ad2a0ac366870ca5e"}}, "hash": "6b65b866115014b38064948236ca5a7c29d17589255db12c0d792dce4ab277ed", "text": "Country Year Authors Bangladesh 2004 S.

Housing Asia-Pacific\u2019s Urban Poor Asia-Pacific is predominantly rural, yet it is one of the most rapidly urbanizing regions in the world. Its urban population is predicted to nearly double to 3.4 billion by 2050. Every day for the coming decade cities in Asia and the Pacific will need to accommodate 120,000 new residents, placing additional pressure on providing affordable land and housing.1 Meeting this demand will therefore be an essential element in ensuring inclusive and sustainable urbanization. Parallel to rapid urbanization, an equally momentous challenge is the growing inequality in urban areas that is reflected in the growth of an already sizeable proportion of the population living in slums. Security of tenure is also recognized as a critical component for successful integration of such settlements into the fabric of urban life as well as facilitating improvements in service delivery. This in turn would present various solutions to address the issue of affordable housing and urban service delivery whilst guaranteeing the right to adequate shelter. At present, however, urban housing in cities across the region is in a state of crisis. This is reflected in the growth of slums \u2013 urban areas characterised by one or more shelter deprivations, including a lack of durable housing, sufficient living space, clean water, access to adequate sanitation and security of tenure. Slum settlements have become the visible face of urban poverty in the region. In the absence of public and private sector initiatives to provide affordable and secure housing for the urban poor as well as commercial bank loans to stimulate affordable housing enterprises, slum living has become an unavoidable reality and so has the threat of slum eviction. Lack of land tenure security remains a major constraint on poverty reduction. Access to land is an 1 UN-HABITAT. 2011. Affordable Land and Housing in Asia. Nairobi: UN-HABITAT. 1 Key Messages \u2022\ufffd Effective land planning and management are fundamental to reducing climate risks. Vulnerability assessments and clear long-term strategies help to ensure that negative social and environmental impacts on communities are minimized. \u2022\ufffd Tenure security is an essential element in building community resilience and addressing urban inequalities. If both women and men-headed households enjoy secure land and housing, they are more likely to plan ahead and invest in resilience measures. \u2022\ufffd Adapting existing housing to current and future climate threats is usually simpler and more effective than relocating communities.

Aside from being a basis for shelter and access to services, secure land rights can act as a safety net in times of hardship and provide financial security. As much as half of the world\u2019s slum population, more than 505 million people, are based in the Asia-Pacific. This amounts to one third of households in the region as a whole, ranging from 24 per cent in Pacific to 35 per cent in Southern Asia, and is in large part due to a lack of affordable and well located housing alternatives2. The absence of land rights also undermines the poor\u2019s access to safe and secure housing, placing them at constant risk of eviction or displacement as a result of redevelopment. As a result, the urban poor face significant difficulties in both access and affordability, their financial constraints compounded by institutional exclusion. Addressing landlessness and secure property rights among the poor is critical to build resilient cities as well as reduce urban inequalities. These inequalities often retard economic development, perpetuate poverty and fuel social tensions. The region\u2019s housing problems are exacerbated by increasing environmental variability. Across Asia and the Pacific, natural disasters and other climate change related impacts are damaging the homes of the urban poor: flooding, extreme heat, tropical cyclones, storm surges, landslides, sea-level rise and coastal erosion, all have a significant negative impact on housing. At the same time, residential and commercial construction for more affluent urban residents consumes vast amounts of energy, and is one of the fastest growing emitters of greenhouse gases in Asia and the Pacific. In light of these challenges, how can local governments and residents adapt their housing to a changing climate? II. Housing Challenges for the Urban Poor Land management is the first step to be taken before any housing construction.

In addition, it leads to increased social tensions in cities3, reinforcing economic and class divisions through spatial segregation. The inaccessibility to decent housing, insecurity of tenure and unaffordable land are major contributing factors to the prevalence of slums and urban poverty in Asia-Pacific cities. A number of intersecting issues must therefore be tackled to ensure better housing options for urban populations: \u2022\ufffd Limited affordability: land and housing prices in many cities have soared as a result of rapid population growth, unchecked speculation and inadequate or inequitable urban planning. Furthermore, the rise in land cost has not been accompanied by a proportionate rise in income for the majority of the urban population, especially the poor. This is compounded by their lack of access to formal housing credit and loans. \u2022\ufffd Non-existent land rights: many urban households, particularly in slums and informal settlements, lack security of tenure. Besides putting them at risk of eviction, this also undermines the ability of the poor to make long term investments in their homes 2 UN-HABITAT. 2010. The State of Asian Cities 2010/11.

Nairobi: UN- HABITAT. 2 and businesses, including resilience measures such as upgrading. Land rights should therefore be a priority focus area for any land or housing development programme. \u2022\ufffd Slum evictions bring to light many urban paradoxes: Despite an acute housing shortage and with a declining trend in house ownership in urban areas, slums are being demolished without the provision of alternative shelter for their inhabitants. The reality is that forced eviction without relocation simply shifts poor people from one slum to another or leads to the development of other slums, depleting valuable housing stocks and land. Despite the number of slum evictions the number of slums continues to increase. \u2022\ufffd Negative impacts from urban development policies: low income or households may face increased difficulties in accessing land and housing as a result of negative urban policies, such as forced evictions. \u2022\ufffd Environmental instability: natural hazards such as flooding can damage or displace urban communities, particularly in under-resourced and environmentally vulnerable areas. \u2022\ufffd Weak or ineffective land planning and management: the absence of land use and building regulations in many Asia-Pacific cities, or their lack of implementation and enforcement, can lead to inappropriate development in environmentally sensitive areas and substandard, high-risk housing that is more susceptible to damage due to extreme weather events and other climate related issues. By tackling land tenure and management issues in an inclusive, rights-based and gender- responsive manner, a city can begin to plan its development and invest in strategies that reduce vulnerability to the negative effects of climate change. Effectively planned land use is essential for the housing sector, people\u2019s livelihoods, transport, commercial and industrial development, ecosystem management, food and water supplies. There are many ways local governments can positively influence land tenure and management to promote resilient housing. These include: Tacloban, the Philippines \u00a9 Ilija Gubic 3 \u2022\ufffd Provision of innovative forms of tenure security, such as community land banks, long term leases and usufruct agreements, to provide poor urban settlements with secure, affordable and socially acceptable housing arrangements. These arrangements may involve multiple actors, including landlords, negotiating an acceptable shared solution that provides residents with more assured tenancy or ownership. \u2022\ufffd Capacity development and engagement of non-state actors in dialogues and project design, resulting in pro-poor, and responsive land and housing policies and programmes. Strengthening participation at every stage of the process will result in more socially appropriate solutions, as well as boost local ownership. Cooperation between different stakeholders, such as public-private partnerships, can also produce positive results if well managed. \u2022\ufffd Zoning laws/regulations and land use plans, ensuring housing is built in less exposed areas and that the housing areas of the urban poor are included in land use plans. Otherwise, informal development will continue.

Energy and water saving technologies may also require an upfront investment that most poor urban households cannot afford without subsidy support. Preparedness and reliable data on climate risk and environmental instability is also a prerequisite for effective land and housing development. Gathering information to understand the current situation through a Vulnerability Assessment is essential before implementing any of the above options. To be effective, a Vulnerability Assessment should be a participatory process of selected stakeholders, which builds the capacity of citizens to address their city\u2019s vulnerability to different climate change scenarios and develop appropriate adaptation strategies.4 4 UN-HABITAT. 2010. Participatory Climate Change Assessments \u2013 A Toolkit based on the Experience of Sorsogon City, Philippines. Nairobi: UN-HABITAT; See another good example, UN-HABITAT, UNDP and UNEP. 2014. Makassar Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment. Fukuoka: UN-HABITAT. 4 Upgrading and adaption may involve significant costs, however, that governments in developing countries may struggle to meet. Formalization of land tenure, while improving the situation of poor residents, may also have the added benefit of expanding the municipal tax base and providing authorities with additional resources to invest in community resilience. Other options include low interest loans that enable the recuperation of some or all of the initial costs in the medium term, while providing communities with a sustainable funding source to upgrade their settlements. The Kirtipur Housing Project \u2013 Promoting Better Housing Options for Poor Communities in Kathmandu The Kirtipur Housing Project in Kathmandu, Nepal is an example of a pro-poor housing strategy that combines environmentally friendly construction and disaster resilient design with effective land planning and affordable financing mechanisms. This innovative programme was designed by Lumanti, a local NGO that specializes in urban shelter, to achieve sustainable housing solutions for squatter communities who were to be displaced after residing for 50 years on the site of the Vishnumati Link Road Project in Kathmandu5. Besides adopting eco-friendly materials, the buildings are also earthquake resistant and economical due to the use of low cost architectural elements such as exposed brick walls, steel stairs and galvanized iron roofs. Most important, however, is the efficient spatial planning of the settlement into a row housing system. To support the development, the government has provided subsidized land \u2013 an essential element, as the 44 rehabilitated families could not have afforded the housing themselves without upfront financial assistance. The families have also been provided with an interest-free loan which the community has to pay back within a period of 15 years. As a result, the project has been able to deliver positive housing solutions to the poor that are both socially acceptable for communities and economically viable for local authorities too6. 5 6 III. Working with Communities for Resilient Urban Settlements Communities should always be actively involved in housing and resilience development programmes. Given the many challenges and constraints they face, the urban poor often lack the time or resources to plan and invest in long-term strategies. However, simple measures to improve the resilience of their houses at little or no additional cost, such as building above the flood level in low-lying areas, are usually welcomed. As the informal settlements of most slum dwellers do not have security of tenure, and may as a result be susceptible to forced evictions or resettlement, land regularization is also an essential element in strengthening community preparedness. Zoning plans and controls, as well as gender-responsive and innovative forms of land tenure, can be used to formalize slum settlements as a first step to improving their resilience.

For instance, organizing women in communities as first responders can help boost long-term recovery and sustainability. One example is the use of skilled female masons in reconstruction efforts in Phuket, Thailand, in the wake of the 2004 tsunami7. Before upgrading a settlement, however, local governments must first understand the current and future vulnerability of the location, housing and community. Once the decision to upgrade has been made, in consultation with local residents, a range of potential options are available, depending on the local context: Bangkok, Thailand \u00a9 Ilija Gubic \u2022\ufffd Determine if particular areas or households are more vulnerable than others. Following consultation, those living in dangerous places can be relocated without moving out of the community, and the spaces they leave can be used for other purposes, such as creating community food gardens or emergency access routes. \u2022\ufffd Introduce a gradual strategy of tenure security improvement. This should, through inclusive community participation and gender sensitive consultation, promote rights-based access to land and flexible forms of tenure security to ensure that the specific needs and interests of men, women and children are taken into account. \u2022\ufffd Introduce or enhance regulatory building codes. Besides promoting the use of locally produced, recycled and other low-energy construction materials, building guidelines can stipulate the provision of proper guttering and drainage, water harvesting, embankments, landscaping, planning around natural features such as rivers, energy efficient building design and other disaster resilience measures such as earthquake resistance, including traditional techniques that may potentially be more suitable for the poor. Regulatory building codes need to be adapted to low-income housing, as poor households will not follow building codes that they cannot afford. Where appropriate, subsidies to support implementation of these measures should be considered. \u2022\ufffd Consider a system of both mandatory and voluntary codes. Mandatory building regulations must be set by a local or national government, but NGOs can work with voluntary codes which may be more appropriate for low-cost housing projects. 7 UN-HABITAT, UNESCAP. 2008. Housing the Poor in Asian Cities: Low-Income Housing: Approaches to Help the Urban Poor Find Adequate Accommodation. Nairobi: UN-HABITAT, Bangkok: UNESCAP. 6 Enforcing building regulations usually falls under the remit of local government, so an adequate inspection system with the capacity for fines and incentives needs to accompany these building codes to ensure uptake. \u2022\ufffd Support accessible and community managed credit access, loans and subsidies for poor urban households. Financing a housing upgrade will often be out of reach for individual households. Local governments can work collaboratively with communities, NGOs and the private sector to access financing, for example through community financing groups, government grants or short-term loans. These approaches prioritize on-site strategies such as upgrading and capacity development to improve the resilience of urban areas, without damaging or disrupting the significant social and economic capital that is invested in local communities, including slums and informal settlements. Adapting current housing to respond to the impacts of climate change, besides usually being cheaper and easier than relocating a community elsewhere, also allows residents to participate in strengthening their existing capacity and resources rather than undergo the upheaval of rebuilding their lives in a new setting. Wherever possible, these measures should be preferred over relocation. If, however, relocation is the only feasible option for safety reasons, local residents must first be consulted, compensated and informed well in advance, in line with the principles of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC). Forced evictions should always be avoided8. Following extensive consultation, an optional living site needs to be appointed that is socially as well as environmentally sustainable: relocating people in faraway locations without connections to infrastructure, services and employment is not acceptable.

Launched in January 2003, the programme is directed by a government body, the Community Organizations Development Institute (CODI), to provide public investment directly to poor communities to manage and execute upgrading to their housing, environment, basic services and tenure security themselves. Residents partner with other actors, including local authorities, academics and civil society groups, to assess all the settlements in their cities. Now in its tenth year, upgrading projects have been completed or are underway in a total of 286 towns and cities across the country, providing secure housing to around 54,000 households9. IV. Towards Equitable Housing and Tenure Security for Climate Resilience Climate change resilience for local communities combines technical, economic, social and environmental considerations. Land and housing development therefore requires a complex range of prescriptions if the urban poor are to enjoy safe and secure shelter, now and in the future. Moving forward, then, cities need to develop flexible and adaptive approaches to meet the needs of different communities, with an emphasis not only on environmental improvements but also livelihoods, social capital, affordability, access and most important of all, the rights and wishes of those affected. Reliable information and data collection is a vital element in this, but should be supported by community participation and multi-stakeholder partnerships to ensure, at the next step, that upgrading programmes are designed and implemented effectively. Ultimately, resilience can be supported, enhanced and subsidized by governments and other groups but it cannot be imposed on residents without their consent. To be sustainable, the communities themselves must own programmes. From affordable credit and tenure security to better building codes and smarter urban design, land and housing policies can only succeed if poor households willingly adopt them. It is hoped that this Issue Brief can be used by decision-makers and communities throughout Asia and the Pacific to adopt pro-poor funding mechanisms, environmentally sensitive building codes, innovative tenure arrangements and other measures to improve the accessibility and affordability of housing for the urban poor in a changing climate. 9 UN-HABITAT. 2010. The State of Asian Cities 2010/11. Fukuoka: UN-HABITAT. 8 Gopalganj Housing Model \u2013 A Way Forward for Community- driven Pro-poor Urban Housing. The construction of disaster resilient resettlement housing for the households evicted from the Gopalganj Town in Bangladesh was a fine example of a collaborative housing project of Gopalganj Municipality, Urban Partnership for Poverty Reduction(UPPR), Comprehensive Disaster Management Project (CDMP) II, Asian Coalition for Housing Rights (ACHR), Asian Coalition for Community Action (ACCA) and local communities. The aim of the project was to use a collaborative effort to ensure sustainable resettlement in a disaster resilient housing complex through a participatory approach and to respond to the habitat needs of the urban poor following their eviction, an event that affected the lives of almost two thousand people. The houses in which many had lived for all of their lives had been reduced to rubble and the livelihoods of many in the community had been lost. But UPPR turned an adverse situation into an opportunity and led the way towards a sustainable solution. At the local level, UPPR\u2019s mobilization efforts resulted in other slum communities assisting their evicted neighbors, and slum leaders successfully lobbying the local authorities to provide rapid, short- and long-term relief.

Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues Rupa Chanda Rupa Chanda is a Professor of Economics at IIM Bangalore. She holds a doctorate in Economics from Columbia University. She has published extensively on in the area of services trade and migration. Her books include, Globalization of Services: India\u2019s Opportunities and Constraints and Integrating Services in South Asia: Trade, Investment, Mobility. She is a member of several committees on services of the Government of India POVERTY REDUCTION United Nations Development Programme The services sector has been a key driver of economic growth in South Asia since 1990 and accounts for nearly 50 percent of the region\u2019s gross domestic product. The sector contributes significantly to output, employment, trade and investment flows across countries in the region. Recognizing the need to leverage the dynamism of the services sector to reinvigorate regional cooperation efforts in South Asia, the South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) Ministerial Council directed the drafting of a SAARC Agreement on Trade in Services (SATIS). The SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) took effect only in December 1995 and was replaced by the SAFTA in January 2006.The Declaration of the 14th SAARC Summit in 2008 called upon member countries to work towards an early conclusion of a SATIS. It also highlighted the need for regional cooperation on a variety of policy issues to complement efforts at promoting integration of services in the region. This report argues that there are good reasons to include services under SAFTA, not least because of the potential all round gains that the sector could bring to the member countries. As a result of the performance of and policy trends relating to services in South Asia over the past decade or so, conditions are more conducive to reaching a regional agreement on services, perhaps even more so than on goods. The single most important condition is the dynamism of this sector and its growing contribution to overall economic activity. The recent focus on services by countries in the region is reflected in their common goal of upgrading their services infrastructure. They have also identified the sector as a key driver for trade and investment liberalization and for regulatory reforms, thereby further enhancing its potential. This convergence of interests and approaches possibly contributes to a greater willingness to negotiate regional liberalization and intraregional collaboration in services. Geographic proximity as well as cultural and linguistic ties among the South Asian countries constitute an added reason, considering how relationship-based marketing, social networks and cross-border movements of service providers play an important role in driving services-related trade and investment flows. In recent years, some South Asian countries have entered into extraregional economic cooperation, trade and investment agreements or other partnership agreements that extend beyond goods and services. This underscores the growing recognition of the importance of services to these economies and of the potential offered by more broad-based regional and bilateral arrangements to boost their services sectors. Foreword The report pulls together national and regional information on services, at the aggregate level and in individual service sectors, to obtain a consolidated picture of recent trends in liberalization in South Asia wherever data was available. These trends are expected to have a significant bearing on regional integration, growth and development objectives in the region. The larger objective is to provide an evidence-based analysis for the ongoing services negotiations and for providing concrete policy options to further a more inclusive process of regional integration across the region.

The rate of growth of this sector has consistently outperformed that of gross domestic product (GDP). Its share in the region\u2019s GDP increased from 36 percent to nearly 50 percent over the 1980- 2006 period. The regional picture also holds at the individual country level. However, the data reveal that the level of employment in services has not been commensurate with the sector\u2019s contribution to output and overall growth. This could undermine national efforts to realize some of the Millennium Development Goals relating to poverty alleviation and human development. Subsectoral trends reflect the importance of a variety of factors in shaping the performance of services in South Asia. These include deregulation and policy reforms in areas such as telecommunications and financial services, the role of rising incomes and domestic demand in driving growth in segments such as trade and distribution services, and a lack of diversification in the smaller economies. Non-commercial services, such as public adminis-tration, government services, and community, social and personal services, contribute significantly to services growth in some countries of the region. Trade data indicate not only an increase in intraregional trade in services, but also the growing participation of South Asia in world trade in services. This reflects the region\u2019s growing competitiveness and thus the sector\u2019s considerable trade potential. However, there are considerable asymmetries within the region in terms of magnitude, pattern, growth and potential, and the regional trends are in large part driven by India\u2019s performance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "522c5bd6-a1d1-4077-abb9-996a4a18c106": {"__data__": {"id_": "522c5bd6-a1d1-4077-abb9-996a4a18c106", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb21213278f5c87d8969caee0558ead94d41f2f02443a4050d528cd072c5dee7"}, "2": {"node_id": "7bb23d1c-fa66-4617-be80-dcdb1a9dee88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9dc71333f47b064198608c734b83cc44dcb6f2f79824e6f04dcae52713c3ec7c"}}, "hash": "81cc897bbe416dda07ae9c3e9c975dce694fbc5a64f0936fadb5e3a3c8dd7191", "text": "All four modes of service delivery under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) could help further regional integration of the sector.

It also reveals that any attempts at regional integration of services would involve asymmetries in trade potential and interests, and that the dominant player, India, would need to play an important role in driving the intraregional integration process forward. The report discusses only four services, but there may well be other services of potential interest in the South Asian context. This deliberate narrowing of scope is driven by the broader objective of providing an in-depth and detailed account of the kinds of issues and concerns associated with a representative set of services which cut across different service clusters, namely infrastructural, commercial and social services, rather than trying to provide a wide ranging but cursory account of all possible services that may be of interest in the South Asian context. 2 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Telecommunication services Telecommunication services show particular promise for regional integration for a number of reasons, including their high growth rates and rising contribution to GDP, the opening up of the sector to foreign ownership in several of the South Asian countries, the potential for pooling of resources for investment and regulatory capacity-building, and the common goal of all the countries in this region to augment investment in telecoms infrastructure and establish regulatory frameworks in order to improve efficiency, affordability and access. Such commonalities of policy trends and objectives, combined with large resource gaps and investment requirements, create scope for both collaborative and commercial relations in telecom services within the region. The chapter describes the various intergovernmental and industry initiatives in telecom services within South Asia. It focuses on issues such as enhancing regional connectivity, promoting information-sharing and human resource development, establishing community information centres, strengthening and harmonizing regulations and standards, and developing common software tools to enhance content availability on the Internet. However, progress in addressing these issues has been limited due to institutional and regulatory challenges. In particular, integration is constrained by a lack of institutional transparency, anti-competitive practices, a tendency to prefer incumbents, lack of independence of the telecom regulatory authorities, political interference and lobbying by incumbents, regulatory uncertainties, policy gaps arising from differences between policies on paper and those in practice, the continued monopoly of certain segments, problems of infrastructure \u2013 in particular spectrum allocation \u2013 and high surcharges and levies on telecom operators due to some countries\u2019 strong dependence on this sector for revenues. Some steps are outlined for promoting regional integration in telecom services. These include accelerating discussions on regulatory cooperation and implementing specific initiatives such as the harmonization of mobile numbers for number portability in the region, reducing intraregional call rates \u2013 which could bring wider benefits to many other sectors \u2013 and improving the investment climate, as well as streamlining investment approval and clearance procedures within the region in general in order to encourage more intraregional investments in this sector. Energy services The growth in demand for energy has consistently outpaced growth of production, making energy security and improved competitiveness and efficiency in this sector a priority for all governments in the region. In the past decade or more, almost all the South Asian countries have embarked on reforms of their power sector, including liberalization and promotion of private participation and foreign investment for the development of energy infrastructure, renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies, expanding the use of indigenous resources, diversifying energy supply sources, and establishment of regulatory frameworks. However, more reforms are needed to overcome poor governance, inefficiencies, lack of transparency and accountability, anti-competitive cross-subsidization policies, reversals of tariff reductions, and populist resistance to pro-competitive and commercially justified measures. Given the strategic and sensitive nature of energy services, none of the South Asian countries that are members of the WTO have scheduled this sector under GATS, reflecting their unwillingness and unpreparedness to conduct Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 3 negotiations and undertake commitments with regard to this sector multilaterally, despite undertaking reforms unilaterally. The chapter outlines various intergovernmental and private sector initiatives in this sector, including under South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), including bilateral projects to promote trade in hydropower and electricity, subregional programmes supported by various multilateral and bilateral development agencies, and discussions on pipelines and trade in natural gas. However, a variety of political, institutional, infrastructural and geographic factors have made it difficult to harmonize regulations, agree on common policies and standards, and develop trading mechanisms for the sector. Thus, despite complementarities in energy resource endowments", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d253e9fe-ba1a-457e-be46-98ed3e028642": {"__data__": {"id_": "d253e9fe-ba1a-457e-be46-98ed3e028642", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "def4bd3f851b3fb15feade1c9b455c2dc5e3d21e6b94b6285c6ed1baa4453490"}}, "hash": "def4bd3f851b3fb15feade1c9b455c2dc5e3d21e6b94b6285c6ed1baa4453490", "text": "and consumption needs, the potential for regional energy cooperation remains largely unexploited. Several proposals are made for deepening regional integration of the energy sector, including the setting up of an apex regional body consisting of State-owned enterprises and leading private sector companies engaged in energy exploration, production and sales in the region, promoting dialogue among energy companies, undertaking joint initiatives to develop a common understanding of energy-related issues and to bring together the technical knowledge and expertise available in the region, and the adoption of a regional energy charter to facilitate regional harmonization of energy policies. The chapter also suggests the need for a broad-based regional forum comprising a wide range of stakeholders, given the cross-cutting nature of issues associated with energy development and trade. The \u201cenergy ring\u201d concept and a phased approach to integration are proposed, first by trading in spare capacity, then undertaking short- and long-term power exchange, followed by joint construction of power stations and associated plurilateral trade in power. The importance of supporting reforms at the national level to make the investment climate more conducive to attracting and retaining private investors is also stressed. Tourism services South Asia accounts for a negligible share of international tourist arrivals and receipts, though its popularity as a tourist destination is growing. In recent years, government policies have aimed at promoting the sector by relieving infrastructure and transport-related bottlenecks, while also ensuring environmental protection and cultural promotion. However, there are differences of approach and objectives, as well as in the models of tourism development. Tourism is among the most liberalized services in South Asia. Private participation by foreign and domestic investors is permitted in all the countries, though the extent of entry and associated conditions vary. Almost all the countries have scheduled this sector under GATS, although these commitments tend to be less liberal than their existing policies. Given the region\u2019s focus on infrastructure development and investment in the tourism sector, the relatively liberal policy environment and the commonalities across the countries in terms of language, culture, history, religion and geography, tourism is perhaps one of the most promising areas for regional integration in South Asia. An area of interest in SAARC since the 1980s, it has been identified as a priority sector for intergovernmental cooperation and deeper regional integration. In addition, the private sector in some of the South Asian countries has evinced considerable interest in investing in this sector, particularly in the hotels segment. However, little progress has been 4 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia made and the potential for regional tourism remains largely unrealized. This is because key challenges, such as improving air connectivity, streamlining visa formalities and identification of specific joint tourism promotion projects, have received little attention at the regional level. The chapter proposes some steps for fostering regional cooperation in tourism. These include lowering travel costs between the countries; improving transport connectivity, especially air links; improving visa procedures and provisions for intraregional travel; streamlining the tax structure in the tourism industry; joint marketing and development of tourism projects around selected themes such as religion, heritage, nature and geography; and sharing of best practices within the region. The need to undertake initiatives at the subregional level is also highlighted. Health services The South Asian countries, for the most part, fare very poorly on key human development indicators. They are among the lowest ranked countries in terms of availability of physical and social infrastructure in the health sector and also in terms of basic health indicators such as mortality rates. The poor health indicators are in part a reflection of the low priority given to health care by most of the governments of the region. Nonetheless, fairly liberal health policies have resulted in the growth of private players in health-care delivery and private sector participation through cross-border investments, particularly in the hospitals segment. This segment has been opened to 100 percent foreign participation in most of the countries, and the operating terms and conditions are also very liberal. GATS commitments in this sector are limited mainly to hospital services, and they are conditional on meeting various social and other obligations. Thus there are considerable opportunities for commercial ventures and collaboration in health care \u2013 a potential well recognized by SAARC. The SAARC Social Charter contains various provisions pertaining to health-related objectives, and it calls for sharing information and capacity-building and for a coordinated approach to health-related issues. However, a variety of infrastructural, human resource, regulatory, perception-related, logistical and cultural barriers continue to hinder the full realization of these intraregional opportunities.

It recommends facilitating cross-border investments, particularly in hospitals and, potentially, in telemedicine centres; facilitating regional mobility of patients; instituting mechanisms to make the region more attractive as a destination for medical tourism, both within and beyond the region; and initiating joint efforts in research, training and capacity- building through institutional tie-ups. It also suggests the need for intergovernmental dialogue for capacity-building, joint research and development (R&D), promotion of information and communications technologies (ICTs) for health, and regulatory cooperation with regard to mutual recognition of qualifications, standards and accreditation of medical establishments. Key findings from the sector analyses The analyses of trends, intraregional initiatives and constraints in the services sector reflected in this report indicate that the potential for gains from the integration of services in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 5 arises from an interesting mix of asymmetries, complementarities and commonalities across the countries. Asymmetries and complementarities in size, levels of development, technical and institutional capacities, private sector enterprises, and financial and human resources create scope for resource flows between the different countries to leverage these differences or to address existing gaps. At the same time, common objectives and interests arising from infrastructural, income and regulatory conditions in the countries create scope for cooperation and for increased trade and investment ties in various services to address the common goals of physical and social infrastructural development, employment creation, universal service provision, equity and poverty alleviation. However, the sector analyses also reveal that there has been virtually no progress in regional integration of services so far. Very few concrete programmes and projects have been undertaken. Cooperation has been limited mainly to bilateral arrangements, which have been narrow in scope and piecemeal in nature. Private sector initiatives have made comparatively more progress, especially in the less-regulated service activities, but even in these the extent of engagement has been limited. Nor have there been any significant governmental efforts to create a climate that is conducive to regional investment and trade flows. The report identifies four mutually interdependent factors that influence the degree and pace of integration of services in South Asia: infrastructure gaps; the presence of a dynamic private sector; social, cultural and historical ties; and the institutional and human resource requirements of different countries in the region. It suggests that regional integration of health services could be best affected by greater mobility of production factors in the form of financial and human resource flows and the mobility of consumption factors in the form of consumer flows, along with greater intraregional investment. Approach to regional integration of services and negotiating strategies This report recommends a phased approach to integrating services in South Asia and a clear time table for deliverables over the medium and long terms. Certain services that involve fewer sensitivities or complex regulatory issues could be fast tracked and pilot projects initiated. To boost intraregional investments, the report recommends a focus on administrative and procedural reforms, such as faster clearance and approval procedures, fast-track clearance for priority services and greater trans-parency of investment regulations. It also recommends the adoption of a regional investment treaty and a multilateral tax treaty, supported by national efforts to improve the overall business environment. In the context of intraregional mobility of persons, the report stresses the need to streamline visa procedures and requirements for select categories of persons within the region, such as investors in key services and special categories of service consumers and providers. Also needed are institutional and regulatory cooperation in specific services and on wider issues of investment, standards and mutual recognition. Equally important are regional discussions among a wide range of stakeholders to share information, exchange best practices, collect data, conduct joint feasibility and impact analysis studies, identify priority areas, develop soft skills and create regional templates for investment and immigration-related initiatives. 6 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Regarding negotiating modalities, the report recommends that countries proceed with negotiations as long as there is a minimum core group of three or more member countries that are willing to discuss a sector or issue. The initial group of participants could then expand gradually, drawing on existing bilateral and plurilateral agreements. Likewise, there should be a progressive approach to scheduling, with initial scheduling being limited to services that have been identified as high priority or for fast track.

Political economy challenges to regional integration of services None of the measures required to further regional integration in services can be delinked from the root problem of politics. There are two fundamental problems. The first has to do with political instability and fragility that characterize many of the SAARC member countries and which constrain their ability to implement reforms and make the requisite investments in social and physical infrastructure. This in turn limits the scope and depth of any liberalization efforts undertaken in a regional services agreement and the ability to engage in cooperation and relationship-building efforts with other countries in the region. The second major problem is the structural and geopolitical asymmetry among the countries in South Asia. Although the large differences in endowments, economic size, trade baskets and strategic importance of the member countries create scope for complementarities that offer potential for trade and investment flows, they also pose challenges in terms of the distribution of the benefits from regional integration and create differences in the strategic interests of the members. Thus, any services agreement is bound to reflect these asymmetries. Intergovernmental cooperation alone will not be sufficient; parallel efforts among industry, civil society and academics through continual dialogue and institutional cooperation at various levels will also be essential for building confidence, removing distrust and developing the will to proceed with regional integration while balancing the interests of the individual member States. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 7 There has been a spurt of regional and bilateral integration efforts over the past decade and particularly since the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. According to the WTO, over 400 agreements \u2013 bilateral, intraregional and cross-regional \u2013 have been negotiated since 1995. Whether this phenomenon has been spurred by factors such as the slow pace of negotiations in the WTO or the sensitivities involved in making concessions on a most-favoured-nation (MFN) basis is debatable, as is the fact that strategizing of mutual interests is easier through regional and bilateral arrangements than through the multilateral trading system. There has also been much debate as to whether these arrangements are building blocks or stumbling blocks to multilateral trade liberalization and whether they may ultimately undermine the multilateral trading system. Whatever the causes and consequences of such arrangements, it is clear that every region in the world, and almost every country in the world, is pursuing some kind of integration arrangement with its own economic, geopolitical and strategic interests in mind. The nomenclature has grown as rapidly as the range of agreements, including preferential trade agreements (PTAs), free trade agreements (FTAs), economic cooperation agreements (ECAs), economic partnership agreements (EPAs), trade and investment agreements (TIAs) and other variants of these, suggesting that these integration schemes have widely varying scopes and objectives. Some are narrow, focusing only on trade liberalization in goods; others are very broad, ranging beyond goods to cover services, investment, mobility of persons, intellectual property rights, scientific and technological cooperation, and other areas of collaboration. The extent of liberalization under these different arrangements also varies, from very shallow to far-reaching, deep integration. 1 1 Background and motivation The member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) \u2013 Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (and more recently Afghanistan) \u2013 are no exception to these recent trends in regional integration efforts.1 Nevertheless, the process of regional cooperation in SAARC has been relatively slow. SAARC was set up in 1985 to provide a forum for regional cooperation and to foster greater social and economic development. It took a decade for the grouping to shift its focus to trade promotion as a concrete means of achieving greater regional integration, starting with the signing of the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) in April 1993 and its entry into force in December 1995. The aim of SAPTA was to pave the way for progressively deeper integration, moving from a preferential trade agreement to a free trade agreement 1 Throughout this report, South Asia and SAARC are used interchangeably, and both terms refer to the member countries of SAARC (excluding Afghanistan, which joined only in 2007, and the Islamic Republic of Iran, which some international agencies consider to be part of South Asia).

This was to be followed by a customs union, a common market and ultimately an economic union. The signing of SAFTA in January 2004 and its entry into force in January 2006 signalled the first step towards deeper integration. Its goal was to achieve a fully operational regional FTA by 2013 for the developing country members of SAARC and by 2016 for the least developed country (LDC) members. Various subsequent SAARC summits discussed the idea of a South Asian Economic Union and the establishment of regional institutions and frameworks, but to date few, if any, concrete steps have been taken to push this process forward. Many studies and experts have highlighted the failure of SAPTA, and later SAFTA, to promote greater intraregional cooperation. The share of intraregional trade in SAARC has increased only marginally, from 2.68 percent in 1990 to 4.85 percent in 2005, compared with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), where the share increased from 19 to 28 percent over the same period. SAARC\u2019s intraregional trade also compares very poorly with that of regional groupings in other parts of the world as well.2 Likewise, the limited data available on intraregional investment flows suggest that the SAARC member countries by and large are not important destinations or sources for foreign direct investment (FDI).3 Intraregional trade and investment has failed to take off despite rapid economic growth in several of the SAARC member countries over the past decade. Unilateral trade and investment liberalization undertaken by SAARC members in recent years (representing a marked shift from an earlier protectionist orientation), and, significantly, the emergence of an important regional and global player \u2013 India \u2013 within the region, which could provide the much-needed impetus to regional integration efforts. Studies on regional integration in South Asia point to a variety of factors that have hampered progress under SAARC. These include the strained bilateral political relations between India and Pakistan, security concerns, competing trade baskets, corruption, the poor state of transport and related services infrastructure and, most importantly, a lack of political will. In addition, factors specific to the architecture of the agreements under SAARC have played a role, such as the narrow coverage of the regional commitments, the limited trade interest and potential of the member countries in the products covered and the modalities of trade liberalization. Factors inherent to the region are also believed to have impeded progress, such as limited market size, lack of scale economies and similar trade structures. Thus, most studies tend to be pessimistic about the prospects for further integration through SAARC, concluding that the economic rationale for such a regional bloc is weak and that SAFTA can be beneficial only if it moves towards a fully-fledged FTA and promotes pan- Asian integration (ADB, 2008a). However, such studies, based on quantitative and qualitative analyses, suffer from one basic limitation. They analyse the existing framework and scope of SAFTA and examine only 2 Asian Development Bank, Asia Regional Integration Centre Integration Indicators Database at: http://aric. adb.org/indicator.php (accessed 17 November 2008). 3 There are exceptions, such as FDI from India to some of the smaller SAARC countries.

It could be argued that the conclusions regarding the prospects for regional cooperation may be quite different if SAFTA were to extend the terms of its ambit and if its negotiating modalities were changed. The few studies that present a positive outlook for SAFTA generally argue for widening its scope, in particular to include services and cross-cutting areas, such as investment and movement of persons, in the negotiating agenda. Successive SAARC summits have emphasized the need to implement SAFTA in letter and in spirit as a stepping stone to broader regional cooperation if progress is to be made and its full benefits realized. The 14th SAARC Summit Declaration is significant in that it specifically stated the need to integrate services into SAFTA and recognized that in order for SAFTA to realize its full potential, there had to be a collective vision for the region, embodying the free flow of goods, services and ideas. It called upon member countries to work towards an early conclusion of a SAARC Framework Agreement on Trade in Services (SAFAS). This was echoed in the subsequent 15th SAARC Summit Declaration in Colombo in August 2008, which stated, \u201cExtending SAFTA to include services would considerably broaden its scope and impact and boost competitiveness", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42790a18-3545-4b82-83c6-4240df38f35f": {"__data__": {"id_": "42790a18-3545-4b82-83c6-4240df38f35f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0dd2b3ced7d705d61bc194d4dac4b1da379c0ddd1395fd6a9f84da679e827a73"}}, "hash": "0dd2b3ced7d705d61bc194d4dac4b1da379c0ddd1395fd6a9f84da679e827a73", "text": "in key emerging sectors such as banking, communications and aviation.\u201d That Summit further highlighted the need for regional cooperation on a variety of policy issues, including domestic regulations and regulatory frameworks, data and standards, to complement efforts at promoting services integration in the region. In March 2008, the SAFTA Ministerial Council directed the drafting of a SAFAS by the end of 2009 (though its completion was delayed). In April 2010, the SAARC Agreement on Trade in Services (SATIS) was signed by all the SAARC member countries. Working groups on subregional economic cooperation have since been formed to examine issues relating to transport and tourism services and subsectors. The South Asian governments have also recommended specific areas for action, many of which have a bearing on services. These include improving mobility of persons, strength-ening communication and transport links, fostering intraregional trade and investments in the energy sector and implementing measures for trade facilitation. This extension of SAFTA to include services and investments is part of ongoing discussions to further regional cooperation, with proposals for an eventual South Asia Economic Union, though no concrete actions to this end have been taken so far. Independently of these regional efforts, the member countries have also entered into some subregional initiatives for trade liberalization. One example is the Bangladesh\u2013Bhutan\u2013 India\u2013Nepal Growth Quadrilateral Initiative (BBIN\u2013GQ) within the SAARC framework, which aims at promoting rapid economic development through identification and implementation of specific projects. Another is the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), which involves some SAARC member countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka) along with some non-members (Myanmar 10 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia and Thailand), and seeks to foster cooperation in a variety of areas.4 There are also several bilateral trade agreements between various SAARC member countries, such as the Indo- Bhutan treaty on economic cooperation, the multiple treaties between India and Nepal (covering trade, transit and unauthorized trade), the Pakistan-Sri Lanka FTA and the Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement, signed in 1998 and in effect since 2000. These agreements are more liberal and have been implemented much faster than those concluded under SAFTA.5 Overall, South Asian countries are involved in 21 bilateral arrangements, indicating that bilateral efforts are being pursued concurrently with regional efforts. These recent developments naturally raise questions about the potential role that could be filled by services in SAFTA. Is there a strong case to be made for including this sector in SAFTA? Can the expansion of SAFTA to services and investment provide the dynamism that has been lacking to date in South Asian integration? This report argues that there is a convincing case for extending SAFTA to include services due to the potential gains they offer member countries. Recent performance and policy trends in services in South Asia have made conditions conducive to a services agreement, perhaps even more so than for goods. The single most important development is the dynamism exhibited by the services sector in South Asia and its growing importance in overall economic activity, including output, employment, trade and investment flows. The sector has experienced higher growth rates than other sectors in almost all the South Asian countries and also compared with growth rates of services in other parts of Asia and in other countries with comparable levels of development. Today, services constitute close to 50 percent or more of gross domestic product (GDP) in all the South Asian economies. The Asian Development Bank (ADB, 2008b) notes that the high GDP growth rates (of 7 percent or more) in several countries in the region and the overall improvement in the region\u2019s economic performance in recent years are directly related to the growth in services. The rise of services prior to sustained industrialization has in fact been a particular feature of the region, unlike in other parts of Asia (ibid.). The greater capacity of the SAARC countries to produce and trade in certain services, the availability of high-quality services and the role of new economic geography in driving tradability of certain services, creates opportunities for complementarities in trade and investment within the region (SATIN, 2008). This potential is further enhanced by the recent focus on services as a priority sector for trade and investment liberalization and for regulatory reforms through SAARC as well as by the common goal of all the economies in this region to upgrade their services infrastructure. It indicates a certain convergence of interests and approach to the services 4 These areas are: trade and investment, technology, transport and communications, energy, tourism and fisheries. 5", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "525e0cca-aa45-4748-88cb-f093388ebd2d": {"__data__": {"id_": "525e0cca-aa45-4748-88cb-f093388ebd2d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f98481019c8bac01dfd889a7a8b9705bb0b1ceb92df600d0077fb90acdc2e55"}}, "hash": "0f98481019c8bac01dfd889a7a8b9705bb0b1ceb92df600d0077fb90acdc2e55", "text": "For instance, compared with a negative list of 1,065 and 1,183 for Sri Lanka and Pakistan, respectively, under SAFTA, under the bilateral FTA between these two countries, the negative list contains only 697 and 540 items, respectively (Weerakoon, 2008). Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 11 sector and therefore, perhaps, a greater willingness to negotiate regional liberalization and intraregional collaboration in services. There is the added benefit of geographic proximity of the SAARC countries as well as their cultural and linguistic considering how, as relationship- based marketing, social networks and cross-border movement of service providers play an important role in driving trade and investment flows in services. In recent years, some South Asian countries have concluded extraregional economic cooperation, trade and investment agreements, or other partnership agreements, that extend beyond goods to services. This further highlights the growing recognition of the importance of services to these economies. Thus, on various grounds it can be argued that there is a rationale for extending SAFTA to include services. However, there are many other issues that need to be addressed in the context of a South Asian services agreement. What should be the shape of such an agreement? Which segments and issues should be the priority areas for negotiations? What are the likely benefits to the countries involved? What challenges and sticky areas will the negotiations encounter and can they overcome them, given the political economy realities and resource and capacity constraints that characterize the region? To address such a wide range of questions, an in-depth analysis of the prospects for services integration in South Asia is clearly warranted. An understanding of these issues would not only help inform the ongoing negotiations under SAFTA but would also provide a much-needed stock-taking of the services sector in South Asia. 1 2 Outline and objectives This report draws on national and regional information on services, at the aggregate level and for individual services, to provide a consolidated picture of recent trends and liberalization in South Asia. It can thus serve as a useful factual basis for the ongoing services negotiations under SAFTA and for future academic and policy work in this region. The report has four broad objectives. First, it seeks to highlight the role and performance of services within the region at the aggregate, regional level and use this as a basis for identifying those services and areas that offer the most promising prospects for regional integration. Second, it examines the status of liberalization and reforms in the services sector and current levels of regional engagement in services to provide an overview of the policy environment as well as existing opportunities and interests in the regional market. Third, it provides an overview of the multilateral and extraregional/bilateral commitments in services made by the SAFTA member countries, so far, and their positions on key issues as a basis for assessing their preparedness to commit under SAFTA. The fourth and final aim is to outline negotiating priorities in different services and on cross-cutting issues, based on the earlier analysis of opportunities and constraints, and to point out possible modalities for negotiation. In doing so, the report also touches upon the growth and development implications of using services as a means for furthering regional integration in South Asia. 12 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia The report is structured in line with these four objectives. Following this introduction, chapter II provides the rationale for services integration in South Asia by discussing trends in services\u2019 growth and its contribution to output, employment, trade and investment in each of the countries of the region. The subsequent chapters, III to VI, focus on a representative set of services, namely telecommunications, energy, tourism and health care, and address issues relating to infrastructure, commercial and social services. These chapters follow a similar pattern. They first provide an overview of the sector from a global and regional perspective and then examine trends in the sector in the individual countries. This is followed by a discussion of the status of regulatory reforms and liberalization in each of these services. They then take a look at the current status of intraregional trade and investment relations and cooperation initiatives in the selected services and their ramifications for alleviating poverty and addressing development goals in the region. Next, an overview of the commitments made in these sectors by the South Asian countries under the WTO and in the context of other regional and bilateral agreements highlights their preparedness for regional negotiations on services.

Chapter VII draws upon the analysis in the preceding chapters to outline some negotiating priorities and modalities. It highlights the key drivers of services integration in South Asia and the main channels through which such integration could take place. The chapter suggests the need to adopt a gradual approach to negotiations on services under SAFTA, arguing that the proposed services framework agreement should first incorporate the most promising and least contentious services, where there is already recognition of potential and a demonstrated interest on the part of governments and the private sector. Thereafter, there should be a gradual inclusion of the more difficult and challenging services once the member countries have acquired greater institutional and regulatory capacity and achieved proven outcomes to facilitate the process. The nature of commitments that could be undertaken by individual member countries under SAFTA are outlined, as well as the approach on the cross-cutting issues of investment and movement of service providers. The report concludes by highlighting the complex political economy factors that characterize South Asia and pose the biggest challenge to any form of integration in the region. It also discusses the need to ensure an equitable distribution of benefits from a regional integration of services. 1 3 Scope and limitations of the study As mentioned, Afghanistan has been excluded from the analysis even though it has recently become a member of SAARC, mainly because of the limited and poor quality of data available for that country and the political circumstances that make it difficult to compare Afghanistan with other countries in the region. The terms South Asia and SAARC are at times used interchangeably, but they always refer to the same countries. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 13 The analysis mainly covers the period 1990 through 2007 or 2008. Thus, the impact of the 2008\u20132009 global economic and financial crises on output and trade in services in South Asia is not captured. This choice of period is primarily due to the availability of consistent and common time series data for that period for most of the required indicators across all the countries in this region. To some extent, this choice of years is also justified by the fact that the overall objective is to understand the general trends and characteristics of the growth of services in the region over a sufficiently long period \u2013 roughly the past two decades \u2013 which may otherwise be masked by aberrations in more recent data due to the effects of the recent global crisis on these economies and on the performance of their services sectors. This report discusses only four services, but there may well be other services of potential interest in the South Asian context. This deliberate narrowing of scope is driven by the broader objective of providing an in-depth and detailed account of the kinds of issues and concerns associated with a representative set of services that cut across different service clusters (infrastructural, commercial and social services) rather than trying to provide a wide-ranging but cursory account of all possible services that may be of interest in the South Asian context. However, the discussion does focus indirectly on several other services, such as transport, information technology (IT), financial and research and development (R&D) services, among others, in terms of their bearing on opportunities and constraints in the selected services and in other areas. Thus the discussion clearly recognizes the interdependence of various services, touching upon these links wherever relevant. The focus of the analysis in this report is largely intraregional. Many issues that may also be analysed from a national perspective have been approached differently. Once again, the links between national policies and preparedness for regional cooperation are highlighted, wherever relevant. Finally, the data on services, especially at the intraregional and subsectoral levels, and a cross- section of these two, are extremely poor. This greatly constrains any empirical analysis and modelling that could otherwise have been attempted to quantitatively assess the potential for services integration in South Asia and the resulting trade and growth implications for the region. Notwithstanding these limitations, this report should provide a better understanding of the prospects for and challenges to services integration in South Asia, its potential benefits and the implications of such integration for the realization of the broader goals of both SAFTA and the member countries. This report builds on existing work on South Asian integration through its coverage of the services sector.

There has been, however, a degree of progress bilaterally between some member countries of SAARC, such as under the Indo-Sri Lanka FTA, which has been expanded more recently to a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) that includes services and investment, or the FTA between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, or the bilateral agreements between India and Nepal and India and Bhutan. A major stumbling block for the region has been the strained relationship between the two largest members of SAARC \u2013 India and Pakistan, resulting in little, if any, progress in trade and investment between these two countries. This has dampened prospects for deeper integration. Added to these political dynamics are several characteristics inherent to this region, such as limited market size and purchasing power, the competing production and trade structures of member countries and inadequacies in physical infrastructure and governance, which have greatly constrained regional integration. In this context, is an expansion of SAFTA to include services justified? Would the region\u2019s characteristics also pose problems for the integration of services, or does this sector in the SAARC countries have certain attributes that may enhance the prospects for its regional integration? A close examination of recent trends in the services sector and various performance indicators in the individual member countries of SAARC and the region as a whole seems to suggest that conditions may be more conducive for the integration of services than for goods and that the potential for complementarities and congruence of interests and policy approaches is also likely to be much greater for services than for goods. 2 1 Growth of services and their contribution to output In South Asia, the services sector has clearly outperformed other sectors of the economy in terms of higher growth rates and less volatility. Its average annual growth rate has consistently increased, from slightly less than 4.5 percent in the 1970s to just over 6 percent in the 1980s to over 6.5 percent in the 1990s and a further 8.3 percent in the 2000\u20132007 period (figure 2.1). Although the manufacturing sector has also grown, its performance has been less steady than that of services, with the average annual growth rate rising to a little over 7 percent in the 1980s, then dropping to less than 6 percent in the 1990s and rising to around 6.5 percent in the current decade. Growth of the agricultural sector has not only been much lower but also highly volatile. Chapter 2 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 15 Services have been a key driver of overall economic growth in South Asia since the 1990s. It has consistently outperformed overall GDP growth, thus helping pull up overall economic growth in the region and compensating for volatility in other sectors.6 Figure 2 1: Trends in GDP and sector growth in South Asia (at constant 1991 prices), 1971\u20132007 (%) Source: Author\u2019s calculations, based on United Nations statistical database, at: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/data- bases.htm (accessed on 31 October 2008). The relatively superior performance of the services sector over the past two decades has also resulted in the sector\u2019s growing contribution to South Asia\u2019s GDP. Interestingly, this increased share has been directly at the expense of the agricultural sector. During the period 1980\u20132006, the share of agriculture in the region\u2019s GDP declined from 33 percent to around 18 percent and was almost exactly offset by services, whose share in GDP increased from 36 percent to nearly 50 percent (table 2.1). The contribution of the manufacturing sector increased only marginally over this period. 6 In the United Nations database (which is the source for the figures and tables used in this section), utilities (electricity,gas and water supply) is included in manufacturing and so shares do not change.

South Asia emerges as the region that, barring Southern Africa, has experienced the largest increase in the share of services in GDP over the past 15 years or so (table 2.2). Between 1990 and 2006, the share of services in South Asia\u2019s GDP increased by nearly 10 percent, compared with most other regions, where the increase was quite marginal and less consistent. In some regions, such as South America and South-East Asia, the sector even declined in importance. South Asia is also the only subregion in Asia where the contribution of the services sector increased during this period, and when compared with sub-Saharan Africa (a region consisting of countries with comparable levels of income), the contribution of services was several percentage points higher. Thus, South Asia stands out in terms of the services sector\u2019s growing role in value addition.

A comparison of South Asia\u2019s growth performance vis-\u00e0-vis the other regions also shows a relatively higher growth rate of services throughout the 1990s and in recent years. Among the developing regions, South Asia is the only region that has consistently exhibited a higher growth rate of services than of overall GDP, once again highlighting the importance of this sector in driving overall growth. In the 2001\u20132006 period, the services sector recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.2 percent, compared with 10.2 percent for ASEAN and 6.9 percent for the world. However, the overall growth of the region and of its services sector closely mirror those of India, where the services sector experienced a CAGR Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 17 of 11.6 percent, over the 2001\u20132006 period.7 India has therefore been the main driver of the growth of services in South Asia (discussed in further detail later in this chapter).

Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 19 The differences in growth performance are also quite revealing. While the comparatively higher growth rates of the services sectors in Bhutan and Maldives can be explained by their small base, they also reflect potential niches within this sector, as highlighted by the very high share of services in their GDP and by the disaggregated data (table 2.5). The fluctuating trends in their growth rates also reflect their high degree of dependence on specific segments of the services sector, which renders them vulnerable to trends in those segments. In contrast, India\u2019s services sector exhibits a consistently high growth rate, which has also increased over time, reflecting the growing capacity and potential of this sector. For the remaining countries, the services sector exhibits more moderate and at times fluctuating growth rates. These are also countries where the services sector has not been as significant in driving overall growth (figure 2.2). Nepal exhibits the weakest and most volatile growth performance over the given time period. These significant differences in performance are indicative of the potential complementarities in services within the region. This has a bearing on the scope for intraregional integration and collaboration in services and is indicative of likely asymmetries in the roles of different countries in this integration process and also in the resulting distribution of benefits. An examination of the subsectoral trends in services output across the South Asian countries also highlights their differences in scope and potential. It indicates the segments where each of the countries has exhibited higher and relatively sustained growth and those on which some of the South Asian economies are highly dependent, thus revealing potential areas of complementarity and competition among the countries (table 2.5).8 Table 2.5 shows that although the output of different service activities varies considerably among the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2aefff77-49b1-402c-a94c-b2df3588cb93": {"__data__": {"id_": "2aefff77-49b1-402c-a94c-b2df3588cb93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c744518d6a0995832f253ec69e826b34636904741a28a210afd21373b1fa9820"}, "3": {"node_id": "eb1686b6-7dd4-4afa-b060-0eb4f5be73b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9209b4a153485839defd2d1b477a2a9b9f5b9d66895bf56a1377ce569dd89436"}}, "hash": "f8da13d878fb741b810676c7017d75412828d84d8f0fa6a0fdad6623f70175c7", "text": "countries of South Asia, there are also similarities. Those service activities that have registered growth rates of 8 percent are highlighted in the table to help identify similarities and differences in these trends across the countries. Notwithstanding differences in data classification and availability, the services such as construction, wholesale and retail trade and distribution, and communications and transport are the largest contributors to GDP (12\u201320 percent). One exception is Maldives, where tourism services dominate, accounting for over a third of GDP. Government services or public administration-related services, which are non- commercial in nature, are also significant contributors to GDP in several countries in the region, indicating that part of the growth of the sector is non-tradable in nature. In terms of growth trends, communication services have the highest growth rates (over 10 percent) in most of the countries, and financial services have also grown rapidly in many of them. 8 As the definition of services and subsector classifications vary from country to country on account of differences in the national accounts tabulation and data collection procedures, no pooling together of subsector composition of services GDP has been attempted for the region. The differences in statistics on services constrain the ability of researchers to synthesize available information in a standardized and statistically accurate manner. Recent initiatives under the aegis of SAARC to address this issue are therefore important. 20 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Table 2

statistical bureaus and other official sources. Various factors have influenced the performance of the services sector. They include deregulation and policy reforms in areas such as telecommunications and financial services, rising incomes and domestic demand (which have been driving growth in segments such as trade and distribution services) and a lack of diversification in the smaller economies like Maldives. The subsector composition also indicates the importance of non-commercial services, such as public administration, government services and community, social and personal services, in some of the countries. This reflects the role of domestically oriented Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 23 provision and consumption in driving services growth in the region. From this it can be inferred that the general growth dynamics of rising incomes and consumption, liberalization and reform measures undertaken in services and the role of the public sector in services delivery are likely to play an important role in determining the scope for intraregional trade, investment and collaboration in this sector within South Asia. From a development perspective, however, a concern is that modern, less labour-intensive services, such as business services, communications and banking, have outperformed traditional personal services, such as tourism and transport, in South Asia. While this trend reflects higher labour productivity growth in the modern services and is in line with trends seen in other parts of the world, it also implies that the contribution of services to development and poverty alleviation goals in South Asia is contingent on the extent to which this sector creates jobs and on the extent to which it provides inputs to and fosters productivity improvements in other sectors of these economies. 2 2 Contribution of services to employment Official statistics suggest that the share of services in employment has increased in many of the countries in the last 20 years. But the rate of growth of employment in services has been far lower than the rate of growth of the contribution of services to GDP, by around 10 percent or more (figure 2.3), which poses challenges for job creation. The discrepancy is highest in Nepal where the services sector contributes to 53 percent of GDP but to only 18 percent of employment. Likewise in India, where the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP has risen the most consistently, reaching more than 60 percent, its contribution to employment remains much lower, at 35 percent. The only country where services account for a significant share of employment is Maldives, again reflecting the high dependence of this economy on certain service segments, such as tourism.

It could be argued that there are problems with the availability of employment data (particularly with regard to informal and contractual activities, which cover many services sector transactions), thus making it difficult to fully capture the contribution of services to employment. However, the limited national accounts and labour survey data that are available suggest that in South Asia this sector has not been very employment-intensive. As some analysts have argued, the growth of services may in part reflect increased total factor productivity, as opposed to increased factor accumulation (see Banga and Goldar, 2004; Singh, 2006). According to the International Labour Organization (ILO, 2008), although the agricultural sector still accounts for nearly half of total employment in South Asia, no other region of the world has experienced a faster decline in agricultural employment over the past decade. Between 1997 and 2007, there was a greater increase in employment in manufacturing (6.4 percent) than in services (4.9 percent), which contrasts with the manufacturing sector\u2019s much lower contribution to GDP when compared with services. Hence, as pointed out by the ILO, manufacturing has tended to be more employment-intensive than services. The ILO statistics further suggest that the services sector, despite its contribution to overall growth in the South Asian economies, has not adequately addressed the need to create long-term quality jobs in the region and help fulfil the United Nations\u2019 Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of achieving \u201cfull and productive employment and decent work for all, including women and young people\u201d. According to the ILO (2008), 77.2 percent of those employed remain vulnerable. Moreover, available data on gender disaggregation of employment in services in South Asian economies indicate that the share of males employed exceeds that of females. The ILO and several other studies also note that the share of informal and contract-based employment in services is high, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of jobs in the services sector and the vulnerability of those employed in services. For the most part, services output growth has exceeded employment growth, with employment elasticities below 1 (table 2.6). Futhermore, there has been a declining trend in this elasticity for several of the countries, corroborating the earlier discussion that services have not contributed commensurately to employment as compared with their output. Disaggregated information on certain services, including trade and distribution services, transport, communications and financial services, and community, personal and social services, shows their employment elasticities as mostly lower than 1; for most of the countries these have been declining. In contrast, employment elasticities in the informal economy show an overall upward trend and are higher than those in the formal economy.9 9 See: www.saarc-sec.org/data/pubs/rpp2005/pdfs/Chapter6.pdf (accessed on 21 April 2010).

Hence, poverty alleviation and sustained economic growth in the region are dependent on the services sector\u2019s performance, which could be considerably boosted by the opening up of these economies to regional and world markets through trade. Such integration could also help overcome constraints, such as their limited domestic markets and sluggish employment growth. 26 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia An examination of the data on trade in services for South Asia shows that the sector\u2019s growth has contributed not only to increased intraregional trade but also to the region\u2019s increased participation in world trade in services: from a share of around 1 percent to nearly 3 percent for exports of services and to around 2 percent of imports of services (figure 2.4). This trend suggests that the growth of services in South Asia has been trade-oriented, particularly with regard to exports. This orientation is also evident when comparing the growth in South Asia\u2019s trade in services with that of the world. The average annual rates of growth for South Asia\u2019s exports and imports of services exceeded those for the world during the periods 1991\u20132000 and 2000\u20132007 (figure 2.5). This difference is not only greater for South Asia\u2019s exports of services as opposed to its imports of services, but it has also increased in the more recent period compared with the 1990s. The services sector thus appears to have a higher export, as opposed to import, orientation in South Asia.

Given the growth of exports and imports of South Asia\u2019s services sector, the contribution of services to the region\u2019s total trade has increased over time, constituting around one fourth of all trade flows (merchandise plus services) in recent years. This is comparable to the contribution of services to overall trade in developed regions, such as the European Union. The only other developing region that shows a larger share of services in total trade is the Caribbean, at close to 30 percent, while the shares in all others regions are less than 20 percent. The aforementioned trends are indicative of South Asia\u2019s growing competitiveness in services, also evident in the trends in South Asia\u2019s revealed comparative advantage (RCA) indices for services exports compared with those of other regions over the past two decades (figure 2.6).12 South Asia is one of only two developing-country regions where the RCA index for services increased between 1990 and 2007.

While the RCA in South Asia\u2019s services exports has been rising, its RCA in merchandise exports has been declining over this period, and the gap between the two has in fact widened (figure 2.7).

While the average annual growth rate for South Asia as a whole almost trebled between the period 1991\u20131995 and 2001\u20132007, only in India did the growth rate show a consistently upward trend (table 2.8). Several countries experienced a deceleration in their services exports during the 1996\u20132000 period before growth picked up after 2000. Also, for many of the countries, the average growth rate was lower in the 2001\u20132007 period compared with the 1991\u20131995 period, indicating that the output growth in services after 2000 (shown earlier) did not necessarily translate into increased competitiveness and exports for all the countries. This is also consistent with the fact that in some countries, several non-commercial services have grown in importance. The data also indicate that services exports have been quite volatile in most of the countries, particularly Nepal and Pakistan.

Overall, the preceding data for services show that growth in South Asia\u2019s trade and the region\u2019s growing competitiveness and penetration of world markets is in large part driven by India\u2019s performance. This means that any attempts at regional integration of services would obviously involve asymmetries in trade potential and interests, that the dominant player, India, would have an important role in driving the intraregional integration process and that there may be very different distributional effects of such integration across the countries in the region. Should one then conclude that there is not much of a basis for pursuing intraregional integration in services within South Asia and that there is little benefit to be derived for countries other than India? Interestingly, an examination of the trends in competitiveness in services vis-\u00e0-vis merchandise trade in South Asia and a closer look at the subsector composition of trade in services within South Asia suggest that there are potential complementarities that could be exploited regarding particular subsectors as well as modes of delivery.

Looking at the composition of services exports for each of the countries in 1995 and 2006, it is evident that they have succeeded in diversifying somewhat, particularly India. In 2006, India\u2019s services exports consisted of traditional segments, such as transport and travel, as well as new areas such as computer and information services and other business services, the former having declined in importance over the 1995\u20132006 period.13 In contrast, the services exports of Maldives consisted mainly of travel services, those of Nepal entailed mainly travel and government services, Pakistan\u2019s were dominated by transport and government services, Sri Lanka\u2019s by transport and travel services and Bangladesh\u2019s by government services and to a lesser extent other business services. India\u2019s orientation has shifted towards professional and business services, while most of the other countries are still more dependent on certain traditional, commercial services, such as tourism and transport, though they have diversified into more activities since 1995.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c98c4b9-7019-47e0-bdd0-b8f2ee620d1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c98c4b9-7019-47e0-bdd0-b8f2ee620d1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e20f16578239205d2cc975303c572c2b27c590c2cd4cfffd1a89f744931e400d"}, "2": {"node_id": "94b788ab-5337-46b6-b71c-ab1ff726120c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fd9dcbf0e385e11f8343feabda36d8fd74e3f91978f71fa5db6b21ba7fb73d5"}}, "hash": "03015122e883d02ed88e196444273729fa526a91a76f67822faa352d8fe6a2b6", "text": "Thus the export pattern reveals some complementarities, particularly between India and the other countries in the region.

Given the importance of travel and transport services in exports as well as imports, tourism services is clearly one area in which all the countries have a common interest, which implies that they offer scope for greater intraregional trade and related cooperation. Likewise, business services constitute an important export segment for India and an increasingly important import segment for some of the other countries, indicating potential for exports of business and professional services from India to the other countries in the region. Related to these categories is the potential for greater cooperation in air and land transport services and facilitation of business and leisure travel. A fourth important feature highlighted by the trends is the significance of government services (non-commercial services) in some of the countries. This may have implications for the kinds of areas that are covered by a future regional services agreement and the form of such integration. Although it is difficult to interpret the results any further, owing to the lack of subclassification under government services, it may be argued that, given the significant role of public services in South Asia\u2019s trade basket, any regional services agreement could potentially explore possibilities for collaboration, capacity-building and 13 UNCTAD defines \u2018other business services\u2019 as including merchant and other trade-related services; operational leasing services; and miscellaneous business, professional and technical services. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 37 regulatory cooperation. Potentially important areas to consider in regional discussions would be health care, energy, education and the environment. A subsector analysis of the RCA indices for each of the countries also reveals potential complementarities. For most of the subsectors, the RCA indices are 1 or less. However, in several of the countries, there are specific subsectors that show a very high RCA, such as travel in the case of Maldives and computer and information services in the case of India. The latter shows a particularly high RCA index of 8.5 in India, reflecting this segment\u2019s tremendous growth over the past decade and its very high export orientation. Likewise, the high RCA value of travel services in Maldives reflects that economy\u2019s strong dependence on tourism.14 The commonalities and complementarities in the trading pattern highlighted previously are vis-\u00e0-vis the world and thus do not necessarily mean that countries in South Asia would want to trade with one another in some of the identified service segments; they may be more interested in other markets than in those within the region. Thus the preceding analysis of trade prospects and potential in services is valid only to the extent that the countries in South Asia see each other\u2019s markets as important enough to target. Moreover, the relatively small size of some of the South Asian economies is a likely impediment to growth in intraregional trade in services (as discussed in the section on the health sector, for instance). 2.4 Important modes of trade in services in South Asia 15 The sector-wise profile of trade interests and opportunities within the region is also indicative of the modes of services trade that are likely to be important in South Asia. For instance, the commonality of interests and high RCAs in tourism services for some of the countries would suggest that mode 2, or consumption abroad, as classified in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), would be an important form of services trade in the region. Related to this would be the significance of air transport and other transport services across the countries (mode 1). Likewise, the growing share of computer and information services or business services in the trade baskets of some of the countries suggests that mode 1 in the context of outsourcing and mode 4 in the context of movement of professionals and business travelers across the countries could play an important role in intraregional trade in services. Related investments (or mode 3) in these and some of the other services highlighted previously, 14 Based on UNCTAD Handbook of Statistics 2008 database, at: http://stats.unctad.org/handbook/ ReportFolders/ReportFolders.aspx (accessed on 24 October 2008). 15 GATS classifies services trade under four modes of supply. These are: mode 1 or cross-border supply, which refers to services in the form of data and information flows or carriers actually flowing across borders; mode 2 or consumption abroad, which occurs when a consumer goes abroad to consume a service, as in the case of tourism services; mode 3 or commercial presence, which refers to the setting up of a commercial establishment through a subsidiary, a joint venture, a branch office, etc.; and mode", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fb6d6e4-36b8-4365-be8c-fb52c16cf938": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fb6d6e4-36b8-4365-be8c-fb52c16cf938", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ce081bf4d388f3e4366d5c080370476abf9834fb0e60a86f72ba517cda6a910"}, "3": {"node_id": "931ea1bb-b83c-4d73-96e1-69dfae18d999", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1684faa0f2dd0c3952a243a87c4d3770266a2afd819ee359310178752ff5fef"}}, "hash": "e951c78b4ada1b7d098b4159489a8e9c56869365091447ce9d8f1cb46de20e17", "text": "4 or movement of natural persons, which refers to the temporary cross-border movement of service suppliers (not for permanent residence or citizenship in the host country) to provide a service in another market. 38 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia such as in financial, communication and transport services, would also be important for most of the countries in this region. Thus, all four modes of services delivery appear to be important for promoting intraregional services integration in South Asia. The following discussion focuses specifically on modes 3 and 4. It outlines the nature of the temporary movement of service providers (or mode 4) from South Asia and trends in remittances to the South Asian countries to illustrate the importance of mode 4 exports for South Asia. It also outlines the nature of investments (mode 3) in the services sector to explain the scope for regional integration through investment flows. For both modes 3 and 4, to the extent permitted by the availability of data, the extent of intraregional flows is also indicated. 2.4.1 Examining mode 4 trade in South Asia According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM, 2008), Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka are major source countries of migrant workers, both permanent and temporary (mode 4) and at various skill levels, for both industrialized and developing countries. Although it is difficult to distinguish temporary and permanent movement of labour from the existing migration data to separately identify the significance of mode 4 exports, some broad trends and patterns are evident for South Asia\u2019s labour flows. India is the main source country in South Asia and its emigration levels increased more than those of its neighbours over the period 2001\u20132005 (figure 2.17). Moreover, India\u2019s share in total labour inflows into several major OECD countries also increased during that period compared with the 1990\u20132004 period (rising from 5 percent to 8 percent in Australia, from 7 percent to 11 percent in Canada and from 5 percent to 8 percent in the United States) (IOM, 2008: 442).

Although the migrants are now going to more diverse destination countries, the countries of West Asia remain the most important destinations. An estimated 8.7 million temporary contractual workers from different South Asian countries lived and worked in that region as of 2008. (ibid.: 443) The skills profile of South Asia\u2019s migrants varies by destination. By and large, the bulk of unskilled migrant labour, mainly from Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, goes to the oil-rich Gulf States to work primarily on infrastructure projects. Around 90 percent of Pakistani temporary contractual workers to these countries are engaged in semi- and low-skilled jobs (ibid.: 443). Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are important source countries for domestic workers to West Asia (and also to South-East Asia), which has also resulted in the feminization of migration from South Asia. Although the main destination markets for South Asian workers are outside their region, intraregional labour flows are also significant for some South Asian countries (though much of it is often irregular and undocumented). India is the main destination country in this region, with an estimated 5.7 million international migrants, primarily from within the region, although they account for only 0.5 percent of the total population (ibid.: 441). A large number of these are migrant workers of Bangladeshi origin, followed by Nepalese workers. For some of the smaller countries in the region, labour inflows from other South Asian countries contribute significantly to the labour force.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "931ea1bb-b83c-4d73-96e1-69dfae18d999": {"__data__": {"id_": "931ea1bb-b83c-4d73-96e1-69dfae18d999", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ce081bf4d388f3e4366d5c080370476abf9834fb0e60a86f72ba517cda6a910"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fb6d6e4-36b8-4365-be8c-fb52c16cf938", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e951c78b4ada1b7d098b4159489a8e9c56869365091447ce9d8f1cb46de20e17"}}, "hash": "f1684faa0f2dd0c3952a243a87c4d3770266a2afd819ee359310178752ff5fef", "text": "For instance, in Maldives, the largest number of expatriate workers are Bangladeshis (36,380), followed by Indians (23,985) and Sri Lankans (9,754), who are largely employed in the construction and tourism sectors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df16665e-8bd9-4dc9-b50f-cfe02274b72d": {"__data__": {"id_": "df16665e-8bd9-4dc9-b50f-cfe02274b72d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "38fd2efa58edf066e0e2a969404cf28c6991effe4d19268ddfa95428882b76f8"}, "3": {"node_id": "eae9ce8e-3919-4078-8bf9-52bbcded755f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "883905fcd4039131e45b04a7130af5cfbe963d4f2e575a029c5f4ce1029c3e8d"}}, "hash": "effc8bf6a745add1456bb41d1b476da8c8ae1f4674af315ba07f98bf8e922467", "text": "Maldives features among the top 10 destinations for Sri Lankan workers and accounted for around 1 percent of the country\u2019s migrant outflows in 2005 (Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, 2006). This is indicative of the scope for intraregional movement of workers, with some of the smaller countries relying on migrant inflows from the relatively more populous countries in South Asia to serve their needs in specific segments. The importance of mode 4 exports for the South Asian region is reflected in the absolute size of remittances as well as their share in the South Asian economies. All the South Asian countries recorded a consistent increase in remittances over the period 1985\u20132006, with remittances more than doubling, from US$12 billion to over US$24 billion in India (figure 2.18). 40 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Figure 2 18: Trends in workers\u2019 remittances in South Asian countries, 1985\u20132006 (US$ million, at current prices) Source: Same as figure 2.4. Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka also feature among the top 10 recipients of remittances in the world. Indeed, India receives the largest amount of remittances in the world. However, although it ranks first in terms of the absolute value of remittances, receipts from overseas workers constitute a significant share of GDP for some of the other countries of the region: over 7 percent for Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka (table 2.9).

Data on remittance outflows from India by destination market indicate that much of the migrant stock in India is from within the region, and this is also likely to be the case for the other South Asian countries as well. Over 70 percent of the remittances flowing out of India go to two other South Asian countries, Bangladesh and Pakistan, with Bangladeshi workers accounting for over half of these remittance outflows. It is also likely that Nepal features in the set of \u2018other countries\u2019, which account for another 22 percent of remittances from India. The importance of India as a destination market for South Asian migrant workers is quite evident from the data: there were 3.45 million migrant workers from Bangladesh, 1.2 million from Pakistani and 169,000 from Sri Lanka in 2005 (Ratha and Shaw, 2007).16 16 Based on University of Sussex and World Bank, Bilateral Estimates of Migrant Stocks database, World Bank, Washington, DC. 55 0 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 (US$ million, at current prices) 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 16000 18000 20000 22000 24000 26000 1985 1990 1995 2000 2006 Bangladesh India Nepal Pakistan Sri Lanka 51% 26% 1% 22% To Bangladesh To Pakistan To China To other countries 0 3000 6000 9000 12000 15000 18000 21000 24000 27000 30000 33000 36000 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 I d FDI O t d FDI Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 41 Figure 2 19: Workers\u2019 remittances from India to selected neighbouring countries, 2006 (%)* Source: Reproduced from IOM, World Migration Report 2008: 450, figure 16. * Estimated in US$ million.

Thus, mode 4-related issues would have to play an important role in any intraregional agreement that covers services, such as liberalizing visa and immigration- related regulations, given their bearing on trade and investment flows across a wide range of services. From a human development perspective, international evidence on the impact of remittances and migration on poverty reduction and contribution to human capital and health outcomes, asset accumulation and improved living standards also provides a strong argument for promoting intraregional migration flows in South Asia. Moreover, such migration could also provide some insulation against reduced remittances resulting from downturns in other markets. 2.4.2 Investment flows to services in South Asia As highlighted earlier, the growth witnessed in several services, such as communications, finance and IT, is a reflection of the reforms undertaken and policies adopted in these areas. One of the main elements of reform in this region has been the liberalization of FDI overall as well as in key services. Although data specifically for FDI in services are limited, the overall regional and country-level trends clearly indicate that there is a growing role for investments in this region across most of the countries, with some countries emerging as potential investors as well. Moreover, a large part of such investment is targeting the services sector, with potential ramifications for future intraregional investment flows and related trade in services. FDI inflows into South Asia have grown sharply, from less than US$3 billion in 1991 to over US$33 billion on 2007 (UNCTAD, 2008 and figure 2.20). Their average annual rate of growth was 31.5 percent during the period 2000\u20132007. As a result, South Asia\u2019s share in global FDI inflows increased from 2.6 percent in 2000 to 4 percent in 2006, and the region\u2019s share of FDI in GDP rose from 4.7 percent in 2000 to 6.5 percent in 2006. However, this represents a much smaller share than those found in countries of East and South-East Asia where the shares were 25.1 percent and 39.5 percent, respectively (ADB, 2008b). FDI outflows remain much smaller but have also increased significantly in the post-2000 period, from almost 0 to nearly US$15 billion. FDI flows between South Asia, East Asia and South-East Asia have risen in recent years and now constitute almost 50 percent of the Asian region\u2019s total FDI inflows (ADB, 2008b). FDI flows between East Asia and South-East Asia have been significant. Those between South Asia and East and South-East Asia are relatively small, and cross-border FDI within South Asia, in particular, is negligible.

Almost all the South Asian countries experienced a significant increase in FDI inflows over the 1990\u20132007 period, with India accounting for over 80 percent of all inflows into South Asia. Interestingly, there has also been an increase in FDI outflows from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, with outflows from India trebling from about US$600 million to over US$13.5 billion during this period (table 2.11). India also accounted for over 90 percent of the region\u2019s FDI outflows in 2007 (UNCTAD, 2008).

This would enable companies from countries in the region to potentially increase their presence in the other South Asian countries. Already, India is one of the most critical emerging markets for outward FDI (EIU, 2007), much of which goes to other developing countries. And overall FDI trends and patterns suggest that there is scope for India to take a greater role in investment flows in South Asia as that country becomes a more competitive source of FDI and the other countries become more open to FDI. It is difficult to gauge the level of intraregional investments, especially in services in South Asia, owing to the limited information available in this regard. Available data on the composition of outward FDI from India indicate that services constitute around 40 percent of such outflows, the bulk of which consists of non-financial services, namely computer and information services (UNCTAD, 2004). Thus the pattern of FDI from India reflects its competitiveness in business and professional services, as highlighted earlier in the trade data. Indeed, India\u2019s trade and investment interests are the main driver of services growth in the region. Intraregional FDI flows account for a very small share of total FDI inflows of countries in the region (table 2.12). Countries outside the region (i.e. Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States) continue to be the main sources of South Asian countries\u2019 inward FDI. India is the only noteworthy South Asian country investing in the region to any appreciable extent, particularly in Nepal, and to a small extent in Sri Lanka. In essence, the pattern that emerges is that of the bigger countries being potential investors in the smaller countries. Hence, from the limited data available, there appears to be scope for India to increase its FDI flows to the rest of South Asia, and an investment agreement could potentially facilitate this process.

Because service-specific data on a bilateral basis are not available, it is difficult to assess to what extent the services sector would be a recipient of any increase in intraregional investments.

The disaggregated data for Bangladesh, India and Pakistan reveal that the most important subsectors are communications, energy and financial services. Construction and certain business services are also important, but to a lesser extent.17 Although similar data could not be obtained for Nepal and Sri Lanka, recent reports indicate that the services sector has been the leading recipient of FDI in Sri Lanka, where it accounted for 55.6 percent of total FDI inflows compared with 41.7 percent for the manufacturing sector in 2000 (UNCTAD, 2004). The major subsectors that continue to attract large amounts of FDI in Sri Lanka are telecommunications and business process outsourcing, with telecommunications alone receiving about half of total services-related FDI (World Bank, 2007; and UNCTAD, 2004). In Nepal, although manufacturing accounts for a large share of FDI (around 49 percent in 2003), the shares of tourism and communication services are also significant, amounting to 24 percent and 21.4 percent of total FDI inflows, respectively (Pant and Sigdel, 2004). Similar data were not available for Bhutan and Maldives. Discussions suggest that the tourism sector attracts a large proportion of the services-related FDI in Maldives, while the tourism and energy segments are the main recipients of FDI in Bhutan. Overall, there is clearly scope for increased intraregional FDI, due to some apparent complementarities in the services sector across investor and recipient countries and the continued deregulation of many services in South Asian countries (discussed in detail in subsequent chapters). As mentioned earlier, there can be substantial human development benefits of intraregional investment and, more specifically, investment in services.

It is worth summarizing some of the most salient points and their implications for the likely nature of and scope for regional integration of services in South Asia and what a prospective regional services agreement would need to consider. First and foremost, all the countries in South Asia have seen a shift in the structure of their economies away from agriculture and towards services. At the same time, there has been an increase in trade and investment in services in all the economies, and South Asia\u2019s participation in global trade in services has also increased over the past decade. The growing share of services in GDP and the high output as well as trade growth in several of its subsectors support the contention that this sector is a potential priority area for furthering regional integration (including investment, considering many services would not be tradable without FDI). Second, there are considerable variations across the countries in terms of the size of their services, the output and export growth performance of the sector, the relative shares of individual economies in regional services trade and output, and their service-related RCA indices. Much of the improved performance in the region as a whole is attributable to India in terms of the growing diversification of its services export basket and the emergence of non-traditional service activities as well as India\u2019s increased penetration of the world market, particularly in computer and information services and business services. Given such asymmetries, the South Asian countries would probably have very divergent interests in each other\u2019s markets, and there is likely to be considerable asymmetry in their degree of participation in any regional services integration process. India would probably need to act as the main driver of that integration. Moreover, bilateral and/or plurilateral relations in certain areas of common interest and complementarity of endowments (i.e. natural resources and labour) would also be important factors to consider in regional discussions on services. Third, there are potential complementarities regarding to capital and labour among the countries in the region. Some countries, such as India, which has more established service companies (some of which are also engaging in outward investments), could emerge as sources of FDI in subsectors such as energy, communications and tourism services, while other countries in the region could clearly benefit", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e3fac35-9d36-4b70-81a9-3763ba9d9e49": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e3fac35-9d36-4b70-81a9-3763ba9d9e49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21eceb3dde5185d00cbea3d1ad31dc7484df5c47a96ae99b5409696b4f075934"}}, "hash": "21eceb3dde5185d00cbea3d1ad31dc7484df5c47a96ae99b5409696b4f075934", "text": "from FDI inflows into those subsectors. Likewise, with regard to labour movements within the region, India provides an attractive destination market for migrant workers from the smaller and poorer countries and Maldives provides employment opportunities in niche segments. There is also scope for movement Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 47 of professionals and intra-company transfers in business services, particularly from India to the smaller countries, given India\u2019s growing competitiveness in business services and the general openness of this segment in most countries. The subsector trends in growth, trade and competitiveness suggest that there is potential commonality of interests within the region in areas such as communications, tourism and computer and information services. Given the factor intensity of some of these subsectors, factor flows in the form of investments and movement of service providers are likely to be important for furthering intraregional commerce. Fourth, the significance of traditional and government services in the growth and trade patterns of some of the countries suggests that discussions on regional services integration would need to address issues of regulatory cooperation and capacity-building in this sector. Intergovernmental cooperation in the provision and delivery of services and collaboration among regulatory bodies, public sector institutions and associations would be an important element in supporting the regional integration of services. Finally, an important issue highlighted by the development of the services sector in the South Asian economies is its relatively smaller contribution to employment compared with its contribution to trade and output. As roted earlier, this raises the issue of sustainability of the growth in services, which is imperative, particularly in view of the large and young labour force and the need for employment creation for poverty alleviation and for attaining the MDGs. Thus, any regional services agreement would need to address employment and sustainability-related concerns in the services sector by facilitating its contribution to employment and productivity growth and its link with other sectors. On the other hand, increased intraregional trade and investment flows could potentially increase the dependence of some smaller countries on selected services and also their dependence on the larger markets in the region as export destinations and as sources of investment. Thus regional integration in services could lead to less rather than more diversification of trade and investment in services, especially for the smaller, less-developed countries. This could have political and security-related ramifications. 48 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Telecommunication services are considered a critical element in the development of a country\u2019s infrastructure. Improved communication facilities can accelerate growth, facilitate access to markets, enhance trade and investment prospects and reduce poverty and inequality. Throughout the world, the telecommunications industry has experience rapid advancements in technology and the emergence of new segments and value-added services. It has also undergone considerable liberalization, including privatization of state- owned telecom providers and opening up to foreign investors. In the past decade or so, many developing countries, including South Asian countries, have implemented national telecommunications policies involving the restructuring and deregulation of their telecom services, with the ultimate objectives of lowering connectivity costs, improving the quality of those services and meeting universal service obligations (USOs). Independent regulatory bodies have also been established in many countries, though often this process has been a complex one, fraught with challenges. Telecommunication services are a potential area for greater regional integration in South Asia. A combination of factors makes this sector particularly appealing and conducive to such integration. These include the high growth rates and rising contribution of telecom services to GDP, the opening up of the sector to foreign ownership in several of the South Asian countries, the potential pooling of resources for investment and regulatory capacity- building and the common goal of all the countries of augmenting investment in telecom infrastructure and establishing regulatory frameworks to improve efficiency, affordability and access. Such commonalities in policy trends and objectives, combined with large resource gaps and investment requirements, create ample scope for both collaborative and commercial relations in telecom services within the region. This chapter starts by providing an overview of telecom services in South Asia. It examines their performance vis-\u00e0-vis the world in terms of key indicators and performance measures to highlight the overall infrastructure requirements and investment needs of this sector. This is followed by an overview of the trends in key indicators for telecom services in each of the South Asian countries to determine their growth trajectory and the differences and similarities.

The concluding section draws on the analysis of trends, initiatives and commitments to emphasize the main opportunities for greater regional integration, the challenges that exist and the specific issues that would need to be addressed in regional negotiations. 3 1 Overview of telecommunication services in South Asia Telecommunication services in the South Asian countries have grown rapidly over the past decade. The total number of subscribers in the region increased from a mere 41.8 million in 2000 to around 540 million in 2008, and the teledensity (number of total subscriptions per 100 persons) grew from a median of 2.52 to about 32.18 There have been significant increases in the number of subscriptions as well as penetration across the various segments of the telecom sector, including fixed line, mobile and Internet services. Notwithstanding the growth of the telecom sector in South Asia, the region continues to lag behind some other developing countries and also compares poorly with global averages (tables 3.1 and 3.2).

The South Asian countries compare more favourably in mobile teledensity than in fixed teledensity. They show a larger share of mobile subscriptions to total subscriptions than the world average, and the share is either comparable to or larger than the other selected countries, indicating much greater growth of their mobile telephony segment. The latter is also evident from the high CAGRs for mobile telephony, which are several times greater than those of the other selected countries and also greater than the global average. This difference in relative performance between fixed and mobile segments in the South Asian countries is not only an indication of the growth potential of the mobile segment but is also indicative of the constraints on the fixed-line segment more than the mobile segment, stemming from regulations, policies and infrastructure-related factors (discussed later in more detail). Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 51 It is evident from the data on Internet penetration and usage that all the South Asian countries lag far behind other developing countries and also the global average (table 3.2). This is indicative of the lack of an appropriate communications and electricity infrastructure and the low levels of literacy, per capita income and urbanization in the region, which adversely affect the ability to access and use Internet services. The latter is also captured by the very low levels of computer ownership in the region \u2013 20 or less per 100 persons (ADB, 2008c). Overall, telecom services in South Asia remain underdeveloped, despite their rapid growth in recent years, particularly the Internet and fixed-line segments. However, there is a large untapped subscriber base in the region and considerable opportunities for further growth and infrastructure development. 3 2 Trends in telecom service performance in South Asia An examination of the trends in telecom services, as captured by the usual indicators of performance in this sector, reveals several common features. In the past decade, all the countries have experienced a 10- to 60-fold increase in their total subscription base for telecom services (fixed and mobile) and a 10- to 50- fold increase in their teledensities (although the region still lags far behind the world average and behind comparable developing countries). In all the South Asian countries, the main contributor to growth in subscriptions and teledensity has been the mobile segment. There is also wide variation across the South Asian countries in the size and level of penetration of their telecom services and in their rate of expansion. For instance, total teledensity (number of subscriptions per 100 people) ranged from a low of 17.27 for Nepal to 158.2 for Maldives in 2008, with a median teledensity of 32.57. The magnitude of increase has also varied within the region, with Maldives experiencing a rapid increase in teledensity during the 2000\u20132008 period, followed by Sri Lanka (figure 3.1). Mobile telephony has experienced particularly high growth. It now accounts for a growing and significant share of total subscriptions in all the countries. Internet penetration and subscribers have also grown considerably in all the South Asian countries, though in absolute terms the levels of usage still remain very low. Broadband penetration is particularly low, below 1 for all the countries (table 3.3). 52 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Figure 3 1: Trends in total teledensity in South Asian countries, 2000\u20132008 Source: Same as table 3.1.

The expansion of scale and scope of services observed in telecom services in South Asia reflects the liberalization and deregulation undertaken in this sector, but the trends and performance indicators highlight the need for further investment in certain segments. Mobile telephony emerges as potentially the most attractive area for regional discussions because there is likely to be the greatest convergence of interests and objectives. 3 3 Policy trends and regulatory reforms All the South Asian countries have liberalized their telecom services, though to varying degrees and at a varying pace. In almost all the countries, reforms began in the 1990s, starting with the restructuring and partial privatization of state-owned operators (thereby allowing private sector entry into the mobile telephony market and value-added services) the opening up to competition in the fixed-line segment, the adoption of national telecommunications policies and establishment of regulatory commissions. By and large, mobile telephony, value-added and Internet services have been opened to full competition in most of the countries, while local and long-distance landline services still remain monopolies in a few countries. The objectives have been common across all the countries, namely to develop their telecom infrastructure, provide universal access and improve the quality of the telecom services. The countries of South Asia are at different stages of liberalization of their telecom services and their competition varies. The two largest countries, India and Pakistan, have liberalized the most, allowing full competition in most segments, while some of the smaller countries still have monopoly state operators, particularly in their fixed-line segments.

Maldives is the least liberalized, with a competition level index of 0.7, although it has Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 55 the highest teledensity and penetration ratios within the region, even higher than more liberalized India and Pakistan. Similarly, Sri Lanka is less competitive than the regional average (with an index value of 0.89), but it has higher penetration ratios and teledensity than some of the more liberalized countries in the region.19 This would suggest that while the regulatory framework is important for promoting competition and increased services, other factors, such as income per capita, are also important in improving access to telecom services. The extent of liberalization of FDI policies varies across the SAARC countries (see annex table A1.1 for a matrix of FDI policies in the South Asian countries). Some countries, such as Pakistan, have permitted up to 100 percent foreign ownership and also relaxed conditions on repatriation and licensing. Smaller countries, such as Bhutan and Maldives, have not yet opened up this sector to FDI. Yet others have permitted foreign investment up to specified ceilings and subject to various approvals. The variation in the extent of liberalization is indicative of the countries being at different stages of development and thus not embarking on telecom reforms at the same time. As a result of these reforms and liberalization of FDI in telecom services, there has been a rise in teledensity and in the subscriber base in all the South Asian countries, as mentioned earlier, although other factors have also played a role. The reforms have spurred competition and resulted in lower prices and a wider range of telecom services. According to the World Bank, South Asia is comparable with other developing regions in terms of the value of private sector investment committed in recent years,20 particularly since 2000. Such investment rose from a negligible amount in 2000 to nearly US$20 billion in 2007. This growth was largely driven by investment in the mobile telephony segment. In line with the earlier estimates for market competitiveness, India and Pakistan have the largest number of operators. The growth of investment reflects the entry of both domestic and foreign operators. In Pakistan, which has gone the furthest in opening up this sector to FDI, there has been a huge increase in FDI inflows into telecom services, including acquisitions of important domestic companies by foreign operators. FDI inflows into Pakistan\u2019s telecoms rose from US$6.1 million in 2001-2002 to US$1.9 billion in 2005\u20132006, and in May 2007, China Mobile acquired 100 percent ownership of Paktel. The telecom sector\u2019s contribution to total FDI in Pakistan increased from a mere 1.26 percent in 2001\u20132002 to 54.1 percent in 2005\u20132006 (Wilson, 2008: 11). Thus, increased competition in telecom services, particularly in the two largest markets of South Asia, has been the result of growing domestic and foreign private 19 Source: See ITU, World Regulatory Policies Database, at: www.itu.int/ITU-D/ICTEYE/Regulators/Regulators. aspx (accessed on 11 December 2008) for competition-level indices. The level of competition is determined by according a value of 0 for monopoly, 1 for partial competition and 2 for full competition and then dividing the total sum by the number of applicable segments. Thus the higher the index value, the more competitive the sector. 20 Based on data on investment commitments in telecom projects with private participation in developing countries by region for the period 1990\u20132007 (Source: World Bank and Private Participation in Infrastructure database at: http://ppi.worldbank.org/ (accessed on 10 February 2009). 56 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia sector participation as well as greenfield investments and acquisitions. It is also worth noting that the objective of universal service obligation has been a significant feature of all the national telecommunications policies in the region, which regard the development of the telecom sector as integral to overall development and equity goals. 3.3.1 Regulatory and other challenges Despite the growth and improved performance of the telecom sector in all the countries of South Asia, certain challenges remain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77a93df2-fade-4238-bb4e-e2a557313a97": {"__data__": {"id_": "77a93df2-fade-4238-bb4e-e2a557313a97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f064e3b10d4f1b70edbffdc44db62f20ecfc1f48506b4f44908b7f2425b76bce"}, "2": {"node_id": "be83b77c-fb39-48e1-bcf1-3550e222fbfb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d6fba5da80b02f8c274dcfaead87aa96082f34fc72e79bd3bfaf02b71a7da9f"}}, "hash": "25d50dba3fe4b2c8e6212908b8f9133ee5c77dd7d4443a2af00f3f2ddf0e7bf4", "text": "Recent surveys on the telecom regulatory framework in South Asia suggest that market entry is no longer a major barrier; rather, it is mainly institutional and regulatory practices, such as lack of institutional transparency, anti- competitive practices, a tendency to prefer incumbents, lack of independence of telecom regulatory authorities, political interference and lobbying by incumbents, regulatory uncertainties, policy gaps arising from differences between policies on paper and their implementation, continued monopoly in certain segments, problems of infrastructure and in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e733b4aa-1b31-4957-9dec-0c7303c5fae5": {"__data__": {"id_": "e733b4aa-1b31-4957-9dec-0c7303c5fae5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f382302f62d6a4747f312b07fb3e07f1276c11a058e64268b735047bc14dc6a"}, "3": {"node_id": "c43ae39e-e4c0-47fb-acf3-0b70032a974d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a02c81f758f91377f4350451d07432c7918fa8dccc0552ae2691e5a228f6a05f"}}, "hash": "0e22efaec316ef6a57002aaa106e1c306bd5446b10ef649ebe01c6f90605c81c", "text": "particular, spectrum allocation and high surcharges and levies on telecom operators due to a heavy dependence on this sector for revenues in some countries. A 2008 Telecom Regulatory Environment Survey in India, Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka by LIRNEasia (see: www.lirneasia.net), conducted among a wide range of stakeholders, assessed issues of market entry, access to scarce resources, tariff regulation, universal service obligations, regulation of anti-competitive practices and quality of services. The survey results showed relatively good performance in terms of market entry, interconnection and tariff-related measures, especially in the mobile segment. Maldives rated relatively better than the other countries on access to resources, reflecting its higher teledensity and penetration ratios, and the other countries performed much worse for fixed and broadband services. Thus provision of access to telecom infrastructure remains a challenge. Sri Lanka, interestingly, performed poorly on all the parameters, despite having opened up most of its telecom services to partial competition. This is attributed to lapses in governance and problems with regulation (Knight-John, 2008). Overall, the South Asian countries perform poorly on anti-competitive practices. This is mainly due to the lack of independent regulation and protection of incumbent operators, which undermine the reforms undertaken in this sector. It also possibly reflects a certain protectionist policy orientation that still prevails, which could undermine prospects for regional integration of telecom services. 3 4 Intraregional initiatives SAARC member countries have explicitly acknowledged the need for greater intraregional cooperation and initiatives relating to telecom services to address common objectives and interests. As a result, there have been considerable discussions in intergovernmental and industry forums within the region. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 57 3.4.1 Intergovernmental initiatives Information and communications technology is designated as one of the priority sectors for cooperation under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) project of the ADB, which covers Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal. Lack of connections between the countries involved and poor infrastructure and human resource capacity in this sector are seen as major barriers to regional penetration of telecom services in South Asia. To address these constraints, a working group on telecom and ICT was set up after the 12th SAARC Summit in January 2004, which identified five focus areas: enhancing regional connectivity; promoting information-sharing and human resource development; establishing community information centres; strengthening and harmonizing regulations and standards; and developing common software tools to enhance content availability on the Internet. Multilateral support has been provided by the ADB for this working group. A major achievement of the SASEC programme on telecommunications is that it has secured agreement on a SASEC Information Highway Project to optimize interconnection costs and extend the reach of ICT services in this region. An important intergovernmental initiative is the establishment of the South Asian Telecommunications Regulators\u2019 Council (SATRC) in 1998, following discussions between the ITU, the Asia Pacific Telecommunity (APT) and the respective governments of the region.21 SATRC is a permanent body that functions under the auspices of the APT with Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka as members. It is responsible for discussions and coordination of all issues and concerns relating to regulations in the telecommunications sector that are of common interest to the telecom regulators. SATRC also aims to identify and promote areas of potential cooperation in tele-communications among its members and serves as a forum for mutual learning, sharing of experiences and harmonization of regulations. It facilitates the exchange of information through regional seminars, workshops and training courses. In 2004, SATRC drew up an action plan that reflected the common issues and concerns of the member countries. The key issues discussed include licensing, service quality, universal service and access obligations, tariff rebalan-cing, interconnection, numbering plans (according numbers to mobile phones), number portability, equal ease of access, intelligent network services and broadband technology (APT, 2004). The plan aims to lower telecom tariffs among the SATRC members to the lowest levels possible; introduce special rates for transiting regional traffic; promote inter-country direct services, calling cards, cellular roaming and liberalized leased lines; promote use of either direct links, hubbing or transit facilities to facilitate intraregional communications; and encourage regulatory cooperation to improve performance. The common priority objectives under this plan are achieving 21 The Asia Pacific Telecommunity was set up in 1979 as an intergovernmental regional telecommunications organization based in Bangkok.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c43ae39e-e4c0-47fb-acf3-0b70032a974d": {"__data__": {"id_": "c43ae39e-e4c0-47fb-acf3-0b70032a974d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f382302f62d6a4747f312b07fb3e07f1276c11a058e64268b735047bc14dc6a"}, "2": {"node_id": "e733b4aa-1b31-4957-9dec-0c7303c5fae5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e22efaec316ef6a57002aaa106e1c306bd5446b10ef649ebe01c6f90605c81c"}}, "hash": "a02c81f758f91377f4350451d07432c7918fa8dccc0552ae2691e5a228f6a05f", "text": "Its goal is to facilitate the development of telecommunication services and information infrastructure in the Asia-Pacific region.

In the context of universal service obligations, the SATRC countries have adopted various schemes, the main one being that of cross-subsidization supplemented by revenues from telecom operators. With regard to number-ing plans, SATRC has decided to review the issues of harmonizing of emergency telephone numbers, a mobile service access code and satellite-based and terrestrial mobile telephony. The current mismatch of numbering schemes affects subscribers when they travel within the region. New numbering formats have been proposed among the members. On the issue of tariff rebalancing (i.e. modifying telecom service rates to bring them closer to their associated costs), there has been some discussion and analysis of incumbent operators within the region to examine various parameters, such as licensing fees, benchmarking, return on capital, market competitiveness, and transparency, neutrality and independence of regulators. The working group has also conducted analyses for the determination of national and international tariffs, collection charges, and interconnection charges though no recommendations have been made so far. There has been some discussion on performance indicators, quality of services, licensing issues, enforcement mechanisms to ensure adherence to network and service benchmarks, and identification of challenges in meeting the established quality benchmarks. Some of the constraints identified by the SATRC include shortage of spectrum, and the lack of sufficient interconnection capacity between operators and technology. The SATRC has also noted emerging challenges, such as the need for convergence of services, and has discussed the classification and types of licences, dispute resolution and policies and regulations for broadband development in South Asia. Working groups formed under SATRC have submitted their reports on a number of the aforementioned issues and several resolutions have since been adopted. Workshops have been held on regulatory capacity-building, licensing for convergence, mutual recognition agreements, interconnection and convergence. Judging from these activities, the significance of telecom services within the region is well recognized, both in terms of its implications for furthering national goals and for addressing regional opportunities in other areas such as tourism, business, IT and related applications. However, there has been more talk than action and progress has been limited. Most of the discussions remain at the proposal or vision stage. 3.4.2 Industry-level initiatives A SAARC industry forum \u2013 the SAARC CEO Conclave \u2013 launched for the telecom sector and hosted by the Confe-deration of Indian Industries aims to focus on network expansion and mobile security. A conclave of chief executive officers (CEOs) consisting of SAARC industry leaders in telecoms meets annually. Its seven meetings so far have covered a range of major issues, including lowering of tariffs, roaming facilities, high-speed services, sharing of regulatory best practices, building knowledge and capacity on latest technologies and Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 59 standardization of telecom monitoring methods. The 6th Voice and Data CEO Conclave in December 2007 hosted the first Summit of the SAARC Telecom Advisory Council, in which a road map was drawn up for telecommunications in the region for 2008 and beyond. Discussions at the CEO Conclave meetings have highlighted the need for cross-border availability of services and for cooperation among operators in the provision of both voice and data services. Possibilities for regional operators, such as Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), to service the regional market and the need for discus-sions among the major operators in the region to finalize roaming agreements have also been considered. It is recognized that regional operators could provide the economies of scale that individual markets in this region do not offer. The superior performance of the smaller countries in the region in terms of teledensity, the possibility of the larger operators learning from their smaller counterparts in the region and the potential gains for the smaller players from associating with the larger operators have also been acknowledged. For instance, an association of Maldivian companies with Sri Lankan operators and with Reliance Communications (India) is seen as a way for small players to operate at the regional level. Industry participants have also highlighted the need for standardization of products and services to facilitate outsourcing and disaster recovery by IT firms and the potential spillover of opportunities in the IT sector from India to the other countries in the region. Overall, industry leaders in the telecom sector view regional cooperation in telecoms as closely linked to the objectives of poverty alleviation and enhancing quality of life through the use of latest technologies in the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0cadbbff-9338-4b84-acc8-7964dd9e8ccf": {"__data__": {"id_": "0cadbbff-9338-4b84-acc8-7964dd9e8ccf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "047aad0f66d3c33d6f5aecc6e8b265eef00a37745aa3c91d31a5f05d89c51768"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c7cf788-a7c3-4834-a53a-0bf7b4134803", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "865001b48aea418727c16d733057bce35c7536cbd5924741206a7c2464376209"}}, "hash": "d48991439dba5e355e2c55457ac527f349260f5df6ce9a4e560ef009b59902fd", "text": "SAARC region. The CEO Conclave has proposed an industry association at the SAARC level that would include telecom operators, various national industry associations and regulators. 3.4.3 Private sector initiatives Investments in telecom services have been on the rise. Indeed, mobile services are expected to account for major capital expenditures in South Asia, and prospects for technological advancements like 3G, broadband and value-added services are promising (Frost and Sullivan, 2009). The Indian market, owing to its size, is expected to dominate telecom spending in the region and act as a regional source of investment in the other SAARC member countries. Several large Indian telecom companies have either entered the markets of other South Asian countries or have announced plans to do so. For example, the Indian telecom giant, Bharti Airtel, has set up a Sri Lankan subsidiary, Bharti Airtel Lanka Pvt. Ltd., with a proposed investment of US$200 million. Within a few months of its entry, its customer base in Sri Lanka exceeded one million. So far, it has invested US$100 million and will be investing further over the next three years. The Sri Lankan subsidiary has entered into a three-year managed network deal with China\u2019s Huawei Technologies to offer 2G and 3G services in Sri Lanka. Bharti Airtel has also announced plans to expand its cable network to Bhutan to help develop that country\u2019s ICT infrastructure in partnership with the Government of Bhutan. The company is looking to expand its operations in other SAARC countries as well. Reliance Infocomm and Bharti Airtel have shown interest in bidding for a licence for GSM (global 60 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia system for mobile communications) 2D cellular services in Bhutan. In 2004, Airtel signed the first-ever roaming agreement with Pakistan\u2019s Mobilink to provide mobile roaming facilities for its pre-paid and post-paid customers. There have also been attempts to lower tariff rates within the region. In November 2008, BSNL cut its international call rates to SAARC countries by 15\u201335 percent so as to enable customers, both mobile and landline, to make calls to Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives and Pakistan at cheaper rates.22 Two major Indian telecom firms, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Communications, have submitted a joint proposal to the Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission to establish a telecom corridor through Bangladesh to reach the north-eastern part of India. They have expressed an interest in linking up with any Bangladeshi fibre optics operator to provide telecom services to the north-eastern Indian states. In return, they have offered a stand-by submarine cable to Bangladesh. This initiative could be mutually beneficial to both countries: the north-eastern states of India would benefit from lower rates (currently very high owing to their telecom services being provided through VSAT),23 and Bangladesh would benefit from an alternative to its current dependence on a submarine cable from South-East Asia, which would enable it to avoid the disruptions it encounters from that undersea cable. The Indian companies have already brought Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan into their submarine cable network, and this initiative would benefit Bangladesh by connecting it to the rest of the region. Internet service providers in Bangladesh have endorsed this proposal, but the Bangladesh Government is still undecided. However, these ventures have not been without occasional problems. The first is due to anti-competition practices by incumbent operators, as experienced by the Bharti Airtel venture in Sri Lanka. The company complained that the incumbent mobile telecom operators in Sri Lanka had not provided them with adequate points of interconnection, causing call congestion. A second challenge is that of security, as demonstrated by the case of Telenor Pakistan, which is interested in entering India.

Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 61 mobile tariff rates in the world. The cheapest intra-SAARC rate from Pakistan is four times that of the cheapest extra-SAARC rate from that country, and the cheapest rates from Sri Lanka to neighbouring SAARC countries are 40\u201350 percent higher than to the United States. In almost all the countries, the lowest rates charged to SAARC countries are higher than those charged to countries outside the region, including those to Europe, South-East Asia and the United States. High roaming tariffs are a deterrent to regional investment in the mobile telephony segment. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has raised this issue with the APT, wanting to find ways of reducing the global roaming rates within the region along the lines of the EU model. Reduced rates would enable Indian companies, such as Bharti Airtel, which are interested in penetrating other markets in the region, to offer attractive tariff packages to their subscribers in India when they are travelling to other SAARC countries. It has been proposed to reduce the termination charges for international calls originating in SAARC countries either by lowering them to the lowest charges on offer or by eliminating surcharges and levies currently applied to such calls. Lower rates from SAARC countries to other parts of the world are due to the lower termination rates charged by the foreign operators who receive the calls. Lower call rates to the Asia- Pacific region and the United States are made possible because their telecom services are much more competitive and their governments do not maintain artificially high termination charges. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have reformed their telecoms the most, resulting in lower rates. Given that foreign operators are not likely to be charging higher prices for the remaining SAARC countries, the higher rates prevailing in these other countries could mean that their operators are not passing on the lower costs to their customers due to the lack of competition in those markets. The differing call rates also indicate that there is greater competition in the mobile telephone segment than in the fixed-line segment. The inability to lower call rates, despite discussions in SATRC, evidently shows a lack of political will. 3 5 Multilateral and other commitments in telecommunication services All SAARC countries that are members of the WTO (except Maldives) have committed to liberalize their telecom services, with initial and revised offers under GATS (see annex 2, table A2.1). This highlights their willingness to negotiate telecom services and to bind in the liberalization policies discussed earlier. Their commitments and offers reflect the general orientation of the SAARC countries towards multilateral liberalization of telecom services. The annex table shows that mode 3 has tended to be the most sensitive of all the modes with mostly partial commitments, but with a few exceptions. These conditions typically include limits on foreign equity participation, on the number of licences and on the type of foreign presence that is permitted. Fixed- line services tend to be more cautiously committed than value-added services, such as the Internet and data processing. Mobile communications tend to be more liberally scheduled than landline services. Countries have taken most-favoured-nation exemptions 62 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia to apply different accounting rates to selected foreign operators or countries with which they have entered into international telecommunication service agreements. This includes telecommunications agreements entered into with other countries, which provide for preferential rates to be given to operators within the region. There are differences in the scope and extent of liberalization undertaken by SAARC countries that are members of the WTO. Pakistan has scheduled the most segments within its telecom services and has also made very liberal commitments, with no restrictions in modes 1 and 2, and relatively liberal commitments even in mode 3 (allowing 100 percent participation in some segments). This is in line with the greater degree of unilateral liberalization undertaken in that country, as mentioned earlier. Nepal has, for the most part, made unrestricted commitments in all the segments it has scheduled, with mode 3 subject to a very liberal ceiling of 80 percent foreign equity participation. Its deeper commitments compared to those made by other countries in the region are on account of its recent accession to the WTO. Commitments by Bangladesh and Sri Lanka reflect a tendency to protect both government monopoly operators and incumbents, again in line with their unilateral policy stance.

India\u2019s Uruguay Round commitments are narrow in scope and exclude long-distance and international voice services. The mode 3 commitments are quite restrictive, with foreign equity ceilings capped at 25 percent or 51 percent. Several of the modes remain unbound. However, India\u2019s revised offers are significantly more liberal, with a relaxation of the foreign equity ceiling and removal of conditions on foreign operators. This is unlike Pakistan and Sri Lanka whose initial offers remain unchanged for the most part. A comparison of the commitments and offers with the unilateral liberalization and regulatory reforms undertaken by the SAARC countries suggests that they have not bound their existing policies and reforms in the WTO. For instance, although India permits FDI participation of up to 74 percent in basic and cellular services, in the WTO it offers participation of up to 49 percent. There are two possible explanations for this: SAARC countries may wish to retain their policy space to roll back their unilateral liberalization, if necessary, without violating their multilateral obligations; or they may wish to sequence their liberalization by first opening up unilaterally before committing multilaterally, after they have understood the consequences of liberalization and feel prepared to do so with appropriate conditions. None of the South Asian countries have not accepted the WTO\u2019s Telecom Reference Paper on regulatory principles in its entirety, although many of its pro-competition provisions have been accepted in their national telecommunications policies. This shows that the countries have not been prepared to lock in their regulatory reforms. Telecom services do not feature prominently in most of the agreements that the SAARC countries have concluded with countries outside the region. However, whenever telecom services have been negotiated in those other agreements, such as in the Pakistan- China FTA, the Pakistan-Malaysia FTA or the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), the commitments are more liberal than under GATS. For example, shareholding restrictions have been relaxed compared to the GATS offers, and Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 63 additional subsectors have been scheduled in the bilateral agreements. This suggests that the South Asian countries may be willing to commit more liberally in the context of SAFTA than under GATS. 3 6 Looking ahead In view of the preceding discussion on policy trends and outcomes and the status of intraregional cooperation in telecoms, what are the likely prospects for integration of telecom services within South Asia, and what are the main issues and challenges that would need to be addressed for this purpose? The evidence presents a mixed picture of both the opportunities and practical difficulties. It is evident that, given the demographic and economic trends in South Asia, there remains considerable untapped potential in the telecom sector, and therefore promising prospects for its growth. All the countries in the region are interested in this sector from a development perspective. Improved telecom services could help them overcome the challenges of geography, reach out to remote areas, improve government efficiency through e-governance-related initiatives, improve delivery of services such as health care and education, and create opportunities in other sectors such as IT. Greater regional cooperation in this sector and better services could also help overcome the problem of poor land and air connectivity (as discussed at length later). Joint efforts for cross-border call tracking could also enhance security in the region. There are several large operators, particularly in India, that have a strategic interest in investing in the other countries of South Asia in view of the expanding subscriber base, particularly in the mobile telephony segment. Many of those operators are also keen to enter into infrastructure-sharing arrangements with other South Asian countries to overcome geographic constraints. The opening up of telecom services to FDI creates opportunities for such intraregional investments and partnerships. There are also areas of common concern, such as roaming tariffs and harmonization of certain services within the region. The fact that the commitment schedules under GATS already make room for preferential accounting rates for operators within the region indicates that such initiatives may be feasible under a regional agreement. Why then has there been such little progress in regional telecom initiatives? Apart from the general problems of lack of political will, strained relations between some of the larger member countries and limited intraregional trade that limits their interest in regional cooperation, there are certain other challenges, as pointed out in the preceding discussion. Although all the countries in the region have liberalized this sector to some extent, they still adopt an anti-competition policy stance", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e71eb00-b9f9-4ce2-864f-e7d577a35441": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e71eb00-b9f9-4ce2-864f-e7d577a35441", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36b35eaa6131558d14c79022cd2628fd37696fd23b0577233c9fb1c7523116e2"}}, "hash": "36b35eaa6131558d14c79022cd2628fd37696fd23b0577233c9fb1c7523116e2", "text": "that deters investors in certain markets. This is highlighted by the example of Bharti Airtel in Sri Lanka and the results of the survey on the telecom regulatory and policy environment for the various countries in the region. There are also issues relating to institutional transparency, regulatory independence, the investment climate and governance that need to be resolved to attract greater regional 64 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia investment in this sector. The lack of a pro-competition policy orientation is reflected in the nature of the countries\u2019 GATS commitments and the fact that they have not adopted all the GATS Reference Paper principles. Regional investment in telecoms is also constrained by the fact that some segments still remain closed to private participation. Security concerns also hamper cross-border investments, the associated movement of persons and the sharing of telecom infrastructure among some of the member countries. In light of these challenges, it may be optimistic to expect rapid progress in regional integration of telecom services. Actions at both the regional and national levels in three main areas could spur progress, as discussed below. First and foremost it would be important to accelerate the pace of discussions on regulatory cooperation and to deliver concrete results from initiatives on the harmonizing of numbers for identified services. Second, the countries need to focus on lowering intraregional call rates, given the wider benefits this could bring to many other sectors, including tourism, business travel, investment and potential outsourcing and ICT services within the region. However, it would require a more pro-competition policy stance within the countries to lower termination charges for calls originating in other SAARC countries and to pass on the benefits to consumers in these countries. The third issue to address is not specific to telecoms; it pertains to improving the investment climate and the institutional streamlining of investment approvals and clearances within the region. For several investment projects, even where the benefits are evident, there have been delays in approvals, resulting in uncertainties for investors and changes in their investment plans. In general, the South Asian region does not perform well in investment-related areas, such as setting up of businesses or governance structures. Because increased intraregional penetration and collaboration in telecom services will largely depend on investment opportunities, improving the investment climate operationally, and not just adopting a policy, is imperative. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 65 The importance of an efficient and well-regulated energy services sector is recognized. Access to secure, sustainable and reliable energy sources is critical for enabling developing countries to realize their long-term growth, equity and development objectives. Accordingly, many countries have undertaken significant reforms of their energy sectors to improve competitiveness and efficiency in energy supply and delivery. These reforms have ranged from allowing the entry of private participants \u2013 domestic and foreign, the unbundling of different services, restructuring of state utilities and the establishment of regulatory bodies. However, the reform process has been a complex one in many countries due to implications for a wide range of potentially conflicting commercial, social regulatory, infrastructural, geopolitical, national security and strategic objectives. In recent years, an important issue that has emerged regarding energy services concerns the scope and need for cross-country cooperation and regional integration with the objective of pooling energy resources and exploiting opportunities in energy trade. Various regional energy organizations and regional and subregional initiatives have been established to exploit complementarities in resource endowments and integrating power production and supply systems across countries. In South Asia, growing demand for energy has consistently outpaced growth in energy production, making energy security and improved competitiveness and efficiency in the energy sector a priority for all governments. The region\u2019s demand for energy has been growing at a rate of 9 percent per annum, and the deficit in energy production has doubled in the past decade; costly, frequent and widespread power outages are a common phenomenon.24 This hampers the region\u2019s growth prospects and makes most economies in South Asia highly dependent on energy imports and vulnerable to external shocks in energy prices. In the past decade or more, almost all the South Asian countries have embarked on power sector reforms, involving liberalization and promotion of private sector participation, promotion of foreign investment in energy infrastructure development, renewable energy and energy efficient technologies, expansion in the use of indigenous resources, diversification of energy supply sources and establishment of regulatory frameworks. There has also been considerable discussion about the need for regional cooperation in the energy sector, both under", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df9873c6-4c5b-49f5-972c-4807fb65a85f": {"__data__": {"id_": "df9873c6-4c5b-49f5-972c-4807fb65a85f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a24e6c93e288516551a574d09a56f190ee53a737f34dc50ee21f3c13ac9ae7d0"}}, "hash": "a24e6c93e288516551a574d09a56f190ee53a737f34dc50ee21f3c13ac9ae7d0", "text": "the auspices of SAARC and through bilateral and subregional initiatives. Many studies have highlighted the potential for energy trade in South Asia, given the geographical proximity and complementary energy resource endowments of the member countries. Governments in this region have become increasingly aware of the win-win possibilities of energy trade within South Asia. However, numerous political and institutional challenges have constrained this process, and cooperation and commercial efforts have remained confined to bilateral initiatives between certain SAARC member countries. 24 South Asian Journal, \u2018Energy Cooperation in South Asia\u2019, July\u2013September 2005, at: www.southasianmedia. net/Magazine/Journal/ 9_energy_cooperation.htm (accessed on 30 October 2009). Chapter 4 66 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia This chapter assesses the scope for regional energy cooperation in South Asia and the opportunities and challenges. The first section examines the energy status of the region compared with other regions. The energy status of individual countries is also discussed to stress the importance of energy services for the region and to identify the region\u2019s energy needs. Section 2 outlines the regulatory reforms and liberalization undertaken in the energy sector and the related outcomes. It also discusses the status of multilateral and other energy-related commitments made by the South Asian countries and how these affect their readiness to negotiate commercial opportunities in energy services with other countries. Section 3 describes existing and proposed intraregional cooperation initiatives and regional projects at the governmental, multilateral and firm levels and in the SAARC context and the progress made. Section 4 outlines the main challenges to SAARC regional energy cooperation and commercialization. The final section outlines some policy measures and specific steps that could be taken to translate the countries\u2019 understanding of the value and possibilities for regional energy cooperation into reality. Two important points need noting at the outset: the first concerns the meaning of the term \u2018energy services\u2019 as it is used here; the second pertains to regional resource availability and demand and what role trade can play. The term energy services as used in this chapter covers primary energy, renewable, non-renewable (from raw/fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas) and secondary energy, which is the usable form into which primary energy may be converted, such as electricity. However, owing to difficulties in distinguishing between energy goods and services (rather than energy per se) with regard to energy trade, the chapter focuses mainly on activities such as energy exploration, production, transmission and distribution relating to electricity. While there is also discussion of trade in energy products, such as natural gas, which fall under the purview of trade in goods rather than services, even here the focus is mainly on the related services for transport, distribution, engineering and consulting, which form part of the energy value-added chain. Thus the term energy services is used rather broadly as per the GATS classification, in which such activities constitute energy-related services. Because many parts of South Asia are not yet connected to the electricity grid, the chapter focuses on how regional cooperation could be a means to alleviating this problem, such as through the larger players in the region investing in the smaller countries by providing foreign exchange earnings for the less- developed countries\u2019 electricity exports and through regulatory cooperation. With regard to regional endowments and demand, although this chapter focuses on regional trade in energy services as a means of alleviating supply constraints, it is well recognized that regional resources and their pooling are not sufficient to meet the growing energy requirements. With an installed power generation capacity of about 152 gigawatts and an annual generation of around 740 terawatt hours, and with demand projected to grow at 6.6\u201311.5 percent per annum over the next two decades, regional trade in energy services will clearly not meet the gap (Ghani and Ahmed: 2009: 347). The chapter highlights how tapping complementarities within the region, with energy/electricity exports from surplus to deficit countries, in addition to various national policy actions, could help reduce the Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 67 demand-supply gap of some of the larger countries while also providing export earnings to the smaller countries. 4 1 Status of the energy sector and its performance in South Asia The South Asian countries rely on a mix of commercial energy sources, which include natural gas, oil, hydropower and coal. They are also highly dependent on energy imports, mainly in the form of oil imports.

The SAARC region has the lowest energy consumption per capita among all geographic regions. Its per capita energy consumption (at 318 kg) of oil equivalent) is half that of ASEAN, around 60 percent that of Africa and roughly one fourth of the world average of 1,226 kg. of oil equivalent. This low consumption per capita in South Asia reflects the low levels of income in the region, the poor state of its energy infrastructure and lack of basic access to energy facilities for a significant proportion of the population. However, the region\u2019s average annual growth rate of per capita energy consumption of 1.4 percent in the 2000\u20132006 period was broadly comparable to that of other regions and exceeded the world average of 1.1 percent. Moreover, it has been showing an upward trend in recent years. The region has recorded one of the largest declines in energy intensity, greater than the average decline for the world, reflecting efficiency improvements in energy utilization over time. While all the SAARC countries have been exhibiting improvements in energy efficiency, India has recorded the greatest improvements during the past decade (UNESCAP, 2008). Thus the picture that emerges is of a region that is confronted with infrastructural and accessibility problems in the energy sector, combined with growing energy requirements due to economic growth and rising incomes. There is a trend towards lower energy intensity in some countries as a result of their efforts to improve efficiency in energy use. The SAARC region\u2019s dependence on energy imports has been increasing in recent years. Energy imports as a share of total energy supply increased from around 12 percent in 1990 to close to 30 percent in 2006, while comparable figures for the world indicate a decline over this same period, from 11 percent to around 9 percent, and likewise in other regions. This suggests that the growth in energy consumption in the South Asian region has not been matched by commensurate increases in energy supply, thereby increasing the region\u2019s overall dependence on energy imports. This dependence also reflects the lack of diversification and lack of indigenization of energy supply sources in the SAARC countries, with a continued dominance of coal and oil in their commercial energy mix. Yet at the same time, interestingly, intraregional energy exports among SAARC countries rose between 1990 and 2006, which indicates the potential for leveraging supply and demand complementarities and for further energy trade within the region (ibid.: 204). 68 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 4.1.1 Energy sector trends in individual countries South Asia accounts for about 5.9 percent of the world\u2019s total commercial energy consumption. The countries in this region are endowed with a mix of energy resources, including hydropower, coal, natural gas and oil. Bangladesh and Pakistan have abundant natural gas reserves, India has coal reserves, and Bhutan and Nepal have considerable hydropower resources. None of the countries have significant oil reserves. This mix of energy resources largely determines the pattern of commercial energy consumption in the region and the countries\u2019 overall dependence on energy imports. There are two noteworthy features of the resource endowments and energy production patterns in South Asia. First is the large, unexploited potential in most forms of energy resources, in particular, natural gas and hydropower resources. Less than 5 percent of the hydropower potential in Nepal and Bhutan has been exploited, and only a mere fraction of Bangladesh\u2019s natural gas reserves have been tapped thus far (table 4.1). The latter clearly reflects the need for huge investments in this sector if these countries are to become more self-reliant on indigenous resources. A second important feature is the complementarity of resource endowments among the countries, which indicates the scope for regional cooperation and trade to pool and harness each other\u2019s resources.

Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 69 The mix of energy usage also varies among the countries, in line with the varied endowment mix. For instance, India\u2019s energy basket is dominated by coal, which it has in large supply, while Bhutan\u2019s main source of energy is hydropower, as is Nepal\u2019s, though to a lesser extent, and Bangladesh relies heavily on its abundant supplies of natural gas (figure 4.1). The countries of South Asia lack diversity of energy resources, with all the countries relying on a single source for half or more of their energy requirements. Alternative and renewable energy sources account for only a negligible proportion of the energy basket and are evident only in India. Figure 4 1: Commercial energy mix in South Asian countries (% shares) Source: United States Agency for International Development (USAID), South Asia Regional Initiative/Energy (SARI/Energy) Program, 2006: 2\u20133, figure 2-1. An examination of the data on electricity production and sources of electricity over the 1990\u20132004 period indicates that there has been some shift in the pattern of resource use in the larger countries. Bangladesh, India and Pakistan have increased their reliance on natural gas for electricity production and reduced their dependence on hydropower resources, while in Sri Lanka there is increased dependence on oil (table 4.2). South Asia as a whole is broadly comparable with the rest of the world in its use of gas, oil and hydropower as sources of electricity, but the region is more dependent on coal-based electricity production than the rest of the world and lags behind the world in nuclear- based electricity production. Thus, the countries are largely dependent on traditional sources of energy for electricity production, though natural gas has gradually been gaining in importance over the years. There is scope for regional cooperation and for trade and related investments in natural gas. As noted earlier, the South Asian countries are dependent on energy imports to meet their commercial energy requirements. In 2004, energy imports constituted between 9 percent and 59 percent of their total (commercial and non-commercial) energy requirements, 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Nepal Pakistan Sri Lanka 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Other Oil Hydro Coal Gas 13 9 22 59 11 18 41 30 24 29 100 87 26 78 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Import dependence as a percent of total energy Import dependence as a percent of commercial energy 70 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia with an average import dependence of around 25 percent (figure 4.2). Excluding non- commercial energy sources, such as wood, animal waste and biomass, which constitute around half of the region\u2019s total energy consumption, the reliance on energy imports for meeting commercial energy requirements was very high, averaging around 53 percent, and ranging from 18 percent in Pakistan to 100 percent in Maldives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null,

In particular, in India the share of imports in its total energy supply grew from 10 percent in 1990 to nearly 30 percent in 2006 (although this rise is broadly comparable to that witnessed in other high-growth economies in South-East Asia), and its energy imports increased 70 percent (in volume terms) over this period. According to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) (2006: 2-5), India and Pakistan can be characterized as energy-crisis countries, owing to their high energy intensity, their heavy dependence on energy imports as well as the large share of these imports as inputs in their exports. The latter is a reflection of the proportion of export earnings absorbed by energy imports and it also reflects their growing consumption of all major forms of energy supply, which has not been matched with commensurate growth in indigenous sources of energy supply or diversification to other forms of energy, as noted earlier. Data on growth trends in energy consumption for oil, coal and natural gas indicate the predominance of certain energy sources in each country as well as some shifts in consumption patterns. In Bangladesh and India, consumption of natural gas has increased compared with that of other sources, as reflected in the growing share of natural gas in their energy baskets. In India, the greatest increase in imports over the 1990\u20132004 period has been in petroleum and coal, though there is a perceptible shift towards natural gas imports, as noted earlier in the context of electricity production (USAID, 2006). Projections for both India and Pakistan indicate increasing deficits in natural gas over the period 2010\u2013 2020 (figure 4.3). Thus, clearly, access to natural gas resources and exploitation of domestic deposits will be important for both these countries in the medium and long terms. At the same time, the growing demand and projected deficits of these two countries and Bangladesh\u2019s sizeable natural gas endowments points to considerable potential for trade in natural gas within the region (and also with countries outside the region). 72 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Figure 4 3: Projected deficits in natural gas in India and Pakistan, 2010, 2015, 2020 (million metric standard cubic metres per day) Source: Reproduced from World Bank, 2008: 42, figure 5.3. Trends in electricity production and consumption indicate prospects of growing power shortages, particularly in the larger countries. This points to the potential for electricity trade through integration of power systems. Production of electricity has grown more slowly than its consumption in all the countries in South Asia. Data for Bhutan and India reflect bilateral trade in electricity (and associated cross-border investment flows) between these two countries and are indicative of the subregional potential for electricity trade in South Asia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6a623eb-a309-4fa4-9b73-bf9a0b708d9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6a623eb-a309-4fa4-9b73-bf9a0b708d9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "223a22a9f1699853c2219b0b6361d62a219d1ab468e737c95d9560fd5df5de4d"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef7be362-eef5-4fb7-ae0b-09728a884b26", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61c70c984451684572b50fb2e151ea9444f1be9b0bc937eb884945c844cf741e"}}, "hash": "d6ce3d5ea7a98cceb3a5c03bd41b85ebf047ff237f54b7e726d95e9c53df8867", "text": "Table 4 3: Average growth of electricity production and consumption (%) and net electricity imports of South Asian countries (billion kWh) Country Consumption Production* Net electricity imports 1996\u20132000 2001\u20132006 1996\u20132000 2001\u20132006 2000 2005 Bangladesh 7.8 9.39 7.5 7.44 0 0 Bhutan 28.33 22.22 1.3 6.58 -1.44 -1.542 India 3.37 5.5 5.97 4.86 1.345 1.554 Maldives 0 16.67 0 16.67 0 0 Nepal 8.45 9.19 7.82 8.05 0.101 0.108 Pakistan 4.05 6.59 4.18 6.18 0 0 Sri Lanka 6.63 4.64 6.6 4.55 0 0 Source: United States Energy Information Administration, at: http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/countries/ (accessed 30 October 2009).

Juxtaposing these projections and patterns of demand against the growing import dependence, relatively high energy intensity, capacity shortages and the nature of energy resource endowments of this region, it is evident that energy security is a critical issue for South Asian countries. Their main challenges, particularly for India and Pakistan, are securing increased access to diverse sources of energy as well as improving energy efficiency. For the smaller countries as well as Bangladesh, the most critical issue is improving their ability to exploit domestic energy resources and leveraging those resources to enhance their regional export opportunities. 4 2 Policy and regulatory reforms The energy sector faces various infrastructural, institutional, operational and financial challenges in South Asia. Rapidly growing demand combined with supply shortages has been a major constraint on growth in the region. Energy utilities in South Asia are commercially unviable, with poor quality of service delivery. Only a minority of the population in the region has access to energy sources. Electricity transmission and distribution losses are very high due to leakage, weak networks and poor monitoring. In addition, energy-related environmental threats plague the region, which necessitates consideration of alternative and renewable energy sources and improvement in energy efficiency. Hence, there is a clear need for power sector reforms and associated institutional restructuring and privatization, as acknowledged in all the countries. However, reforms in the power sector are at varying stages of implementation in the different countries. The main feature of these reforms has been the increased role of the private sector and liberalization of FDI in several important segments. Private participation in power generation is now allowed in all the countries, which in turn has attracted domestic and international investments in energy exploration and generation in many of them. The main form of private participation has been by independent power producers (IPPs) under long- term power purchase agreements, with the buyer typically the incumbent power company or the state electricity board. Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka have encouraged private companies to participate in the exploration and production of oil and gas. In their drive for energy security, some of the countries have encouraged the acquisition of overseas energy assets by both their public and private sector companies.25 Liberalization has led to the emergence of corporate players, especially in India, who are interested in investing in other markets in the region. There have also been complementary structural reforms, including disinvestment, restructuring and corporati-zation of public sector companies, and moves towards more reasonable and competitive tariffs. The existing state-owned utilities have been unbundled 25 ONGC Videsh, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of India\u2019s largest oil and gas producer, has acquired oil and gas fields overseas. India\u2019s overseas investments in oil fields are expected to amount to US$3 billion in the near future. 74 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia into separate functional companies to improve their financial position and operational efficiency. Regulatory agencies have also been established. The structural reforms have been driven by explicit policies to improve access to electricity in all the countries of this region. India has liberalized the most, having opened up most of its energy segments. As pointed out in many studies, reforms in South Asia need to go further. Although private contributions to the national generating capacity have increased to 20\u201330 percent, the public sector continues to dominate. The high tariffs charged by IPPs, due to perceived risks and the high cost of debt finance, have caused financial distress to the state electricity boards. They are faced with costly power purchase agreements while earning low revenues from retail electricity due to commercially unviable tariffs. Political interference continues to affect electricity pricing. Moreover, reforms have not been undertaken in the distribution sector. Commercial distribution at viable tariff rates is required to attract private investment in generation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6212f04-fb27-4761-8a44-551fc4914b5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6212f04-fb27-4761-8a44-551fc4914b5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4f87ac5561398d090d9072defb50226225aee6c6f832e0cb44d6a731aad1ad3"}, "2": {"node_id": "96fb5044-ab97-4524-aa28-d7cd0c343421", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a050d05052f0282b046f886896f0aa79ff9de6fa0f23db491b1ac075355cfc14"}}, "hash": "76f3d67684bace503023185f06fe4c9eaa32587434cfc3267b35f380b74914ba", "text": "Commercial distribution at viable tariff rates is required to attract private investment in generation.

This obviously reflects their unwillingness and unpreparedness to enter into negotiations on this sector multilaterally, despite having undertaken reforms to encourage private participation, both domestic and foreign. This conservative stance at the multilateral level is due to the sensitive nature of energy services, stemming from its geopolitical and strategic importance. It is also because the sector still remains largely state-dominated despite the entry of private players. Energy exploration is the main segment that has been opened up to private participation. Other segments, such as transmission, distribution and pricing, are still under the control of electricity boards and state-owned power utilities for various social and infrastructural reasons. Thus the regulatory environment is still not conducive to private investment and the playing field is still not level for public and private players, despite sectoral reforms in most countries of the region. Consequently, it is a sector where unilateral liberalization has proceeded more rapidly than multilateral liberalization, indicating that countries prefer to retain the possibility of reversing policies, if so required, and to learn from their unilateral liberalization before committing multilaterally. The energy sector does figure in some of the bilateral and extraregional agreements signed by the SAARC member countries. For instance, the Pakistan-China FTA includes energy among the five major sectors identified for cooperation between the two countries. Likewise, the proposed Pakistan-Afghanistan Economic Cooperation Agreement includes energy and the specific issue of gas pipelines as an item for discussion. The India-Singapore CECA covers services incidental to electricity distribution. The proposed Bangladesh-United States Trade and Investment Framework Agreement and the proposed Bangladesh-Russia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 75 FTA both cover the power sector. The energy sector is one area of focus of the BIMSTEC subregional agreement, to which several of the SAARC countries are signatories. Its stated objectives include establishing power exchange and grid connections among member countries, creating a common regulatory framework, installing a trans-BIMSTEC gas pipeline, promoting hydropower projects and the use of non-conventional sources of energy, and technical cooperation. Because many member countries of SAARC are also members of BIMSTEC, it is not surprising that many of the areas identified for cooperation are quite similar across the two regional blocs. Overall, there has been significant reform and change in the operating and regulatory structure of energy services in most of the South Asian countries. The focus of deregulation has been to facilitate investments in infrastructure and in discovery of energy resources and to improve efficiency in energy utilization. However, the basic structure of state-owned utilities remains unchanged, though there are private players in selected segments, and non-commercial considerations still dominate the functioning of this sector. 4 4 Intraregional cooperation and initiatives Member governments, both in the context of SAARC discussions as well as in bilateral discussions, have generally agreed that energy cooperation and trade in South Asia are important to address their energy security interests. Many studies have noted the scope for mutual benefit from exports of power generation surpluses from Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal to meet the huge power deficits in India. They have also pointed to the need to structure this generation mix in a way that will meet the region\u2019s demand patterns and enable the lowering of electricity prices for all the countries concerned. For instance, effective development of the huge hydropower potential of Bhutan and Nepal could serve regional electricity needs while also addressing those countries\u2019 trade deficits with partner countries like India. Tables 4.4 and 4.5 depict the potential for cross-border energy trade in the eastern, northern and western regions of SAARC, based on earlier studies.

There could be considerable direct benefits from energy cooperation in the region associated with investments in energy supply and demand technologies as well as environment- related outcomes. According to one source, the benefits could be as large as US$359 billion for the 2010\u20132030 period, or 0.98 percent of the region\u2019s GDP (Shukla et al., 2003: 114). The projected indirect benefits from such regional cooperation include the development of water markets, infrastructure development and increased agricultural productivity as a result of better irrigation. Hence, the cost of not cooperating in the energy sector would be quite high. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 77 4.4.1 Bilateral and subregional cooperation: Successes and failures Energy cooperation within SAARC has progressed mainly at the bilateral level, between India and Nepal and India and Bhutan. It has taken the form of energy exchanges and is largely confined to hydroelectric power, though there have also been some discussions regarding natural gas and renewable energy. In addition, there are some subregional initiatives, but these remain only at the conceptual stage so far. The few instances of bilateral cooperation highlight the potential that exists in the region. The most successful case is that of electricity trade between Bhutan and India. Once an importer of electricity from India, today Bhutan exports about 75 percent of its electric power to India while importing all its petrol requirements from India. Its electricity exports are the single largest source of export earnings for Bhutan. The history of Indo-Bhutanese cooperation in the energy sector dates back to the 1960s, to the signing of the first bilateral agreement between the two countries. That agreement enabled the construction of a barrage in Bhutan and a power plant in West Bengal at an agreed rate of royalty payments by India to Bhutan and agreement on the supply of free power and on the export of power to parts of Bhutan from India.26 The Bhutanese Government has received technical and financial assistance from the Indian Government for the development of its hydropower resources, including grant assistance for Bhutan\u2019s first hydroelectric plant at Joshina. Today, there are several hydropower projects from which Bhutan exports energy to India. For example, 84 percent of the energy generated from the Chukha plant (which was developed as a joint venture between the two countries\u2019 governments) is exported to India. The Power Trading Corporation (PTC) is responsible for this trade. During the 1992\u20132000 period, India purchased an average of 1,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of power per year. Another such joint project is the 60 MW Kurichhu Hydroelectric Power Project in eastern Bhutan, primarily for domestic consumption, but the surplus is sold by the PTC to India\u2019s Damodar Valley Corporation and West Bengal Electricity Board, and the generating units have been connected to the Indian grid. Another successful example is the 1,020 MW Tala Hydropower Project, which exports most of its output to northern India. This was also the first successful public-private partnership of its kind. In 2006, the two governments signed a framework agreement on hydropower development and trade involving public and private participation. The agreement also covers issues of renewable energy and accelerated hydropower development. There are plans to jointly develop three more projects in Bhutan, in addition to upgrading the existing transmission link to enable 5,000 MW of electricity imports into India by 2020.

The revenue inflows from the Tala project are being used by the Bhutanese Government to expand its social services network. The successful bilateral relationship between Bhutan and India has been made possible by political will, favourable terms of bilateral financing, political stability and good relations between the two countries. 26 Under the Jaldhaka Hydroelectric project, India supplies electricity to border towns in Bhutan. 78 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Indo-Nepalese cooperation in energy has not been as successful due to political and infrastructural challenges. Nonetheless, some cases are worth highlighting, The cooperation has mainly involved Indian financial and technical assistance to four hydroelectric schemes in Nepal. The Power Trade Agreement signed between India and Nepal in 1996 allows contracting parties (both governmental and private) to enter into separate agreements for deciding terms and conditions regarding power supply and tariffs, thus creating opportunities for domestic and foreign private investors to invest in hydropower development in Nepal for the sale of power in India. India\u2019s Power Trading Corporation is in charge of issues pertaining to power exchange with Nepal and of finalizing commercial and technical arrangements with the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA). The PTC and NEA are responsible for the sale of surplus power between the countries. There are 22 interconnection points between the two countries for power exchange. In 2004, Nepal supplied 110.7 GWh of electricity to India, which generated revenues of 573 million Nepalese rupees for the country. In turn, Nepal has received energy from India under the Koshi and Tanakpur treaties. In view of India\u2019s growing energy demand and Nepal\u2019s large, untapped hydropower potential, there is an understanding between the two governments to increase the exchange of electricity by extending transmission lines at selected border points. Studies show that projects of about 42,000 MW are economically feasible in Nepal, while the country\u2019s current installed capacity is only 600 MW. For increased transfer of power, transmission facilities need to be expanded. Developing the transmission network could potentially enable Nepal to export power to India during the wet season and import power from India during the dry season. Towards this end, several other projects have been identified for cooperation, including the Pancheswar Multipurpose Project, the Sapta Kosi High Dam Multipurpose Project and the West Seti, Karnali and Burhi Gandaki projects. Some of these projects have the potential to generate huge amounts of peaking power and huge revenues for Nepal. Joint technical expert groups have been formed to prepare feasibility studies for some of the projects. Tables 4.6 and 4.7 show the revenues generated from electricity sales by Bhutan and Nepal to India and indicate the importance of the Indian market for their energy resources. The benefits accruing to these countries from power trade with India are evident. Energy exports can clearly serve as a means of redressing the trade imbalance between these two countries and India. Indeed, the ADB projects that Bhutan\u2019s current-account deficit with India could move into surplus as a result of its hydropower exports (ADB, 2006).

India and Sri Lanka are in discussions about laying a transmission line between the two countries. This line would connect Madurai and New Anuradhapura substations and would be 385 km long, including a 30 km submarine cable. This cable would carry power from India to Sri Lanka but could potentially carry power in the reverse direction too, depending on seasonal variations and load profiles. The line would have an initial capacity of 500 MW and another 500 MW later. Although much of the bilateral cooperation efforts in the energy sector in South Asia are driven by intergovern-mental agreements and initiatives, increasingly, bilateral energy cooperation is facilitated by the liberalization of the energy market, particularly in India. This has not only led to growing private sector participation and the presence of multinational energy companies in a range of activities in the region, including generation, trans- mission and distribution (excluding nuclear power); there has also been growing interest among private players to penetrate other markets. The opening up of the energy sector to international competitive bidding has made possible such cross-border private participation. Indian companies have submitted proposals for investments in other SAARC countries. The Government of Nepal awarded the 200-MW Upper Karnali hydroelectric project to the GMR group of companies in India.27 Two Indian firms, the GMR Group and the state-owned Satluj Jai Vidyut Nigam, are setting up hydroelectric stations in Nepal.

Indian Oil is one of the largest retailers of petroleum products in Sri Lanka. The Tata Group recently submitted a proposal to develop an integrated steel and power facility in Bangladesh, which would use local gas and coal resources for generating electricity intended for export to India (although this proposal has since been withdrawn). Several Indian civil engineering firms, such as NCC Limited and Continental Construction Ltd., are in the running for contracts for hydroelectric power projects in Nepal. A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Tata Power Company Ltd. (TPC), TPTCL, is part owner of the transmission line between the Tala project in Bhutan and Delhi. It is entering into joint projects with SN Power, the largest IPP in Nepal, for the development of hydropower resources in Nepal, Bhutan and the border between India and Nepal. The Indian Government is increasingly looking at ways to help its private sector companies secure projects in Bhutan and Nepal, marking a shift from its traditional approach of using state-owned companies for energy diplomacy in the region. Foreign investment is also playing a role in furthering regional cooperation in energy. As noted earlier, the opening up of this sector to FDI and its unbundling has created opportunities for cross-border investments by companies both within the region and outside. Multinational energy companies present in India and other countries in South Asia are showing interest in doing business in other countries in the region. The Government of Bhutan is considering allowing 100 percent foreign equity investment by Indian companies in several sectors, including hydropower. In contrast to India-Nepal and India-Bhutan bilateral cooperation, cooperation between India and Pakistan and India and Bangladesh have been fraught with challenges and neither has materialized. For instance, there have been discussions about a pipeline for transporting natural gas from northeastern Bangladesh to West Bengal and north India. Firms such as Petrobangla in Bangladesh have shown interest in such export possibilities, but plans have stalled due to concerns about domestic availability and growing demand within Bangladesh. Extraregional issues extending beyond SAARC to Myanmar to the east and to the Islamic Republic of Iran to the west have also complicated India\u2019s bilateral dynamic with Bangladesh and Pakistan. India has been keen to import gas from certain gas fields in Myanmar. The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and the Gas Authority of India have 20 percent and 10 percent shares, respectively, in one of Myanmar\u2019s gas fields and have been interested in exporting via a gas pipeline that links the Myanmar gas field to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c951c537-4dff-4691-82b1-c88310c82638": {"__data__": {"id_": "c951c537-4dff-4691-82b1-c88310c82638", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7284351fc7e51bbd1919ad1fc796878eb4e8ed1f244fd34c999d2f48f4f0679"}}, "hash": "d7284351fc7e51bbd1919ad1fc796878eb4e8ed1f244fd34c999d2f48f4f0679", "text": "India via Bangladesh. This was seen as a win-win project proposal: Bangladesh would have received investments of US$350 million and would have earned US$100 million in transmission fees, US$100 million as one-off, right-of-way charges and US$25 million each year for sharing management expertise, while India would have been able to import gas for its north-eastern state of Tripura and through Bangladesh to West Bengal. However, this proposal failed to materialize due to counter- demands by Bangladesh that India was not ready to meet for reasons of internal security Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 81 and strategic interests. In return for transit rights, Bangladesh had insisted on a reduction of non-tariff barriers by India to reduce its trade imbalance with India, a corridor via India for Nepalese goods to reach Bangladeshi ports and access to Nepal and Bhutan through India for imports of hydroelectricity from those countries. The shelving of this pipeline project forced India to consider a longer route for transporting the gas from Myanmar that bypasses Bangladesh, thus also raising costs by an estimated US$3 billion. In turn, Bangladesh also lost a good opportunity to earn revenues and develop its energy infrastructure. Likewise, India\u2019s plans to access natural gas reserves in the Islamic Republic of Iran through a gas pipeline from the latter\u2019s South Pars natural gas field via Afghanistan and Pakistan have not materialized. Pakistan was close to signing a pricing formula with India and the Islamic Republic of Iran for building this much-delayed US$7 billion pipeline. But the project was stillborn due in part to the failure of India and Pakistan to reach an agreement on account of security concerns and political differences as well as other geopolitical issues involving the Russian Federation and the United States. Again, this has meant that potential benefits to Pakistan in the form of infrastructure development, energy security and transit fees and to India in the form of increased energy security have been foregone. Regional interconnection of transmission systems of these four countries has also been an area of focus under the USAID SARI/Energy programme. The Four Borders Region project under this programme aims at exploiting regional power transfer opportunities in order to improve power system reliability, diversify sources of energy supply, increase energy security, improve efficiency and lower costs to consumers. However, to date, this project has not been able to achieve power exchange between Bangladesh and the other countries. Overall, the energy sector in South Asia remains much less integrated than in many other regions. Only the most minimal form of bilateral cooperation has been achieved and that too involves only a handful of countries within the region. Bilateral prospects between other sets of countries and subregional prospects across a wider group of countries still remain to be exploited. Most of the discussions have either not gone beyond the conceptual level or at most have made it only to the drawing board. 4.4.2 Regional forums and initiatives There are some regional and subregional forums in which cross-border trade, investment and cooperation in the energy sector and possible synergies have been discussed. At the SAARC level, there have been efforts to facilitate dialogue on regional cooperation in the sector and to promote capacity-building and information dissemination. The real push came at the 12th SAARC Summit in 2004, where it was decided to undertake a study on South Asian Energy Cooperation, including the concept of an \u201cenergy ring\u201d (i.e. a regional transmission link in the region, which would consist of transnational lines for trade in electricity, gas and oil).28 The 28 In 2002, a SAARC technical committee on energy and power recommended a power grid that would run through Bangladesh, Nepal, India and Bhutan, which would provide 100,000 MW of power for use by all four countries (World Bank, 2008). 82 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia joint statement by SAARC energy ministers clearly recognizes the importance of regional cooperation for promoting trade and investment in the energy sector and its bearing on accelerated social, economic, industrial and technological development in the region. The SAARC Working Group on Energy has also identified a number of areas for regional cooperation. The SAARC Energy Centre (SEC) was established in March 2006 in Islamabad. So far, the work under SAARC, and specifically the SEC, has focused on matters such as renewable energy projects in South Asia, developing a regional energy database, training workshops for sharing experiences and best practices, interdependence of policies in the energy sector and in other sectors, and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16cb619c-086d-4be6-b92f-5fc056dae68e": {"__data__": {"id_": "16cb619c-086d-4be6-b92f-5fc056dae68e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f7e6a7bf661ea7e149030825b3545292ccf68a1ad70fa4391ea911ca50a20bd"}}, "hash": "6f7e6a7bf661ea7e149030825b3545292ccf68a1ad70fa4391ea911ca50a20bd", "text": "exchanges of experts and officials of energy research institutes in the region. An agreement has been signed between the SAARC Secretariat and the ADB for technical assistance to SAARC on energy sector dialogue and the SEC\u2019s capacity development project, which mainly consists of a SAARC regional energy trade study. A regional committee prepared a survey report on the demand for surplus power and electricity as well as a load forecast over the medium term, which is to form the basis for discussing energy trade in the region. However, most of the discussions under SAARC remain simply proposals and vision statements, with no concrete outcomes. Various multilateral and other funding agencies have also shown considerable interest in promoting regional energy cooperation in South Asia. One of these is the aforementioned SARI/Energy programme of USAID, which aims to promote energy security through three activities: cross-border energy trade, creation of energy markets and partnerships to facilitate access to clean energy. This should enable more efficient regional energy resource utilization, increase the region access to energy sources and mitigate the environmental impacts of energy production. In the context of cross-border trade, the main focus of this regional initiative is to identify potential energy projects and to provide technical assistance for the development of projects. Some of those efforts include pre-feasibility studies of projects (such as the Nepal-India petroleum pipeline); a power exchange tracker, which would provide a profile of the cross-border exchange of electricity, investment infrastructure and potential for additional cross-border exchange among SARI/Energy participating countries; and a regional clean coal partnership. With regard to promoting regional energy markets, SARI\u2019s activities have focused on information dissemination and capacity-building. On clean energy access, there have been some activities to support private sector financial institutions to set up equity and venture funds for investments in clean energy projects and to engage the private sector in the region in various clean energy projects, such as in hydropower and energy efficiency programmes. But as with SAARC, the bulk of the work has been related to capacity-building, best practices sharing and identification of possibilities rather than actual implementation of concrete projects. Other multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the ADB have also been involved in country-level as well as cross-country projects at a bilateral level, mainly in the form of technical and financial assistance. Clearly, this sector has attracted considerable attention from various funding agencies in the context of infrastructure financing, investment, Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 83 public-private partnerships, electricity reforms and technical assistance-related issues of importance to this sector. 4 5 Obstacles to the creation of a regional energy market Although there has been some progress with energy cooperation and trade at the bilateral level, these remain confined to isolated projects. There has been only a limited attempt to systematically tap the region\u2019s energy potential. For instance, there is still no transmission grid with sufficient capacity to carry hydropower from Nepal and Bhutan to India, and no regional transmission grid. Subregional cooperation has failed and energy cooperation between some partner countries has not taken off at all. South Asia thus remains one of the least integrated regions for energy. This situation is due to a variety of political, institutional, infrastructural and geographic factors. Perhaps the greatest challenge is the political and security situation in the region. Political instability in Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka has deterred investments in the energy sector in these countries, thus inhibiting the scope for energy trade. Poor political relations and misgivings between several countries in SAARC have been a major deterrent. Implementation of important treaties has been held up due to political tensions between governments, such as India and Nepal. The possible export of surplus power to India by IPPs in Pakistan failed due to strained relations and uncertainties about possible supply disruptions. Likewise, political misgivings led to the failure of a proposal for gas and power export from Bangladesh to India by Indian and international investors. The absence of good political relations and trust between key players in the region and the lack of political stability in several of the countries has made the climate unattractive for bilateral and intraregional cooperation in the energy sector. A related constraint is the prevailing ideology of self-sufficiency that underlies moves towards energy security. Energy exports are seen as cutting into the domestic supply of energy resources and creating future uncertainties, rather than as a means to achieving greater energy security and improved efficiency, with wider implications for economic growth. Such a mindset, which perceives trade in energy as nothing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f742b94f-7689-41b9-a1ff-35745b4eda75": {"__data__": {"id_": "f742b94f-7689-41b9-a1ff-35745b4eda75", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "459d02265430d90b484a2ed2f33dfafdfe3619f856e2d3ccf5ad5e625e1a19dd"}}, "hash": "459d02265430d90b484a2ed2f33dfafdfe3619f856e2d3ccf5ad5e625e1a19dd", "text": "more than trade and does not recognize its longer-term benefits, is a major deterrent to regional energy cooperation. Another constraining factor is the lack of institutional arrangements and lead institutions responsible for energy cooperation arrangements. Moreover, the institutional capacity for power development, planning and implementation in the region is inadequate. Joint development and utilization of power is impeded by the absence of a regional network of institutions and the lack of identified focal institutions in each country to work out power purchase agreements and the procedural and legal issues involved. There is also an absence of regional power trading frameworks to establish basic principles of power trading and the rights and obligations of participants, which would define the procedures for full-cost recovery and outline the elements for equitable sharing of benefits. One of the problems in this regard has been a lack of clarity on how to integrate and expand the electricity grids in 84 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia the region. Without such frameworks, intergovernmental agreements in the energy sector cannot be drafted. Despite inadequate technical and planning capabilities in several South Asian countries, they have been reluctant to cooperate with countries, such as India, which have this technical capacity.29 There are also infrastructural and resource-specific challenges. Cross-border electricity trading is constrained by the absence of a transmission grid with enough capacity to carry hydropower from Nepal and Bhutan to India, as well as the absence of generation plants, causing most of the potential in hydropower to remain untapped. According to some studies, given the dynamics of energy demand in India, the unpredictability of river flows and high costs of hydropower development, regional transmission lines may be difficult to build and there is unlikely to be any large-scale development to serve regional demand in the foreseeable future. Some experts have noted that given the infrastructural requirements and resource dynamics of this region, the likely scenario would be isolated projects with dedicated plants to load centres in India rather than a regional transmission grid. The ownership and financing structure in the energy sector of the South Asian countries is also problematic: It is not mature enough to support regional cooperation. Although reforms have made possible a greater role for the private sector, created multiple buyers and sellers and led to the establishment of regulatory bodies, public players still predominate and the role of private players is still limited. The poor operational and financial performance of electricity utilities in the South Asian countries constrains energy trade and investment in the region. The utilities suffer from problems of low quality and unreliable power systems, large losses due to uneconomic pricing and misuse of power and huge supply constraints, which result in load shedding and power shortages during peak hours. For instance, the total financial losses of all SEBs in India amounted to US$4.9 billion, or 1.2 percent of GDP, in 2005, while Nepal\u2019s loss was as high as 25 percent in 2005 and that of the Bangladesh Power Development Board exceeded US$100 million in 2006. Financial constraints in turn pose a serious problem for energy development. Thus it is extremely difficult for the region\u2019s power utilities to fulfil contractual obligations with IPPs and to engage in power trade arrangements. Another major problem is the lack of commercial considerations in the pricing of power and the lack of trans-parency and accountability in the region\u2019s power systems. Without economic rationalization of power tariffs and harmonization of pricing policies among the South Asian countries, public undertakings have a problem paying IPPs their asking price for power while at the same time having to charge low rates to customers. Regional electricity trade would require that the power generated be made available at competitive prices for export to neighbouring countries, which in turn would require regulatory cooperation among the countries. 29 This is also why there has not been a wider integration of energy, environment and transport systems in the region. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 85 In sum, the unstable political environment, lack of infrastructure, inadequate institutional and legal frameworks, lack of political commitment and economic barriers are obstacles to regional energy cooperation. Such factors have made it difficult to harmonize regulations, agree on common policies and standards and develop trading mechanisms. 4 6 Steps needed to deepen energy integration It is evident from the preceding discussion that opportunities for intraregional trade in energy remain largely untapped in South Asia.

However, governments in this region are increasingly becoming aware of the win-win opportunities offered by such trade, particularly in electricity and natural gas. They are also looking to extend commercial relations beyond the South Asian region to countries such as the Islamic Republic of Iran, Myanmar and Turkmenistan. As outlined in several studies by the World Bank, USAID, ADB and SAARC, energy integration in the region would require political will and agreement on some basic principles and on mutually beneficial sustainable solutions. Agreement would need to be based on an evaluation of existing studies on energy cooperation in the region, an understanding of the implications of the current regulatory and policy environment for regional energy cooperation, an evaluation of the trade-offs between trade versus self-sufficiency in energy, assessment of the technical and economic feasibility of an integrated electricity network in the region and an examination of contractual obligations and terms of agreement for trade in energy. Without agreement and understanding of these issues, it would not be possible to undertake any sustainable initiative. Moreover, given the complexities of cooperation in the energy sector, it would also be best to take a gradual approach, selecting pilot projects and building up confidence to move from small to larger initiatives. To reach such agreement on principles and mutually sustainable solutions, regional cooperation initiatives will be needed at the institutional, infrastructural, informational and regulatory levels. First and foremost there is need for institutional cooperation. One possibility is to set up an apex regional body consisting of state-owned and leading private sector companies that are engaged in energy exploration, production and sales in the region. So far, institutional cooperation has taken place mainly among government officials at various SAARC summits and under the aegis of the SAARC Energy Centre. There is need for dialogue among energy companies, both public and private, that are operating in the region, as regional cooperation in energy will involve joint ventures, BOOT arrangements and public-private partnership arrangements. Given the growing role of private players in the energy sector, it would be important to create an association or forum that brings together key private companies, such as ONGC, Petrobangla, Gas Authority of India Ltd., Sui Gas of Pakistan and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation of Sri Lanka. They could jointly undertake assessments of material and other resources pertinent to the energy sector in this region, R&D, collective action on renewable energy sources and improving energy 86 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia efficiency, sharing of information and experiences to evaluate the benefits of cooperation and capacity-building through seminars and training programmes. Such joint initiatives would also help develop a common understanding of the issues involved in regional energy cooperation, bring together technical knowledge and expertise available in the region and complement the work of other regional bodies, such as the SAARC Energy Centre. Dialogue is also required through a broad-based regional forum encompassing a range of stakeholders in this sector, including private and public institutions, industry, regulatory authorities, civil society, experts, government officials, industry associations, academics and multilateral agencies. Such wide participation will be needed because of the cross- cutting nature of issues associated with energy development and trade. Discussions could cover subjects such as the establishment of a SAARC grid, social and environmental impacts resulting from the exploitation of energy resources, financing of energy projects, technical specifications and standards, contractual arrangements and alternative energy sources. Such discussions, as well as multi-stakeholder dialogue in the region, would need to be complemented by information gathering and dissemination about this sector. An information databank covering aspects such as renewable energy, trends in energy supply and demand, the regulatory and policy environment, not only in energy services but also in related areas such as energy products and equipment, investment opportunities, energy conservation and efficiency efforts and R&D activities, could provide a boost to regional cooperation. Sharing of information and technology on electric power and gas, in particular, would be useful because they are the main basis for establishing a regional electricity grid and promoting trade in natural gas. The energy ring concept needs further discussion before it can be implemented. There are already grid interconnections between India and Nepal and between India and Bhutan, and technical studies have been done to assess the feasibility of similar transmission links from India with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. This will need agreement to move beyond bilateral arrangements to a plurilateral approach, which in the past has been resisted by some member countries.30 The way", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0a52ee2-a014-496c-939f-bea0114a31e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0a52ee2-a014-496c-939f-bea0114a31e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "876e8155a9e31279eabe6b502c94b56fc8b8f0a639b6465a2e947c8a8a015400"}}, "hash": "876e8155a9e31279eabe6b502c94b56fc8b8f0a639b6465a2e947c8a8a015400", "text": "forward could be through a step-by-step approach to interconnection, building on existing bilateral treaties on power exports to the eventual creation of a SAARC grid. First of all, cooperation could be promoted by interconnecting national networks, enabling power exchange and sharing among countries in times of need and making better use of existing generation. This would also lead to coordination of their generation systems, which would be required as a first step in establishing a power grid. This could be followed by short- and long-term power exchanges using these interconnections, based on an evaluation of the supply and demand characteristics of the various networks. Such exchanges would move the participating countries closer to a coordinated approach by increasing the interdependence of their operations. The next step could be joint 30 For example, in 1998, SARI had proposed the creation of an 80,000 MW power reserve to supply electricity to Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal. However, it could not be implemented because India preferred bilateral agreements with the respective countries. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 87 planning, design, funding, construction and operation of transmission lines and, finally, joint construction of power stations with associated power trade on a plurilateral basis. It has been suggested that some of these joint projects could start with promising subregional electric power and natural gas projects to be undertaken on a priority basis. Success in these projects could be used to build mutual trust and confidence, leading to the development of larger regional projects. The possibility of lagged cooperation has also been proposed, whereby country A would provide the energy resource to country B for a defined period, while country B would be required to provide country A with the contracted amount of energy in the future. Such an arrangement would address concerns over future shortages and uncertainties about future demand in exporting countries, while taking into account the possibilities of future resource discoveries in the importing countries. But studies are required to assess the costs and benefits of such lagged cooperation arrangements. Another area of focus could be trade in natural gas in a subregional context, involving India, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan and Bangladesh, India and Myanmar, and associated issues of transit, security and geopolitics. This can only be addressed through political dialogue between governments, complemented by initiatives of private sector entities interested in such trade. Some concerns could be allayed through such discussions (though there are additional complexities concerning the western energy grid, which involves Afghanistan, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan, due to well-known sensitivities on the part of the United States). With regard to the India-Pakistan natural gas transit, the main concern has been the possibility of disruptions in supply and threats of stoppage at times of heightened political tensions. Regular discussions could overcome this obstacle by reassurances that, as a transit and consumer country and given private sector investment by Pakistani companies in the pipeline, it would not be in Pakistan\u2019s interest to disrupt supply for political purposes. Regular discussions could help provide an understanding of the costs of not cooperating. The ultimate requirement, of course, is political will, which unfortunately seems unlikely in the near term due to the current political climate and instability in Pakistan, which have soured relations with India. Prospects for trade in natural gas between Bangladesh and India seem more promising under the new government in Bangladesh. However, companies such as Petrobangla and Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL), which have a stake in such trade, will need to push their governments in these efforts. It is also important to recognize that, owing to the geopolitical complexities involved in trade in natural gas, it may not be advisable to link up third-country and plurilateral issues, as this would only delay progress. Other forums could be used in parallel to discuss other issues, such as those relating to non-tariff barriers affecting Bangladesh\u2019s exports to India and access to Nepal and Bhutan via India, which have been raised by Bangladesh in the past. These other issues should not be made a precondition for energy trade, as this would only make energy cooperation discussions more complicated and delay agreement and implementation. 88 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Cross-border investment in the region will continue to be hampered by inefficient public sector utilities and electricity boards.

Hence, further reforms of the SEBs, in the form of more competitive retail pricing of electricity, greater commercial discipline and less political interference in the their functioning, would be required to make regional investments and cross-border sales of electricity viable. Such reforms would also help make the investment climate more conducive to attracting and retaining private investors, both foreign and domestic. This would be essential for helping to overcome the financial resource constraints facing governments in developing this sector. Clean and alternative energy is another area that offers scope for regional cooperation, given the growing energy requirements in the region and environmental concerns arising from a heavy dependence on fossil fuels. Owing to the growing focus on the development of renewable energy resources, this is an area of common interest, and there are possibilities for initiating joint projects. For instance, the potential for wind energy in South Asia remains unexplored. Modern and cost-effective indigenous wind power technologies are available in India, but because Pakistan does not permit the payment of technology fees to India, it imports higher-cost technologies from the West. Thus there is scope for launching a bilateral wind energy technology-sharing project. Likewise, joint biofuel projects could be initiated in the region, particularly as some of the countries, such as Sri Lanka and India, are increasingly interested in promoting bio diesel production. Joint feasibility studies, joint development projects and analyses of the environmental and socio-economic consequences of alternative and renewable energy sources could be carried out within the region. Because energy trade requires costly infrastructure, if regional cooperation in energy is to succeed there is need for a legally binding instrument, such as a charter or treatyalong the lines of the Energy Charter Treaty. This multilateral treaty to promote East-West cooperation in the energy sector provides a useful model for promoting regional cooperation in South Asia. It covers issues of investment, trade, transit, safeguards for investors and dispute resolution. It is important that SAARC countries sign up to this or a similar treaty because it would provide a framework of rules and would help create a level playing field among the member countries, thus reducing the risks associated with energy-related trade and investment. Underlying this agreement on a regional charter on energy would be cooperation on the legal and regulatory framework and harmonization of energy policies. Given the varying stages of reform in this sector among the South Asian countries, it would be necessary to review the existing legal and regulatory frameworks in the region, the approaches to private investment in the different countries, their tariff-setting principles and issues relating to standards and specifications. Institutional frameworks for energy trade would also need to be developed. Past arrangements have been ad hoc, mostly driven by bilateral negotiations and goodwill. But extending such trade, including substantial trade in power, to a subregional or regional level, Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 89 will require detailed frameworks for contractual arrangements and operating procedures. In this regard, the idea of a SAARC Regional Power Trading Corporation has been proposed to provide a market mechanism for energy trade. This institution would maintain and provide information on plant structures, production costs, sales prices, utilization rates, profitability, market conditions, consumer demand and investments. Accordingly, it would have to gather and analyse information on generation, demand, transmission, payment and market operations. Such a mechanism could help in the development of a bidding system for power generation projects in the region. In sum, a combination of political, institutional, technical and commercial efforts will be needed to accelerate the process of energy integration in South Asia. The various elements of cooperation and the approaches suggested are not new; they have been proposed in numerous studies, which have also stressed the importance of political will, improved political relations and a better political climate in the region. However, it may be worth considering the reverse, namely that economic integration in a sector such as energy, where there are substantial benefits to be derived, could help build mutual trust and confidence, which in turn could help improve political and economic relations in the region. The potential development benefits in terms of improved and diversified sources of energy and improved regional infrastructure could be significant. The preceding discussion has focused on regional cooperation as a means to promoting regional and national energy security in order to sustain economic growth and development in South Asia.

But another very important dimension, that of energy security, also needs to be assessed in the context of regional integration. South Asia is characterized by widespread energy poverty, reflected in low access to electricity and modern fuels: More than 600 million people have no access to electricity and depend heavily on traditional biomass fuels as the primary source of energy. To what extent could regional cooperation in services enhance the availability of adequate, affordable, safe and reliable \u201cmodern\u201d energy to all segments of the population, especially the poor and disadvantaged? This would depend on the priority given to implementation of regional energy projects and construction of transmission links. In addition, discussions and initiatives are needed to address a variety of issues that go beyond power generation, including minimizing carbon emissions, integrated river basin management and water- sharing agreements, climate change and its impact on the supply of natural resources and regional optimization of primary energy resources. Cooperation on clean and alternative energy sources could promote the diversification of countries\u2019 energy baskets and energy security for all. And regional efforts to enhance national energy security are likely to have positive spillover effects on energy security as well. 90 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Tourism is the world\u2019s largest and fastest-growing service industry. Within the South Asia region too, the sector has grown considerably in recent years and presents significant opportunities for further development. It is usually one of the easiest sectors to negotiate in bilateral and regional talks, owing to its non-controversial and largely commercial nature. It is therefore not surprising that negotiations and cooperation on tourism issues have progressed much more than in other sectors, not only subregionally within SASEC and BIMSTEC but also regionally within SAARC. The South Asian countries recognize tourism as an area with considerable potential for intraregional growth, and they therefore see the need to deepen integration of this sector. To date, little has been achieved in concrete terms, despite many discussions and joint declarations about this sector. This chapter examines the status of cooperation and trade in tourism in South Asia, the associated constraints, and how its regional integration could be promoted. Section 1 outlines recent growth, employment and investment trends in tourism services in South Asia and compares these with other regions. Section 2 summarizes the regulatory and policy environment and recent developments with regard to FDI, domestic private sector participation and other institutional aspects. Section 3 discusses the extent and nature of intraregional tourism trade and cooperation in South Asia at the intergovernmental, private sector, subregional and multilateral levels. It also highlights industry initiatives with regard to cross-border investments in the tourism industry. Section 4 outlines the main constraints affecting intraregional cooperation in tourism services, focusing in particular on issues of connectivity, mobility of persons and investment. Section 5 presents the status of multilateral and other commitments by the South Asian countries in tourism services to highlight their preparedness to negotiate and liberalize under a regional agreement. Section 6 discusses the way forward. 5 1 Tourism trends in South Asia Tourism in South Asia compares quite poorly with the rest of the world, accounting for a negligible share of international tourist arrivals and receipts. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), in 2007 this region accounted for only 1.2 percent of world tourist arrivals compared with destinations such as Europe, North America and emerging destinations in East Asia, which account for 52.9 percent, 10.6 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively.31 Nevertheless, it is encouraging to note that South Asia has recorded a robust average annual growth rate of 7.1 percent over the past decade, although this growth is mainly due to increased tourist arrivals into India. The only other regions with higher growth rates are West Asia, Central America and North-East Asia.

In terms of tourism receipts, South Asia received US$13.4 billion in 2007, which represents only 1.6 percent of total world receipts from tourism (table 5.1).

Over the past decade, South Asia has registered the highest average annual growth rate in tourism receipts, at 9 percent, which is far higher than that of other developing regions, such as West Asia or South-East Asia. While the latter two regions have recorded higher growth rates of tourist arrivals, South Asia has benefitted from higher receipts per arrival than these other regions. There has also been significant growth in tourism-related employment, with a CAGR of 4 percent over the 2001\u20132008 period for the South Asian region as a whole, exceeded only by one other region, the Middle East. However, employment growth in tourism has not been commensurate with its GDP growth, which raises issues concerning the long- term development and sustainability of growth in this sector and the desirable pattern of its development. Over the past decade, there has also been very high growth in capital investment and government expenditures in the tourism sector, with South Asia again registering higher growth rates than other developing regions. The average annual growth rate of capital investment was more than 12 percent and for government expenditure it was 6 percent (WTTC, 2009).33 The growing government expenditures in tourism indicate that governments in this region are according greater attention to this sector due to its potential for generating employment and creating economy-wide gains.

Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 93 The global ranking of South Asia on competitiveness indicators in the tourism sector presents a mixed picture. According to the travel and tourism competitiveness indicators developed by the World Economic Forum, which provide rankings for a total of 132 countries based on a variety of parameters, the five South Asian countries included in this list perform well on intrinsic factors (e.g. landscape, cultural and historical heritage), but poorly on policy- related parameters (table 5.2). The rankings indicate that the South Asian countries perform well in terms of their natural, cultural and historical resources and on price competitiveness, with India performing the best among these countries, followed by Sri Lanka. But they lag far behind others in terms of the policy and regulatory environment and availability of tourism infrastructure. There are, however, some differences across the countries. For instance, India and Sri Lanka perform reasonably well on indicators such as environmental sustainability compared with the other countries, and India performs better on air transport infrastructure. These differences for certain parameters reflect variations among the countries in terms of their degree of liberalization and the pro-competition policies they have introduced in related areas, such as civil aviation, as well as differences in their policy thrust and orientation within the tourism sector. Overall, at the regional level, the tourism sector has shown impressive growth, especially since 2000. If these trends continue, the outlook is promising.35 It is evident, however, that the governments in this region need to focus on tourism infrastructure development and on the regulatory and policy framework governing tourism. 5.1.1 Tourism trends in individual South Asian countries While South Asia as a whole has experienced remarkable growth in tourism, there have been sharp variations among the various countries in the region. This is due to several factors, including the level of overall economic development of each country, its history and stage of tourism development, the forms of tourism that are promoted, cultural and ecological resources, and local attitudes towards tourism, to name a few.

There has also been considerable volatility in the rate of tourist arrivals on an annual basis. In part this reflects the base effect in some of the smaller countries, which receive small numbers of tourists, but it also reflects the impact of external factors and dependence on economic conditions in source markets for tourists \u2013 a common characteristic of the tourism sector. For instance, all countries in the region, except Bhutan and Pakistan, saw a significant drop in arrivals in 2005 on account of the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004. Similarly, all the countries experienced a decline in tourist arrivals during the period 2000\u20132001, corresponding to the global recession at that time.36 To some extent, the large fluctuations could also reflect the region\u2019s failure to create a competitive and sustained high- growth tourism sector, which makes the sector vulnerable to external market conditions. India dominates the region in terms of absolute number of arrivals. It accounted for 62 percent of all tourist arrivals into South Asia in 2006, up from 56 percent in 1990 (figure 5.1). While most other countries have maintained their shares within the region, Nepal has experienced a decline, which is also consistent with its poor performance in tourist arrivals and receipts in recent years. 36 Based on UNCTAD Handbook of Statistics, available at: http://stats.unctad.org/handbook/ReportFolders/ ReportFolders.aspx (accessed on 1 December 2008). 96 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Figure 5 1: Shares of individual countries in total international tourist arrivals in South Asia, 1990-2006 (%) Source: United Nations World Tourism Organization, statistical database, at: www.unwto.org/facts/eng/indica- tors.htm (accessed on 12 December 2009). Regional trends reveal South Asia\u2019s rising popularity as an international tourism destination, especially emerging economies like India and unique cultural and natural destinations like Bhutan. There is also a clear correlation between tourism performance and economic and political stability in the region, which is why emerging market economies such as India and politically stable markets such as Bhutan have been generally outperforming the other countries. The main source countries for tourists in South Asia are mostly outside the region. A few developed countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, are the leading sources for tourists to the region, though India also features among the top five source markets for several of the South Asian countries (table 5.4).

Although the data reveal the dependence of the South Asian countries on a few source markets for tourists and thus the region\u2019s high degree of susceptibility to fluctuations in external demand, they also indicate the potential for intraregional trade in tourism. India accounts for over half of all tourist arrivals in Bangladesh and for 18\u201320 percent of all tourist arrivals in Nepal and Sri Lanka. Likewise, Sri Lanka features as an important source country for tourists in India and Nepal. The presence of such intraregional tourist flows, as well as the recent growth in outbound tourists from the region, and in particular from India (which, according to UNWTO (2007) estimates, is expected to reach 20 million by 2020 at an annual growth rate of 5.7 percent), clearly highlights the prospects for promoting intraregional trade in tourism within South Asia and for diversification of source markets. However, owing to the way tourism data are collected, it is difficult to determine to what extent such arrivals are for tourism purposes as opposed to other motives, such as visiting family or for business. 5.1.2 Contribution of tourism to growth and employment Just as tourism has contributed significantly to GDP, export earnings and employment at the regional level, it has also played an important role in the individual economies of this region, as measured by the share of travel and tourism in national GDP. This share has grown considerably, especially since 2000.37 For instance, the sector\u2019s contribution to India\u2019s GDP grew at an average annual rate of 17 percent in the 2001\u20132008 period compared with 3\u20134 percent in the 1990\u20132000 period.38 In general, those countries with high growth in tourism arrivals and receipts have also benefitted from a greater contribution of the travel and tourism sector to their economies. However, growth of employment in tourism has not been commensurate with the sector\u2019s increasing contribution to output, a feature also highlighted earlier at the regional level, and which contrasts with the experience of the tourism sector in other developing regions. It mirrors the overall discrepancy discussed earlier between growth and employment trends in services in South Asia. Growth in tourism-related employment has remained largely stagnant. In India, for example, employment in the sector has remained at around 5 percent, while in Maldives it has actually declined in recent years. Because employment is one of the main indicators of the extent of socio-economic benefits derived by local communities from 37 This refers to the combination of direct and indirect effects of tourism activities across all sectors of the economy. 38 WTTC, Tourism Economic Impact and Data Analysis Tool, www.wttc.org/bin/pdf/temp/southasia.html (accessed 8 November 2009) 98 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia tourism, the weaker performance of the tourism sector in this regard is a matter of concern and certainly an issue that would need to be kept in mind when exploring intraregional trade prospects in this sector. 5 2 Policy and regulatory environment for tourism in South Asia Governments in South Asian countries have been paying increasing attention to their tourism sectors. All of them have enacted tourism policies that broadly focus on ways to increase tourist arrivals, overcome infrastructure and transport-related bottlenecks and, to varying degrees, ensure environmental protection and cultural promotion through tourism. There are also differences in approach and objectives across the countries and in the models of tourism development being pursued. In Bhutan, where tourism is relatively new, the industry \u201cis founded on the principle of sustainability, meaning that tourism must be environmentally and ecologically friendly, socially and culturally acceptable and economically viable\u201d,39 whereas in Nepal, the national goal of tourism development is \u201cto improve the living standards of the people through tourism activities with a substantial contribution towards national income\u201d.40 For Maldives, the objective of tourism is to \u201cimprove the quality of life of the Maldivian people by optimizing and balancing the economic, environmental and socio-cultural benefits of tourism\u201d,41 and in India the main objectives of the 2002 national tourism policy are to \u201cposition tourism as a national priority\u201d42 and to work towards improving competitiveness and infrastructure. Different models of tourism have been adopted by the countries, from the \u201clow volume- high value\u201d model in Bhutan, which imposes restrictions on the number of tourists, to the investor-driven model in Sri Lanka and Maldives and the community-based tourism model in Nepal. The countries also focus on different niches within tourism.

Tourism is among the most liberalized services in South Asia. Private participation by foreign and domestic investors is permitted in all the countries, though the extent of entry and associated conditions differ. Indeed, the relatively high growth of capital investment in tourism in most of the South Asian countries in recent years largely reflects greater private sector participation. There are large differences in the amount of capital investment across the countries, with India registering investments of over US$20 billion in 1990, up from US$5 billion in 1990. However, countries that have been affected by political and economic instability, such as Nepal and Sri Lanka, have seen a sharp decline in capital expenditures 39 Tourism Authority of Bhutan, at: www.tourism.gov.bt/about-tcb. 40 Nepal Tourism Board, at: www.welcomenepal.com/corporate/473182689482-574861922369. 41 Maldives Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, at: www.tourism.gov.mv/article.php?aId=3. 42 Government of India, National Tourism Policy 2002, at: www.tourism.gov.in/. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 99 in this sector since 2000, indicating problems with investor confidence and with the general investment climate in those countries in recent years.43 As the data do not provide a breakdown between foreign versus domestic investment, or for that matter investment sourced from within the region, it is difficult to gauge the extent of dependence of these countries on external versus internal resources and the potential role of intraregional investments in developing their tourism sector. An examination of the policy and regulatory environment affecting the two main segments of the tourism sector, namely hotels and travel tour operators, reveals several similarities as well as differences in objectives and concerns. In all the countries, the foreign investment regime is very liberal for hotels. Up to 100 percent FDI is permitted in the hotels segment in all the countries except Bhutan, where foreign equity participation is capped at 70 percent. Barring Nepal and Bhutan, which require foreign investors to be approved by investment authorities and the relevant departments, all the other countries permit foreign investment automatically. There are, however, several conditions imposed on foreign investment in hotels across all the countries. These include minimum capital requirements, requirements to form joint ventures with local investors and various licensing and registration requirements. An examination of these conditions indicates that one of the primary objectives in attracting foreign investment is to encourage technology transfer, learning and transfer of management and other practices in the sector, ensuring at least some degree of involvement and contribution by foreign investors to the economy and accountability of foreign investors with regard to social and environmental norms and specifications as set by authorities. This relatively liberal policy environment has resulted in growing private sector participation in South Asia\u2019s tourism industry. Several well-known corporate players, who are investing globally and in the region, have emerged. Investment regulations for hotels in some of the countries reflect concern for environmental sustainability. In Bhutan, for instance, there are specific policies concerning construction of hotels and restrictions on the number of tourist arrivals into the country in order to ensure that tourism there is environmentally sustainable and eco-friendly. In Maldives, private investment is governed by zoning and other regulations aimed at preserving the marine ecology and minimizing environmental damage. In general, norms apply uniformly to both foreign and domestic investors, though in some countries domestic investors are granted special infrastructure-related incentives that may not be available to foreign investors. Overall, the policy framework reflects an emphasis on infrastructure development, along with an attempt to balance commercial considerations against social and environmental concerns. The policy environment in tourism services is characterized by a multiplicity of taxes, including value-added taxes, luxury taxes, expenditure taxes, hotel taxes, service taxes and taxes on capital goods as well as high import duties on liquor.

Policies affecting the other important segment of the tourism industry, the travel and tour operators segment, tend to be more restrictive than those for hotels. Although foreign operators are allowed in some of the countries, their activities are restricted by conditions pertaining to training at specified agencies/institutes in the countries, authorization and licensing by specified agencies, minimum capital requirements and local commercial presence requirements. In some countries like Nepal, certain kinds of activities are not open to foreign travel operators and tour guides. The restrictions reflect employment- and quality-related considerations, which result in a more conservative policy stance in this segment than in the hotel segment. 5 3 Intraregional cooperation and initiatives In light of the region\u2019s focus on infrastructure development and on attracting investment in the tourism sector, coupled with the relatively liberal policy environment and the similarities among the countries in terms of language, culture, history, religion and geography, tourism is perhaps one of the most promising areas for regional integration in South Asia. Indeed, it has been identified as a priority sector under SAARC for promoting intergovernmental cooperation and deepening regional integration. The following section describes the current status of intra-SAARC travel and outlines the cooperation efforts undertaken in this industry at various levels and through various forums as well as the challenges to such cooperation. 5.3.1 Intra-SAARC travel The outlook for intraregional tourism is promising in view of the growth in outbound tourism from the SAARC region and the significance of some SAARC countries as source markets for tourists to other countries in the region. On average, intra-SAARC travel (for tourism and other reasons) has accounted for about 20 percent of all international arrivals in the SAARC countries in recent years, although there is considerable variation across countries. There is considerable variation in the degree of dependence on other SAARC countries for international tourist arrivals. While intra-SAARC travel accounted for close to 50 percent of all international arrivals in Bangladesh in 2005, it was less than 5 percent in Maldives (table 5.5). The data suggest that intraregional travel is strongest among India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, where it constitutes 20 to 30 percent of total tourist arrivals in those countries. Pakistan and Maldives are exceptions, where intra-SAARC tourist arrivals account for a very small share of their total tourist arrivals. In Maldives, which is one of the more advanced tourism destinations in the region, South Asians account for less than 5 percent of Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 101 all international arrivals; the majority of tourists originate outside the region (mainly Europe and the United States).44 Table 5 5: Share of South Asian tourists in total tourists in individual SAARC countries, 2000\u20132006 Share of tourists from South Asia as a % of all international arrivals 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 % No. Bangladesh 46.69 45.27 46.90 41.75 36.64 47.68 99,010 n.a.

A few South Asian countries feature significantly in intra-SAARC travel, with India accounting for the bulk of such travel. For example, tourists from India represent 87 percent of all intra- SAARC tourists to Bangladesh and 76 percent and 68 percent of all intra-SAARC tourists to Sri Lanka and Nepal, respectively. Bangladesh is also an important source country for some SAARC countries, accounting for 54 percent of all South Asian visitors entering India.45 Although country-wise arrival data are not available for Bhutan, it is likely that Indian tourists dominate.

Overall, the data indicate that there is a significant and in some cases growing proportion of intraregional travel, especially between specific countries or groups of countries. In addition to religious and cultural tourism, other segments of interest include sports and recreational tourism, adventure, ecotourism and medical tourism.46 For instance in sports tourism, events such as Indian Premier League cricket or the Triangular series involving multiple countries in South Asia, or regional events, such as the South Asian Federation Games, bring many spectators from within the region. The 11th South Asian Federation Games in 2010 was a major sports event involving around 1,800 athletes from the eight SAARC member countries, competing in over 20 different sports. The South Asian Games, conducted once every two years, promote cultural exchanges between the member countries. There are also lesser-known events, such as the SAARC Countries Carom Championship or hockey and badminton meets. Such events, which draw a large number of regional spectators, officials and athletes, present a good opportunity to promote cultural and historical sightseeing visits in the host countries, with all their related positive externalities. Beyond traditional sporting events, the South Asian countries offer promising prospects for recreational sports, such as mountaineering, trekking, mountain sports, white-water rafting and various beach and water sports. There are also recreational tourism opportunities, such as spas, resorts, wellness tourism resorts and cruises, and ample scope for coordinated holiday packages that combine locations across different countries in the region. Ecotourism based on nature and culture has been identified as one of the product-specific areas for promoting South Asia as a tourist destination. 5.3.2 Intergovernmental cooperation Countries in SAARC have cooperated in tourism since the 1980s. In 1986, the Scheme for Promotion of Organized Tourism was initiated, whereby member States agreed to work together to promote tourism abroad and develop it at home. Members also agreed on a travel voucher system that would promote intra-SAARC tourism without incurring foreign exchange expenditures. A Technical Committee on Tourism was organized in 1991 within the framework of SAARC. The most significant institutional development since then has been the formation of the SAARC Working Group on Tourism, which was established by the Council of Ministers during its Twenty-fourth Session in Islamabad in January 2004. To date, the SAARC Working Group on Tourism has met four times but has made little concrete progress. The first and second meetings that were held in Colombo, Sri Lanka in 2004 and 2005 merely re-emphasized the need to promote tourism within the region, bring in the private sector as a participant in the process and observe 2006 as the South Asia Tourism Year. Regional tourism plans were more like vision statements rather than concrete 46 Medical tourism is discussed in chapter 6 on health services. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 103 action plans. It was only in 1996, with the SAARC Cox\u2019s Bazaar Action Plan on Tourism, that concrete suggestions were made for the first time on how to promote tourism within the region. Key suggestions to enhance intra-SAARC travel in that plan were: \u2022\ufffd promoting direct air links among member States; \u2022\ufffd expeditious development of road and rail links among member States; \u2022\ufffd separate counters for SAARC nationals at international airports in the region; \u2022\ufffd possible recognition of a national driving licence by SAARC member States on a reciprocal basis; \u2022\ufffd rationalization or reduction of entrance fees for SAARC nationals for entry into archaeological sites and other tourist attractions; and \u2022\ufffd further simplification of visa formalities for SAARC citizens. However, SAARC has made no progress in implementing these recommendations.

Instead, the thrust of SAARC discussions has been on promoting the region as a \u201csingle destination\u201d and thereby promoting \u201cSouth Asianess\u201d, with recommendations such as observing the South Asia Tourism Year, publishing joint promotional materials and using SAARC as a platform for greater visibility and marketing support to the countries within the region. But no joint projects and initiatives have been identified for this purpose, and the focus of policies in each of the countries has remained on promoting tourism at the country level rather than regionally, with no coordination of national tourism policies and plans of action. Tourism has also been a priority area in other regional forums, such as the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC), which was set up by the ADB and BIMSTEC.47 There has been a little more progress in these forums than in the context of SAARC in terms of developing concrete plans for regional tourism. SASEC has identified tourism as a priority sector and has invited Sri Lanka to be a member of its Tourism Working Group because of its close links to some of the SASEC countries. The SASEC Tourism Development Plan (TDP) of 2004 identifies 23 cross-border tourism projects to be developed in seven key areas, largely covering ecotourism and the Buddhist circuit. A major emphasis of this plan is to facilitate intraregional travel, with proposed measures to improve highways (e.g. links to the Asian Highway project), develop new airports (e.g. making Bagdogra in north-eastern India a hub) and ease border restrictions. The ADB has provided financial support for the development plan in the form of a loan of US$950,000. Although the SASEC TDP addresses several important issues that are critical to any regional tourism efforts, it has been subject to considerable debate. Several aspects of the plan have been criticized, such as the absence of genuine community participation in the planning process, the potential impact of the planned ecotourism projects on the region\u2019s ecology 47 SASEC was set up under the auspices of the South Asia Growth Quadrangle initiative with financial assistance and support from the ADB. 104 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia and socio-cultural milieu, and the plan\u2019s failure to include sustainability parameters. Moreover, there are doubts as to whether the planned projects will bring tangible benefits to the local communities. The extent of implementation of the TDP is unclear, and there is little evidence to suggest that the SASEC TDP and SAARC\u2019s tourism plans are coordinated, despite claims that there is broad convergence. Another subregional grouping, BIMSTEC, has adopted a similar approach as that of SAARC. India has taken the lead in this grouping. At the second Roundtable and Workshop of BIMSTEC Tourism Ministers in August 2006, the Kathmandu Declaration on Tourism Cooperation and a Plan of Action were adopted. The main features of this plan of action are quite similar to those outlined by the SAARC Working Council, such as joint promotion of heritage, cultural, adventure and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) tourism, and development of joint packages, setting up of an information centre in India to disseminate tourism information about BIMSTEC member countries, establishing a Tourism Fund, meeting on an annual basis and exploring synergies with SASEC. There have also been discussions on related issues of transport infrastructure and improving rail, land, water and air transport connectivity. However, there has been little progress in meeting these objectives. At best, BIMSTEC\u2019s tourism efforts constitute no more than political agreement to cooperate on regional tourism, similar to other regional intergovernmental efforts in promoting intra-SAARC tourism. There are also bilateral agreements among the SAARC governments to promote hospitality and tourism. For example, India and Maldives aim to build on the recent growth in tourism between these two countries by addressing issues such as increasing the frequency of flights between the two countries, cross-border cooperation between travel agents and joint development of hospitality projects in each other\u2019s countries. 5.3.3 Private sector initiatives in the region Several well-known companies in the region have established a presence in the tourism sector, particularly in the hotels segment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7014535d-c96c-499a-82ad-1494e9745199": {"__data__": {"id_": "7014535d-c96c-499a-82ad-1494e9745199", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76d073f599493dc64feb6c2a1bfeb46d742fe3c0f954270f36b589fa943e7b4e"}, "2": {"node_id": "185cc336-7ebf-4d9b-8946-c97ecc706320", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06490a6a5ebc90623f9bf515c5d84121c0671fd2ad51bd4c94850318d9e46a8d"}}, "hash": "5a99e91d1c69a11b8e39d9bb19fa515cfc9925a9fb5d6e00418c07e0f2b9b350", "text": "There are a variety of source and destination countries for private investments in the tourism sector, which suggests considerable scope for mutual benefit in developing tourism services in the region.

The local partner will hold 30 percent shares and the Oberoi Group 50 percent, with the remaining 20 percent of shares floated to the public. The group will hire mainly local employees, and managerial staff will be trained at its school of management in Delhi. Two of Sri Lanka\u2019s top conglomerates, Aitken Spence Hotel Holdings and John Keells Hotels, have resorts in Maldives. Both companies have significant hotel portfolios in that country as part of their diversification strategy that seeks to reduce their dependence on earnings from Sri Lankan hotels, which were adversely affected by the political turmoil in that country. Both companies are looking to further diversify their hotel business by investing in India and elsewhere in South Asia. There are also companies from some of the smaller countries, such as Maldives, which have established themselves in the tourism sector and plan to invest in the larger markets in the region. For example, many Maldivian hotel companies, such as the Villa Hotels Group, are interested in investing in hotel projects in India, and the Government of Maldives supports such private sector expansion plans. 5 4 Challenges to tourism development in South Asia As mentioned earlier, there has been much talk about prioritizing tourism as a sector for regional cooperation, and various action plans and discussion forums have focused on this sector, but these have not led to any significant concrete action. One of the main reasons is the failure to address some of the major obstacles, especially practical issues, such as improving air connectivity, streamlining visa formalities and identifying specific joint tourism promotion projects and programmes. 5.4.1 Transport and connectivity Lack of an integrated transport infrastructure in South Asia has been one of the main obstacles to promoting regional cooperation in various spheres, whether in tourism, trade in goods or investment flows and associated mobility of factors of production across a variety of sectors. Many experts and agencies have pointed out that integration of South Asia\u2019s transport network is critical to reducing the cost of travel and trade in the region. The existing transport networks and infrastructure are in disuse and badly need upgrading in many parts of mainland South Asia. The north-eastern region of India is connected to the rest 106 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia of India by a narrow, congested land corridor between Bangladesh and Nepal, hindering not only transport of goods (which has been much discussed in the context of trade facilitation in South Asia) but also movement of people in the region. The absence of extensive cross- border road and rail links is a major constraint on subregional tourism in South Asia, although there is some discussion under SASEC to implement agreements in these areas.48 Air connectivity is one of the most important driving forces of leisure and business travel. An examination of the statistics on air connectivity reveals the logistical difficulties in promoting intraregional tourism in South Asia.

Weekly flight frequencies within the region are in the range of two to six for some of the countries. Bhutan has the lowest flight connectivity with the other countries, accounting for only 11 of the 562 weekly flights operating within the region, followed by Pakistan, which has only 17 flights per week, and Maldives, which has 37 flights. India is the best connected, accounting for around half of all weekly flights operating in the region, and almost all the countries, barring Pakistan, have a sizeable number of direct flights with the capital and/or with other cities in India.49 A few examples of poor air connectivity between certain countries highlight how this constrains growth in regional tourism. There is very poor connectivity from Pakistan, a potentially important source country for tourists to other markets in the region, such as Maldives. Also, there are no direct flights between Maldives and Bangladesh. Regional tourism to Maldives is further constrained by the low frequency of travel between larger source countries like Pakistan and potential transit markets such as Sri Lanka or India. Similarly, Bhutan, an important destination market within SAARC, is not directly connected to potential source countries, such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Again, use of transit routes through other SAARC countries, such as from Pakistan to Bhutan via India or via Nepal, is limited due to the poor connectivity between Pakistan and these other potential transit countries. Thus, both in terms of direct access to other markets within SAARC as well as indirect access through transit countries in SAARC, connectivity is poor, which limits the potential for transit tourism as well. It is clear that faster, efficient and affordable air connectivity is indispensable for promoting intra-SAARC tourism. Statistics from all the countries in the region underline the fact that air is the preferred mode of transport used by the majority (more than 90 percent) of international tourists visiting the region. The current status of air connectivity, direct and indirect, is clearly inadequate for boosting either leisure or business travel within the region. 48 Some of the main transport infrastructure-related proposals under SASEC include development of a road corridor and a rail link between Agartala and other places in north-eastern India and Dhaka and Chittagong in Bangladesh, as well as modernizing cross-border transit agreements and crossings. Economic and technical feasibility analyses, environmental impact assessments and studies of social issues of displacement, land acquisition and developmental impacts will be undertaken as part of this initiative (ADB, 2007). 49 Based on websites of all the airlines in the South Asian region, websites of airlines of neighbouring countries flying in the region and other web sources.

Visas on arrival and gratis visas with minimal conditions are available for tourists in some of the countries. However, visa requirements for business travel, employment and for other purposes, such as medical and educational purposes, are cumbersome. Some of the countries do not provide multiple entry visas and visas are typically given for a very short duration, only 15\u201330 days on a single entry basis. The documentation requirements between India and Pakistan are particularly onerous, in addition to which Indians and Pakistanis travelling to each other\u2019s countries are required to report to the local police station or registration authorities and notify them when moving to different parts of those countries for internal security reasons. Visa fees are also quite steep in some countries. Some of the countries do not have provision for transit visas, and there are no separate counters for SAARC travellers to facilitate intraregional movement, whether for business or leisure. These visa regimes are in sharp contrast to those of ASEAN member countries, which have facilitation counters for ASEAN travellers and grant gratis visas to travellers from partner countries on arrival. In addition, an ASEAN Air Pass offers a concessionary air fare to travellers to various ASEAN countries. 5.4.3 Domestic challenges In addition to issues of air transport connectivity and cumbersome visa regimes, various national policies and market conditions hinder the promotion of intraregional tourism. Chief among these are inadequate domestic infrastructure, lack of integrated tourism policies and high transactions costs arising from multiple taxes and regulations, as noted earlier. There are also broader problems that go beyond the tourism sector, such as the investment climate, political instability and uncertainties regarding the economic and regulatory environment, which deter cross-border investments in the tourism sector.

Lack of adequately skilled human resources and hospitality training are other problems for some of the countries, which could affect regional tourism prospects. Constraints related to domestic infrastructure, inadequate resources, institutions and skilled human resources, which hamper the development of the tourism industry in the individual South Asian countries and consequently the sector\u2019s global competitiveness, also affect the region\u2019s ability to leverage the intra-SAARC market. 5 5 Multilateral and other commitments in tourism and travel services In line with the prevailing liberal policy environment in tourism and travel services all the South Asian member countries of the WTO (except Maldives), have scheduled this sector under GATS. This is the one sector, other than telecommunication services, in which most of the countries have indicated their general willingness to negotiate multilaterally. The two main segments that have been scheduled are hotel and lodging services and travel agency 108 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia and tour operator services. Modes 1 and 2 are largely unbound while mode 3 commitments are almost fully or partially open, though with some conditions in the form of approvals and local incorporation requirements (see annex table A2.2). As in the case of all segments within tourism services that have been entered in the WTO-GATS commitment schedules, mode 4 is unbound, though sensitivities concerning the potential impact on local, less- skilled labour are evident in some commitments. By and large, countries have bound their unilateral policies in mode 3. However, some have been more conservative in their GATS commitments and offers, in comparison with their actual policies in this sector. India, for instance, has made investment in hotels subject to approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), although this is permitted automatically in practice. Many of the countries have left mode 2 unbound, although in practice there are no restrictions on outbound travel from these countries. There is little or no change in the offers, even in modes where no restrictions apply. Thus an examination of the commitments and offers in tourism services suggests that although the countries may be willing and prepared to negotiate multilaterally in this sector, they would still like to retain some policy flexibility. Nor has there been much signalling value attached to this sector in terms of improving their offers, perhaps because the regimes are already open and tourism is not a sensitive or high profile sector in multilateral negotiations. Most of the bilateral FTAs and trade and investment agreements concluded between the South Asian countries and countries outside SAARC also include tourism services. Examples are the Pakistan-Malaysia and Pakistan-China FTAs, the India-ASEAN and India-Singapore CECA and the Pakistan-Mauritius PTA. Some of the agreements also cover rail and road links, services auxiliary to transport services, improving air connectivity through open skies agreements and general trade facilitation issues. BIMSTEC, as already discussed, has focused on tourism promotion in the subregion through increased cooperation in many areas. Thus, there is clearly a common recognition of the importance of tourism services for regional and subregional cooperation and the associated issues of transport infrastructure and connectivity that have a bearing on tourism prospects. However, none of these extraregional agreements deal with visa issues or mechanisms to facilitate the cross-border movement of travellers, indicating the sensitive nature of this issue, not only in SAARC but also more generally. 5 6 Steps needed to promote regional tourism in South Asia The preceding discussion gives an idea of the unrealized potential for regional tourism in South Asia. It has also highlighted the need to focus on tourism services as a high priority sector for regional cooperation, given the many commonalities of interests across the countries and the existence of various forums to promote cooperation. This is a sector in which successful and mutually beneficial outcomes are possible and could be used to build confidence in the overall regional integration process in South Asia. Thus tourism could Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 109 potentially serve as a pilot sector for services integration because it could have positive learning and demonstration effects for integration efforts in other services. Some of the main issues that need to be addressed regionally and nationally include lowering travel costs between the countries; improving transport connectivity, especially air links; streamlining visa procedures along with introducing longer duration and more flexible visas for intraregional travel; streamlining the tax structure in the tourism industry; joint marketing and development", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ddec8076-e55b-46f6-99fc-6537a6d20708": {"__data__": {"id_": "ddec8076-e55b-46f6-99fc-6537a6d20708", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_k
