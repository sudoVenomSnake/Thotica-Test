More than 80 percent of respondents also agreed at least to some extent that undocumented migrants could not expect to have any rights at work.556 A recent survey led by the Institute for Population and Social Research at Mahidol University found similar marked differences in Thai perception of registered versus irregular migrants. The survey found that the less favourable perception of irregular migrant workers was influenced by \u201cfear of the unknown\u201d and \u201cfear of numbers.\u201d In addition, with specific regard to labour protections, half of the respondents in this survey believed that registered migrant workers should have the same labour protections as Thai workers, although at the same time a majority of respondents did not believe such workers should have access to the same minimum wages as Thais. Almost half of survey respondents also believed that registered workers competed with Thais for jobs.557 551 Asian Development Bank, 2009, \u201cMigration in the Greater Mekong Subregion: A Background Paper for the 4th Greater Mekong Subregion Development Dialogue\u201d, Beijing, May 5, 2009\u201d. 552 World Bank, 2006, Labor Migration in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region, Synthesis Report: Phase 1. 553 Ditton and Lehane, \u201cTowards realizing health-related millennium development goals for migrants from Burma in Thailand\u201d, op. cit. 554 Veerman and Reid, \u201cBarriers to healthcare for Burmese migrants\u201d, op. cit., p. 1. 555 Ibid., p. 67. 556 ILO, 2011, Public Attitudes to Migrant Workers: A Four Country Study, at http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/ documents/presentation/wcms_159851.pdf. 557 Institute for Population and Social Research Mahidol University, 2012, The Survey of Thai Public Opinions on Myanmar refugees and displaced persons, pp. iv\u2013v. 156 Country profile: Thailand In-migration overview Although the majority of migrant workers in Thailand are low-skilled workers from neighbouring Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar, lesser numbers come from Bangladesh, China, and Viet Nam.558 While workers from the former group are difficult to enumerate given the number of undocumented workers, those from the latter group are difficult to identify and count given that the government does not officially recognize them. Estimates from the Thai Ministry of Interior in 2010 suggested that there were approximately 2.46 million low-skilled migrant workers, both documented and undocumented, from Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar in Thailand. An exact breakdown of this figure into documented and undocumented is difficult to reach in the context of Thailand\u2019s complex, parallel registration systems, as will be discussed. However, it is estimated that this total figure includes approximately 1 million workers at various stages of registration with the Thai Ministry of Labour, and approximately 1.4 million who do not have any form of registration.559 In the past there have been questions surrounding the methods of enumeration for documented migrants, let alone undocumented migrants,560 which has led to doubt surrounding the final accuracy of government estimates. Non-government sources have estimated that the number of irregular migrants in Thailand could actually be two-to-four-times higher than the 1.4 million estimate,561 given that many migrants have never completed any form of registration with Thai authorities.562 By far the greatest majority of migrant workers in Thailand come from Myanmar. Since 1996 the number of workers granted work permits from Myanmar has ranged between approximately 75 to 90 percent of all permits granted.563 Workers from Myanmar work primarily as daily labourers, factory workers, fishermen/seafood processors, farm workers, sex workers, and domestic workers. The second largest group of workers comes from Cambodia, working primarily as fishermen, mill workers, farm workers, construction workers, and a variety of low-wage labour. Third largest group comes from Lao PDR and are primarily employed as truck drivers, labourers, factory workers, construction workers, sex workers, and domestic workers.564 558 Institute for Population and Social Research Mahidol University, 2011, A Situation Analysis on Health System Strengthening for Migrants in Thailand, p. 5. 559 Ibid., p.3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e406d900-559b-4577-9e14-026744c379f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e406d900-559b-4577-9e14-026744c379f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b56f8681e4441de25091a222d0961bc1709bcee19a68febcf95051f6c144455b"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b557d32-4a3d-4b64-965a-3184c52a7994", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0de647a7179e96f3aa743a6dd5436370698438f64c778bd0728c47f8c947f3ec"}}, "hash": "0fe9a311b077b7014681c28e78fe697e8c81db31455de51dcdb49471820126fa", "text": "5. 559 Ibid., p.3. 560 Archavanitkul, K., 2009, \u201cA pilot study to improve data collection on migrants for the Thai 2010 census\u201d, cited in Baker, Holumyong, and Thianlai, 2010, Research Gaps Concerning the Health of Migrants from Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar in Thailand, Institute of Population and Social Research, Mahidol University/WHO.

These workers are primarily male, with females accounting for only 16 percent.565 Predominant sectors for male employment are construction, manufacturing, and agriculture, while females tend to work in the domestic and entertainment sectors. In 2010 almost two thirds of documented migrant workers from Thailand were deployed to Asian destinations. While destination countries included key ASEAN host countries of Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, and Singapore, the largest proportion of workers (both male and female) were deployed to Taiwan. Secondary destinations for male migrant workers were the Middle East and Africa, which received almost one third of all male migrant workers. The main secondary destination for women was Hong Kong, at 13 percent.566 LABOUR MIGRATION GOVERNANCE The Alien Employment Act 2008 regulates the employment of all low-skilled labour migrants (as well as skilled and high-skilled) in Thailand according to the three guiding principles of national security, protecting work opportunities for Thai persons, and establishing a level of labour migration that would support the growth and development of Thailand.567 This act\u2019s primary focus is work permit regulations and the reservation of certain occupations for the Thai labour force. Migrant employment is also governed under the Labour Protection Act 1998, which focuses on working conditions and benefits and labour welfare. Aside from these acts and related policies, labour migration management is also further regulated by separate bilateral memoranda of understanding with Myanmar, Lao PDR, and Cambodia. Thailand is not a party to either the International Convention on the Protection of Rights of All Migrant Workers or ILO\u2019s Migration for Employment Convention (No. 97) or Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (No. 143), but Thai commentary suggests that the standards contained in these instruments generally overlap with the main rights conventions that already bind the country.568 At the same time, various external commentaries notes that while the policies and bodies to manage migrant workers are now well-established, complex procedural regulations, fear of misuse of personal data, and lack of information among employers and migrants about 565 Thailand Migration Report 2011, op. cit., p. 13.

Alien Employment Act 2008 This act primarily governs the issuance and validity of work permits, establishing also a committee on alien work and a deportation fund for migrant workers. The act reserves certain occupations for the Thai labour force and is supplemented by regulations that list those occupations in which migrants are allowed to work.570 Broader management of labour in-migration processes in Thailand is coordinated at high levels and are relatively complex.

In 2006 a fourth step of \u2018nationality verification\u2019 by source governments (that is, Myanmar, Lao PDR, and Cambodia) was introduced into the semi- regularization process to filter semi-regularized workers into official MoU registration. According to this fourth step, semi-regularized workers, many of whom were without any formal identification, were required to provide identification data for verification by home country authorities. They were then able to receive a temporary passport or a certificate of identity, a visa to remain in Thailand for two years (extendable for two years, after which they would then have to return home for at least three years), and a change of work status to \u2018legal\u2019.575 Laotian and Cambodian authorities commenced their nationality verification processes in 2006,576 and workers from both these countries were able to complete the registration process without leaving Thailand. The Myanmar registration process, however, only became operational in 2009,577 with difficulties arising due to the need, initially, for Myanmar workers to return home to carry out the nationality verification process.578 In 2007 the Thai Cabinet agreed to allow all semi-regularized workers who had completed steps (i) to (iii), as described above, permission to stay and work in Thailand until February 2010, by which time they should have undergone the nationality verification process detailed under step (iv). According to the Cabinet resolution, those who did not complete the nationality verification process within this time period would otherwise risk deportation. The February 2010 deadline was later extended until February 2012, provided workers had at least entered the nationality verification process (but not necessarily completed it) by February 2010.579 A subsequent extension was then provided until December 2012, followed by reports in 2013 that additional amnesty periods on any deportations were approved by the government.580 Estimates suggest that from this programme\u2019s inception until end January 2011 approximately 550,000 migrant workers from Myanmar, Lao PDR, and Cambodia had completed all four steps towards regularization and nationality verification,581 including approximately 353,000 from Myanmar, 103,000 from Cambodia, and 93,000 from Lao PDR.582 A further 400,000 are still eligible to complete the national verification process,583 having commenced it by completing steps (i) to (iii) and renewing their work permits. It is important to note, however, that despite the repeated extension of amnesty to enter and complete the nationality verification process, all workers with Tor Ror 38/1 ID numbers are \u201cillegal, pending deportation\u201d due to their initial illegal entry.584 575 Ibid., p. 19. 576 Mekong Migration Network, Policy Overview: The Bilateral MoUs on Cooperation in the Employment of Workers, at http://www. mekongmigration.org/?page_id=80 577 Ibid. 578 Although Myanmar officials now run a national verification centre in Ranong, Thailand, many Myanmar workers must still return to Myanmar if they wish to complete the nationality verification process.

This letter expressed concern that migrant workers whose status remained precarious as a result of the end of amnesty in 2010 had in the past been permitted to stay on in Thailand as they were \u201cfilling important gaps in the Thai Labour Force and strengthening the Thai economy.\u201d The letter pointed to \u201climited public awareness raising both for employers and migrants of what nationality verification is about and what are its benefits, as well as the expense, dangers of misuse of personal information.\u201d586 Similarly, as the most recent December 2012 deadline approached, media reports once again highlighted the expense and difficulty for migrant workers from all three neighbouring countries to negotiate the nationality verification process. Confusion regarding the status of deportation orders has also continued following the December 2012 deadline. The Cambodian Ambassador to Thailand, for example, was quoted in media reports stating that while \u2018officially\u2019 all undocumented Cambodian workers are subject to deportation, a deal had been struck with Thai authorities that would likely see many workers remain in Thailand.587 At the time of the deadline, a representative from the Thai Department of Employment noted that 150,000 Cambodians, 99,000 Laotian, and 60,000 Myanmar migrant workers would be facing deportation. One additional point to note is that reports also suggest that a significant number of migrants entered the nationality verification process with false information in 2010, given the impending threats of deportation and lack of awareness of processes. Commentary has noted, however, that the lack of instances of migrants failing nationality verification subsequently raises doubts regarding the genuineness of this process.588 (ii) Memoranda of understanding processes The second set of processes by which migrant workers are registered to work in Thailand are those outlined in bilateral, government-to-government MoU. Thailand signed separate Memoranda of Understanding on Cooperation in the Employment of Workers with Lao PDR in 2002, and Cambodia and Myanmar in 2003. These MoU focus on government-to-government recruitment of migrant workers for a specific period of employment in Thailand. Migrant workers recruited from outside Thailand under these MoU are provided with visas for temporary stay, plus work permits for a 585 Human Rights Development Foundation, Thailand, 2010, \u201cOpen Letter of Concern for the Safety and Security of Migrant Workers in Thailand\u201d, at http://www.hrw.org/news/2010/01/18/open-letter-concern-safety-and-security-migrant-workers-thailand. 586 Ibid. 587 Phnom Penh Post, \u201cExpulsion looming for migrant workers\u201d, 10 December 2012, at http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index. php/2012121060193/National-news/worker-expulsion-looming.html. 588 Thailand\u2019s Low-Skilled Migration Policy, op. cit. 161 The Right to Health Section III period of two years. These work permits are then renewable for another four years, after which it would be necessary to leave Thailand for a period of three years before re-registering. Upon their introduction, MoU processes were intended to become the official method for recruiting new migrant workers from neighbouring countries. However, at end 2010 only approximately 80,000 workers had been recruited via this process, including 50,000 from Cambodia, 25,000 from Lao PDR, and 1,500 from Myanmar.589 Based on commentary from government, civil society, and migrant worker groups, a number of challenges have been identified in both the semi-regularization and MoU registration systems, including: lack of awareness of both worker and employer regarding the protections registration offers and a perceived lack of benefit of entering into such processes; 590 lack of explanation to migrants in their language, leaving them reliant on employers and potentially exploitative agents if they wanted to take part in the registration process; expense of registration; 591 processes seen as cumbersome, confusing, limited in time span; 592 and the risk to workers of becoming \u2018unregistered\u2019 if they do not follow correct, and complex, procedures when changing work or employers.593 LABOUR MIGRATION AND THE RIGHT TO HEALTH In terms of international standards on right to health for all, Thailand has not ratified the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which provides the most comprehensive provisions for protections of right to health.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61e75104-0648-48ac-8d88-2dfa88e54ff8": {"__data__": {"id_": "61e75104-0648-48ac-8d88-2dfa88e54ff8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9fec7baeefc377fe3c638c415c02ace8d1f7172751c0cc62e2a7067baf29940b"}, "2": {"node_id": "98b1c46b-5e6d-4bf8-ac2e-5c6e368d163e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b606195a937f833e130f6b62a5622bf3fbf9e6b4dfcf5d8abd21c9c36791d5e"}}, "hash": "320f45c24551ede04276711734a1c0d503ee8acd1e6a30a8dff5ef2458ed6327", "text": "It is also not a State Party to most United Nations core conventions that provide for the right of access to health care and medical treatment for all.

Broadly speaking, this research supports anecdotal suggestions that the living conditions and general work environment for many migrants in Thailand are poor, with workers in factories, on construction sites, and in agriculture reporting health problems mainly as a result of poorly maintained equipment and the lack of adequate safety measures. Fishery workers are widely believed to be worse off than other workers. Commentary notes that these workers work in six-hour cycles over a 24-hour work day, with sickness, poor nutrition, abuse, and death at sea being common.596 Nevertheless, despite the relative volume of research, commentary suggests that what data exists is fragmented, due in part to the lack of separate monitoring and reporting systems for migrants and the resultant lack of disaggregated data, as well as to the elusive nature of the migration process in Thailand and the difficulties this creates in maintaining a comprehensive, consolidated evidence-based picture of migrant health, health service provision, and health- seeking behaviours.597 Despite strong progress in this area, key research gaps mean that there is still not enough data to create a comprehensive picture of who the migrants are. Although generalized evidence on what constitutes an effective health-care system for migrant workers does exist,598 interventions and programming to better address the health vulnerabilities of migrants are hindered by budget constraints and shifting politics. What is particularly important to note in Thailand with regard to monitoring migrants\u2019 health is that issues related to the fragmentary nature of available information are not necessarily only a result of lack of data itself, as is the case in many other ASEAN countries. In terms of data management, there are at least nine databases599 containing information on migrant workers, administered by three different ministries.600 Also, data is kept in various formats, making it difficult to compile the data when needed. In terms of data analysis, while a broad range of raw data is available at the local level, data analysis is hindered by the lack of a standardized set of indicators at the national level.601 595 WHO, 2011, WHO Country Cooperation Strategy: Thailand, 2012\u20132016. 596 Mekong Migration Network, 2011, Legally Binding: A Summary of Laws in the Greater Mekong Subregion, p. 40. 597 Baker et al., Research Gaps Concerning the Health of Migrants, op. cit., p. 7. 598 IOM/WHO, 2009, Financing Health Care for Migrants: A case study from Thailand. 599 These are: (1) household registration (TR 38/1),( 2) work permit, (3) medical examination, (4) compulsory migrant health insurance, (5) voluntary migrant health insurance, (6) infectious diseases surveillance (506 Report), (7) HIV/AIDS sentinel serosurveillance (506/1 Report), (8) PMTCT database, and (9) migrant health care service utilization and cost. 600 These are: (1) MoI for household registration (TR 38/1), (2) MoL for work permit, and (3) MoPH for the seven health databases. 601 Jitthai, Migration and HIV/AIDS in Thailand, op. cit., p. 21.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db6fb940-a6a8-4ca1-8023-c85235e0f339": {"__data__": {"id_": "db6fb940-a6a8-4ca1-8023-c85235e0f339", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "298aeafe2ba7bf2b7cbf1e6b450f70d3b051e678116814c42d61b77cdd9876e5"}, "2": {"node_id": "7857257f-c47a-4567-a54a-b7782e15ffb1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "493f011261f10d1a4329c05d1d59b7b14249e35f1e0cb5a4763bf74c19b124bf"}}, "hash": "e3655cb9a10a3769afb39ed71157930201e88465f9a30c1ad9d07315da3a2eb3", "text": "cit., p. 21. 163 The Right to Health Section III Policies and legal frameworks affecting migrant health A policy of universal health care was implemented in Thailand in 2002, which has resulted in almost 99 percent coverage for Thai nationals through a range of health protection schemes.602 Health care protection for the general population is now provided via three means: (i) a Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme, covering 7 percent of the population; (ii) two schemes for private employees \u2014 the Worker Compensation Scheme and the Social Security Scheme \u2014 covering 15 percent; and (iii) a scheme for all other", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f24f6461-b6a9-4507-8c96-c83a227bde27": {"__data__": {"id_": "f24f6461-b6a9-4507-8c96-c83a227bde27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae7ea6ed3c5918e0e87625330b93c3e0cadcfff448549f81c885010284743a3f"}}, "hash": "ae7ea6ed3c5918e0e87625330b93c3e0cadcfff448549f81c885010284743a3f", "text": "Thai people \u2014 the Universal Coverage Scheme \u2014 which covers 76 percent of the population.603 According to legislation, migrant workers who have completed all steps under the MoU processes, described earlier, are eligible for coverage under the Social Security Scheme.

A renewed plan for 2012\u20132016 was approved by the Cabinet and launched by the Minister of Public Health in August 2012. A Strategic Plan on Migrant Health for the same period is still in draft. Strategies included in these plans focus on the provision of quality services in relevant languages; increased participation of migrant communities; and improved training for relevant health personnel involved in the provision of health care to migrants in Thailand.604 International organizations and non-governmental organizations have also implemented programmes to provide additional health services in border areas. In addition, A National Master Plan for HIV/AIDS Prevention, Care, and Support for Migrants and Mobile Population (MMP), 2007\u20132011 was also developed and launched by the Department of Disease Control in 2007, aiming to reduce new HIV infections among MMP and increase quality of life of HIV-positive MMP. Nevertheless, progress in this area has been hindered by a lack of budget and implementation directives in the national master plan. While a second master plan is currently being drafted, progress remains unclear. Generally speaking, registered migrant workers have access to two different types of health care, dependent on whether they are semi-regularized or fully documented. Recent policy developments are also aimed at increasing insurance coverage options for undocumented workers. The particulars of available insurance schemes are described below. (i) Compulsory Migrant Health Insurance Scheme This scheme is compulsory for semi-regularized workers with a Tor ID number. It is administered by the Ministry of Public Health, and migrants are required to pay 1,300 baht ($42) per year, plus an additional 600 baht ($19) for health examinations. This scheme is also open to dependents of semi-regularized workers, on a voluntary basis. Migrant workers under this scheme are eligible to receive the following general care (however, to access it they must return to the same hospital in 602 WHO Country Cooperation Strategy: Thailand, 2012\u20132016, op. cit. 603 Ibid., p. 22. 604 IOM, Migrant Information Note: Issue 10, April 2011. 164 Country profile: Thailand which they received health screening): physical examination, diagnosis, treatment, child delivery, rehabilitation, dental care, board and meals in the common inpatient ward, medicine and medical products covered by the National Drug List, and medical referral.605 Migrant workers also receive access to accident and emergency treatment, but here again only within the province in which they are registered.606 A number of services are excluded from the compulsory migrant health insurance scheme. For example, workers do not have access to the social security scheme or work accident compensation. Under the medical referral component of this scheme migrant workers are eligible for referral to other hospitals, which may be in other provinces, for certain conditions for which adequate treatment is not available at the hospital where the migrant is registered for health insurance. However, referral and treatment for a number of conditions, including antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS and kidney dialysis, is excluded. At the same time, it is important to note that while the compulsory migrant health insurance scheme is more limited in its range of treatment, a component of the funds generated by its implementation are dedicated to preventative health measures, for which there is no provision in the Social Security Scheme. Until recently, documented workers have had no access to this health insurance, although they could pay for medical treatment at a government or private hospital; and on special conditions, decided by service providers, they could benefit from free treatment. However, in August 2013 eligibility for the compulsory migrant health insurance scheme was expanded to include undocumented migrants and their dependents. To enrol, undocumented workers are required to undergo an initial medical exam, pay an annual fee of 2,200 baht ($67), and pay 600 baht ($18) for each subsequent annual exam.607 A number of challenges have been identified within this system, including: (i) employers\u2019 practice of keeping employees\u2019 work permits and health cards as a means to deter them from running away or changing jobs, which in turn prevents them from getting medical care; 608 (ii) reluctance of migrants to access health facilities due to a range of factors, including language barriers, perceived and real discrimination, and fear of harassment or arrest by authorities; (iii) an inability to pay the fees; 609 and (iv) lack of training among medical staff to deal with migrants", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "809dd0eb-206d-4cdf-ba30-39e6931e90ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "809dd0eb-206d-4cdf-ba30-39e6931e90ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f0e780d27ef194c60ded62c86dedf3a6946b55c02b6d87f225962782d1b9d77"}, "3": {"node_id": "71b51ccc-c677-40ec-8ffe-e041eb957dcb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d37c91aca3bf0f87b24bc6f75c2f63736e0805b72ca355559efb5fb9d8a0dc31"}}, "hash": "e07fa1cc56b36dc7894b5c5cf397ba17561229af74eae05086543d63b22ba010", "text": "from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds.

It is important to note that discussions with migrants suggest that this may not be the preferred method of health coverage for a variety of reasons, including: (i) the level of expense, for both workers and employers, compared to the 1,300 baht scheme; (ii) the liability of employers to enrol migrant employees, and their failure to fulfil this requirement; and (iii) the unnecessary inclusion of long-term benefits that relatively short-term migrants will be unable to access. Although each of these schemes demonstrates progress in the provision of health care for migrant workers, commentary notes a recognized lack of long-term planning and policy coherence across the ministries of Interior, Labour, and Public Health, making it difficult to plan for migrant health needs and ensure better health security for all in Thailand.612 Further accessibility-related issues include the fact that hospitals and health care providers are unable to hire migrant workers to work as translators due to restrictions on the type of work migrants may carry out.613 Although this latter issue has been addressed partially with the assistance of international NGOs and donor support,614 and by the placement of migrant worker volunteers and migrant health assistants, there is no clear policy approach from the government on the provision of care and support in the language of migrant workers. Most recently, in September 2013 Ministers of Health from Thailand and Myanmar signed a memorandum of understanding for strengthening border health collaboration between the two countries.615 610

the notion that such improvement may increase the number of migrants coming to Thailand from abroad,616 which could place extra strains on the health system and thus possibly have a detrimental impact on the health of Thais.617 A recent survey of Thai public opinions on Myanmar refugees and displaced persons, led by the Institute for Population and Social Research at Mahidol University, found that while a majority of Thai respondents supported registered migrant workers being provided with the same standard of health care as Thais, most preferred that health care be provided via separate facilities and that workers themselves should finance such services.618 At the same time, strong examples of the push for more migrant-sensitive health systems include programmes run by the

Within the subregional group of Thailand, Myanmar, Lao PDR, and Cambodia, a number of consultations have also been held to look at cross-border partnerships in this area.620 In addition, non-government partnerships also include the Migrant Working Group, composed of Thai NGOs working on migrant issues, and the UN Thematic Working Group on Migrants, composed of United Nations agencies in Thailand working on migrant issues. 616 Baker et al., Research Gaps Concerning the Health of Migrants, op. cit., p. 5. 617 Ibid. 618 The Survey of Thai Public Opinions on Myanmar refugees and displaced persons, op. cit., p. v. 619 Huguet, J., 2008, \u201cDo International Migration Policies in Thailand Achieve their Objectives?\u201d, p. 8\u20139, cited in A Situation Analysis on Health System Strengthening for Migrants in Thailand, op. cit. 620 For example: (i) Consultation on Migrants\u2019 Access to Anti-Retroviral Treatment Along the Migration Continuum in Four Greater Mekong Subregion Countries, see www.junima.org; and (ii) Consultation on Memorandum of Understanding to Reduce HIV Vulnerability Associated with Population Movement, see http://regionalcentrebangkok.undp.or.th/practices/hivaids/GMSMOUConsultationJuly2012.html. 167 The Right to Health Section III RECOMMENDATIONS Monitoring migrants\u2019 health 1 Design and implement a nationally standardized system for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of disaggregated data collected at the provincial level on migrant workers, examining health care needs and health-seeking behaviour throughout the migration cycle.

The Vietnamese Government actively promotes labour migration as part of its poverty reduction and economic development strategies, and data from the World Bank estimates that remittances from migrant workers constituted seven percent of GDP in 2009.621 Broadly speaking, labour export is aimed at contributing to: (i) the development of human resources and technical skills, (ii) employment creation and greater income for workers, (iii) increased foreign currency earnings, and (iv) enhanced international relations.622 In terms of push factors for individual migrants, research among Vietnamese labour migrants travelling to Malaysia, Taiwan, and South Korea found that beyond migrating to earn more income, workers hoped to use money earned overseas to pay family debts, children\u2019s education costs, make home improvements, and pay health care expenses.623 621 World Bank, 2011, Migration and Remittances Factbook 2011. 622 Dang, N.

The feminization of Vietnamese labour migration has recently increased, with more women migrant workers heading to Malaysia and Taiwan in particular.627 In the case of Taiwan, Viet Nam has been a major source of labour since 2000; 628 and as of June 2011, Taiwan was host to approximately 87,000 Vietnamese migrant workers,629 with a reported 39,000 new or return workers deployed each year.630 More than half of all documented workers deployed to Taiwan from Viet Nam are female and work predominantly as domestics, while others are engaged in manufacturing, fisheries, and farming.631 In the case of South Korea, approximately 13,000 Vietnamese workers are admitted annually to the country under the Employment Permit System.632 At the end of 2010 approximately 57,000 Vietnamese workers were in South Korea, 8,000 of whom were undocumented.

LABOUR MIGRATION GOVERNANCE The Law on Vietnamese Workers Working Overseas Under Contract 2006, which came into effect in July 2007, regulates recruitment, contracting, pre-departure training, fee payments, and migrant rights\u2019 protection while overseas. Under this legislation, cross-border labour migration is managed within Viet Nam by the Department of Overseas Labour, within the Ministry of Labour, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MoLISA), and by provincial departments of MoLISA. MoLISA is responsible for granting licenses to recruitment enterprises, which are then responsible for the entire recruitment process, including pre-departure training, contract signing, collection of commissions, overseeing rights of workers while in country, liaising with embassies and consulates, reporting back to MoLISA, and arranging repatriation where necessary. In the case of workers deployed to the East-Asian destination countries Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, MoLISA also carries out bilateral negotiations to agree on specific regulations supplementary to those included in labour export legislation. Essentially, according to legislation and bilateral negotiations, Vietnamese migrant workers can travel overseas to work via four channels: (i) through Vietnamese enterprises licensed to provide labour services according to contracts signed with foreign partners; (ii) through Vietnamese enterprises and/or individuals with labour-supply contracts or investments overseas; (iii) through Vietnamese enterprises that send workers overseas for skill-improvement internships; or (iv) under labour contracts signed by individual workers directly with employers overseas.636 Neither Viet Nam nor any of the primary destination countries for low-skilled Vietnamese labour migrants have ratified the International Convention on the Protection of Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families or the ILO\u2019s Migration for Employment Convention (No. 97) or Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) (No. 143).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a4ccd20-65dc-4859-a5e2-cddc6a3418de": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a4ccd20-65dc-4859-a5e2-cddc6a3418de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35d0015065bc7837f1a04e0da322b551a15cfbed368b5c84d443c9859c072674"}, "2": {"node_id": "75a810c7-303d-4da0-be60-c6f99597d58f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8041834ddf9b1d4db9ff48464c73502acfc108b1cf782758c1972338a2eaa6c3"}}, "hash": "5226aafd731cf567310f7ae24d38fe9c538c0737072b7282ed84a247129d7fdd", "text": "97) or Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) (No. 143).

Established in 2007, the regulations cover the content of training and time to be devoted to various topics, including: basic content of labour law; labour contracts; labour discipline, safety, and occupational health.646 Commentary notes that the delivery of effective pre- departure training for all workers has been a challenge for a variety of reasons,647 including the fact that responsibility for certification of completion lies with the recruitment agencies, rather than independent and/or government bodies. Nevertheless, certain recent initiatives have the potential to increase the protection of migrant workers\u2019 rights.

Viet Nam is also not a State Party to most of the core United Nations conventions that provide for right of access to health care and medical treatment. Nevertheless, it has ratified Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which provides for the right to access health-care services on a basis of gender equality (theoretically including migrant workers beyond national citizens). As a WHO Member State, the country is committed to the WHO Resolution on the Health of Migrants, adopted at the 61st World Health Assembly in 2008, which recognizes increased health risks for groups of migrants and calls for the promotion of migrant-sensitive health policies and equitable access to health promotion, disease prevention, and care.652 Monitoring migrants\u2019 health While documented Vietnamese migrant workers must undergo health examinations prior to departure for work abroad, it is the responsibility of labour export enterprises to record results of such data, only as a means to demonstrate compliance in carrying out the mandatory health 648 MoLISA, \u201cFirst Migrant Resource Centre Opens in Viet Nam\u201d, 4 June 2012, at http://english.molisa.gov.vn/news/viewdetail/tabid/339/ newsid/54946/seo/First-Migrant-Resource-Center-MRC-opens-in-Viet-Nam/language/en-US/Default.aspx. 649 Viet Nam News, \u201cExperts discuss overseas workers issues\u201d, 23", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a27a1856-2c30-4940-b082-dd9f2242d569": {"__data__": {"id_": "a27a1856-2c30-4940-b082-dd9f2242d569", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a5fbb1d900f981a57839e061d4109ead2e2e03af8a49f0273c332169b21d177"}, "3": {"node_id": "e1259200-8cc9-4f2f-9e1c-6fa532b9fefa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba8d96368b903cf93eb51efbd8823751d82e21b0d0c529202cabcdff6089b641"}}, "hash": "02c53570e841224e8cf6fa4e7a35d3b9c5fe94ae2d08cac0c42d1fca670620b2", "text": "April 2012, at http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/opinion/in-the- spotlight/223827/experts-discuss-overseas-worker-issues.html. 650 Vietnamese Association of Manpower, 2010, Code of Conduct Applied to Vietnamese enterprises sending workers for overseas employment. 651 Ibid. 652 WHA 61.17, Resolution on Health of Migrants. 174 Country profile: Viet Nam examination. The government itself keeps no data on the health of migrant workers,653 and there is also no mechanism for monitoring migrant workers\u2019 health once they are deployed or upon return. Although in particular cases where workers are deployed in a group a Vietnamese doctor may be sent to provide clinical health care,654 there is no mechanism for data collection and reporting on health care needs in these cases either.655 Policies and legal frameworks affecting migrant health Under the Law on Vietnamese Workers Working Overseas under Contract, enterprises engaged in the recruitment of workers are mandated to ensure that workers have access to periodic health checks, consultation, and hospitalization in case of sickness and accidents. In the event that the worker is incapable of performing work abroad, the enterprise must also arrange and bear all expenses for the worker\u2019s return.656 In reality, however, a lack of human resources and capacity to address and monitor issues related to migrant health care results in cases of migrants being left without access to legislated protections.657 Migrant-sensitive health systems Much of the limited research that exists on the health access and experiences of Vietnamese migrant workers abroad focuses on those who migrate via informal channels, rather than those who are deployed via official, registered channels. In the case of the latter group, feedback from the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids, and Social Affairs suggests that almost all such workers are covered by health insurance in host countries. In addition, many Vietnamese recruitment enterprises buy their workers voluntary health and medical insurance during their stay overseas.658 On the other hand, surveys that also include those workers who migrate via informal channels identify key challenges in accessing health systems and services during the migration cycle. For example, a survey of more than 600 returned workers and more than 600 households with a migrant worker abroad found that approximately 8 percent of Vietnamese migrant workers experienced physical abuse while deployed abroad, while verbal abuse was experienced by one third. Work related injuries were also found to be common, with one in six reporting having been injured in the workplace, and only 20 percent of these workers having received some form of compensation.659 In terms of medical care, workers tended only to attend hospital when a health 653 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit. 654 Ibid., p. 63.

For example, research among 220 Vietnamese workers migrating along the East-West economic corridor, primarily those migrating via informal channels, found that they received little assistance from embassies, consulates, or civil society organizations in destination countries when faced with social welfare issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1259200-8cc9-4f2f-9e1c-6fa532b9fefa": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1259200-8cc9-4f2f-9e1c-6fa532b9fefa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a5fbb1d900f981a57839e061d4109ead2e2e03af8a49f0273c332169b21d177"}, "2": {"node_id": "a27a1856-2c30-4940-b082-dd9f2242d569", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02c53570e841224e8cf6fa4e7a35d3b9c5fe94ae2d08cac0c42d1fca670620b2"}}, "hash": "ba8d96368b903cf93eb51efbd8823751d82e21b0d0c529202cabcdff6089b641", "text": "Discussions in multi-stakeholder meetings suggest that there is a need in Viet Nam for learning from other sending and receiving countries in order to address migrant health issues, and a need to both improve human resources and increase capacity to address issues related to migrant health.662 At the same time, some strong recent examples of partnerships within Viet Nam that might assist migrant workers during the migration cycle include: (i) the establishment of a Migrant Resource Centre in Hanoi, in partnership of the International Organization for Migration, the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94f793af-8c5b-4667-be9a-ba5dc626d979": {"__data__": {"id_": "94f793af-8c5b-4667-be9a-ba5dc626d979", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6fef6da544c9c16ead6118e16af8240719a36faac3eaf4acbc2217e11753bc83"}, "3": {"node_id": "1d7154fc-0083-47ed-80c0-48e96dd582a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef9ca949cc723cf718cf57696bf8da87af0381ad981d609d63fee51e617252b1"}}, "hash": "dacf98696de2288146620cbf4023690701f1b9c7a4f40bb0d52d993cf070fb6c", "text": "Department of Overseas Labour, and the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union;

While some commentary attributes the failure of ratification to a lack of promotion and awareness,673 further investigations reveal that a number of countries, particularly host countries, have avoided ratification in the belief that it would significantly limit their ability to regulate the admission of migrant workers, or that the granting of rights to migrant workers would come at considerable cost to this host country.674 Although the ICMW faces certain credibility issues as a result of its low level of ratification, it nevertheless provides a useful framework to examine the range of rights violations experienced by migrant workers and the protections available in the international arena. In essence, the ICMW \u201cgrants regular migrants a number of rights on the basis of equality with nationals\u201d, stipulating that migrant workers \u201cshall enjoy treatment not less favourable than that which applies to nationals of the State of employment in respect of remuneration\u201d and conditions of work including \u201covertime, hours of work, weekly rest, holidays with pay, safety, health\u201d. 675 In terms of how such protections might be realized, it recognizes that bilateral agreements will play an important role; that irregular migrants cannot be ignored in discussions on the protection of migrant workers\u2019 rights; and that protection is not only about rights being available but also 671 Ibid., p. 9. 672 OHCHR, 2005, \u201cThe International Convention on Migrant Workers and its Committee: Fact Sheet No.24 (Rev.1)\u201d, at http://www.ohchr.org/ Documents/Publications/FactSheet24rev.1en.pdf. 673 Ruh, M., 2012, \u201cThe Human Rights of Migrant Workers: Why do so few countries care?\u201d, American Behavioural Scientist, vol. 56(9), p. 1277. 674 Ibid. 675 ICMW, article 25. This article has important implications for advocacy on recognition of predominantly female foreign domestic workers, who are not recognized under employment law in any of the host countries among ASEAN Member States. 181 The Right to Health how accessible they are. The convention makes repeated reference to the provision of information and materials to migrant workers and their families in \u201ca language they understand\u201d and the importance of respect for cultural identity. It also notes that all migrant workers and members of their families have the \u201cright to be informed by the State of origin, the State of employment of the State of transit\u201d of their rights according to the ICMW.676 In 2010 the Committee on Migrant Workers also adopted the General Comment 1 on migrant domestic workers,677 which noted the absence of \u201cexpress references to either domestic work or domestic workers in a broad range of national and international frameworks of law\u201d and aimed to provide guidance on obligations with respect to migrant domestic workers. Important points included in this comment are: \u2022 Clarification on the fact that migrant workers are protected throughout the whole migration process, which comprises preparation for migration, departure, transit, and the entire period of stay and remunerated activity in the state of employment as well as return to the state of origin or the state of habitual residence \u2022 Clarification that migrant domestic workers are included in the term \u201cmigrant worker\u201d and that any distinction made to exclude migrant domestic workers from protection would constitute a prima facie violation of the convention. With regard to health-related rights for migrant workers, the ICMW recognizes the importance of providing access to social security and the right to receive emergency medical care, as well as access to other social and health services.678 It also notes that with respect to social security, migrant workers and members of their families shall enjoy the same treatment granted to nationals in so far as they fulfil the requirements provided for by the applicable legislation of that state and the applicable bilateral and multilateral treaties.679 Importantly, according to this treaty, access to emergency medical care should not be refused by reason of any irregularity with regard to their stay or employment.680 ILO C97 Migration for Employment Convention This convention is based on the principle of equal treatment of nationals and regular migrant workers in labour-related areas. As per the ICMW, this convention has achieved a relatively low level of ratification.

The provisions of this convention only relate to regular, fully-documented migrant workers. It obliges State Parties to adhere to certain standards with regard to medical examinations, care, and hygiene before the migration journey, during the journey, and on arrival.682 Specific protections include the requirement of State Parties to grant workers equal treatment with regard to remuneration, membership in trade unions, and enjoyment of the benefits of collective bargaining, accommodation, and social security.683 ILO C143 Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention This convention includes rights protections for both documented and undocumented migrant workers. It has received only 23 ratifications, again significantly less than the aforementioned average of 163 ratifications for the eight core ILO treaties. Within the ASEAN region, only the Philippines has ratified this convention. Articles of this convention call for equal treatment and equality of opportunity with regard to employment and occupation, of social security, of trade union and cultural rights and of individual and collective freedoms for persons who as migrant workers or as members of their families are lawfully within its territory.684 Further stipulations include that host countries must not restrict a migrant\u2019s right to free choice of employment for more than two years and that loss of employment shall not, in its own, imply a loss of residence permit.685 Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No.189) This is the most recent convention of the ILO, adopted in June 2011. To date, it has been ratified by just two countries, Uruguay and the Philippines. Following ratification by these two countries, it came into force mid-2013. Although this convention is not migrant-specific, it is highly relevant within the ASEAN region given the increasing number of female foreign workers from ASEAN source countries working in this sector. Foreign domestic workers are mentioned explicitly in article 8 of the convention, which provides for the provision of a written job offer or employment contract before the workers\u2019 departure from the home country, which is enforceable in the host country. 681 Lyon, B., 2010, \u201cThe Unsigned United Nations Migrant Workers Rights Convention\u201d, Journal of International Law and Politics, vol. 42, pp. 389\u2013500 . 682 International Commission of Jurists, Migration and International Human Rights Law, p. 211. 683 C143, article 6. 684 C143, article 10. 685 C143, article 8. 183 The Right to Health The convention defines domestic work as that performed in or for a household or households, and provides for such protections as minimum wage, weekly rest periods (and freedom to move outside the household during these rest periods), and protection from abuse. Within the ASEAN region support for this convention is polarized. While the Philippines chaired the Domestic Workers Convention negotiating process and Indonesia expressed strong support for the convention, both Singapore and Malaysia abstained from voting on its adoption in 2011, stating that the concerns of domestic workers could be addressed within the framework of existing national laws and policies.686 ASEAN Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of Migrant Workers Rights The ASEAN Declaration on Migrant Workers is a legally non-binding instrument that was adopted in 2007, recognizing migrant workers as a vulnerable group whose rights require protection. The declaration acknowledges cases of abuse and violence against migrant workers, and contains obligations for both sending and receiving states related to enhanced protection of the fundamental human rights, welfare, and dignity of migrant workers. While the signing of this declaration in 2007 represented a particularly important step towards regional responses on the issues related to migrant workers, it is important to note that in order to implement the declaration an instrument for its implementation must still be drafted.

This resolution calls on Member States to take action on migrant-sensitive health policies and practices688 and to promote the exchange of information and dialogue among Member States. Specifically, it recognizes that: health outcomes can be influenced by the multiple dimensions of migration; some groups of migrants experience increased health risks; and there is a need for additional data on migrants\u2019 health and their access to health care in order to substantiate evidence-based policies. The resolution also calls upon Member States to promote migrant-sensitive health policies; 689 to establish health information systems in order to assess and analyse trends in migrants\u2019 health, disaggregating health information by relevant categories; 690 to gather, document, and share information and best practices for meeting migrants\u2019 health needs in countries of origin or return, transit, or destination; 691 to raise health service providers\u2019 and professionals\u2019 cultural and gender sensitivity to migrants\u2019 health issues; 692 and to promote bilateral and multilateral cooperation on migrants\u2019 health among countries involved in the whole migratory process.693 A follow-up Global Consultation on Migrant Health in 2010 also produced an Operational Framework for Migrant Health, which established four priority pillars to help Member States to 688 WHO, 2008, World Health Assembly, at www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2008/wha61/en/index.html. 689 Resolution on Migrant Health, article 1. 690 Ibid., article 3. 691 Ibid., article 5. 692 Ibid., article 7. 693 Ibid., article 8. 185 The Right to Health operationalize the goals of this resolution: (i) establishment of policies and legal frameworks; (ii) monitoring of migrant health; (iii) partnerships, networks, and multi-country frameworks; and (iv) migrant-sensitive health systems.

In particular, article 13 states that comprehensive national approaches to improving social welfare and social inclusion and cohesion in the context of labour migration are necessary and should be promoted. 694 ILO Multi-lateral Framework on Labour Migration (non-binding principles and guidelines for a rights-based approach to labour migration) These guidelines were developed by the

populations are included as vulnerable populations under UNAIDS strategies in each of the ASEAN member countries. A key focus of UNAIDS strategy with regard to migrant and mobile populations also includes the elimination of HIV-related restrictions on entry, stay, and residence. In the ASEAN region, three of the four host countries Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore currently have legislated restrictions against entry, stay, and residence of people living with HIV. ILO Recommendation 200: Recommendation concerning HIV and AIDS and the World of Work (2010) This ILO recommendation provides for universal access to prevention, treatment, care, and support services for all workers working under all forms or arrangements, and at all workplaces, regardless of their legal status or occupation. Thus, by definition, both documented and undocumented cross-border migrant workers are within its scope. Key components of this recommendation related to migrants include: prohibition of mandatory HIV testing, screening, or disclosure at any stage of migration; prohibition of discrimination in or exclusion from migration on the basis of real or perceived HIV status; 701 and support for migrants to obtain universal access to HIV education, information, treatment, care, and support. It also provides for training, safety instructions, and any necessary guidance to be given in a clear and accessible form to ensure a safe and healthy work environment.702 ASEAN Declaration of Commitment: Getting to Zero New Infections, Zero Discrimination, Zero AIDS-Related Deaths This ASEAN Declaration of Commitment, adopted in 2011, notes that migrant and mobile populations continue to be particularly vulnerable to HIV, and specifically commits to overcoming barriers to treatment.703 In a range of commitments indirectly related to migrants, it also aims to expand and promote access to HIV testing that is voluntary, confidential, and rights-based; and to make full use of existing flexibilities under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS) to secure and expand access to affordable HIV diagnostics and treatment.704 700 Ibid., article 84. 701 ILO, 2010, \u201cRecommendation Concerning HIV and AIDS and the World of Work\u201d, article 3, (c), at http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/--- ed_norm/---relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_142613.pdf. 702 Ibid., article 30. 703 \u201cASEAN Declaration of Commitment: Getting to Zero New Infections, Zero Discrimination, Zero AIDS-Related Deaths\u201d, article 18(b)ii. 704 Ibid., article 18(b)iii. 187 The Right to Health ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community Blueprint (ASCC) 2009\u20132015 As part of the Road Map for the ASEAN Community, ASEAN\u2019s objectives and activities are divided among three communities: the ASEAN Political Security Community, the ASEAN Economic Community, and the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC). Each of these three communities runs according to a blueprint that outlines ASEAN\u2019s priorities and targets. Issues of migration, health, and development come under the ASCC, and are guided by its blueprint. Migrants are referred to specifically in action lines that come under priorities such as promotion of decent work,705 access to health care/promotion of healthy lifestyles,706 and the protection and promotion of the rights of migrant workers.707 Responsibility for driving the migration, health, and development response lies with the ASEAN Health Ministers Meeting and the Senior Officials Meeting on Health and Development. Under these guiding bodies, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia are the lead countries guiding the response to migrant health, in addition to the Health and Communicable Diseases Division of the ASEAN Secretariat. 705 ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community, blueprint, section A.

Critically, attention must be drawn to the hard work of the national research teams in Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam which collected the data, provided data analysis and wrote the individual country reports that this regional analysis is based on. iii Foreword Despite impressive gains in the response to the HIV epidemic in Asia and the Pacific, a notable weakness of the national responses in the region has been the inadequate efforts to mitigate the social and economic impact of the epidemic on people living with HIV, and their households. One of the reasons for this gap has been the deficiency of evidence that could guide impact mitigation policies and programmes at the national and provincial levels. To address this issue, since 2005 UNDP has undertaken national studies to assess the socio-economic impact of HIV on people living with HIV and their households. The first such case-controlled study was conducted in India in partnership with the National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). Based on the lessons learned from this study, as well as experiences from the rest of the region and elsewhere, the HIV, Health and Development Team of the UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Centre (APRC) supported similar studies in Cambodia, China, Viet Nam and Indonesia. The studies employed case-controlled, large-scale sample surveys across several provinces in each country and provided scientific evidence on the nature and extent of the social and economic impact of HIV on people living with HIV and their households. A new dimension of impact mitigation in the region has been the emerging importance of social protection. Although there is increasing attention to social protection for vulnerable and marginalised populations in the region, the need for HIV-sensitive social protection has not gained commensurate currency, probably because of the relatively poor understanding of the issue. Given this context, the UNDP HIV, Health and Development team undertook a regional analysis of the data and findings of the national studies that covered about 17,000 households and 72,000 household members in five countries with a view to strengthening evidence-informed policy advocacy for impact mitigation and HIV-sensitive social protection. This report presents the findings and recommendations of the analysis. A highlight of the report is that for the first time in the region, it provides irrefutable, quantitative evidence on the nature and depth of the socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels. The data has also been disaggregated by sex and analysed separately to measure the impact of HIV on women and girls. The findings and recommendations of this analysis are presented in a separate stand-alone report.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16dce943-faae-4a51-ad60-ed574c92e3a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "16dce943-faae-4a51-ad60-ed574c92e3a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7ba38808ab9fa02b6d6e8a006fa86039c8c1c03da9c50cdc2b0389c885bba23"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c9bcd3b-f693-46b9-b0c7-f73d732ebf01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0854e8bc1d2464e822673658874618eb94238d35ffe4e79e2177ab166ba97fa7"}}, "hash": "7071d183b190e0c546a6e808e856e3f700287a24f1ca9dcfbc02de910ea4732f", "text": "The findings and recommendations of this analysis are presented in a separate stand-alone report.

Background It is widely acknowledged that HIV severely impacts the economic and social spheres of all societies. Over the past several years, governments in Asia have made important advances in the introduction of new policies and programmes aimed at mitigating the socio-economic impact of HIV on individuals living with HIV and their households. Examples include China\u2019s \u2018Four Free and One Care\u201d policy1 and India\u2019s free provision of second-line ARV medicines and a number of HIV-sensitive social protection schemes. Despite these advances, there have only been limited attempts to measure the specific impact of HIV at the household level and use this information", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5d1ce62-93ee-4db1-b807-8dc71d428d22": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5d1ce62-93ee-4db1-b807-8dc71d428d22", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "063eb1cd2f529f9bbf51699116ce17f2994c5e822a834dbf8e3f529c0a0f462d"}, "3": {"node_id": "7411e9d8-4e29-4dd0-8722-e434422c090c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de13445dcca5e42ee130c50a8435da41ed4da69bcb08cfcaff08498799a97ebd"}}, "hash": "bff255e6eeb69331fabcb5498379a74a4449bc4232432ae0e2d3a871dfadcba6", "text": "for evidence-based policy interventions. To address this vital gap, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) undertook nationwide socio- economic impact studies in Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam between 2005 and 2010. This analysis is based on the data and findings from the country level studies and is meant to support the development of targeted, evidence-informed impact mitigation policies and programs in the region, with particular emphasis on HIV-sensitive social protection. All the countries studied face concentrated epidemics, and many of them have HIV prevalence that has either remained steady or decreased in recent years. Indonesia, however, has seen an increase in prevalence in recent years, and in certain regions of the country is facing a generalized epidemic. Despite the general similarities of most of their epidemics, policies regarding the mitigation of HIV\u2019s socio-economic impacts vary widely over the region. This report, therefore, also aims to identify critical entry points for strategic, policy and programmatic interventions to minimise the negative consequences of HIV on people living with HIV (PLHIV) and their households.

Methodology and Data The studies all involved surveys of HIV-affected households (HIV- HHs) and non-affected households (NA-HHs) and examined critical socio-economic issues: income, employment, revenues, expenditures, coping mechanisms, health, education, food security, family composition, impact on women and girls, and stigma and discrimination. While the survey instruments used in the various studies were adapted to meet the specific needs and circumstances of each country, they followed a broad common methodology developed by UNDP that allowed for inter-country comparisons. The surveys were conducted over a period of six years, starting with India in 2004 and ending with Cambodia in 2010. In total, over 17,000 households were included in the surveys, compiling data on over 72,000 household members. The details of the number of households covered and year each survey was conducted are shown in Table 1.

Throughout the studies, the household size varied by country and HIV status from the smallest with an average size of 3.4 members in NA-HHs of Indonesia to the largest of 4.6 members in Cambodia. Households also varied by their urban and rural locations. There were similar ratios of the sexes found throughout the household members, but varied for PLHIV. HIV-HH members in Cambodia and Viet Nam were less educated than those in NA-HHs, and PLHIV in Cambodia and Indonesia were less educated than other members of their households. HIV-HH members in Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam were more likely to be widowed than NA-HH members, and PLHIV were the most likely to be widowed. Key Findings 4. Living Conditions, Income and Employment Overall, members of HIV-HHs lived in lower living conditions, were more likely to be unemployed, and had lower household incomes than members of NA-HHs. At the most basic level, respondents from NA-HHs in Cambodia, China, India and Viet Nam were more likely to live in stable structures than those in HIV-HHs. With regard to employment, male members of HIV-HHs in Cambodia, China and Indonesia had lower employment levels than those in NA-HHs, and PLHIV in Cambodia and Indonesia were almost twice as likely to be unemployed as NA-HH members. Specifically for PLHIV, their employment levels in Cambodia, China, India and Viet Nam dropped substantially after their diagnosis. A common thread throughout the countries was the additional impact of care-giving on income and employment. A quarter of PLHIV in Cambodia, India and Indonesia had a caregiver, many of whom had either left their job or experienced reduced income as a result of their care-giving duties. In terms of productivity, in all countries, HIV-positive status or care-giving resulted in greater numbers of lost work days than was experienced by members of NA-HHs. As a result of the above- mentioned factors, the reduction in income attributable to HIV in Cambodia, China, India and Viet Nam ranged from $1,119 in Viet Nam to $52 in India. Notably HIV-HHs in Indonesia had higher income levels than NA-HHs, largely because of the social transfers they received. However, in China, India and also in Indonesia, a greater percentage of HIV-HHs were below the poverty line than NA-HHs (68%, 29% and 38% more, respectively). Additionally, in Cambodia, China, India and Viet Nam, child labour levels were higher in HIV-HHs than NA-HHs, especially for girls (almost double in Cambodia, and over ten times greater in China), providing insight to some of the coping mechanisms taken on by HIV-HHs to deal with lower total annual household incomes than NA-HHs. 5. Coping Mechanisms: Asset Liquidation, Migration, Debt, Consumption, and Loss of Savings In addition to the effects of reduced employment and income, the potential medium to long-term effects of HIV are manifest in the reduction of assets, migration, debt, consumption and overall loss of savings. It is well documented that HIV affects individuals through the continual need to spend more on medical expenses, often resulting in the need for coping mechanisms such as asset liquidation or assumption of debt. In all countries, HIV-HHs were less likely to own their house than NA-HHs and were less likely to own most assets included in the surveys. The greatest impact was evident in Cambodia, China and India where, on average, NA-HHs were 24% more likely to have reported owning their house than HIV-HHs. The least impact was found in Viet Nam. This finding points to a reduction in asset accumulation that has deleterious effects on the financial stability of the HIV-affected households. Additionally, HIV-HHs and PLHIV in Cambodia and Viet Nam were more likely to have migrated than NA-HHs, and there were high levels of HIV-HH migration in India and Indonesia. The reasons for migration varied, but discrimination and seeking medical care were important issues in many countries. The deleterious effect of HIV on asset accumulation is also evident in the forced reduction in savings. The most serious impact was seen in Indonesia, where almost 50% of HIV-HHs reported they had lost savings due to HIV.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b89061ed-49a6-4d13-8213-3b2883efd344": {"__data__": {"id_": "b89061ed-49a6-4d13-8213-3b2883efd344", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0678bfaec54da34e23638ec5c97923418ef5a151a321ee308c4db6bea60f4cb0"}, "2": {"node_id": "38a58f1a-681d-4073-b09d-e89515e967be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd8a7529142cac6b3b593f463c665daaa174f4b4a127c060bad142be24ee2df2"}}, "hash": "c86a90df833224ffe2eaefe8db45a9def447f8bb44010e5decb4eade4ea70ec0", "text": "In addition, HIV-HHs in Cambodia, India, and Viet Nam were more likely to be in debt than NA-HHs, mostly attributable to the need to supplement their lost incomes or the high costs of medical care.

Indeed, HIV-HHs in India, Indonesia and Viet Nam spent three to four times as much on health care as NA-HHs, although it should be noted that in Cambodia, with its universal ART coverage policy, HIV-HHs spent less on health care than NA-HHs. Notably, access to credit is much more limited for many PLHIV, encouraging them to turn to usurious lenders who often charge high interest rates and they propagate a downward spiral in the economic condition of the household. 6. Impact on Children\u2019s Education The studies showed that HIV has a destructive toll on the human capital accumulation of HIV-HHs through reduced educational opportunities and outcomes. Children in HIV-HHs in China, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam were less likely to attend school than those in NA-HHs, and the most vulnerable, poor children living in HIV-HHs in China and India were much less likely to attend school than those in NA-HHs (71% in the poorest Chinese HIV-HHs compared to 100% in the wealthiest NA-HHs). Additionally, the negative impact of HIV on female household members, as discussed earlier, is much higher than that of males. Girls in HIV-HHs in China, India and Indonesia were substantially less likely to attend school than those in NA-HHs or boys in any household. In China, the difference ranged from 86% attendance for girls in HIV-HHs to 99% for girls in NA-HHs. In addition, children in HIV-HHs in China, India and Indonesia were more likely to have dropped out of school, and again, girls were more likely than boys to have dropped out. Executive Summary 3 However, HIV-HHs in Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam were more likely to have received education assistance than NA-HHs, pointing to the positive steps that government policies have taken to mitigate the effects of HIV on households. In contrast, children in HIV-HHs faced significant stigma and discrimination, a possible contributor to the negative education results observed, and one that cannot be overcome by financial assistance alone. 7. Impact on Health The increased demand for healthcare that results from a diagnosis of HIV has a dual effect. First, the absence from the workplace has an important effect on the household\u2019s financial standing. Secondly, the increased cost of medical care which the household faces forces households to adjust consumption and savings levels, further exacerbating the impact on income and living conditions. Access to free ART and healthcare services clearly mitigates the high health care cost traditionally associated with HIV and can even lead to decreasing levels of expenditure, reductions in dis-saving, thereby constituting a basic pillar of any financial protection strategy targeted to PLHIV. Overall the percentage of health expenditures allocated to HIV-related costs varied. Data were available for China (35% of health expenditures) and Viet Nam (26%). The effect of HIV on increased utilization of health services is clear. The studies showed that substantially more PLHIV in Cambodia, China and Indonesia reported an outpatient visit than NA-HH members, and PLHIV in Cambodia and Indonesia were also more likely to have incurred an inpatient hospital visit. The lack of free medical care is an important barrier that leads households to forego necessary medical care. In all countries, members of all households were likely to have not sought medical care when they reported being sick, but PLHIV in China and Indonesia were more likely to have not sought medical care than NA-HH members when sick due to financial reasons. With regard to spending patterns, HIV-HHs in China, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam allocated substantially more of household consumption to health care than NA-HHs. Additionally, the poorest HIV-HHs in China, India and Viet Nam allocated the greatest share of household expenditures to health. However, in Cambodia, the reverse was true, and NA-HHs actually reported spending more on health than HIV-HHs, possibly due to the free and nearly universal coverage of ART coverage in Cambodia, a striking pointer to the benefits of universal access to treatment. Analysis of the specific aspects of health for PLHIV showed that ART coverage levels ranged from 94% in Cambodia to 21% in Indonesia2.

In the countries that asked about intimate partner transmission (Cambodia and Indonesia), female PLHIV were more likely to report heterosexual transmission through their intimate partner than male PLHIV. 2 Based on WHO 2010 guidelines. WHO (2010). Towards universal access: scaling up priority HIV/AIDS interventions in the health sector: Progress Report 2010. Geneva. 8. Impact on Food Security In light of increasing world-wide food prices over the time of the surveys, the relationship between HIV and food expenditures has gained increasing importance. The results show that HIV substantially affected food expenditures in Viet Nam and the poorest households in India. Members of HIV-HHs in Cambodia and Viet Nam were more likely to have experienced hunger than members of NA-HHs. Additionally, in all countries there were differences in how food budgets were spent, as HIV-HHs spent less on protein-rich foods than NA-HHs, indicating that even when quantities were considered sufficient, achieving adequate nutrition was potentially still an issue. Finally, food support for HIV- HHs varied across the region, but HIV-HHs in Cambodia and Viet Nam were more likely to have received food support than NA-HHs, again indicating well-targeted government policies. 9. Stigma, Discrimination and Quality of Life HIV can have a traumatic impact on an individual\u2019s sense of self-worth, personal security and social standing within the household and community. Emotional, mental and sometimes physical manifestations of stigma and discrimination are not only personally damaging but are often correlated with other medical co-morbidities and can further reduce an individual\u2019s capacity to engage in productive economic activities. Internal stigma, stigma and discrimination can also reduce the likelihood of an individual accessing HIV testing, seeking treatment, or sharing their diagnosis and taking action to protect others. The studies reported high levels of internal stigma (shame, low self-esteem, and suicidal thoughts) by PLHIV. In addition, regional differences were seen in PLHIV who immediately reported their diagnosis to their spouse; however, in most countries males were less likely to have done so than female PLHIV (the opposite was true in Indonesia). There were also differences in spousal reactions to the disclosure, but all countries showed improved support over time. NA-HHs in India and China reported very high levels of bias against PLHIV and their families. In conjunction, PLHIV reported very high levels of stigma and discrimination. Over 50% of PLHIV in China and India reported social isolation and neglect - an average of 20% of PLHIV in all the countries reported being verbally abused because of their status. Perhaps most concerning was the high level of discrimination in health facilities in Indonesia (30%), Viet Nam (17%) and China (13%). This reduces the likelihood of PLHIV disclosing their status and receiving the care they need, as evidenced by the high percentage (over 40%) of pregnant HIV- positive women in Indonesia who had not disclosed their status to their health care provider. 10. Impact on Family Structures, Women and Girls, and Intimate Partner Transmission In the three analysed countries where data was available, Cambodia, China and Indonesia, HIV-HHs were less likely to have a nuclear family structure than NA-HHs. While this may reflect the high percentage of widowers in the survey population, it clearly points to the impact on the economic earning potential of the households in the studies. Pregnant HIV-positive women are a particularly vulnerable group. In Viet Nam, 9% of women in HIV-HHs indicated they had been forced or persuaded to have an abortion, compared to 6% of 4 women in NA-HHs. In Indonesia only 42% reported being on ART at some point during their pregnancy or delivery. There is an urgent need for greater information, education and empowerment activities regarding the sexual and reproductive health rights of HIV positive women. Another particularly vulnerable group, widows, was analysed with regard to their property inheritance rights. In Cambodia, it was found that widows in HIV-HHs were less likely to have inherited their deceased husband\u2019s property or assets than widows in NA-HHs. In Indonesia and Viet Nam, high levels of loss of inheritance rights were reported (71% in Indonesia and 62% in Viet Nam). These results point to the need to ensure the portability of assets and other rights, irrespective of HIV status. 11.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f636e0e-3c82-431b-adde-9289358f8ee1": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f636e0e-3c82-431b-adde-9289358f8ee1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "275508e57738c9b34a5948699420bcb6c7543c94e54b99afcf1b748229185a2b"}, "2": {"node_id": "1dc7fff4-5df0-4e77-ae4a-8a09cd431523", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "897b5e1f0cfdeec2a2b022a79a1cabb3940ab5f0f74cad3ada439e06e68f84a8"}}, "hash": "ce2c33a558265633c18f5a8aa99e83fecdd696090f894652686795324ddcd729", "text": "11.

In addition, the poorest HIV-HHs were most likely to have received such support, again indicating good targeting by support providers. The data in Cambodia, China and Viet Nam also allowed for analysis of the financial support as a percentage of total household income. In Cambodia and Viet Nam, the support had a moderate impact (8% of total income), but it was critical in China, accounting for 18% of household income. 12. Knowledge and Awareness of HIV Increasing individuals\u2019 knowledge and awareness of HIV is critical in both reducing transmission and eliminating stigma and discrimination against those it affects. However, NA-HH respondents in China and Indonesia reported worryingly low knowledge levels of HIV (only 70% of those in China had heard of HIV and 72% in Indonesia). In addition, of those who had heard of HIV, knowledge of where they could go for a test was limited (62% in Cambodia, 40% in China and 44% in India). With regard to HIV prevention methods, there was fairly widespread knowledge of condoms as a form of prevention (above 80% in Cambodia and Indonesia, though only 58% in India). However, females in all countries were less likely than males to cite condom usage as a form of protection against HIV. 13. Conclusions and Policy Recommendations The findings of these multi-country studies point to the need for urgent policy action. They demonstrate that as the HIV epidemic matures, it has significant and lasting impact on the ability of households to cope with the loss of family members; the loss of income and assets; HIV-related morbidity and mortality; and the loss of educational opportunities, particularly for girls who are pulled out of school to care for sick and dying family members and social exclusion that prevents them from taking part in the socio- economic growth of the country. Moreover, the study points to the fact that even concentrated epidemics have wide ranging impacts on PLHIV and their households, effectively multiplying the socioeconomic effect as it erodes the fabric of HIV households. An important part of the negative effects on income and assets can be mitigated by ensuring access to free ART and medical services for HIV affected households. This is underscored by the clear impact of the expansion of ART in Cambodia and the resulting reduction in health spending and dis-saving compared to the other countries of the study. Equally, this study points to the positive impact that targeted interventions, such as food support, government medical insurance and welfare programs can have on the health, nutrition, well-being and quality of life of HIV-affected households. Most importantly, they provide further empirical evidence of the effects of HIV on the household that can be used to better prioritize interventions in the region. The studies in all five countries were taken at different times of economic growth and prosperity, spanning from the economic growth of 2004 to the downturn at the end of the decade. Nonetheless, they show that HIV-affected households are disproportionately affected, even in good times, and their extremely vulnerable state underscores the need for concerted action to mitigate HIV\u2019s impact. As the effects of the global economic crisis continue to unfold, HIV-affected households have little cushion on which to rely and, in many cases, limited social security or protection. The studies show that in a large number of cases, the affected families resort to irreversible coping mechanisms. They are thus among the most vulnerable and need to be prioritized for social protection. While there is some attention to social protection programmes for PLHIV since these studies were completed, continued evolution of those programmes is required to support the people, households and communities that are hardest hit. The studies also point to the deleterious effect of HIV on the reduction of human capital not only due to death and morbidity of PLHIV but also due to reduced investment in the education of children. The policy conclusions of the report may be contextualized within three key policy dimensions. The dimensions reflect: (1) the scope or range of services provided; (2) the depth or level of interventions to address structural issues related to poverty, decline in human capital accumulation, and issues associated with knowledge, behaviour, stigma and discrimination; and (3) the breadth, or population coverage, of various interventions. The study demonstrates the significance of the household as an institution and hence the impact mitigation interventions should be targeted at them. Scope of Services: The need to explore changes in the scope of services provided to PLHIV and their families is highlighted in this section.

Key policy recommendations include: 1. Strategically integrate HIV into appropriate social protection schemes, making them \u201cHIV-sensitive\u201d, to protect affected households from irreversible coping mechanisms \u2013 of particular relevance are cash transfers, access to credit and health and micro-insurance. 2. Ensure PLHIV and their households have access to an increased continuum of care and related services - beyond ART - to further reduce the catastrophic financial burden of HIV-related medical expenditure. 3. Increase the range of services provided by PLHIV-staffed (volunteers and paid) services, which can have greater Executive Summary 5 acceptance and effectiveness than non-PLHIV provided services. 4. Increase efforts to target interventions to improve areas with low coverage or effectiveness, such as breast feeding for HIV positive women. 5. Increase the use of health technologies and social media to better increase knowledge and awareness of HIV and HIV prevention measures, as well as reduce stigma and discrimination in the general population. 6. Strengthen legal environment for an enabling environment that is rights and gender sensitive so that vulnerable and marginalised populations have access to services. 7. Designate HIV-HHs as a priority group in public employment and housing support. Quality and Depth of Services: While it is clear that HIV-affected households are receiving beneficial support from government and NGO programs in the region, the study results may be used to look at levels and quality of support and whether they should be increased to cover households\u2019 broader needs. For example, despite the increased provision of food support to HIV-HHs in Cambodia and Viet Nam, their members were still more likely to have been hungry than members of NA-HH. Furthermore, because of HIV\u2019s impact on family structure (HIV-HHs were significantly more likely to be headed by a widow), the \u201cdepth\u201d of service should be carefully estimated to reflect specific household needs. The main recommendations in this area include: 1. Improve food support to the poorest HIV-affected households and ensure that the level of support is sufficient to offset the potential reductions in consumption and changes in the caloric intake of the household. 2. Strengthen mental health and psychosocial support services for PLHIV and their family members. 3. Develop targeted interventions to address the negative self- esteem experienced by PLHIV and their family members. 4. Implement targeted interventions in institutions, mainly in health facilities and work places, to reduce stigma and discrimination against PLHIV. 5. Strengthen legal empowerment measures for women living with, and affected by, HIV. 6. Prioritize efforts to keep children from HIV-affected households in school, especially girls, by targeting them in programmes such as conditional cash transfer and food for school. 7. Develop an HIV vulnerability index to improve targeting, particularly for key populations3 at higher risk of HIV exposure, and unify benefits available to HIV-affected households. Breadth (Coverage) of Services: The following recommendations concerning service coverage are particularly important to reinforce the pursuit of significant reductions in HIV incidence and ensuring basic rights of all men, women and children, including the poorest and most vulnerable populations. 1. Build flexibility and quality into VCCT services and create demand for early testing as a cornerstone of efforts to reduce the incidence of HIV, especially among key populations, hard- to-reach and vulnerable populations. 2. Continue efforts to expand universal access to quality ART coverage and support services so that PLHIV can remain productive members of the household economy and to offset the potential catastrophic impact of increased health spending. 3. Carry out further in-depth studies that track the conditions of PLHIV and their households over time, to improve targeting and enhance measurement of results over time. 3 Key populations = \u201ckey populations at higher risk of HIV exposure\u201d (UNAIDS, 2011) 7 Introduction 1.1 Background It is widely acknowledged that HIV severely impacts the economic and social spheres of all societies.

Improved understanding of the epidemic \u2013 specifically regarding the dynamic and magnitude of how HIV affects individuals and households \u2013 will support the development of targeted, evidence- informed impact mitigation policies and programs. Over the last six years, independent studies, commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with national institutions, were conducted in five countries within the region: Cambodia (2010), China (2009), India (2006), Indonesia (2010) and Viet Nam (2009). The studies all involved surveys of HIV- affected households (HIV-HHs) and non-affected households (NA- HHs) that examined a variety of socio-economic issues: income, employment, revenues, expenditures, coping mechanisms, health, education, food security, family composition, impact on women and girls, and stigma and discrimination. While the survey instruments used in the various studies were adapted to meet the specific needs and circumstances of each country, they followed a broad common methodology that allowed for inter- country comparisons. Using the data provided by those studies, this report seeks to analyse the socio-economic impact of HIV at the household level in Asia and offers policy recommendations for impact mitigation. Globally, the impact of HIV on poverty \u2013 at the individual, household and national levels \u2013 is clear. Findings from various studies in the region (UNDP, 2006; UNDP, 2009; UNDP, 2009b; UNDP, 2009c; United Nations 2010) suggest that HIV is a financial drain on households and that the disease disproportionately affects already-impoverished households. Poor families have less capacity to handle the effects of HIV because they lack savings and other assets to cushion the impact of illness and death. Healthcare expenses, costs associated with funerals, migration, 4 It includes free ARV drugs, free prevention of parent-to-child transmission, free voluntary counselling and testing, free education for children orphaned by AIDS, and provision of care to people living with HIV. unemployment and loss of income from reduced productivity, can lead families to sell their productive assets, take on debt, deprive children of educational opportunities to supplement household income and caregiving burden, and reduce household expenditures on food and other critical areas. Additionally, WHO estimates of antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage varies widely between countries (Cambodia has a coverage rate of 94%, China between 19% and 38%, India between 23% and 28%, Indonesia 21%, and Viet Nam 34%5), which offers valuable lessons to be shared regarding the evolution of policy priorities as the disease profile shifts to more closely resemble a chronic disease with a different pattern of costs at the country level. The figure below highlights the various impacts analysed in the socio-economic impact studies commissioned by UNDP. This report aims to clarify how each of these dimensions impacts both people living with HIV (PLHIV) and HIV-affected households in Asia. This will in turn provide national and international policy- makers with better information to formulate programmes that will effectively and efficiently support those affected by HIV.

Chapter Summary The report is an analysis of five socio-economic impact studies in Asia: Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam; The report systematically addresses information gaps regarding the socio-economic impacts of HIV at household and individual levels in the region; While all countries have made progress in addressing the epidemic, in Cambodia, China, India and Viet Nam, the HIV epidemic is concentrated and prevalances have either remained steady or decreased in recent years; however, in Indonesia, prevalence has increased, and certain parts of the country are experiencing a generalized epidemic. The report examines the impacts of HIV on living conditions, employment and income; coping mechanisms such as debt, asset liquidation and migration; educational impacts; health utilisation and expenditures; knowledge and awareness regarding HIV; food security; stigma and discrimination; women and girls; safety nets and policy recommendations. 8 The policies to mitigate the impact of HIV on households in Asia should be developed within the context of the improving economic situation of many countries in the region, while taking into account social and economic inequalities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b34e1c8-948a-4825-a5ca-5437aa092ae1": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b34e1c8-948a-4825-a5ca-5437aa092ae1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7db0ba4dd9ce8b444d9c4abd690984ec0d4a1e040aed87d4bc52560a917065d9"}, "2": {"node_id": "27500f08-3bd6-47ae-bf13-f8784ca5f41a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b25cd8f309241b00757dc4488a18ee23cb6038218d913c44f2888f5c120e00cb"}}, "hash": "f3938e09682a779029d5d249de77341bb8a66c1e9565c30ef45d327b3995fb58", "text": "Despite economic improvement, 30.1% of people in Cambodia (2007), 2.8% in China (2004), 28.6% in India (2000), 16.7% in Indonesia (2004), and 28.9% in Viet Nam (2002), still live below their national poverty lines (World Bank, 2011).

In the same year, 1.8 million people died from the disease - almost 260,000 of them were children, and HIV was identified as the leading cause of death and disease among women 15-49 years of age (UNAIDS, 2010)6. Regionally, Asia accounted for the second highest number of world-wide AIDS-related deaths (300,000), the second highest number of new infections (360,000) and the second highest number of PLHIV (4.9 million) (UNAIDS, 2010b). In Asia alone, HIV will cause an estimated total loss of 180 million years of healthy and productive life between 2002 and 2020, more than any other disease (Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008). 6 Sub-Saharan Africa is the highest in all three counts. For the most part, the countries featured in this report have concentrated HIV epidemics, with adult prevalence below 1% in the general population, but significantly higher HIV prevalence among key populations such as people who inject drugs (PHID), female sex workers (FSWs), and men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people (TG). In four of the five countries featured in this report, HIV prevalence has declined or remained steady over the last five years. However, Indonesia has seen a rapid increase in prevalence. Additionally, there are often large inter-regional differences in HIV prevalence within countries \u2013 for example, in China, over half the country\u2019s PLHIV reside within just five of the 22 provinces (UNAIDS, 2010b), and in India, 60% of PLHIV live in six of its 28 states (NACO, 2010). Early diagnosis, assisted by voluntary confidential counselling and testing (VCCT) centres, is important for preventing transmission and reducing morbidity and mortality for PLHIV. Throughout the region, the number of HIV-testing facilities has increased in recent years, (the number of facilities per 100,000 adults in East, South and South East Asia increased from 0.9 in 2008 to 1.2 in 2009) but is still well below the global average of 5.5 for low and middle-income countries (WHO, 2010). At the same time, the median number of HIV tests per 1,000 adults increased from 9.2 to 13, but this is again below the global median for low and middle-income countries of 50 per 1,000 adults.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cef6288c-5b03-4c63-ba93-bf21a8140f41": {"__data__": {"id_": "cef6288c-5b03-4c63-ba93-bf21a8140f41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e09a579dc4b39eabb58cfb7984fc9a37a9c2beb7de2531a17f5ec846ceb0077"}, "2": {"node_id": "04ea76f0-2fd6-48aa-a9b7-2c340a3abbf8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80aaa854deae16429c91496b2f5aacda411e8ef29aacbd18619a96ec462b5c5c"}}, "hash": "862b13a14343b7fd2d6e8e9ae7f868cb73d5ccdb59e88b930ae7ab758f8c0e50", "text": "Additionally, the percentage of pregnant women who received an HIV test in East, South and South East Asia increased from 2% in 2005 to 17% in 2009, but is still much lower than the 26% 2009 global average for low and middle- income countries, and substantially lower than the 80% target for 2010, adopted by the Heads of State and Representatives of Governments in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS at the UNGASS on HIV/AIDS in 2001 (WHO, 2010; UNGASS 2001). The impact of ART on reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality is well known. Reduced morbidity and mortality, in turn, leads to more economically productive PLHIV and HIV-affected household members.

As such, universal coverage of ART is a cornerstone of any robust effort to reduce the negative socio-economic impacts of HIV. However, in 2009, of the almost two million adult PLHIV (over age 15) in East, South and South-East Asia estimated to be in need of ART, fewer than 500,000 (24%) were receiving treatment, compared to 37% of those in need on treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, 2010). Additionally, the percentage of women receiving ART to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV increased from 9% in 2005 to 32% in 2009 but still significantly lower than the global average of 53% for low and middle-income countries. ART coverage, VCCT centres, and support services for PLHIV all require substantial financial and political commitment from governments. UNAIDS has attempted to measure the degree of investment priority that governments have given to support their national AIDS responses through the \u201cDomestic Investment Priority Index\u201d (DIPI) (UNAIDS, 2010). The index is calculated by dividing the percentage of government revenue directed to the AIDS response by the country\u2019s HIV prevalence: Public expenditure on AIDS response Government revenue DIPI = \u00d7 National population PLHIV 9 A higher DIPI figure usually means a higher assigned priority, with the global mean value of 0.35. A comparison of their DIPI and other basic indicators for the included countries is shown below in Table 2. The size of the countries varies from the two largest in the world - China and India - with over a billion people each, to Cambodia with fewer than 15 million people. The least populated of the countries is also the poorest - Cambodia is considered a low-income country by the World Bank - while the others are considered lower middle-income countries. The HIV prevalances, low overall, range from a high of 0.5% in Cambodia to a low of 0.1% in China. However, due to China and India\u2019s large populations, the estimated number of PLHIV is still very high in those countries \u2013 almost 2.5 million in India and 750,000 in China. As discussed earlier, the ART coverage rates in the countries, also varies significantly, from the high of 94% in Cambodia to a low of 21% in Indonesia, using the WHO 2010 guidelines. Finally, the level of VCCT centres throughout the countries ranges from a high of 2.9 per 100,000 population in Cambodia to a low of 0.2 in Viet Nam.

In general, demographically the studies had fairly similar overall populations, although there were some differences. Household size varied by country and HIV status from the smallest with an average size of 3.4 members in NA-HHs of Indonesia to the largest of 4.6 members in Cambodia. Households also varied by their urban and rural locations. There were similar ratios of the sexes found throughout the household members, but varied for PLHIV. Table 3 summarizes the number of households and household members included in each study, as well as the year the study was conducted. Detailed tables of sample profiles by country are available in Annex II. 2.2 Data Analysis The analyses presented in this report followed two main methodologies: (1) Utilisation of data from published reports on China and India; (2) New analysis of databases from Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam. New analyses were not conducted for the China and India studies due to confidentiality considerations restricting access to the databases. Instead, regionally comparable statistics were gathered from the published country reports. For the three countries where new analyses were conducted, the original databases were recoded, cleaned and new categorical variables created to increase comparability between the countries.

The studies examined household conditions for key socio-economic issues: income, employment, revenues, expenditures, coping mechanisms, health, education, food security, family composition, impact on women and girls and stigma and discrimination; This study included the following main dimensions of analysis: Country; HIV-affected versus non-affected households; PLHIV versus non-PLHIV; men (and boys) versus women (and girls); urban versus rural household location; and quintile of consumption (poorest versus richest); New data analyses were conducted on the survey databases from Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam; Secondary data analyses were conducted for China and India, using previously published reports;

boys and girls; males and females; PLHIV before diagnosis and after diagnosis. 2.4 Limitations The key limitations are as follows: (i) Primary databases from China and India were not accessible for confidentiality reasons, limiting the possibility to include dimensions of analysis that were possible in the other three countries. (ii) Because of the local adaptation of the methodology and questionnaire, there are some limitations on the availability of comparable indicators across all countries. (iii) Non-probability sampling in Viet Nam, India, Indonesia, and China data collection does not allow for statistical inferences on population parameters or other estimates. In addition, since this Asia Regional Analysis depends on the individual country studies and data, the limitations of the individuals studies, outlined in Annex II, contribute to the limitations of the study.

This provides a guideline for the comparability and interpretation of results with regard to HIV-affected and non- affected households throughout the region. Unfortunately, basic demographic information on households, head of households (HoH) and PLHIV was not available for all the countries. However, available data highlight some differences and similarities between countries, and, regionally, between HIV-HHs and NA-HHs. Figure 2 shows that, in the four countries for which data could be analysed, there were only small differences in the average household size (no data was available for China). Overall Cambodia had larger households than the other countries while Indonesia had the smallest reported household sizes.

Cambodia and Viet Nam both had a higher percentage of HIV-affected households located in urban areas (63% and 64%, respectively), when compared with non-affected households (46% and 37%, respectively) The Indonesia study, however, focused almost exclusively on urban households. In India, the majority of households were in urban locations, with little difference seen between HIV-HHs and NA- HHs. According to the methodology of the China report, the majority of the households surveyed (HIV-HHs and NA-HHs) were in rural areas.

In India, HIV-HH HoHs were more likely to be illiterate than those in NA-HHs (28% versus 20%). In Cambodia, China and Viet Nam, HoHs in HIV-HHs were less likely to have completed secondary or tertiary education than HoHs in the NA-HHs (which may be partially explained by the differences in sex and age of the HoHs).

Indonesia had substantially more males than females (70% versus 30%), compared to Cambodia, which had only 29% male PLHIV and 71% female PLHIV. While this may be mostly attributable to the differences in sample populations and survey methods, the differences are an important consideration when considering the results and the design of impact mitigation strategies. For example the higher proportion of IDU in Indonesia might point to the differences in the specific MARP sampled rather than the overall perspective of the epidemic nationally.

However, it should be noted that in Cambodia (with its largely female cohort of PLHIV), 34% of respondents indicated they were widowed, compared to 18% in India, 14% in Viet Nam, 10% in China and 9% in Indonesia.

Chapter Summary NA-HHs in Cambodia, China, India and Viet Nam were more likely to live in physically stable household structures than HIV-HHs; Male members of HIV-HHs in Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Viet Nam were 8%, 12%, 9% and 10% less likely to be employed than those in NA-HHs; PLHIV in Cambodia and Indonesia were almost twice as likely to be unemployed as NA-HH members; Employment levels of PLHIV in Cambodia, China, India and Viet Nam dropped by an average absolute difference of 9% after their diagnosis; A quarter (25%) of PLHIV in Cambodia, India and Indonesia had a care-giver, and many of them either left their job or experienced reduced income as a result of their care-giving duties; In all countries with data, HIV-positive status resulted in more lost work days than for NA-HH members, ranging from 54 more (Indonesia) to 16 more (Cambodia); In all countries with data, caregivers for PLHIV also lost more work days than NA-HH members, ranging from a high of 18 more (Viet Nam) to a low of 7 more (Cambodia); In all countries, child labour levels were higher in HIV-HHs than NA-HHs, especially for girls; On average, in Cambodia, China, India and Viet Nam, HIV-HHs had lower total annual household incomes than NA-HHs: the loss of household income varied between $1,119 in Viet Nam to $52 in India; In China, India and Indonesia, HIV-HHs were 68%, 29% and 38% more likely to be below the poverty line than NA-HHs.

Figure 13 and Figure 14 display data on the basic amenities of the households across the surveyed countries. In all countries, HIV-HHs are more likely to live in a less structurally stable house than the NA-HHs, though the difference is only minimal in Indonesia, possibly due to the predominantly urban population surveyed. Only small differences are seen in households having a toilet, but in Cambodia, HIV-HHs were more likely to report having a toilet, while in Indonesia, NA-HHs were more likely to report having a toilet.

The impact on the labour market is channelled through an increase in the overall level of unemployment for HIV-affected households as well as increased absenteeism and decreased productivity. Figure 15 and Figure 16 show the differences in employment levels for males and females in the different countries, stratified by the HIV status of both the household and the household members10. In China, Indonesia, and Viet Nam, male PLHIV and non-PLHIV in HIV-HHs both had lower participation in the workforce than those in NA-HHs. In Cambodia, male PLHIV and males in NA-HHs had the same employment levels, but male non-PLHIV in HIV-HHs had lower employment levels. Interestingly, the non-PLHIV males in Indonesia also had the lowest employment levels, and those in India had significantly lower levels than the male PLHIV, possibly due to the general older age of the non-PLHIV than the PLHIV.

Additionally, in Cambodia, and Indonesia, female PLHIV and non- PLHIV in HIV-HHs had higher employment levels than females in NA-HHs, again likely due to the increased need for additional financing caused by HIV. The different results seen across the countries in the region may also be partly due to differences in urban / rural strata within the studies, as well as differences in the male to female ratios of PLHIV, HoHs and household members. For example, in Cambodia, there were many widowed female heads of HIV-HHs. These women were therefore more likely to be responsible for procuring the household finances than females in NA-HHs. Clearly, HIV has a large impact on the roles and employment opportunities of different household members across the region.

Across all countries other than India, unemployment levels are substantially higher for PLHIV than non-PLHIV. The most extreme differences are seen in Viet Nam, where over six times as many PLHIV were unemployed than members of NA-HHs. Figure 18 shows the unemployment levels, by sex, for PLHIV, non-PLHIV members of HIV-HHs and members of NA-HHs. It highlights the additional impacts of HIV on employment as non-PLHIV members of HIV-HHs, especially males, had higher unemployment rates than members of NA-HHs. While in Cambodia male and female PLHIV have similar unemployment levels, females in Indonesia and Viet Nam were less likely to be unemployed, pointing to their need to continue to work regardless of their health status. Female non- PLHIV members of HIV-HHs in Indonesia and Viet Nam also have much lower unemployment levels, possibly partially due to the need for caregiving by household members, as discussed in the following section.

In both Cambodia and India, there was a bigger drop in employment for males than females (Cambodia: 12% absolute difference decrease for males and 7% absolute difference decrease drop for females; India: 10% absolute difference decrease for males and 4% absolute difference decrease for females), while in Viet Nam the reverse was true (9% absolute difference decrease for females, 5% absolute difference decrease for males).11 11 India: Different age range than for WFPR. Figure 21 shows the main reasons given by unemployed PLHIV to explain their lack of employment. For both Viet Nam and Cambodia, the number one response was health-related, indicating the strong impact that HIV can have on an individual\u2019s ability to perform work functions. The data in Section 9.2 describe the stigma and discrimination that PLHIV face in the workplace, and provides more information on what may constitute the \u201cother\u201d reasons cited here.

This may be partially explained by the data in Figure 22 that shows the impact of caregiving on HIV-HHs. For Cambodia, India and Indonesia, almost a quarter of all PLHIV had a caregiver providing them with assistance. In both Cambodia and India, the impact of that assistance can be seen in the percentage of household members who had to leave their job (18% in Cambodia), or take a reduction in hours and/or pay in order to perform their caregiving activities (39% in Cambodia, 28% in India).

China did not report days lost due to HIV, but the study did analyse the amount of time that HIV-HH members were able to spend working, in comparison to NA-HH members. It was shown that PLHIV worked substantially less hours per day than non-PLHIV living within HIV-HHs, and that they, in turn, worked less hours per day than members of NA-HHs. Both the reduction in hours worked per day, and the reduction in days worked per year, will contribute to a substantial reduction in income for HIV-HHs.

The effect appears particularly acute for girls in HIV-affected households. In Cambodia, girls are nearly twice as likely to be working in an HIV- affected household, pointing to the negative effects on human capital accumulation, as girls are withdrawn from school to support the household. Nonetheless, the impact is not limited to girls; in Vietnam and India the effect on boys is more than double, when comparing HIV-HHs and NA-HHs. Figure 24 shows the impacts of HIV on child labour. It should be noted that the data for Cambodia was restricted to the age range of 10-14 only, while for other countries a larger age range (including younger children) was included, likely explaining the higher rates in Cambodia. For all countries where quantifiable data was available, children in HIV- HHs were more likely to have entered the workforce than children in non-affected households. In both Cambodia and China, the impact on girls was substantially greater than that for boys (for whom the impact was either small or non-existent). In Viet Nam, while little difference was seen for girls, a much larger percentage of boys in HIV-HHs had entered the workforce than boys in NA- HHs. India did not have data on children in NA-HHs by sex, but clearly, the employment rates for both boys and girls was between two to three times higher in HIV-HHs.

Indonesia: Only three child workers were found during the Indonesia survey. All three children were in DKI Jakarta. Two of the three children (one boy and one girl) were living in a HIV-HH. The other child was in a NA-HH. 24 4.3 Income: Overall HIV has a clear effect on household income, and lowered the average annual household income by an average of 22% across the five countries. The greatest absolute dollar value reduction was in Viet Nam ($1,119) and the least impact in Indonesia, where HIV-HHs actually had higher average household incomes than NA-HHs ($445 on average). While the previous section highlighted how the economic security of HIV-HHs differs from than that of NA-HHs across the region, this section\u2019s analysis of average household income highlights some of the mechanisms through which those differences occur. Figure 25 shows the differences in average household incomes for HIV-HHs and NA-HHs across the countries. Some of these differences may be partially due to differences in household size (i.e., in Indonesia, HIV-HHs were larger, on average, than NA- HHs, while in Cambodia, the reverse was true), but due to data availability, overall average household incomes are the only figures available for comparison. HIV is positively associated with an increase in poverty levels. In all of the countries for which data were available, HIV-HHs were, on average, 45% more likely to be below the poverty line than NA-HHs, as shown in Figure 26, ranging from a low of 29% more likely in India to a high of 68% more likely in China. The largest absolute difference was seen in China, where 19% of HIV-HHs were reported to be below the poverty line, compared to 12% of NA-HHs. In India, 22% of HIV-HHs were below the poverty line, compared to 17% of NA-HHs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e14022b-29b9-4842-81dd-9a7a9eb074a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e14022b-29b9-4842-81dd-9a7a9eb074a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3f525a09113533b1edadaf52e8d725ba9c11ed29545af126b632f4b60585105"}, "2": {"node_id": "3de9b6c6-73af-4ce7-82b3-099c2131b173", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "716d4db4ee7e36148ab7c1a6f79b7da5bb5639a2b627769369cb08c387ea640d"}}, "hash": "41e44af6aa350927b655f79e57ecff1a86d24d2e32be6e76a4949fefa7815d68", "text": "In Indonesia, a smaller impact was seen, with 9% of HIV-HHs and 7% of NA-HHs indicating they were below the poverty line.

One of the critical components of economic security is ownership of the household\u2019s dwelling. Figure 27 shows that, across all five countries, differences were reported between HIV-affected and non-affected households with regards to home-ownership. In every country, HIV-HHs were less likely to own their house, an indicator of the underlying impacts of HIV on reduced asset accumulation and forced sale of assets. The most extreme differences were seen in Cambodia (77% of non-affected households owned their homes versus 58% of affected households), China (87% versus 69%) and India (73% versus 54%).

HIV-HHs in all countries were less likely to own their house than NA-HHs; HIV-HHs were less likely to own assets than NA-HHs; HIV-HHs and PLHIV in Cambodia and Viet Nam were more likely to have migrated than NA-HHs and there were high levels of HIV- HH migration in Indonesia; Discrimination and the pursuit of medical care services were important issues related to migration in many countries; An average of 12% of HIV-HHs reported a loss of savings due to HIV, with the highest levels reported in Indonesia; HIV-HHs in Cambodia, India, and Viet Nam were 1.5 times more likely to be in debt than NA-HHs; HIV-HHs in India, Indonesia and Viet Nam spent three to four times as much on health care as NA-HHs; HIV-HHs in Cambodia spent less on health care than NA-HHs underlining the importance of free, universal ART and access to support services including free healthcare.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6f40f1c-3d36-412b-9b98-854fd66f2b4c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6f40f1c-3d36-412b-9b98-854fd66f2b4c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "349dcb374db6740bed61e4b596f6df9fbe0d4b6cd2e62875efe93efae6847d81"}, "2": {"node_id": "1456f9f2-a5ab-4131-8d04-9f73b97ef158", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7cb77f4e5fa62fcafc405f191322baadb378a7ffb99a1b2e8433a0b494aa705e"}}, "hash": "23568637bf52beda783f52afbaeca5e99e003fd3fc0a52123051025cb12c6633", "text": "27 Coping Mechanisms: Asset Liquidation, Migration, Debt, Consumption, and Loss of Savings FIGuRE 28 Household Asset Ownership (cont\u2019d) 39% 46% 15% 54% 62% 21% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% Cambodia China India % HHs own a Motorbike/Scooter HIV-HH NA-HH 61% 42% 44% 46% 61% 50% 52% 46% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% Cambodia China India Viet Nam % HHs own a Bicycle HIV-HH NA-HH Cambodia: Differences between HIV-HHs and NA-HHs remained across rural and urban stratifications.

In Indonesia, nearly 50% of all HIV households report a loss of savings, compared to a low of 6% in Vietnam. When combined with the loss of tangible assets, the further reduction of income due to reduced earnings, and additional expenditures due to HIV, HIV clearly erodes the financial protection of the household. Figure 32 shows the percentage of HIV-HHs that indicated they lost savings or investments due to the impact of HIV. Additionally, in Cambodia, China and Viet Nam, the percentage of households reducing their savings as a coping mechanisms increased with the overall income of the household, as the higher income households were more likely to have savings to draw upon (data not shown).

Figure 33 shows the impact of HIV on household debt across the countries. In Cambodia, India and Viet Nam, HIV-HHs were, on average, 52% more likely to have reported being in debt than NA-HHs. However, in China, where the vast majority of loans come from friends or family, NA-HHs were 10% more likely to have a loan than HIV-HHs, which may be due to HIV-HHs being unable to obtain necessary financing from financial institutions. The highest level of debt associated with HIV is found in India where HIV-HHs were 67% more likely to report being in debt than NA-HHs. This may be linked to the reduced income-earning potential of HIV-HHs and, correspondingly, to their reduced capacity to repay loans and others\u2019 reluctance to provide them (UNDP, 2009a).

In India, household expenditure was higher among HIV-affected than non-affected households, due to increased health expenditures (over three times higher in HIV-HHs). In Indonesia, HIV-HHs reported higher expenditure figures, and again had higher health expenditures (over three times higher). Interestingly, in Cambodia, perhaps due to its near-universal ART coverage, health expenditures were actually reported to be less for HIV-HHs than for NA-HHs. 29 Coping Mechanisms: Asset Liquidation, Migration, Debt, Consumption, and Loss of Savings In those countries where an increase in health spending is evident, there is a clear \u2018crowding-out\u2019 effect, as higher healthcare spending leads to reductions in food or educational spending. This result points to the importance that food support and educational support programs can have on HIV households. Specifically with regards to food support, it highlights the magnitude of the problem to assist in the definition of the level of food support that is necessary to offset potential increases in health spending. 5.6 Other Coping Mechanisms In China and Indonesia, households were asked what other coping mechanisms they had used to deal with financial hardship. The responses to those questions are shown below in Figure 36. In China, overall more households reported being forced to use a coping mechanism (37% versus 30%), and more noted they had to sell assets or the spouse had been forced to take on work. In Indonesia, only HIV-HHs were asked this question, and more than a quarter (25%) of those households indicated they had been forced to liquidate assets. In India, over 43% of HIV-affected households responded affirmatively when specifically asked if they had been forced to liquidate assets or increase debt. Additional analysis of specific coping mechanisms used by households to cope with health expenses is outlined in the section on healthcare.

Additionally, while there are no definitive data on the total number of children affected by HIV12 in Asia, studies from India estimated that over eight million children (approximately two percent of children in India) are affected by HIV, and numbers from Cambodia estimated over 85,000 vulnerable children (again, approximately two percent of the under 18 population) (UNICEF, 2007; United Nations, 2010). Given that Asia is estimated to contain over 1.2 billion children, the potential impact of HIV on children in the region is staggering (ADB, 2011). Ensuring that these children\u2019s education rights, including the right to stay in school, to obtain the same quality of education as other children and the right to receive higher education, are not undermined by their illness or that of their family members is a vitally important policy goal. 6.1 Attendance Figure 37 highlights the impact of HIV on school attendance levels among children across the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c382a38-75dc-443f-8783-38be59973159": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c382a38-75dc-443f-8783-38be59973159", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d52889ed06223b78358929d4e20945d1abf53831f4dc2cb42dc768ca39a5b453"}, "2": {"node_id": "efbc7c71-d92c-4f89-b86c-e0d350156e8b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb212c02f41923cfa86f8872e3243aa614ecb65d55cc1b37f5a5bd8e3d317dd7"}}, "hash": "2f03cac7d762b1b481efee7428e6b3814d4200634c4493303a50e9a3cf7e70e6", "text": "In all countries, with the exception of Cambodia, attendance levels were reported to be lower for children in HIV-HHs than for children in NA-HHs, with the largest differences in China.

Chapter Summary Human capital accumulation is reduced in HIV affected households as evidenced by lower rates of schooling; Children in HIV-HHs in China, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam were less likely to attend school than those in NA-HHs; The poorest children in HIV-HHs in China were 28% less likely to attend school than those in NA-HHs; Girls in HIV-HHs in China, India and Indonesia were 8% less likely to attend school than girls in NA-HHs (and less likely to attend than boys in any household); Children in HIV-HHs in China, India and Indonesia were, on average, almost three times more likely to have dropped out of school, with girls most negatively impacted; HIV-HHs in Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam were more likely to have received education assistance than NA-HHs highlighting effective targeting; Children in HIV-HHs faced significant stigma and discrimination, a possible contributor to the negative education results observed. 32 Figure 39 shows how, across almost all countries, the impact of HIV on girls\u2019 attendance rates was more severe than for boys\u2019 rates. Other than in Cambodia, which showed only minor differences in the attendance rates between girls in HIV-affected and non- affected households, girls in HIV-HHs generally saw almost three times the drop in attendance rates as did boys in HIV-HHs.

Figure 41 highlights the specific vulnerabilities of girls in relation to school drop-out rates. Specifically, drop-out rates for boys were either equal or only slightly higher in HIV-HHs than NA-HHs across the region, while girls saw a much larger increase in drop-out rates. The largest disparities were in China and Indonesia, where drop- out rates for girls in HIV-affected and non-affected households were 13.8% to 0.9% and 6.1% to 1.0%, respectively.

However, in all countries, the percentage of children who were not attending school because they needed to earn an income or assist in household chores was higher in HIV-HHs than in NA-HHs. The largest difference was seen in India, where more than twice as many HIV-HHs (60%) than NA-HHs (28%) reported that their children were absent for work purposes. Additionally, in Indonesia and Viet Nam, where shame / stigma was an survey response option, none of the NA-HHs responded that was the reason, versus 7% in Indonesia and 5% in Viet Nam for HIV-HHs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8e3b8ab-b3b0-4d8c-952a-c45836aea876": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8e3b8ab-b3b0-4d8c-952a-c45836aea876", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e844417a3fe2862aead40adc9f0cfa39e227fcd87046d99a71344f87e118053c"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e917171-d57d-4e01-a5ad-c5aafd4635a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "118b45f76bbb4f2c2423b0726328e5badbafd58cdf5f2d184230bdae4918e08d"}}, "hash": "7f466cfb539090585f550237133323695029b0aa1486ffc5de65880f312c9de5", "text": "33 Impact on Education FIGuRE 42 Reasons for Child School Non-Attendance 21.3% 15.4% 13.3% 15.7% 53.3% 55.6% 45.5% 53.8% 4.4% 6.0% 13.6% 7.7% 22.3% 17.6% 60.0% 27.7% 9.0% 7.7% 6.7% 0.0% 4.5% 0.0% 10.6% 11.1% 22.1% 50.6% 40.0% 44.4% 7.7% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% HIV-HH NA-HH HIV-HH NA-HH HIV-HH NA-HH HIV-HH NA-HH Cambodia India Indonesia Viet Nam Reasons for Non-Attendance Other Stigma Child working Child sick Could not afford fee 6.4 Educational Assistance The data in Figure 43 highlight differences in educational assistance received by households in Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam. In all countries, a higher percentage of HIV-HHs reported receiving educational assistance, although differences between households, and overall levels of assistance across countries, differed. In Cambodia, over five times as many HIV-HHs (25%) as NA-HHs (4%) reported they had received educational assistance in the form of scholarships or stipends. However, these results may be subject to observational bias, as the large numbers of HIV- HHs receiving home-based care were more likely to have been informed of potential assistance than other HIV-HHs. In Indonesia, over 25% of all households with a student reported receiving some form of assistance, and slightly more HIV-HHs (28%) than NA-HHs (26%) reported receiving such assistance. In Viet Nam, lower numbers of households reported receiving educational assistance in comparison to the other countries, but again, more HIV-HHs received (7%) than NA-HHs (2%). In general, the results point to encouraging evidence that governments and NGOs are assisting HIV-HHs in mitigating the negative impacts of HIV on the education of their children.

Factors such as humiliation by their peers and ostracism within the school led to the demotivation of vulnerable children, resulting in them falling behind in their studies and dropping out of the school system. The data in Figure 44 show how the various countries reported different types of stigma and discrimination against their children. In all studies, some level of discrimination against children in HIV- HHs was reported, from a low of 2% in Cambodia to a high of 79% in China. In China, only a very small percentage of households reported that their status was actually known in the school system (10%), which is understandable as nearly four fifths of the households reported that their child had faced discrimination in the school system due to the HIV status of the household. Given the earlier reported China results on lower levels of attendance by children in HIV-HHs and higher levels of drop-out, this is an area where additional sensitization activities need to be implemented. Additionally, in China, almost one third (33%) of NA-HHs reported that they would NOT allow their child to play with a child from a HIV-HH and similar numbers said they would not allow their child to attend school with a HIV-positive child (Figure 45). In India, 3% of HIV-HHs reported their child had been ostracised in the community, but almost 50% of NA-HHs indicated they would not allow their child to play with a HIV-vulnerable child, or allow their child to attend school with a HIV-positive child. In Indonesia, only 5 of the 316 PLHIV who were in school actually revealed their status to the school. As such, it is not possible to analyse the data on the responses of the school and schoolmates. However, their lack of disclosure speaks loudly towards their fear of what the potential for stigma and discrimination would be should their status be revealed. Additional data from the survey revealed that approximately 14% of the 163 HIV-households whose status was disclosed to their community reported that their children had been socially ostracized in the community, indicating a need for greater educational awareness activities. Finally, in Viet Nam, 3% of HIV-HHs reported their child had been socially ostracised. 34 FIGuRE 44 HIV-Affected Households with Children who were Discriminated Against 1.8% 79.2% 2.9% 13.5% 2.9% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% HIV-HHs Reported Stigma or Discrimnation Against Child Cambodia: Of the HHs that reported their status was disclosed- Percentage reporting their child faced educational stigma.

First, the absence from the workplace has an important effect on the household\u2019s financial standing. Secondly, the increased cost of medical care that the household assumes forces households to adjust consumption and savings levels, further exacerbating the effects on income and living conditions. Access to ART clearly mitigates the high healthcare costs traditionally associated with HIV, and, apparently, can even lead to decreasing levels of expenditure thus constituting a basic pillar of any financial protection strategy targeted to PLHIV. This section reviews the cross-country evidence from HIV-affected and non-affected households in terms of utilisation, care seeking behaviour, health expenditure and access to treatment and diagnosis. 7.1 Health utilisation The data displayed in Figure 46 and Figure 47 show the impact of HIV on health care utilisation rates.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acf12aee-f37d-4274-9602-13efc9056b1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "acf12aee-f37d-4274-9602-13efc9056b1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9464b457110ad44fd1135b04287738a243868d04b41f39f45804a81fb033148"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb95a05f-5063-4762-b092-b086f3572f4e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5460d70a46e934948cf4cff9a4aac142ff632fb238c34d8677623ae61e5fa6b"}}, "hash": "f9836a843b9a6e94f9b80cebef43d13e5b15016caca73c6165ed03494a0465cd", "text": "As expected, the members of HIV-HHs (and PLHIV in particular) had higher utilisation rates than both non-PLHIV members of HIV-HHs and NA-HHs.

Countries varied in the overall percentage of members indicating they did not seek care when ill (highest in Indonesia, lowest in India), and between households (largest differences seen in Indonesia, with only 17% of PLHIV indicating they did not seek care when sick compared to 36% of members of NA-HHs13). However, the reasons given for not seeking care varied widely by both country and by household. In Cambodia, most members of HIV-HHs indicated they did not seek care because they already had the medication at home, while the majority of NA-HH respondents indicated it was because the illness was not serious enough to require going to a medical facility. In China, almost 91% of NA-HH respondents indicated they had not sought care because they had the medicine available at home, compared to only 42% of HIV-HH members.

As indicated in Section 5.5, in countries other than Cambodia, HIV-HHs allocated a larger percentage of their household expenditures to health care than NA-HHs. In China, the largest allocation towards health spending was seen, with health consuming 17% of HIV-HHs total expenditures (compared to 8% in NA-HHs). In India, HIV-HHs allocated more than three times their budgets (11%) towards health care than NA-HHs (3%). An equally large difference was seen between households in Indonesia, where the share of expenditures spent on health care in HIV-HHs was over three times greater than in NA-HHs (10.2% versus 3.1%). Viet Nam had the lowest allocations towards health care, but HIV-HHs still spent almost four times the share of HH spending as NA-HHs (5% compared to 1%).

Again, other than in Cambodia, where the insulating effect of ART appears to protect the poorest equally to the richest, the poorest households in the other countries allocated a greater percentage of their household expenditures towards healthcare than the wealthiest households. In China, the poorest HIV-HHs spent 18% on health care, as opposed to 6% for the wealthiest NA-HHs.

Figure 54 and Figure 55 highlight the main sources of financing for health charges incurred by household members when receiving either inpatient or outpatient services. The data cannot be directly correlated, as the questions were asked differently in Cambodia, China, India and Indonesia, and of different respondents. However, they do provide a general understanding of how individuals in the various countries pay for their health care, and how those mechanisms are different in the houses affected by HIV. In China, data were reported for all health services together (inpatient and ambulatory / outpatient) and compared PLHIV with non-HIV members. It showed that while PLHIV were more likely to be covered by insurance (5% versus 1% for non-HIV members), the vast majority of members in both households relied on their household earnings to pay for services. It should be noted that these expenditures for China do not include ART medications, which are largely covered by the government. At the household level in Cambodia, there were large differences between HIV-HHs and NA-HHs for both inpatient and outpatient care. For both types of care, HIV-HHs were more likely to report their care was free of charge. They equally reported having obtained a loan to pay for the care, but in both cases the NA-HHs were more likely to report having sold assets or used savings to pay for the care. While that may seem counterintuitive at first, the study on the Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household level in Cambodia (UN, 2010) found that many PLHIV indicated that they had depleted their savings for the care required when they were first diagnosed with HIV, so they no longer had assets or savings available to finance more recent care, which correlates with the overall fewer number of assets that HIV-HHs reported having in comparison to the NA-HHs (see Section 5.1). For India, data was only reported on the financing of hospitalisation cases, and only for HIV-HHs, but the large negative impact of health on household asset retention and savings accumulation can be seen, as 46% of HIV-HHs with a hospitalisation reported they had either used savings or sold assets to pay for care, while a further 42% reported they had gone into debt to cover the care. In Indonesia (where data is for non-PLHIV members of HIV-HHs and members of NA-HHs), for outpatient care, personal cash holdings were the main source of payment, but HIV-HHs did indicate the 39 Impact on Health care was free of charge slightly more frequently than the NA-HHs (10% versus 8%). Additionally, NA-HHs indicated that insurance covered their care more frequently (13%) than HIV-HHs did (10%). As in Cambodia, households in Indonesia were less likely to report using cash or household earnings to pay for inpatient care than they were for outpatient care, likely due to higher costs associated with hospitalisations. In Indonesia, differences between the percentage of non-PLHIV HIV-HH members and NA-HH members reporting that their care was at least partially exempt from charges was greater for inpatient care (10% for HIV-HHs, 4% for NA-HHs), as was the percentage who reported that insurance had covered some of the charges (20% HIV-HHs; 28% NA-HHs).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7739e7ec-4a07-4746-9161-63d90910f21d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7739e7ec-4a07-4746-9161-63d90910f21d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc53521323182c6c9c87501be8c2324a34fd3b03c34539e9a9380650c118d0a3"}, "2": {"node_id": "34d4f075-5e8c-4214-bd94-1627ce68ad5b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "476202314d1f9b26f57e4d8d0109e93f77c69671e9cde9ea6c80e6fb87ca30d1"}}, "hash": "1152e91c31e5ab370bf7b91ea1823a7f33c8e265559ae48186c284bd9082a02f", "text": "FIGuRE 54 Source of Financing for Outpatient Care Charges 15.3 2.7 0.0 0.0 9.7 7.8 55.0 79.4 93.7 95.8 75.3 75.6 4.6 9.9 13.3 4.7 4.6 6.1 9.2 17.5 3.7 2.5 4.4 2.8 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% HIV-HH NA-HH PLHIV Non-HIV HIV-HH NA-HH Cambodia China Indonesia Outpatient health costs paid by Other Used savings / sold assets Loan Insurance Cash / HH earnings Free / Exempt China: For China, all medical expenditures (IP and OP) were combined.

HIV-HH responses are for non-PLHIV only. 7.3 ART utilisation by PLHIV Continued access to ART is a core goal of all programs reviewed in the study. Increasing evidence points to the life-changing effect that HIV has on PLHIV in transition countries and the results in all countries highlight important differences in socio-economic status in accordance with varying levels of access. Figure 56 indicates the percentage of PLHIV who reported they were taking ART at the time of the interview. Overall, the percentages vary widely by country, from a high of 87% in Cambodia to a low of less than 15% in India. Additional data on usage by sex and stage of infection are also shown for certain countries in Figure 57 and Figure 58. There are only minor differences in usage by sex. In Cambodia, most of the differences in ART usage were due to differences in stage of infection between males and females, and that may be the case for Viet Nam as well (United Nations, 2010). However, it should be noted that the Viet Nam study reported that, in their qualitative interviews, female PLHIV indicated that female PLHIV would often share their ART with their HIV-positive male spouses, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to get the medicine; both my husband and I got them from the project. Sometimes, when medicine for my husband ran out, I let him use mine. There\u2019s no problem if I miss one time.\u201d In China, usage rates were ahead of the targets in China\u2019s Action Plan for Reducing and Preventing the Spread of HIV/AIDS (2006- 2010), which indicated that 80% of eligible patients (stage IV) should be receiving free ART at the end of 2010 and the survey reported 83% (State Council of People\u2019s Republic of China, 2006). However, in China, Indonesia and Viet Nam, the percentage of PLHIV reporting they are on ART was substantially higher than that reported by WHO and UNAIDS, as outlined in the Introduction. In China, ART coverage among survey respondents is almost double even the highest estimated national coverage (38%), perhaps due to the specific population covered in this survey - largely rural PLHIV. In Indonesia, the survey reported more than double the national coverage level of 21% and Viet Nam again almost double the national coverage figure of 34%. However, it should be noted that in Viet Nam the number of PLHIV receiving ART in 2009 (approximately 36,000 adults and 2,000 children) had more than doubled since 2007, and seen a 14-fold increase since 2005 (Ministry of Health, 2009a). In India, the national figure is currently higher (26%) than the survey reported, but that is likely due to the difference in timeframes, as the India survey was conducted in 2004 and 2005. Overall, as seen with some of the other data on the impact of health expenditures and financial barriers to care, it appears that while Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Viet Nam all have some form of government policy providing access to free ART treatment for PLHIV, it appears to have been most effective in Cambodia, at the time of the surveys.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8581531d-1455-44b4-8868-26f7207fc6a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "8581531d-1455-44b4-8868-26f7207fc6a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa9621f76544508662c30d17aad4b2d4c323b4c25d2182d7f66c84c665343b3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "675519b5-5b9e-4307-b6aa-a72359fb19c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef6994e05bbd24eda1ac557dd84471a5b2a89e0551c2746479fa607d66592b89"}}, "hash": "bf17d1d63e43e2dce3001dbd63d3e6f41e4a237c589db0ba218e5c3302bf589f", "text": "40 FIGuRE 56 PLHIV Taking ART 86.7% 63.4% 14.5% 53.5% 64.8% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% PLHIV taking ART (%) FIGuRE 57 PLHIV Taking ART, by Sex 91.4% 53.7% 62.6% 84.8% 53.1% 67.8% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Cambodia Indonesia Viet Nam PLHIV taking ART (%) Males Females FIGuRE 58 PLHIV Taking ART, by Stage of Infection 80.9% 40.2% 87.1% 48.4% 90.4% 75.2% 89.2% 83.0% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Cambodia China PLHIV on ART (%) Stage I Stage II Stage III Stage IV Stage in China by CD4 count, in Cambodia by WHO clinical staging classification. 7.4 Transmission and Diagnosis The percentage of PLHIV who discovered their status through VCCT (rather than after a prolonged illness, pregnancy test, or other form of diagnosis) is reported in Figure 59.

It is possible that a different definition of VCCT was used in the survey that is not described. Figure 60 displays data on the percentage of PLHIV diagnosed via VCCT, by sex. In both Cambodia and India lower levels of men were diagnosed through VCCT than females. This has important consequences for transmission, especially for those undiagnosed PLHIV with intimate partners, as the longer a PLHIV continues without knowledge of their status, the greater the chances of them unknowingly passing their infection onto their partner. Increasing the accessibility of VCCT for specific key populations14 for early diagnosis and treatment could contribute to reducing transmission. In Indonesia, there were identical levels of reported VCCT diagnosis in both males and females, with only 85 of 771 male PLHIV stating they were not diagnosed via VCCT (2 did not know) and only 34 of 335 female PLHIV (4 did not know). Only Cambodia reported details about whether respondents were associated with a key population at higher risk of HIV exposure, so it was not possible to draw any regional conclusions about similarities or differences regarding HIV and key populations. However, data was available on the mode of transmission reported by the surveyed PLHIV, as shown in Figure 61. It should be noted that differences in survey methodology, and gender distribution of PLHIV may partially explain differences seen in the various countries. For example, in China, the survey focused on poor rural areas, and specifically on PLHIV who were infected through injecting drug use, commercial blood donation and heterosexual sex between spouses, so other significant groups of PLHIV, such as commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, and 14 Key populations= key populations at higher risk of HIV exposure.

However, these differences (and similarities) are important for drawing conclusions from the other findings in this report.

When broken down by sex, it is clear that, for females across the studied countries, heterosexual contact is the main mode of transmission: 90% of female PLHIV in Cambodia, 88% in India, 65% in China and 63% in Indonesia (see Figure 62). This contrasts with males, for whom heterosexual contact was reported as the mode of transmission at a lower rate, in every country: 85% in Cambodia, 71% in India, 24% in China and only 4% in Indonesia. In Cambodia and Indonesia, PLHIV were specifically asked about spousal transmission, and again, differences by sex are seen in the responses (see Figure 63). Significantly more females indicated they had contracted HIV from their husbands in contrast with male PLHIV who indicated they had contracted HIV from their wives (in Indonesia, 77% of women indicated they contracted HIV from their spouses, while 23% of men indicated the same).

Importantly, those results reflect the pattern of transmission from several years before the survey occurred, and it is believed that the issues with commercial donation and HIV have been largely solved. Risk factors associated with injecting drug use are noted in several country studies, especially in males in China (62% of transmission) and Indonesia (73%). In Indonesia, the survey data were different from overall national averages, where heterosexual contact was reported as the main source of transmission (Ditjen PP dan PL, Kementerian Kesehatan RI, 2010), possibly due to the specific regions that the report\u2019s survey targeted. However, all data from Indonesia do suggest that HIV transmission through unsafe injecting practices is increasing, and points to the need for additional education and awareness among people who inject drugs (Ministry of Health et al, 2007).

This is especially true as the unique nature of HIV and its treatment increases the importance of improving the nutritional status of PLHIV. It is estimated that the impact of HIV increases an asymptomatic adult PLHIV\u2019s energy requirements by 10% and a person living with symptomatic HIV or AIDS is likely to require 20-30% more energy to maintain bodyweight (WHO, 2004). As such, the food expenditures associated with HIV-HHs would be expected to increase, yet at a time when even less income is available, as previously discussed. The data displayed in Figure 64 indicate that, for most countries, HIV had a relatively small overall impact on food expenditures as a percentage of total household expenditures. Viet Nam is the only country where HIV-HHs did spend substantially greater portions of their household budget on food than NA-HHs. In contrast, in India, HIV-HHs spent less than NA-HHs, likely due to the larger proportion of their budget allocated towards healthcare. Additionally, HIV- HHs in Indonesia were specifically asked if they reduced their food expenditures as a coping mechanism and over 26% answered affirmatively.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9548dd9-925a-479a-a154-3504a2574ccf": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9548dd9-925a-479a-a154-3504a2574ccf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e362f6823aebcbdecf31fd576ea249ce7743a23f1d7fdc25946fb4765237f60"}, "2": {"node_id": "6f0e6709-af37-42a7-8a43-c92fa5d14792", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb44fbc632aac92e551daea32cebe02e9d7417c03b5a93ec69f4c51fe8edd406"}}, "hash": "8864ae4eaafdb7f04f66b2c6a713589697dfa12c4632433e5713cf60169707c0", "text": "FIGuRE 64 Household Food Expenditure as a % of Total Household Consumption 57.3% 41.3% 42.7% 48.1% 60.8% 59.1% 39.7% 45.8% 47.7% 49.9% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% Cambodia China India Indonesia Viet Nam Food Expenditures as % of Total HH Consumption HIV-HH NA-HH Figure 65 shows that in China and India, greater differences in food allocations between HIV-HHs and NA-HHs can be seen when segregated by the wealth of the household.

The results of that analysis are shown in Figure 67. It can be seen that there was wide variation in the composition of household food expenditures, but in all three countries with data (Cambodia, China, and Indonesia), HIV-HHs spent less on proteins (meat and eggs) than NA-HHs. This may be partially due to the fact that those items are often more expensive, not easily produced by those in lower income rural households, or because the food support to HIV-HHs often does not include protein-rich items. Additionally, while Viet Nam did not report specifically about expenditures of households on different food items, they did report on daily use of protein rich food. Again, HIV-HHs had reduced daily use of proteins in comparison to NA-HHs, in both urban and rural areas (7% fewer households reported daily protein consumption in urban areas and 15% less in rural). When asked why they did not eat certain foods frequently, HIV-HHs were more likely than NA-HHs to respond that the foods were too expensive, especially in urban areas (20% for respondents from HIV-HHs versus 14% for respondents from NA-HHs).

As shown in Figure 68, only Viet Nam and Cambodia specifically asked about household hunger. However, for both countries, HIV-HH households were more likely to have reported members being hungry than NA-HHs (1.4 times more likely, on average).

Emotional, mental and sometimes physical manifestations of stigma and discrimination are not only personally damaging, but are often correlated with other medical co-morbidities, and can further reduce an individual\u2019s capacity to engage in productive economic activities. Internal stigma, stigma and discrimination can also reduce the likelihood of an individual accessing HIV testing, seeking treatment, or sharing their diagnosis and taking action to protect others. Figure 71 diagrams the inter-relationship between how the three different aspects of HIV-related stigma and discrimination (internal stigma, stigma and discrimination) can escalate one another and lead to a cycle that is difficult to break. Stigma within the community leads to discriminatory actions against the person living with HIV, which in turn leads to increased levels of internal stigma within the PLHIV, creating reduced socialisation, which can lead to further stigma in the community. FIGuRE 71 Conceptual Framework for Stigma, Discrimination and Internal Stigma Source: USAID, Breaking the Cycle: Stigma, Discrimination, Internal Stigma and HIV, 2006. 9.1 Internal Stigma The data in Figure 72 demonstrate some of the internal stigma experienced by the PLHIV in Cambodia and in Viet Nam. In Cambodia, high levels of PLHIV reported having experienced shame (47%), guilt (49%), self-blame (46%), low self-esteem (65%) and feeling they should be punished because of their HIV status (65%). Similar numbers of PLHIV in Viet Nam reported low self- esteem (66%), though there were lower levels of shame reported (25%). Of great concern were the high levels of PLHIV in Cambodia reporting suicidal thoughts in the previous year, due to their status (16% versus 7% in Viet Nam). Chapter 10 shows that differences in internal stigma were reported for males and females, with females being significantly more likely to experience suicidal thoughts (18% versus 10% for males in Cambodia and 6% of males in Viet Nam compares to 9% of females).

There are clear regional differences with regard to status disclosure, although potential observational bias exists in some of these results - for example, in Cambodia, bias due to the methodology used to locate PLHIV in the survey, as PLHIV known to home-based care teams are more likely to have disclosed their status than those not receiving home-based care. Overall, the highest levels of non-disclosure were reported in Indonesia (13% overall), followed by India (7%), China (7%) and Cambodia (1%). The rate of disclosure in Indonesia is important as it points to the need for greater education of PLHIV, and the general population, on the importance of sharing their status with their sexual partner.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df427e2d-a71d-4e82-ae00-ced32767b4db": {"__data__": {"id_": "df427e2d-a71d-4e82-ae00-ced32767b4db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "beed5d3c977c03724ad1b84a21488a98529e2b81dd80fabc99692f68e48d3308"}, "2": {"node_id": "24933ddd-903c-49dd-be3c-a5dcd09b8908", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4cf66bda2a0b73f8eaaff0b3c37703113172378a40a2c03f5b97aa7283dba2c6"}}, "hash": "369571a35d25b546fca90eba2adab09f6104e9e1ce778e2ad3f9c427b4997420", "text": "The data show that in China, India and Indonesia there were strong differences (and minor differences in Cambodia) in the percentage of men who immediately reported their status to their wife and the percentage of women who immediately reported their status to their husband (more female PLHIV reported immediately in both China and India, the reverse in Indonesia).

In Indonesia, responses by sex were only available for PLHIV who were also responding as the heads of their household, so present a small, particular segment of men and women. However, for those particular PLHIV, women were considerably less likely to have disclosed their status to their intimate partner (26% had not revealed their status, compared to 11% of men). Based on other data in the Indonesia analysis, it is likely this is due to fear of discrimination and / or abuse (16% of female PLHIV who were once married reported their husband left them and no longer supported them and 10% of female PLHIV reported they had been physically abused for trying to refuse sex with their husband).

Did not disclose Not immediately Immediately The data shown in Figure 74 indicate both the initial and current attitudes of the PLHIV\u2019s spouse towards their HIV status, as reported by the PLHIV. Both Cambodia and India had similar percentages of PLHIV indicating that their spouse was supportive from the beginning (45% and 43% respectively), while China reported a lower figure of 34%, and Indonesia even lower with only 21%. It should be noted that the questions asked and possible responses were not the same for all countries: in Cambodia a response of either \u201csupportive\u201d or \u201cvery supportive\u201d was included and referred only to the spouse, in China and India only \u201csupportive\u201d was included but responded to both family members and spouses, and in Indonesia, responses of \u201cmore attentive\u201d or \u201cshowed empathy\u201d were included, and referred to either spouses or heads of household. The data also show how spouses\u2019 attitudes changed overtime, as PLHIV also described their spouse\u2019s attitude towards them at the time of the survey. The largest change was noted in China, where more than twice as many PLHIV indicated spouses were supportive at the time of the interview (75%) in comparison to when they initially disclosed their status (34%). In India and Indonesia almost twice as many PLHIV reported a supportive spouse at the time of the interview (from 21% to 43% in Indonesia and from 43% to 82% in India) than initially. In Cambodia, the current reaction of the spouse of the PLHIV was less likely to be supportive (only 63%) as those in China and India, but it should be noted that discriminatory attitudes towards the PLHIV were reported less frequently. Due to the differences in reporting, exact correlations are not possible, but in Cambodia, only 2% of PLHIV indicated that their spouse (and 4% their family members) were currently discriminatory or very discriminatory against them, while in India 12% reported they were neglected, isolated or verbally / physically abused, 6% indicated they had been asked to leave the home, and 8% indicated they had been discriminated against in some other way. Similarly, in China, over 10% of PLHIV reported they had been discriminated against in some way.

Overall, high levels of bias can be seen in both countries, in a variety of situations. India\u2019s responses were more biased overall, but that is possibly due to the older survey timeframe. In China, 25% of respondents indicated their community would not accept a PLHIV living within their community, and in India, that number rose to 37%. Over 25% of both countries\u2019 respondents indicated they would not interact with the family of a PLHIV, showing the knock-on effect which HIV can have on those close to a PLHIV. Some of the economic repercussions of negative community attitudes towards PLHIV can be seen as 41% of respondents in India, and over 57% in China indicated they would not buy food (specifically steamed breads) from a HIV-positive shopkeeper. Additionally, over 48% of those in India said they would not accept a HIV-positive teacher in their child\u2019s school, and 32% in China. In India, people in urban areas were more open and tolerant than those in rural areas (data not shown). Only one question was asked of those in Indonesia (data not shown), \u201cHow is your attitude when interacting or one day interacting with a PLHIV?\u201d. In Indonesia, 15% of NA-HH respondents indicated they would either avoid a PLHIV or keep their distance, and the percentage was higher for female respondents (19%) than for male respondents (14%). 50 FIGuRE 75 Attitudes of Non-Affected Household Respondents Towards PLHIV 31.9% 57.1% 39.7% 34.5% 26.7% 24.5% 48.1% 40.5% 54.9% 43.4% 26.8% 36.5% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% NOT accept a PLHIV as a teacher NOT purchase food from a HIV-positive shopkeeper NOT use health facilities used by a PLHIV NOT share food with a PLHIV NOT interact with family of a PLHIV NOT accept a PLHIV to live in same community India China China: Asked of HoHs in NA-HHs. India: Asked of all adult members of NA-HHs. The data in Figure 76 and Figure 77 highlight the percentage of PLHIV who disclosed their status to their community, and the main forms of stigma and discrimination those PLHIV faced because of their HIV status. The same methodology was not used across the five countries, so the results are not directly comparable, but still give a good estimate of how various countries in the region are similar (and different) with regards to stigma and discrimination experienced by PLHIV. In Cambodia, which used the \u201cPeople Living with HIV Stigma Index\u201d questionnaire (International Planned Parenthood Federation, 2008), approximately 80% of PLHIV indicated they had disclosed their status to their friends and neighbours, compared to 75% in India, 49% in China and only 17% in Indonesia. Again, it must be noted that the PLHIV interviewed in Cambodia were receiving visits from home-based care teams who, as part of their activities, conduct HIV awareness-raising community activities. Perhaps partially due to those activities, only 6% reported having been socially neglected or isolated by their community, compared to the high levels of social ostracism by the community in China and India, with 56% of PLHIV in China and 66% in India reporting that they were either socially isolated or neglected. Levels were lower in Indonesia and Viet Nam (25% and 21%). Additionally, high levels of verbal abuse were reported by PLHIV in both India and Viet Nam (37% had experiences such abuse), and while levels were lower, they still raise concern in Cambodia (21%), Indonesia (19%) and China (18%). Additionally, an alarming 6% of PLHIV in Cambodia and 4% in Indonesia reported they had suffered from physical abuse due to their HIV status. Viet Nam was the only country that surveyed whether the PLHIV felt their rights had been diminished due to their positive status (property and asset rights, fertility rights, childcare rights, confidentiality rights), and 19% reported that they had faced such discrimination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97ba5808-62be-4462-baa3-16dd40e6c11a": {"__data__": {"id_": "97ba5808-62be-4462-baa3-16dd40e6c11a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55c597d99ee688e78dfb9053bfe48284a886a2338db73ae58f4c5ff98f75c18b"}, "2": {"node_id": "51f8bb0c-6754-4bfd-a4ca-27849acc2d98", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ac1f8d39da8181ff3e075dd236c540545d06bd3724a05be9c941120b435020b"}}, "hash": "3bdcd4bcfc21b9dcbaaa2875ddf8988402b938263edec80af788b0f275b576f2", "text": "Additionally, PLHIV were asked if they were required to use separate chopsticks or eating utensils within the household, and 12% of those in Indonesia reported in the affirmative, while 9% of those in Viet Nam and 7% of those in Cambodia and China did so.

The lower rate of disclosure in China and Indonesia might be partially attributable to the higher rate of discrimination within the health sector reported by PLHIV as only 1% of PLHIV in Cambodia reported discrimination in their health facilities, compared to 13% in China and 30% in Indonesia. A high level of discrimination was also reported in Viet Nam, where 17% of PLHIV reported they had been discriminated against in the health setting. These high levels of reported discrimination point to an immediate need to increase sensitization and awareness of HIV in the health facility setting, as many PLHIV are currently not receiving the care they require, and are also likely not to be receiving adequate education about transmission prevention, and other key support modalities. In Cambodia, a very low level of PLHIV (2%) indicated they had not disclosed their status within their workplace, compared to 74% of PLHIV in India. However, a very high percentage of PLHIV in Cambodia also indicated they had been discriminated against as a result (30%), which is a substantially higher level than reported elsewhere in the region (10% in India and Viet Nam, 4% in China). In China, levels of workplace-based discrimination are low due to the largely rural agriculturally-based sector of the population who were interviewed, and for whom their household is the productive unit, so work-based contact with individuals outside the home is limited, and therefore labour-based discrimination is less likely.

In India, fairly similar levels of stigma and discrimination were reported by both male and female PLHIV. 51 Stigma, Discrimination and Quality of Life However, in Indonesia15, significantly more females than males reported social isolation (47% versus 17%) and verbal abuse (12% versus 29%). In Viet Nam equal levels of male and female PLHIV reported being discriminated against within the workplace, and having been verbally abused, but substantially greater levels of female PLHIV than male PLHIV reported they had been socially isolated (28% versus 17%), suffered rights neglect (26% versus 14%), or been discriminated against within health facilities (21% versus 15%). 15 Analysis was restricted to the subset of PLHIV who were also the HoH and status was known to the community.

Executive Summary Executive Summary Impact on Family Structures, Women and Girls and Intimate Partner Transmission 10 53 54 10.1 Family Structures One of the major social impacts of HIV is a change to the family structure, both through mortality and social stigmatization. In the three countries (Cambodia, China and Indonesia) that reported on family structures, all showed that HIV-HHs were less likely to maintain a \u201cnuclear\u201d family structure (parents and children) than NA-HHs, as shown in Figure 79 (55% compared to 63% in Cambodia, 51% compared to 62% in China, and 50% compared to 64% in Indonesia). In some of these instances, the households maintained extended family structures that included a more distant family member (aunt, uncle, brother, sister, grandparent) who joined the household to assist with caregiving functions, or with household income. In other instances, PLHIV may have been forced to leave their home, or their partner died, leaving them in a single household. In both cases, the household is in a more economically vulnerable position. FIGuRE 79 Households with Nuclear Family Structure 55.5% 50.7% 49.2% 62.7% 62.3% 63.9% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% Cambodia China Indonesia Households with Nuclear Family Structure (%) HIV-HH NA-HH It should also be noted that, while only Cambodia specifically reported on the presence of orphans within households, these results show the additional significant impact that HIV has on family structures - 33% of HIV-HHs reported caring for an orphan, compared to only 2% of NA-HHs. Further research in other Asian countries on the socio-economic impacts of HIV on households with orphans would be of value. 10.2 Women and Girls Gender inequality remains an issue in the countries featured in this report. In Cambodia, the adult literacy rate for women is 64% compared to 85% for men (United Nations, 2011). In India, the difference is even greater (48% versus 74%). In China, the under- five mortality rate for girls (2000-2005) is 38 deaths per 1000 live births, compared to 27 for boys. In Viet Nam, the percentage of underweight girls is 35%, compared to 31% for boys. It is not surprising, then, that the studies featured in this report often found women to be often disproportionately affected by HIV. Due to the increasing proportion of female PLHIV in the region (35% in 2011, up from 21% in 1990), it is important to better understand the specific issues affecting women and girls in HIV-affected households (UNAIDS, 2011c). For a more detailed analysis of the issues affecting women and girls affected by HIV across all socio- economic indicators please refer to the partner report, The Socio- Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis of the Impact on Women and Girls (UNDP, 2011b). 10.2.1 Pregnancy Three of the five studies featured in this report explored the experiences of women living with HIV with respect to pregnancy and, in particular, the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Figure 80 provides data on how women in the various countries demonstrated knowledge of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). Overall, less than 50% of all pregnant women were informed of PMTCT, underlining the importance of increasing provider- based programmes for preventing mother-to-child transmission.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8b11039-b4cc-434d-ae44-ebebf7c1f74a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8b11039-b4cc-434d-ae44-ebebf7c1f74a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9d03873ef2c374cc9aea8868ebff5ca4d42019b04a3e7a515ea30294483b342"}, "2": {"node_id": "113a4509-b90b-4b94-8e8f-3316d1e8b9fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b3056f48c1b9adc7835b9bdd9c6b99ae721c2df4b4869959bd310037291ebe9"}}, "hash": "dff7569da163f6d1aa1979d06c3152ab6bfe856912a04cd71f2264e32627dfeb", "text": "Responses varied greatly, with nearly all women in NA-HHs (92%) in Indonesia reporting they had heard of MTCT, while less than half that percentage (42%) reporting the same in Viet Nam.

In China and India, boys in HIV-HHs were 0.6 times more likely to have dropped out than boys in NA-HHs while girls were almost eight times more likely. Widows in HIV-HHs face additional hardships through the loss of property inheritance rights. 55 Impact on Family Structures, Women and Girls and Intimate Partner Transmission but only 2% of those in NA-HHs were aware. That data raises two sets of concerns, the first of which is the high percentage of HIV positive pregnant women in Indonesia who did not inform their health professional of their HIV status (over 40%). As was discussed earlier, high levels of discrimination in health facilities were reported in the Indonesia study (over 30% of PLHIV reported being discriminated against in a health facility), so it is understandable that women are hesitant to disclose their status to health professionals. While levels of PMTCT awareness in NA- HHs in Viet Nam cannot be extrapolated to those in Indonesia, it can be safely assumed that women who do not indicate they are HIV positive are considerably less likely to be informed of PMTCT medicines. As such, the data point to the need for increased sensitization training within the health profession, as the fear of discrimination, and hence reluctance to disclose status, is placing the lives of many unborn babies at risk.

With regards to actual pregnancies, in Cambodia, the survey asked if women (aged 15-45) had given birth within the last year, while in Indonesia, the survey asked whether women (who had ever been married) had ever been pregnant, so numbers cannot be compared. In Cambodia, twice as many women in NA-HHs (12%) had given birth in the previous year than in HIV-HHs (6%). In Indonesia, 40% of HIV-positive married, divorced or widowed women indicated they had been pregnant or given birth since being diagnosed with HIV. In Viet Nam, 9% of women in HIV-HHs indicated they had been forced or persuaded to have an abortion, compared to 6% of women in NA-HHs. While data is not available for other countries, the result points to a need for more information on this issue, and for increased education and empowerment activities regarding the sexual and reproductive health rights of HIV positive women. With regard to PMTCT during pregnancy, it is important to note that all the surveys took place, either concurrently with, or before new WHO recommendations were published in November 2009, that indicate \u201cAll HIV-infected pregnant women who are not in need of ART for their own health require an effective ARV prophylaxis strategy to prevent transmission to their infant\u201d (WHO, 2009).

The recommendations were changed to \u201cMothers known to be HIV- infected (and whose infants are HIV uninfected or of unknown HIV status) should exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first 6 months of life, introducing appropriate complementary foods thereafter, and continue breast-feeding for the first 12 months of life.\u201d However, the data clearly indicates that HIV-positive women in Cambodia and Indonesia will need additional education to change their current practices - in Cambodia only 21% of women in HIV-HHs reported they breastfed their baby in the first six months, while 93% of women in NA-HHs reported breastfeeding. In Indonesia, 45% of HIV-positive women reported breastfeeding their baby, which is surprisingly high, and perhaps due to the low percentage who informed their health provider of their status, and were therefore not informed of the previous recommendations not to breastfeed.

Cambodia Indonesia 10.2.2 Widows Of the 245 million widows worldwide, almost 50% live in devastating poverty, and China, India and Indonesia alone account for over one third of these vulnerable women (Loomba Foundation, 2010). That vulnerability is even more pronounced for those who are HIV positive, whose deceased spouse was HIV positive, and elderly widows caring for grandchildren orphaned by HIV (Loomba Foundation 2010). The studies in Cambodia, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam looked at how HIV-positive status impacted the inheritance rights of widows. In Cambodia, widows in both HIV-HHs (regardless of the widow\u2019s HIV status) and NA-HHs were asked if they inherited their deceased husband\u2019s assets after he passed away, and significant differences were seen between 56 households - widows in HIV-HHs were more likely (15%) to have been denied their rightful inheritance than those in NA-HHs (10%). Figure 82 shows that in India, Indonesia and Viet Nam, widows in NA-HHs were not asked that question, but the percentages of HIV- affected widows being denied access to their husband\u2019s property was substantially higher than in Cambodia (79% of widows in India, 71% in Indonesia and 62% in Viet Nam). Additionally, in Viet Nam, 33% of HIV positive widows were asked to leave the household after their husband\u2019s death. In both Cambodia and Viet Nam, the negative impact of HIV was much more pronounced in rural areas than in urban areas (data not shown).

Viet Nam: % of widows or separated HIV-positive women. Studies of widows have also pointed to the extra vulnerability of children in widow-headed households, as their reduced economic status often forces them to turn to the household\u2019s children for extra income, restricting them from educational opportunities. The Cambodia study provided data on the percentage of children who had to repeat a grade based on the status of the head-of- household.

This is due to the fact that men who buy sex constitute one of the largest groups of PLHIV, and they are often married, or will become married. Their wives, often believing they are at low risk due to their sexual interaction with only partner, are in fact vulnerable to infection. In India, a recent report on HIV and intimate partners showed that, while 22% of surveyed men reported having extramarital sex (EMS), only 40% reported using a condom in the EMS encounter (UNAIDS, 2009b). In contrast, only 6% of surveyed wives reported they thought their husband might be engaged in EMS. It has been estimated that 90% of HIV positive women acquired the virus through heterosexual contact with their spouse or intimate partner (Silverman et al, 2008) but there is still fairly limited data on the subject. The data provided by these surveys, especially in Cambodia and Indonesia, which specifically asked about intimate partner transmission, provide new and significant insight into the situation. The data in Figure 62 showed that the percentage of female PLHIV reporting that they acquired their infection through heterosexual contact was higher than that for males, in all countries providing data. The largest difference was seen in Indonesia, where only 4% of men but 63% of women indicated heterosexual sex as the mode of transmission. Additionally, Figure 63 showed that in Cambodia 80% of men who stated they had contracted HIV through heterosexual sex reported that the source of their infection was their spouse or intimate partner, while 98% of women indicated the same. In Indonesia, only 23% of men who reported heterosexual sex as the mode of transmission stated that they had contracted HIV from their intimate partner, compared to 77% of women. Additionally, while it cannot be assumed what percentage of the transmissions were from their intimate partners, the large percentage of women in India (88%) and China (65%) indicated that their transmission had been via heterosexual contact, and given the nature of the household-based surveys used, it is likely that the majority of those infections, as in Cambodia and Indonesia, were also through sexual contact with intimate partners. The data therefore validates previous studies concerned with this issue (UNAIDS, 2009; Saggurti et al, 2009) which have highlighted the need for increased empowerment of wives, increased education to men on the risks of EMS, and the importance of condom usage, and increased awareness of the impact of STIs and their connection with HIV. In order to be effective, such interventions will need to challenge traditional gender norms that intensify HIV vulnerability among women and girls (as well as men who have sex with men and transgender people). Additionally, further studies should be conducted to determine the potential benefits of introducing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs such as tenofovir or tenofovir/emtricitabine, which, when taken daily as preventive medicine by an unaffected partner, have been shown to reduce HIV transmission by 63-73% (UNAIDS, 2011b). 10.2.4 Impact on Education In addition to the burden borne by HIV-positive women, all women and girls in HIV-HHs (regardless of their HIV status) are likely to be disproportionately affected by HIV. For example, in Cambodia, the majority of caregivers in HIV-HHs (who assumed additional duties) were women. Additionally, in China, a comparison of the total productive time for women in NA-HHs was 0.7 hours per day more than for men, while females in HIV-HHs worked 2.2 hours more per day than males, providing insight into the additional 57 Impact on Family Structures, Women and Girls and Intimate Partner Transmission burdens HIV places on women in HIV-HHs. In Viet Nam, the work force participation rate among female PLHIV (83%) was higher than among males (68%), even though HIV positive women were sick more frequently (5.2 episodes of illness compared to 2.9 in men) and for longer (140 days compared to 115 days for men). Across the region, data indicates that girls in HIV-HHs also experience reduced educational opportunities.

China and Indonesia saw the most significant differences, with girls in Chinese HIV-HHs 13 times more likely to have dropped out than those in NA-HHs, compared to a two-fold increase for boys. In Indonesia, girls saw a six-time increase in drop-outs, compared to equal numbers of drop-outs for boys in HIV-affected and non- affected households. These educational disparities have negative consequences, for both the total human capital accumulation of the household, and for future economic opportunities for the females in the household. 10.2.5 Stigma and Discrimination This section examines the specific issue of stigma and discrimination experienced by women and girls living with HIV. Figure 78 showed shows that, in Cambodia, while differences are not noted between the percentages of men and women who reported experiencing either social isolation or discrimination in the health sector, more females reported having been verbally and physically abused than males. In China, however, no large differences are seen with regard to discrimination, except for the percentage reporting they use separate chopsticks - males were significantly more likely not to share their food utensils than females (10% versus 3%). In India, fairly similar levels of stigma and discrimination were reported by both male and female PLHIV. However, in Indonesia, while similar levels of PLHIV reported discrimination within health facilities, and verbal and physical abuse, significantly more females than males reported experiencing social isolation (28% versus 18%). Similarly, in Viet Nam, equal levels of male and female PLHIV reported being discriminated against within the workplace, and having been verbally abused, but substantially greater levels of female PLHIV reported they had been socially isolated (28% versus 17%), suffered rights neglect (26% versus 14%), and been discriminated against within health facilities (21% versus 15%). The data in Figure 83 show how internal stigma was experienced differently for males and females in Cambodia and Viet Nam. Worryingly, in both countries, a much greater percentage of females had considered suicide in the past year, because of their HIV status, than males. Additionally, in Viet Nam women were more likely to report low self-esteem than males (70% versus 62%). In Cambodia, possibly due to the high levels of intimate partner transmission from men to women, women were more likely to blame others for their status (27% versus 9%), and less likely to feel guilty (43% versus 65%). However, the guilt levels are very high, considering that 90% of female PLHIV surveyed were infected through sexual contact with their intimate partner. Paired with the data from the previous table, the results below indicate a need for targeted psychosocial support for women and girls living with HIV. FIGuRE 83 PLHIV in Cambodia who Experienced Internal Stigma, by Sex 42.8% 64.5% 57.6% 8.8% 62.4% 49.1% 10.1% 48.4% 42.6% 40.9% 27.1% 65.8% 46.0% 18.4% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% Ashamed Guilty Blamed self Blamed others Low self-esteem Should be punished Suicidal Percentage of PLHIV who felt internal stigma Male Female FIGuRE 84 PLHIV in Viet Nam who Experienced Internal Stigma, by Sex 62.1% 5.6% 70.1% 9.2% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% Low self-esteem Thoughts of death Percentage of PLHIV who felt internal stigma Male Female 59 Social Safety Nets and HIV 11.1 Health Insurance, Life Insurance and Pensions Insurance offers HIV-affected households an important potential mechanism to mitigate the effects of morbidity and mortality. However, the data in Figure 85 show the varying levels of insurance and pension coverage throughout the reporting countries, and across both HIV-affected and non-affected households. In China, high levels of health insurance were reported, largely due to the implementation of the new rural cooperative medical system by the government, and the largely rural base of the household surveys. However, despite the inclusion of PLHIV, 15% fewer HIV-HHs reported having health insurance than NA-HHs. This varied by region, as households in Yunnan had equal rates of coverage, while HIV-HHs in Sichuan had only 27% coverage, compared to 65% of NA-HHs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d87ad4a-26c4-4dc9-af13-d2d2fc3a208f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d87ad4a-26c4-4dc9-af13-d2d2fc3a208f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15ffeb47bec549c6486713f62ab76ff5605ff627b27d61fee82c533b602db12a"}, "2": {"node_id": "97d1bf52-b785-4c61-9fb2-36059b7a7483", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20f00bd60f940865cc17a15b0cf78ea3e7322f6eae305d67a33b594c27505316"}}, "hash": "c3338a81ecd17b5b494104e0ca659fac8360ad0dc5e4cad9a7a15593a0cd48af", "text": "The PLHIV in Sichuan were more likely to be urban than in the other provinces, and therefore not eligible for inclusion in the rural health plan.

In Cambodia, no significant numbers of households indicated they had access to life insurance, but in China, 6% of NA-HHs had life insurance, compared to less than 1% of HIV-HHs. In China, life insurance policies do not extend coverage to those who die from HIV, so it is unlikely that HIV-HHs would purchase a policy. In Indonesia, 4% of HIV-HHs indicated they had life insurance policies. The data point to the lack of financial security that most of the households (HIV-affected and non-affected) face after the death of their primary bread-winner. However, given the known mortality impact of HIV, it is clear that there is a need for expanded safety net support for the households of PLHIV. The figure also shows that there is both little variation, and almost no participation, by households in pension funds, regardless of country or HIV status of the household, although in China members of NA-HHs (3.4%) were twice as likely as HIV-HHs (1.7%) to report inclusion in a pension scheme.

HIV-HH NA-HH As well established in the preceding sections, HIV-affected households across the region suffer economically through reduced income from diminished employment opportunities due to illness, discrimination, and caregiving duties, and, in most countries, through increased health-related expenditures. To mitigate those direct impacts, and the other impacts such as increased child labour, reduced educational opportunities, and reduced nutritional status, many countries have implemented other forms of financial support to assist HIV-HHs in dealing with their increased hardships. The data in Figure 86 highlights how effectively those programs are targeting HIV-HHs, and how the assistance varies across the region. In Cambodia, targeting appears to be effective, with 69% of HIV- HHs reporting they received financial support (not including assistance with health expenditures), compared to only 9% of NA- HHs. Additionally, when examined by wealth quintile as shown in Figure 87, not only do the differences between HIV-affected and non-affected households remain, but targeting appears to be reaching those most in need - 71% of the poorest HIV-HHs reported receiving support, compared to 62% of the highest income HIV-HHs. In China, targeting also appears effective, with 40% of HIV-HHs reporting they received aid in comparison to only 13% of NA-HHs. Additionally, greater numbers of low income HIV-HHs (43%) than higher income households (34%) received assistance. Assistance in China includes the minimum living standard assistance (MLSA) and other programs, and support from projects or NGOs, but again does not include assistance for health-related expenditures. In Viet Nam, 15% of HIV-HHs received financial support, compared to only 3% of NA-HHs. The financial influence of the support on household income is displayed in Figure 88, which shows the value of the received Chapter Summary Levels of life insurance and pension coverage were low throughout the region averaging only 1.6% of HIV-HHs and 3.1% of NA-HHs for life insurance and 1.4% of HIV-HHs and 1.9% of NA-HHs for pensions; In most countries, HIV-HHs were less likely to have insurance than NA-HHs; Financial support was well targeted to HIV-HHs and to the poorest households, and was an important source of income for HIV-HHs in China; In Cambodia and Viet Nam, participation in Home-Based Care Network or self-help group helped PLHIV gain access to financial support. 60 support as a percentage of total household income.

No major difference was seen, however, between the percentage who had received assistance with medications (100% versus 99%) or health care financing (24% versus 25%). Similarly, in Cambodia, those HIV-HHs that received home-based care team visits, were correlated with HIV-HHs who reported receiving government educational scholarships and stipends, and other forms of financial support.

In Cambodia, community home-based care teams were developed in 1998 to address the multitude of issues facing people living with HIV at the time, including limited access to ART, limited public capacity to serve other health needs, and widespread stigma and discrimination, which further limited access to health care (NCHADS, 2006). Today, there are over 250 home-based care (HBC) teams throughout the country, providing assistance to more than 13,757 PLHIV (KHANA, 2008). They provide a variety of services from financial aid, food support, access to education, income generation aid, community- based sessions on HIV awareness, prevention education and reduction of stigma and discrimination. In Viet Nam, self-help groups provide four main areas of support: (i) counselling; (ii) care and treatment; (iii) social support (community mobilization for a more supportive environment); and (iv) economic support through income generation opportunities. Participation by PLHIV in a self-help group has been identified as an important mechanism in reducing stigma against women (Paxton, 2002), and improving household economic status (Nguyen et al, 2009; Oosterhoff, 2008). The data in Figure 89 show the percentage of PLHIV identifying with either having received a visit from a HBC team in the previous three months (Cambodia) or participating in a self-help group (Viet Nam).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32346c04-dba0-493b-9c95-b0e91a6c6b1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "32346c04-dba0-493b-9c95-b0e91a6c6b1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "efecba7ea52074615fbffe6e89256ece48cb619279e8b7605c2db6915ae3ce35"}, "2": {"node_id": "dcff8b49-89ed-4041-943e-f8acd741bc69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5185c596b5158c658b7b07c36e19530a1e0043b42a6dfa56bdd75a64d9f1a0cc"}}, "hash": "425338d6595fcd90b6aeb8ad3d0180d6a70f480b1c27a1d2b112707b1a044b8f", "text": "It should be noted that neither study is representative of participation levels within the country, as both relied upon those networks to identify PLHIV for the survey. 63 Knowledge and Awareness of HIV Increasing individuals\u2019 knowledge and awareness regarding HIV are critical in both reducing transmission and eliminating stigma and discrimination towards those affected by HIV.

Some of these differences may be due to how survey questions were asked \u2013 in Cambodia, respondents were not specifically asked if something was a form of prevention, but the respondents had to name as many options a possible, while in Indonesia, it is unclear how the question was asked.

Equally they point to the positive impact that targeted interventions, such as food support, government medical insurance and welfare programs can have on the health, nutrition, well-being and quality of life of HIV-affected households. Most importantly, they provide further empirical evidence of the effects of HIV on the household that can be used to better prioritize interventions in the region. The studies in all five countries were taken at different times of economic growth and prosperity, spanning from the growth of 2004 to the downturn at the end of the decade. Nonetheless, the studies show that HIV-affected households are disproportionately impacted, even in good times, and their extremely vulnerable state underscores the need for concerted action to mitigate the impact of the disease and to limit the risk of further impoverishment after having already liquated assets, depleted savings and utilized options for borrowing to cope with the loss of income due to illness. As the impacts of the global economic crisis continue to unfold, HIV-affected households have little cushion on which to rely and, in many cases, limited social security or protection. They are thus among the most vulnerable and need to be prioritized for social protection. While several countries have already scaled up social protection programmes for PLHIV since their studies were completed, continued evolution of those programmes is required to support the people, households and communities that are hardest hit by the economic crisis and the epidemic. The studies also point to the deleterious effect of HIV on the reduction of human capital not only due to death and morbidity of PLHIV but also due to reduced investment in the education of children. The policy conclusions of the report may be contextualised within three key policy dimensions. The dimensions reflect (1) the scope or range of services provided (2) the depth or level of interventions to address structural issues related to poverty, decline in human capital accumulation, and issues associated with knowledge, behaviour, stigma and discrimination, and (3) the breadth, or population coverage, of various interventions. The three dimensions can be visualized in the following cube (Figure 95), and recommendations are oriented toward each of these dimensions. FIGuRE 95 Dimensions of HIV Mitigation Strategies Source: Sanigest Internacional Recommended Changes in the Scope of Services: The need to explore changes in the scope of services provided to PLHIV and their families is highlighted in this section. Despite mounting challenges posed by the epidemic at the household level, the analysis point to a consistent set of interventions that could ameliorate the short and medium-term effects of the epidemic on PLHIV and HIV-affected households throughout Asia. Key policy recommendations include: 1. Strategically integrate HIV into relevant social protection schemes, making them \u201cHIV-sensitive\u201d. The study findings clearly articulate the importance of social protection for HIV- impacted households. However, HIV-related concerns are often not reflected in social protection schemes and therefore they may not reach those most needed. For example, pension schemes for widows have minimum age eligibilities, which can be above 40 or 50. Many women widowed by AIDS may not be able to access such schemes as they tend to be young. Under such circumstances, the age restriction can be relaxed to extend coverage to them. In the Indian state of Rajestan, a special provision was made for HIV widows where the minimum age eligibility for widow pension was lowered from 40 to 16, resulting in the additional coverage of 1000 HIV widows. HIV-sensitive social protection should be prioritised over HIV-exclusive social protection from equity and sustainability viewpoints. Maximize women\u2019s and widows\u2019 access to credit and income-generating opportunities and legal counselling by generating options for sustainable livelihoods, such as the provision of vocational skills, start up funds for micro-enterprise, partnerships with the private sector, and linkages with the market, as well as providing free legal counselling opportunities, among other initiatives. It is particularly important, in the context of targeted poverty reduction efforts, to focus on the most vulnerable groups. 2. Ensure PLHIV and their households have access to an increased continuum of care and related services - beyond just ART- to further reduce the catastrophic financial burden of HIV-related medical expenditure. The large impact of HIV- related expenses on the majority of the countries covered by this report points to the need for policies to continue increasing mechanisms that cover a full range of medicines, laboratory services, transport, nutrition and mental health services to ensure maximum results. This should include exploring policies to ban exclusion", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7eefb68e-556c-4543-9a79-ed457dc844cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "7eefb68e-556c-4543-9a79-ed457dc844cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6c0de219fb861835c72919ee6e126cfa9aa8fbdda844fc86c77a416ca7e17ee"}}, "hash": "d6c0de219fb861835c72919ee6e126cfa9aa8fbdda844fc86c77a416ca7e17ee", "text": "of PLHIV from health insurance as well as ways to link medical support for PLHIV to existing health insurance systems, or developing vouchers or other reimbursement schemes. 67 Conclusions and Policy Recommendations 3. Increase the role of PLHIV-supported services. The results from Viet Nam and Cambodia point to the important role self-help groups and home-based care teams can have on reducing the deleterious effects HIV has on PLHIV and their families\u2019 socio-economic conditions. Policies that provide increased support for such programs within all countries, and are integrated into the scaling up of national poverty reduction strategies are critical for cost-effectiveness. At the same time, introducing pro-poor targeting through conditional cash transfers, micro credit and other social protection programmes is required to support the people, households and communities who are hardest hit by the economic crisis and the HIV epidemic. 4. Increase efforts to target specific areas with low coverage, or effectiveness. For example, low levels of exclusive breastfeeding among HIV positive women highlight the need to ensure the changes in the ART and breastfeeding protocols are effectively implemented. Innovative solutions such as mobile health (m-health) technologies could be employed, as the studies showed that mobile phone penetration rates in Cambodia, China and Viet Nam were all over 70%, and recent studies show levels in India to be 68% in India for 2011 (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, 2011) and 69% in 2009 Indonesia (ITU, 2011). The use of m-health initiatives for increasing ART adherence in Kenya, for example, could be used with HIV-positive mothers in Asia (Lester et al, 2010). 5. Increase the use of m-health technologies and social media to better increase knowledge and awareness of HIV and HIV prevention measures, as well as reduce stigma and discrimination in the general population. The studies showed that knowledge of HIV was low in China (30% had not heard of HIV) and Indonesia (28%), knowledge of condom usage for HIV prevention low (20% of those in Indonesia who had heard of HIV did not know about condom use for HIV-prevention, and over 40% did not know in India) and knowledge of VCCT sites even lower (in China only 40% of those who had heard of HIV knew where to go for a test). Stigma and discriminatory practices against PLHIV and their families, and the negative socio-economic consequences, from poor school performance to reduced employment, were high in all countries. Policies should explore the use of social media and SMS texting to key populations, their clients and partners for cost-effective ways to increase knowledge of HIV, VCCT testing locations, and as a method for providing facts that will dispel commonly held misconceptions regarding and HIV and PLHIV. Recommended Changes in the Quality and Depth of Services: While it is clear that HIV-affected households are receiving beneficial support from government support programs in the region, study results should be used to look at levels and quality of support, and whether they should be increased, to cover households\u2019 broader needs. For example, despite the increased provision of food support to HIV-HHs in Cambodia and Viet Nam, their members were still more likely to have been hungry. Furthermore, because of HIV\u2019s impact on family structure (HIV- HHs were significantly more likely to be headed by a widow) the \u201cdepth\u201d of service should be carefully estimated to reflect specific household needs. The main recommendations in this area include: 1. Improve food support to the poorest HIV-affected households. The findings from Cambodia and Viet Nam demonstrate that despite receiving food support, HIV- HHs still face a hunger problem. Additionally, in Cambodia, China and Indonesia, HIV-HHs had significantly lower levels of protein within the household, indicating a food security issue beyond mere supply. Given the impact of food security on both education and health outcomes, increased food support that includes proteins to the poorest, HIV-affected households should be considered. 2. Strengthen mental health and psychosocial support services for PLHIV and their family members. PLHIV should be explicitly integrated into National Mental Health Strategic Plans. The study identified significant mental health issues among PLHIV, including widespread depression, anxiety and suicidal tendencies, as well as reduced quality of life, and pervasive stigma and discrimination at the community level. Inclusion of their family members is also important as they can also be subjected to psychologically and emotionally harmful experiences that require professional care. 3. Targeted interventions in health facilities to reduce stigma and discrimination against PLHIV. A key finding of the study was the high levels of PLHIV reporting stigma and discrimination within health facilities, and high levels of PLHIV who did not disclose their status within the health", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3de9b6c4-c236-4498-b3bf-e861115fcdb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "3de9b6c4-c236-4498-b3bf-e861115fcdb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b9a98ee443f90ab5e39fd093d114e4c4f18665bc4af7b73661768925ae8bb0a"}}, "hash": "8b9a98ee443f90ab5e39fd093d114e4c4f18665bc4af7b73661768925ae8bb0a", "text": "facilities. Policies should seek to change the attitudes of health workers, in order to avoid the dangerous consequences that result from the discriminatory practices (such as the low percentage of HIV-positive pregnant women in Indonesia who were aware of PMTCT mechanisms). 4. Strengthen legal empowerment measures for women living with and affected by HIV. Legal reforms should be stressed to improve women\u2019s equal rights to inheritance and property ownership, especially widows. These assets are critically needed, following the death of a spouse, to provide women and children with shelter and economic assets so they are better able to cope with the impact of the death of their family member. 5. Prioritize efforts to keep children from HIV-affected households in school, especially girls by targeting them in programmes such as conditional cash transfer and food for school. Additional interventions are needed to ensure that children from HIV-affected households receive the same level of education as children from non-affected households, and do not drop out in order to work or become caregivers. Conditional cash transfers and food for school programmes should be explored, specifically targeting girls, to ensure increased enrolment and retention rates for HIV-affected children, thereby reducing the negative impact on human capital accumulation. 6. Develop an HIV vulnerability index to improve targeting, and unify benefits available to HIV-affected households. Integrated specific parameters that emerge from the socio- economic study of PLHIV into the development of national social protection programmes. A number of developing countries have advanced towards the establishment of vulnerability indices to improve the transparency and effectiveness of social protection programs. Developing a unified index would facilitate work in many of the areas outlined in the policy recommendations. 68 Recommended Changes in the Breadth of Services: The following recommendations concerning service coverage are particularly important to reinforce the pursuit of significant reductions in HIV incidence and ensuring basic rights of all men, women and children, including the poorest and most vulnerable populations. 1. Build flexibility and quality into VCCT services and create demand for early testing as a cornerstone of efforts to reduce the incidence of HIV, especially among key populations, hard-to-reach and vulnerable populations. The study found low VCCT usage, especially among males, possibly due to the cost of testing and increased levels of stigma and discrimination. The results show that late testing and delayed diagnosis may be a contributing factor to impoverishment as individuals (a) must seek care before they are eligible for the publically funded programs targeting PLHIV (b) are likely to require more care after accessing public programs as they initially were not receiving adequate treatment for their HIV. 2. Continue efforts to expand universal access to quality ART coverage and support services so that PLHIV can remain productive members of the household economy. The results from Cambodia clearly show the positive economic impacts of expanding and successfully implementing universal access to ART coverage. Development of strategies that ensure implementation of such policies should be encouraged. 3. Carry out further in-depth studies that track the conditions of PLHIV and their households over time to improve targeting and enhance the measurement of results over time. By developing longitudinal studies which follow cohorts of households over extended periods of time, potentially using sentinel surveillance methods, policy makers can better understand the evolving dynamics of HIV on household socio-economic indicators, how household behaviour changes as the disease evolves, and the effect of existing and future policy and programmes on household outcomes. Finally, there were several issues that the study covered superficially due to either lack of data or lack of comparability between country studies. These areas should be considered for further research in the region. In this regard, two main issues appear to require additional research. First, the particular socio-economic situation of widows and orphans in HIV-affected households requires additional study. Second, the potential socio-economic and other benefits of introducing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs such as tenofovir or tenofovir/emtricitabine, which, when taken daily as preventive medicine by an unaffected partner, have been shown to reduce HIV transmission by 63-73% (UNAIDS, 2011b). Third, additional follow up should carefully monitor the shift from previous WHO policies on breastfeeding and ART to the new protocols to ensure minimum transition time. The capacity to respond to the challenges of HIV relies on our ability to describe and understand the implications of the epidemic at household and national levels and to develop support strategies that mitigate the effects on families and society. The five country studies analysed in the present report provide innovative insight into the lives of PLHIV and their family members and the effects of the epidemic on their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7a81cff-07e3-412d-bce3-71a68e5c12c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7a81cff-07e3-412d-bce3-71a68e5c12c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c3efacb1f787c0b934c05d72a5ffee614f1c76d911d10322c57068ccbe66eca5"}, "3": {"node_id": "adbae506-f37f-49e1-b497-4eeb3cc0fe7e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "766e478ca036c4cb0bf84a82c7f6ac518ad9cd5a2b16a7e54aaaff0c098e07da"}}, "hash": "76a3d92b595148fb68654bbbf542e7bdc35b8c7a0264ed0bc62805360e480b0e", "text": "socio-economic conditions.

Progress Report 2010. 72 Cambodia The study on the Socio-economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Cambodia (UN, 2010) aimed to detail the socio-economic impact of HIV at the household level in order to provide a basis from which to design mitigation strategies. The survey was administered between December 2009 and February 2010 by Sanigest Internacional and the Centre for Advanced Study (CAS), and included a total of 3,972 households. Methodology Details The study surveyed 2,623 households containing a person living with HIV and 1,349 control households, with more than 17,000 total individuals (11,566 within HIV-affected households and 6,129 in non-affected households).

Non-affected households were selected based on geographic proximity to HIV-affected households (in this case, the third house from every other HIV-affected household interviewed) in order to select households of similar socio-economic context within the community. Survey Design Sanigest Internacional, CAS and UNDP designed the household survey. The survey instrument was designed to focus on key socio- economic indicators and to ensure it would provide comparable data with other socio-economic surveys within the regional context (from India, China, Viet Nam and Indonesia). The initial piloting of the instrument occurred in urban areas of Phnom Penh, and was facilitated by an NGO working with low-income and HIV positive families in Boeung Kak and Borei Keila. Limitations While the robustness of the study design allows for substantial analysis of the data, it should be noted that there are a number of limitations to the study, including: (i) The population of PLHIV randomized for this study contained a higher proportion of women to men than previous data would predict: 71% of 2,623 PLHIV sampled for the survey were female.

However, it should be noted that due to the sensitive nature of the questions, it is likely that many individuals would not divulge that they identified with certain key population groups. China The Study on the Socio-Economic Impact of HIV/AIDS at the Individual and Household Level in China (UNDP, 2009a) aimed to quantify the impact of and response to HIV at the household and individual levels. The study was conducted from February through April 2008 by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Centre for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention (NCAIDS), and the Beijing Institute for Information and Control, and included a total of 1,926 households. Methodology Details Data were collected on both the household and individual levels in five high prevalence counties (Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hubei and Shanxi). All selected households were in poor rural areas. In Guangxi, Sichuan, Hubei, and Shanxi, where most of the PLHIV had not disclosed their HIV status, interviews were not carried out in the household. Enumerators and interviewees generally held the interview sessions at the CDC offices or at VCCT clinics. In Yunnan, the survey was conducted in the households, as most PLHIV had disclosed their HIV status. During household-based surveys, the interviewers could directly observe the impact of HIV on living conditions, household facilities, hygiene and other factors.

Other high-risk groups, such as commercial sex workers and men who have sex with men, as well as people living in urban areas were therefore under-represented. Of the 9,083 reported cases of PLHIV who were reachable in the selected counties in 2007, 11.3% (1,027 in 931 households) were selected for the survey. In total, 96 of the HIV-HHs were households in which both spouses were living with HIV. A total of 2,022 people were interviewed. The study employed a multistage, random sampling, in which five high prevalence provinces were identified in the first stage (Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hubei and Shanxi) from which three high prevalence counties were selected in the second stage. In the third stage, in each county, villages were arranged according to their distance from the county headquarters and were selected randomly. In the fourth stage, in each selected village, all the HIV/ AIDS households and control households were interviewed. The list of PLHIV maintained by the CDC served as the sampling frame. Selection of HIV-affected Households Sample households were selected by using a combination of multi-stage and systematic sampling methods. In cooperation with local health departments and organizations, the field survey was conducted in the five high prevalence provinces of China as mentioned above. The survey included 931 HIV- 74 affected households (1027 PLHIV; 654 males and 373 females) and 995 non-affected households (472 males and 523 females). The research methods included quantitative and qualitative analyses, questionnaire surveys, focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and case studies. Selection of Non-affected Households Two methods were used to select the non-affected households. In Yunnan, where PLHIV were interviewed in their homes, investigators moved clockwise (i.e. east) and selected non- affected neighbours whose sex and age were similar (less than five years\u2019 difference) to the HIV-HH. In counties where PLHIV were interviewed outside the home, investigators identified NA-HHs from the PLHIV\u2019s community whose sex and age were similar (less than 5 years\u2019 difference) to the HIV-HH.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20d849fc-02a4-41f2-a84c-211f9ff3b77b": {"__data__": {"id_": "20d849fc-02a4-41f2-a84c-211f9ff3b77b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b702cd00b1f2c5251e5f52c818145e5d2553664b68880dbdf4fe44db5d6a143f"}, "2": {"node_id": "470ad4c0-c89b-42db-80b6-1cde16240a29", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e397745939c34e8a1f6675abc89f41606b0b751ceca0b9141e36cbca9f5b06ea"}}, "hash": "eda29d557a42f2d1a1677631179afd8384640b1a43bd4a25b64e663c56e21c1d", "text": "Selection of PLHIV for Case Studies As part of the survey, researchers conducted in-depth interviews with some respondents to further investigate the impact of HIV.

India The study on the Socio-Economic Impact of HIV and AIDS in India (UNDP, 2006) aimed to determine the impact of HIV at the household level with a focus on the relationship between, and distribution of, income and wealth, and changes in the structure of employment and social security. The study on the Socio- Economic Impact of HIV and AIDS in India was conducted by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) with the sponsorship of UNDP and National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) from October 2004 through May 2005, and included 8,292 households in total. Methodology Details Data were collected at both the household and individual levels in six high prevalence states (Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur, and Nagaland). Provinces with the highest HIV prevalence were selected based on the Sentinel Surveillance of the respective State AIDS Control Societies (SACS). Five to seven districts in each state were identified from which to sample the households. The capital of each state was selected, and other districts were chosen based on their prevalence and distribution of PLHIV. Higher prevalence districts were chosen to save time and money. The table below shows the selected states and districts.

Sampling consisted of two primary sampling units: \u2022\ufffd HIV-HH \u2022\ufffd NA-HH Due to confidentiality, a list of PLHIV was not available from which to draw a sample of HIV-HHs. Some HIV-HHs were interviewed in their homes while others were interviewed at alternative locations, such as Voluntary Counselling and Testing Centres (VCTCs). A total of 2,068 HIV-HH and 6,224 NA-HH were surveyed, including 2,386 PLHIV.

Survey Design Quantitative data were collected through household surveys using structured interviews. The survey instruments were developed by NCAER, UNDP and the National AIDS Control Organisation. Qualitative data were collected through case studies and focus group discussions. Enumerators interviewed PLHIV with semi-structured in-depth interviews designed to allow respondents to speak openly about issues. A total of six focus group discussions were conducted as part of this study \u2013 one in each state. Participants were selected through the networks of people living with HIV, and discussion encompassed the social and economic problems faced by network members, as well as the legal and other issues. All qualitative data is meant to support the household survey. Limitations Difficulty in obtaining a list of PLHIV from which to create a sampling frame was the fundamental weakness of this study. Other limitations are as follows: (i) Non-probability sampling of HIV-HHs does not allow for statistical inferences on population parameters or other estimates. (ii) HIV-HHs were oversampled in urban areas to achieve cost- effectiveness, which can be a possible source of selection bias. (iii) Since PLHIV were recruited through public health facilities, investigators were not able to sample many middle and upper class HIV-HHs since these facilities typically cater to low-income people. (iv) The study was conducted six months after the government began to provide ART services. The data should therefore be interpreted as a baseline for that point in time, and not representative of the current situation in India. Indonesia The study on the Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Individual and Household Levels in Indonesia (UNDP, 2011) aimed to describe the impact of HIV on the socio-economic condition of PLHIV and their households in Indonesia. The study was conducted from April through May 2009 by the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) and UNDP in collaboration with the Indonesian Network of People Living with HIV (JOTHI) and included a total of 2,038 households. Methodology Details Data were collected at both the household and the individual level in two low prevalence provinces (West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara) and five high prevalence provinces (DKI Jakarta, East Java, Bali, and Papua). With the exception of DKI Jakarta, East Java and Papua, data were collected only in the provincial capitals.

The research team searched for NA-HHs immediately following visits to selected HIV-HHs by observing neighbouring households. Households deemed most similar to the HIV-HH in terms of comparative indicators, including the condition of the homes, were selected as control households. Selection of PLHIV for in-depth interviews Each enumerator was required to conduct at least four in-depth interviews. PLHIV were selected from interviewed HIV-HHs. Interviewers chose their own respondents. However, workers were asked to choose participants based on (1) complexity of their problems; and (2) composition of respondents by sex and high risk groups. An enumerator assessed a respondent\u2019s suitability for an in-depth interview immediately after administration of the HIV module questionnaire. Selected PLHIV then continued with the in- depth interview. Survey Design Quantitative data were collected through household surveys. The survey consisted of the two parts, and additional qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews and focus groups. The focus group discussions involved informal discussions with community leaders, members of NGOs, PLHIV groups, officials of government agencies associated with HIV prevention, and other stakeholders. Discussions focused on factors relating to the socio- economic impact of HIV at the household level, including access to health services, stigma and discrimination. BPS and JOTHI jointly designed the survey instruments. The questionnaires were then field tested in Bandung City and West Java Province. Collaboration between BPS and JOTHI continued through the finalization of the questionnaires. Limitations The primary limitation of this study revolved around the difficulties in obtaining a list of PLHIV from which to create a sampling frame. Other limitations included: (i) Non-probability sampling does not allow for statistical inferences on population parameters or other estimates. (ii) The identification of HIV-HHs through the JOTHI network created a study population that consisted of a greater percentage of HIV-HHs involved in HIV activism than would normally be reflected in the Indonesian population. This is a possible source of selection bias. (ii) By selecting PLHIV with \u201ccomplex problems\u201d and association with high risk groups, the data collected through the in-depth interviews may not be representative of the challenges faced by the typical PLHIV in Indonesia. Viet Nam The study on the Socio-economic Impact of HIV and AIDS on Household Vulnerability and Poverty in Viet Nam aimed to assess the socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS on households. The study also provides recommendations on how the country should mitigate the impact of HIV at the household level through lessons learned, international best practices, and identifying areas for further research. The study was conducted from November through December 2008 by Strategic Consulting Company in consortium with Medical Committee Netherlands - Viet Nam, and included a total of 904 households. Methodology Details Data were collected at both the household and individual levels in six high prevalence provinces (Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Hanoi, Quangninh, Langson, Caobang and Angiang).

Selection of HIV-affected Households While a list of PLHIV was available at health facilities, the research team did not use the list as a sampling frame due to confidentiality issues. As a result, the study is based on a non-probability sample. The field investigators working with the Viet Nam PLHIV Network and volunteers worked with self-help groups to identify PLHIV. Peer groups referred subjects known to be HIV positive. Willing participants were asked to take part in the study. Field investigators attempted to include PLHIV at differing stages of infection, as well as match the nationwide 2:1 male to female ratio among PLHIV. Each HIV-HH was limited to two adult PLHIV informants. Selection of Non-affected Households For every HIV-affected household selected, one non-affected household was selected as a control - usually the closest neighbour of the HIV-affected household. This method attempted to pair houses with similar characteristics, other than the HIV status of household members. Staff at the commune health station or at the Women\u2019s Union at commune level helped to identify households that had similar economic and social status (type/quality of accommodation and number of family members) to the HIV-HH. Heads of non-affected households were restricted to adults aged 20-60 years. Selection of PLHIV for In-depth Interviews A total of 36 in-depth interviews were completed nationwide \u2013 a total of six per province (one male, one female, and one head of household interview in both rural and urban areas in each province). Semi-structured interviews covered all major themes within the household questionnaire, while allowing for new themes to emerge, based on researcher and/or interviewee input. Survey Design Quantitative data were collected through household surveys. Focus group discussions were conducted at national and provincial level. These involved stakeholders in HIV prevention, treatment, care and support, including service providers, program managers, communities and mass organizations, PLHIV, (I)NGO, activists, researchers, and members of the HIV Technical Working Group. The research tools included structured questionnaires for HIV-affected and non-affected households, and guidelines for in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The household survey instrument was adapted from the survey used in the 2005 study with additional inputs from the questionnaires used in the China and India UNDP HIV studies. The questionnaire was drafted in English, translated into Vietnamese, and piloted for cultural appropriateness. Limitations As in other countries, difficulties in obtaining a list of PLHIV from which to create a sampling frame was the primary weakness of this study. Other limitations are as follows: (i) Non-probability sampling does not allow for statistical inferences on population parameters or other estimates. (ii) Households containing family members who had pneumonia or TB were excluded from NA-HH eligibility. This is a potential source of selection bias. (iii) By selecting PLHIV with \u201ccomplex problems\u201d and association with high risk groups, the data collected through the in- depth interviews is not likely to be representative of the challenges faced by the typical PLHIV in Indonesia.

Critically, attention must be drawn to the hard work of the national research teams in Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam which collected the data, provided data analysis and wrote the individual country reports that this sex-disaggregated regional analysis is based on. iii Foreword Discussion regarding the vulnerability of women and girls to HIV in Asia and the Pacific is too often grounded in ideologies, as well as too often based on weak or biased analysis of available data. However, we do know that HIV among women and girls has seemingly reached a plateau of approximately 35% of all people living with HIV or AIDS for the region as a whole; with some countries experiencing significant percentages of their new cases among women whose only risk factor is being the spouse or girlfriend of a man who engages in high-risk behavior (injecting drug use and/or multiple concurrent sexual partnerships without correct and consistent condom use with sex workers and/or with other men). Equally revealing is the disproportionate social and economic impacts of the epidemic on women and girls. This manifests in the form of a range of socio-economic burdens on women and girls within HIV-affected households and their constrained access to services. The socio-economic impact studies conducted by UNDP between 2005 and 2010 in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, India and Viet Nam provide considerable empirical evidence that opens a window into the actual and relevant HIV challenges that women and girls face. Until now, the attempts to measure the specific impact of HIV on women and girls, and use this information to formulate policies and programmes for impact mitigation, have been very limited in Asia and the Pacific. To address this gap, the HIV, Health and Development Practice Team of UNDP\u2019s Asia Pacific Regional Centre has undertaken a regional analysis of the socio-economic impact of HIV on women and girls at the household level using the sex-disaggregated data from the national studies. This report presents in detail the findings and recommendations of this analysis. The report outlines the specific impacts that women and girls face on a daily basis that range from employment and household burden to discrimination and access to treatment. By comparing across countries in the region, and across HIV-affected and non-affected households, the analysis provides unique insights into the dynamics of the epidemic and improved understanding of the specific impact HIV has on women and girls. It highlights the many differences between countries in the region, but also the numerous similarities, and therefore how they might learn from one another. I hope the findings and recommendations of this report will help governments and other stakeholders in strengthening policies and programmes to address the disproportionate social and economic impact of HIV on women and girls in our region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba66051d-9003-494f-ab34-9258fa60756b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba66051d-9003-494f-ab34-9258fa60756b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis of the Impact on Women and Girls", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a3ad424fd885c04afefe557d1a381bc63e9ff852181ed020bbf3efa94848d71"}, "2": {"node_id": "49a39482-4a69-4fa4-8fe8-2dbbeada262f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93adb5b249934ebd7192386ae4b1540dd82ae67480f0e57b9349aa9b9daf4d9a"}}, "hash": "b3d526f4dc2e62545f7c6d98363971f3736dd2cf689bb69761f54eafc4462b3f", "text": "Clifton Cortez Practice Leader HIV, Health and Development UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre v Contents List of Figures and Tables vii Acronyms and Abbreviations viii Executive Summary 1 1.

Over the past several years, governments in Asia have made important advances in the introduction of new policies and programmes aimed at mitigating the socio-economic impact of HIV on individuals living with HIV and their households. Despite these advances, there have only been limited attempts to measure the specific impact of HIV on women and girls and use this information for evidence-based policy interventions. An important element of the socio-economic impact of HIV is how it disproportionately affects women and girls, in terms of their vulnerability to infection, constrained access to services and the additional household burden and care responsibility among others. The attempts to measure the specific impact of HIV on women and girls, and use this information to sharpen the policies that are developed to address the epidemic, particularly impact mitigation, have been very limited in Asia. This analysis of the socio-economic impact of HIV in selected countries in Asia was prompted by the need to address this information gap and to determine the potential impact of the region\u2019s HIV epidemic through better understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic at the individual and household levels. Improved understanding of the epidemic \u2013 of how it is experienced by women and girls at the individual and household levels \u2013 will support the development of targeted, evidence-informed impact mitigation policies and programs. The report utilises data from five country reports (Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam) covering more than 72,000 household members in over 17,000 households. The analyses focus on comparisons between HIV-affected and non-affected households for impacts on women and girls regarding key socio- economic issues: income, employment, revenues, expenditures, coping mechanisms, health, education, food security, family composition, pregnancy and stigma and discrimination. At the level of the dimensions of analysis, the study highlights: country differences; HIV-affected versus non-affected households; people living with HIV (PLHIV) versus non-PLHIV; women (and girls) versus men (and boys); urban versus rural household location; and Quintile of consumption (poorest versus richest). New data analyses were conducted on the survey databases from Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam, while secondary data analyses were conducted for China and India, using previously published reports. Each country study, and thus this analysis, had limitations due to differences in methodology, timing and execution of each survey. The report has five chapters, beginning with an introduction and overview of HIV in the region. \u2022\ufffd Chapter Two covers the methodology and data analysis used within this regional analysis. \u2022\ufffd Chapter Three details the key findings of the report, viz. the impact of HIV on women and girls in key socio-economic areas: employment; coping mechanisms, including migration, asset liquidation, and debt; education and human capital accumulation for children in HIV-affected households; health factors including utilisation of services, antiretroviral therapy (ART) utilisation by PLHIV, and transmission and diagnosis; knowledge and awareness of HIV; food support; stigma and discrimination; pregnancy; widow property rights and intimate partner transmission. \u2022\ufffd Chapter Four outlines recommendations based on this report\u2019s results. \u2022\ufffd The final chapter contains a list of references used throughout the report. Key Findings HIV contributes to significant gender differences in asset accumulation. \u2022\ufffd Female-headed (non-widowed) HIV-HHs in Cambodia and Indonesia were less likely to own their home than male- headed (non-widowed) HIV-HHs. They were also less likely to own a motor-vehicle, and in Indonesia, less likely to own a non-motor vehicle. \u2022\ufffd Female-headed HIV-HHs in Indonesia were more likely to be in debt than male-headed HIV-HHs. \u2022\ufffd The majority of female widows in HIV-HHs in Indonesia and Viet Nam reported being denied a share in their deceased husband\u2019s property and assets. In India, the overwhelming majority (79%) of widows living with HIV were denied such rights. Girls and female PLHIV were more likely to be employed, and girls in HIV-HHs are less likely to attend school, thereby pointing to the reduction in human capital accumulation among women and contributing to a growing divide.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f28e6ef-00fc-4d8a-a1eb-8dbdd34fc17a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f28e6ef-00fc-4d8a-a1eb-8dbdd34fc17a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis of the Impact on Women and Girls", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8fd88cc4ffd6e7bf2a173818991015ab0a57499b459b3c0135de5c21398b88c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "0de32b93-3cfa-49d6-864f-7b67468c1b0a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19f9de4a0c5b14f4655c63e8568e12ed2b8b003478de17fce1c6c9ad5ddf75f2"}}, "hash": "5e65a9a9c268e4abef6595d42f28c88d5b72d8329eb8a917726422d859f2180c", "text": "\u2022\ufffd Male PLHIV in Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Viet Nam had lower employment levels than males in non-affected households (NA-HHs), but female PLHIV in Cambodia and Indonesia were more likely to be employed then females in NA-HHs.

However, boys in HIV-HHs in Viet Nam were more likely than girls to be involved in child labour. \u2022\ufffd Across the region, girls in HIV-HHs were the least likely to be attending school, and the most likely to have dropped-out. HIV has important effects on households, ranging from migration to increased incidence of disease, lower self-esteem and greater discrimination. \u2022\ufffd Cambodia, male-headed HIV-HHs were more likely to have migrated, but in Indonesia, female-headed HIV-HHs were more likely to have migrated, and female-widow-headed (38%) were even more likely than widower headed (20%). \u2022\ufffd In India, female PLHIV were more likely than male PLHIV to report having been sick, but not having sought care. They were also more likely than males to state the reason for not having sought care was due to financial reasons. 2 \u2022\ufffd In both Cambodia and India, female PLHIV were more likely to have been diagnosed through voluntary confidential counselling and testing (VCCT) than males. This may reflect the higher numbers of females who reported their transmission was from their partners, and therefore were told to go for testing. In all countries, females were much more likely than males to report their transmission was through heterosexual sex with their intimate partner. \u2022\ufffd Female PLHIV in Cambodia and Viet Nam were more likely to report having low self-esteem and more likely to have had suicidal thoughts than male PLHIV. \u2022\ufffd In most countries, female PLHIV were more likely to have immediately disclosed their status to their spouse or intimate partner than male PLHIV. However, this may be partially reflective of the high male to female intimate partner transmission rate. \u2022\ufffd Female PLHIV reported either higher or the same levels of spousal support upon initial disclosure of status. However, at the time of the survey female PLHIV were either equally likely or less likely to report a supportive spouse. \u2022\ufffd Responses from NA-HHs in China and India showed high levels of discriminatory attitudes towards PLHIV and their families. In India, more women held discriminatory attitudes than males, while the reverse was true in China. \u2022\ufffd In general, female PLHIV were more likely than male PLHIV to have been discriminated against: in Viet Nam they were more likely to have reported discrimination in health facilities and rights abuses; in Indonesia and Viet Nam they were more likely to have reported social isolation and neglect in their communities; in Cambodia female PLHIV were more likely to have reported verbal abuse, physical harassment and physical abuse. Knowledge and access for women is lower across the region, pointing to the need to improve mechanisms to divulge best practices and to actively target women for prevention activities. \u2022\ufffd Women in Viet Nam had relatively low levels of knowledge about mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV and in Indonesia and Viet Nam, low levels of prevention of mother- to-child transmission (PMTCT). In Indonesia, less than two- thirds of pregnant HIV-positive women told their health provider of their status. \u2022\ufffd In both Cambodia and Indonesia, the levels of HIV-positive women who were on ART and who breastfed their babies were lower than recommended. \u2022\ufffd In Cambodia, India and Indonesia, women were less likely to have knowledge of condoms for HIV prevention. It should be noted that in conducting this analysis, it became clear that there are still a number of areas which require further research in the region, including studies on the dynamics of the specific issues facing widows and the children orphaned by AIDS, who are most affected by HIV; how best the negative impacts on girls can be addressed, as they are clearly most likely to have reduced educational opportunities and increased presence in the labour market; and the social conditions that have led to the increase in intimate-partner transmission throughout the region. However, with the caveat on future research, this study is a valuable tool in its regional analysis of the impacts of HIV on women and girls across Asia.

Improved understanding of the epidemic \u2013 particularly of how it is experienced by women and girls \u2013 will support the development of targeted, evidence- informed impact mitigation policies and programs. Over the last six years, independent studies, commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with national institutions, were conducted in five countries within the region: Cambodia (2010), China (2009), India (2006), Indonesia (2010) and Viet Nam (2009). The studies all involved surveys of HIV- affected households (HIV-HHs) and non-affected households (NA- HHs) and examined a variety of socio-economic issues: income, employment, revenues, expenditures, coping mechanisms, health, education, food security, family composition, gender considerations and stigma and discrimination. While the survey instruments used in the various studies were adapted to meet the specific needs and circumstances of each country, they followed a broad common methodology that allowed for inter-country comparisons. Using the data provided by those studies, this report seeks to analyse the socio-economic impact of the HIV on women and girls in Asia and offers policy recommendations for impact mitigation. Overall, gender inequality remains an issue in the countries featured in this report. In Cambodia, the adult literacy rate for women is 64% compared to 85% for men (United Nations, 2011). In India, the difference is even greater (48% versus 74%). In China, the under-five mortality rate for girls (2000-2005) is 38 deaths per 1000 live births, compared to 27 for boys. In Viet Nam, the percentage of underweight girls is 35%, compared to 31% for boys. It is presumed that the presence of HIV will even further impact these and other inequalities, but the question is, to what extent? Due to the increasing proportion of women living with HIV in the region (35% in 2011, up from 21% in 1990), it is critical to attain a better understanding of the specific issues affecting women and girls in HIV-affected households (UNAIDS, 2011). The report has five chapters, beginning with an introduction and overview of HIV in the region. Chapter Two covers the methodology and data analysis used within this regional analysis. The third chapter details the key findings of the report, including the impact of HIV on women and girls in key socio-economic areas: employment; coping mechanisms, including migration, asset liquidation, and debt; education and human capital accumulation for children in HIV-affected households; health factors including utilisation of services, antiretroviral therapy (ART) utilisation by people living with HIV (PLHIV), and transmission and diagnosis; food support; stigma and discrimination; pregnancy; widow property rights; intimate partner transmission and knowledge and awareness of HIV. Chapter Four outlines recommendations based on this report\u2019s results. The final chapter contains a list of references used throughout the report. There is an Annex which contains summaries of the methodologies used in the individual country studies. 1.2 Overview of HIV in Asia Globally, in 2009, 33.3 million people were estimated to be living with HIV. In the same year, 1.8 million people died from the disease \u2013 almost 260,000 of them children, and HIV was identified as the leading cause of death and disease among women 15-49 years of age (UNAIDS and WHO, 2009). Regionally, Asia accounted for the second highest number of worldwide AIDS-related deaths (300,000), the second highest number of new infections (360,000) and the second highest number of PLHIV (4.9 million)(UNAIDS, 2010b)1. It is calculated that in Asia, HIV will cause a total loss of 180 million years of healthy and productive life between 2002 and 2020, a number higher than that of any other disease (Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008). For the most part, the countries featured in this report have concentrated HIV epidemics, with adult prevalence below 1% in the general population, but significantly higher HIV prevalence among key populations2 such as people who inject drugs (PWID), female sex workers (FSWs), and men who have sex with men (MSM). In four of the five countries featured in this report, HIV prevalence has declined or remained steady over the last five years.

However, in Indonesia, prevalence has increased, and certain parts of the country are experiencing a generalized epidemic. The report focuses on impacts on employment; coping mechanisms such as debt, asset liquidation and migration; educational impacts; health utilisation; knowledge and awareness regarding HIV; food security; stigma and discrimination; pregnancy; intimate partner transmission; widowhood; and policy recommendations. 5 Introduction Public expenditure on AIDS response Government revenue DIPI = \u00d7 National population PLHIV A higher DIPI figure usually means a higher priority, with the global mean value of 0.35. A comparison of their DIPI and other basic indicators for the included countries is shown above in Table 1. The percentage of PLHIV who are women, ranges from a high of 56% in Cambodia (35,000 of 63,000 PLHIV) to a low of 28% in Indonesia (88,000 of 310,000 PLHIV). The table also displays that the percentage of PLHIV receiving ART generally mirrors the percentage of female PLHIV, from a high of 52% in Cambodia to a low of 25% in Indonesia. The size of the countries varies from the two largest in the world - China and India - with over a billion people each, to Cambodia with less than 15 million people. The smallest of the countries is also the poorest - Cambodia is considered a low-income country by the World Bank, while the others are considered lower middle- income countries. The prevalence ranges, low overall, range from a high of 0.5% in Cambodia to a low of 0.1% in China. However, due to China and India\u2019s large populations, the estimated number of PLHIV is still very high in those countries \u2013 almost 2.5 million in India and 750,000 in China. As discussed earlier, the ART coverage rates in the countries, also varies significantly, from the high of 94% in Cambodia, to a low of 21% in Indonesia, using the WHO 2010 guidelines. Finally, the level of VCCT centres throughout the countries ranges from a high of 2.9 / 100,000 population in Cambodia to a low of 0.2 in Viet Nam. The percentage of pregnant women who received an HIV test in East, South and South East Asia increased from 2% in 2005 to 17% in 2009, but is still much lower than the 26% 2009 global average for low and middle-income countries (WHO, 2010). 1.3 Overview of HIV and Women in Cambodia More than 35,000 women are currently living with HIV in Cambodia. While national HIV prevalence is relatively low (calculated at 0.9% in 2006 and estimated at 0.5% in 2011 by UNAIDS), prevalence is still unacceptably high in certain female sub-populations, such as female sex workers (14.7% in 2006) and indirect female sex workers (9.4% in 2006) (NCHADS, 2007; NAA, 2010). Heterosexual transmission outside of brothels continues to be a problem, and while the actual number of women living with HIV is decreasing, women comprise an increasing proportion of all people living with HIV. In 1997, only 37% of all people living with HIV were women. However, the Asian Epidemic Model projects that, by 2012, 52% of all people living with HIV in Cambodia will be women. Conversely, by 2012, it is projected that women will only account for 43% of new infections, down from 53% in 2006.

HIV is still largely localised within specific key populations and within specific regions. However, as in Cambodia, intimate partner transmission has become an increasing problem, as the percentage of intimate partner transmissions increased from 6% in 2005 to 12% in 2009. Overall, 30% of all reported HIV cases are female. (Ministry of Health of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2010) Since 2003, with the implementation of the \u201cFour Frees and One Care\u201d policy, China has considerably stepped up its HIV prevention and treatment. The new policy provided for free ART to rural PLHIV or low income urban PLHIV, free VCCT, free PMTCT to pregnant HIV-positive women, free schooling to children orphaned by HIV and economic assistance to the households of PLHIV through the Minimum Living Standard Allowance. However, these programs are not yet functioning as desired. For example, according to WHO, in 2009, of the estimated 2,000 \u2013 11,000 women who were pregnant and in need of ART for PMTCT only 1,554 of them received the therapy (between 14-59%) (WHO, 2010). However, it should be noted that according to the 2010 UNGASS report, 75% of HIV-positive pregnant women received ART (Ministry of Health of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2010). A step-up in PMTCT was outlined in the 2008 \u201cPrevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission Work Implementation Procedures\u201d, and coverage increased from 271 counties in 2007 to almost twice that number (453) in 2009.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29aef690-e0fc-4fa1-8861-2f9fc5677765": {"__data__": {"id_": "29aef690-e0fc-4fa1-8861-2f9fc5677765", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis of the Impact on Women and Girls", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2de57fa8fa37f9b702b13d1118cc2c6c47db4db876894f9d95a76cd8ecd43d4"}, "2": {"node_id": "45d4af79-5ffa-4a17-9eb5-1c392318770b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebb23034ec03a678815ccb48b7f39a7dccfdd3142f3cab7157d23b52202a9391"}}, "hash": "7d3b13a027558111f3a26cd31aa8327f91254f0f99ee04dd702a0b71e6be679d", "text": "As a result, the number of pregnant women screened for HIV doubled from just less than two million in 2007 to over four million in 2009 (Ministry of Health of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2010). Finally, stigma and discrimination towards PLHIV have been documented as a large problem within China, with a 2008 survey of 6,000 people living in six Chinese cities revealing that 41% of respondents were unwilling to work in the same place as a PLHIV, 48% were unwilling to eat food in the same place as a PLHIV, and 64% were unwilling to receive services from a PLHIV. Additionally, the 2009 China Stigma Index survey found HIV positive women in China face additional pressure: 12% of those who reported being pregnant stated that they had been pressured into terminating pregnancy by health facility staff. 1.5 Overview of HIV and Women in India As with China, India has a relatively low adult HIV prevalence of 0.3%. Yet due to its large population, over 2.4 million Indians, 880,000 of them women, are estimated to be living with HIV - the third largest number in the world, after South Africa and Nigeria (NACO, 2010). Nationally, heterosexual sex is the main form of transmission (87%), followed by mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) (5%), homosexual transmission and transmission through injecting drug use (IDU) (both 2%) and blood transfusions (1%). FSW are a key population in India, as over 2% of adult males in 2006 reported they had paid for sex in the previous year.

There are currently eight districts where FSW have a prevalence greater than 15%, and even in generally low prevalence states, there are 15 districts where the prevalence is over 5%. Overall, 39% of PLHIV in India are female, and of them, 90% are estimated to have acquired the infection from their husband or partner. Since 2002, India\u2019s policy framework has focused on (i) prevention (67% of budget) (ii) provision of care and support to PLHIV (17% of budget) (iii) strengthening infrastructure, and human resources for programmes (8%) and (iv) strengthening the nationwide information management system (3%). Under the Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission, there has been an increase in the number of pregnant women tested for HIV from 3 million in 2007 to 5.5 million in 2009. However, only 20% of an estimated 27 million pregnancies were tested in 2009, and only 30% of an estimated 65,000 HIV positive pregnant women were identified. As such, only approximately 17% of pregnant HIV positive women received ART in 2009. This is partially due to the large percentage of women not attending a facility for their birth (60% of babies are not born in a health institution), so community based HIV screening for women who do not attend an antenatal clinic is scheduled to begin in the future. 1.6 Overview of HIV and Women in Indonesia Indonesia a growing HIV epidemic, with the number of reported cases rising from less than 3,000 in 2004 to 20,000 in 2009, and the estimated number of adult PLHIV almost doubling from 170,000 in 2005 to more than 300,000 in 2009, of which 88,000 are women. The epidemic has also spread regionally, from reports of HIV in only 16 provinces in 2004 to 32 of the 33 provinces in 2009. HIV is still largely concentrated within key populations, with the 2007 IBBS survey (IBBS 2007) reporting HIV prevalences of 10% among direct sex workers, 5% among indirect sex workers, and 24% among transgenders. These figures are in comparison to the national HIV prevalence of around 0.2%. In 2009, females represented 25% of all PLHIV, up from 21% in 2006, indicating increasing vulnerability. The Asia Epidemic Model forecasts a rapid increase - almost a doubling - in the prevalence of HIV in Indonesia to 0.4% in 2014, tied to an increase in new infections, particularly among women, children, MSM, and intimate partners of PLHIV. 1.7 Overview of HIV and Women in Viet Nam The prevalence of HIV in Viet Nam was estimated to be 0.4% in 2009 - the second highest of the countries featured in this study (Ministry of Health, 2009a). Females account for less than a third of all PLHIV, but still count at more than 81,000. Like other countries in the region, Viet Nam\u2019s HIV epidemic is largely concentrated within key sub-populations. The 2009 HIV prevalence for FSWs was 9%, ranging from <1% to 23% by region. (Viet Nam Administration of AIDS Control, 2009). Viet Nam\u2019s current HIV strategy calls for harm reduction interventions to reduce HIV transmission through behaviour change within key populations, and includes a Needle and Syringe Program (NSP), Condom Use Program (CUP) and opioid substitution therapy (Methadone Maintenance Therapy, MMT). In 2009, 57 provinces dispensed 24.8 million condoms free of charge, and 78% of FSWs reported they used a condom with their most recent client (Ministry of Health, 2009b). There are currently 223 facilities providing PMTCT services in Viet Nam (96 are comprehensive), up from 107 facilities in 2006. However, in 2009 only 25% of pregnant women were tested for HIV, and only an estimated 32% of HIV-positive pregnant women received ART to reduce the risk of MTCT, although this is a substantial increase from 14% in 2006. 8 This analysis is based on studies undertaken by UNDP to assess the socio-economic impact of HIV at the household level in five Asian countries, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam3, and additional sources of information4.

In general, demographically the studies had fairly similar overall populations, although there were some differences. Household size varied by country and HIV status from the smallest with an average size of 3.4 members in NA-HHs of Indonesia to the largest of 4.6 members in Cambodia. Households also varied by their urban and rural locations. There were similar ratios of the sexes found throughout the household members, but varied for PLHIV. Table 2 summarizes the number of households and household members included in each study, as well as the year the study was conducted. Detailed tables of sample profiles by country are available in Annex I. 2.2 Data Analysis The analyses presented in this report followed two main methodologies: (1) Utilisation of data from published reports on China and India; (2) New analysis of databases from Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam. New analyses were not conducted for the China and India studies due to confidentiality considerations restricting access to the databases. Instead, regionally comparable statistics were gathered from the published country reports. For the three countries where new analyses were conducted, the original databases were recoded, cleaned and new categorical variables created to increase comparability between the countries. All analyses were conducted in STATA and SPSS. Specific analyses were restricted to certain populations (for example, based on age, marital status, HIV-status) as outlined in the detailed results sections. For Indonesia and Viet Nam, which included data on household members who had passed away in the previous year, deceased members were removed from the databases. Chapter Summary This report utilises data from five country socio-economic impact studies (Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam) covering more than 72,000 household members in over 17,000 households; Analyses focus on comparisons between HIV-affected and non-affected households for impacts on women and girls regarding key socio-economic issues: income, employment, revenues, expenditures, coping mechanisms, health, education, food security, family composition, pregnancy and stigma and discrimination; This study included the following main dimensions of analysis: country; HIV-affected versus non-affected households; PLHIV versus non-PLHIV; men (and boys) versus women (and girls); urban versus rural household location; and quintile of consumption (poorest versus richest); New data analyses were conducted on the survey databases from Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam; Secondary data analyses were conducted for China and India, using previously published reports;

(ii) Because of the local adaptation of the methodology and questionnaire, there are some limitations on the availability of comparable indicators across all countries. (iii) Non-probability sampling in Viet Nam, India, Indonesia, and China data does not allow for statistical inferences on population parameters or other estimates. In addition, since this Asia Regional Analysis depends on the individual country studies and data, the limitations of the individuals studies, outlined in Annex I, contribute to the limitations of this study.

This provides a guideline for the comparability and interpretation of results with regard to HIV- affected and non-affected households throughout the region, and insight into how differences in the household gender ratio may partially explain differences in socio-economic impacts. Figure 1 shows that, in the four countries for which data was analysed, there were only small differences in the average ratio of males to females within the households. However, females were more likely to be the head of household in HIV-affected households, than in non-affected households (data available for Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam). As discussed in more detail in the section on widowship, this is likely due to the large number of widowed females in the HIV-affected households. The largest difference was seen in Cambodia where only 47% of heads of households (HoHs) were male in HIV-HHs, compared to 65% in NA-HHs. In Indonesia, it was 76% and 85% and in Viet Nam it was 52% and 59%, respectively. Given the difference in the income- earning potential between the sexes, and that many of those Chapter Summary Household compositions for the sexes were found to be between 46% male in HIV-HHs in Cambodia to 53% in HIV-HHs in Indonesia. Levels varied more for PLHIV (29% males in Cambodia to 70% males in Indonesia).

In all countries, females were much more likely than males to report their transmission was through heterosexual sex with their intimate partner. In Cambodia, India and Indonesia, females were less likely to have knowledge of condoms for HIV prevention. Female PLHIV in Cambodia and Viet Nam were more likely to report having low self-esteem and more likely to have had suicidal thoughts than male PLHIV. In most countries, female PLHIV were more likely to have immediately disclosed their status to their spouse or intimate partner than male PLHIV. Female PLHIV reported either higher or the same levels of spousal support upon initial disclosure of status. Responses from the respondents in NA-HHs in China and India showed high levels of discriminatory attitudes towards PLHIV and their families. In general, female PLHIV were more likely than male PLHIV to have been discriminated against. Females in Viet Nam had relatively low levels of knowledge about MTCT and in Indonesia and Viet Nam, low levels of PMTCT. In Indonesia, less than two-thirds of pregnant HIV-positive women told their health provider of their HIV status. 12 With regards to educational attainment of household members, differences are seen between types of household, gender, and country. However, as shown in Figure 2, in all countries, females were more likely than males to be illiterate, in both HIV-HHs and NA-HHs. Additionally, in both Cambodia and Viet Nam, females in HIV-HHs reported the lowest levels of educational attainment: in Cambodia, 71% of females in HIV-HHs reported an educational level of only primary school or less, compared to 60% of females in NA-HHs, while in Viet Nam the respective percentages were 25% compared to 21%. In Indonesia, females in both households reported similar educational levels (30% of HIV-HH females at primary level or less, versus 31% in NA-HHs). It should be noted, however, that females in HIV-HHs did not report greater differences in educational levels than males, as all members of HIV-HHs were impacted to a similar extent. In contrast, with marital status, not only were there differences between HIV-HHs and NA-HHs across countries, but females in HIV-HHs were significantly more impacted than males in HIV- HHs, especially with regards to being widowed. The most striking differences were seen in Cambodia, where 4% of males in HIV-HHs and 2% in NA-HHs were widowed, compared to 27% of females in HIV-HHs and 13% in NA-HHs. In Indonesia, 7% (HIV-HHs) and 4% (NA-HHs) of males were widowed compared to 17% (HIV-HHs) and 10% (NA-HHs) of females. In Viet Nam, 4% (HIV-HHs) and 1% (NA-HHs) of males were widowed compared to 20% (HIV-HHs) and 8% (NA-HHs) of females.

That compares to 55% of all non-PLHIV males and 63% of non-PLHIV females (data not displayed), indicating the increased vulnerability of females. It should be noted that the results do not neccessarily indicate that HIV has negatively impacted the educational levels of female PLHIV, but do imply correlation between lower levels of education and female PLHIV. In China, the overall educational levels of male and female PLHIV were fairly similar, with 56% of males and 59% of females only having a primary school education or lower. However, it should be noted that female PLHIV were more likely to be illiterate (20%) than males (12%). In India, large differences were noted: 39% of males had a primary school level of education or lower, compared to 47% of females. In Indonesia, overall higher levels of educational attainment were reported than in the other countries, but twice as many females reported only having a primary school or lower level of education (23%) as males (11%).

The impact on the labour market is channelled through an increase in the overall level of unemployment for HIV-affected households as well as increased absenteeism and decreased productivity.

Interestingly, the non-PLHIV males in Indonesia also had the lowest employment levels, and those in India had significantly lower levels than the male PLHIV, possibly due to the general older age of the non-PLHIV than the PLHIV. Other than for Chinese PLHIV, females had lower employment levels than males. Many HIV-HHs in China pointed to the need for their spouses to join the workforce as a coping mechanism in response to HIV, possibly explaining that result. Additionally, in Cambodia, and Indonesia, female PLHIV and non-PLHIV in HIV- HHs had higher employment levels than females in NA-HHs, again likely due to the increased need for additional financing caused by HIV. The different results seen across the countries in the region may also be partly due to differences in urban / rural strata within the studies, as well as differences in the male to female ratios of PLHIV, HoHs and household members. For example, in Cambodia, there were many widowed female heads of HIV-HHs. These women were therefore more likely to be responsible for procuring the household finances than females in NA-HHs. Clearly, HIV has a large impact on the roles and employment opportunities of different household members across the region. 6 India\u2019s data for NA-HHs is not disaggregated by gender, so the overall employment level is used for both figures.

As such, the term employment is used throughout this section. China: WFPR for members 15-59. India: WFPR for members 15-60. Data was not available for NA-HHs by sex. Indonesia: Alive HH-members between the ages of 15-60. Viet Nam: Alive HH-members between the ages of 15-60 in an income-earning position (housewives and peer educators excluded). Figure 7 shows unemployment levels for PLHIV, non-PLHIV members of HIV-HHs and members of NA-HHs (the percentage of 15 to 60 year olds not working, performing housework or attending school), by sex. Across all countries, unemployment levels are substantially higher for PLHIV than non-PLHIV. However, additional impacts on the employment of HIV-HH members are also seen, with non-PLHIV members of HIV-HHs in China and Indonesia having substantially higher unemployment rates than members of NA-HHs (those in Cambodia and Viet Nam showed only small increases in unemployment rates). This impact is likely due to the need for caregiving by household members, as discussed in the following section. The figure also highlights the additional gender impacts of HIV. While in Cambodia male and female PLHIV have similar unemployment levels, females in Indonesia and Viet Nam were less likely to be unemployed, pointing to their need to continue to work regardless of their health status.

For example, in Cambodia, the majority of caregivers in HIV-HHs (who assumed additional duties) were women. Additionally, in China, a comparison of the total productive time for women in NA-HHs was 0.7 hours per day more than for men, while females in HIV-HHs worked 2.2 hours more per day than males, providing insight into the additional burdens HIV places on women in HIV-HHs.

The effect appears particularly acute for girls in HIV-affected households. In Cambodia, girls are nearly twice as likely to be working in an HIV- affected household, pointing to the negative effects on human capital accumulation, as girls are withdrawn from school to support the household. Nonetheless, the impact is not limited to girls; in Vietnam and India the effect on boys is more than double, when comparing HIV-HHs and NA-HHs. Figure 9 shows the impact of HIV on child labour. It should be noted that the data for Cambodia was restricted to the age range of 10-14 only, while for other countries a larger age range (including younger children) was included, likely explaining the higher rates in Cambodia. For all countries where quantifiable data were available, children in HIV-HHs were more likely to have entered the workforce than children in non- affected households. In both Cambodia and China, the impact on girls was substantially greater than that for boys (for whom the impact was either small or non-existent). In Viet Nam, while little difference was seen for girls, a much larger percentage of boys in HIV-HHs had entered the workforce than boys in NA-HHs. India did not have data on children in NA-HHs by gender, but clearly, 7 India: Different age range than for WFPR. 16 the employment rates for both boys and girls was between two to three times higher in HIV-HHs, and overall girls in HIV-HHs had the highest rates.

Additionally, the basic amenities of a household, as well as asset accumulation, are often used as indicators of economic status, as during times of economic hardship, the sale of a family\u2019s house or their assets is often turned to as a coping mechanism. Figure 10 shows the differences in home-ownership in Cambodia and Indonesia for those households with a female head of household compared to a male head of household.

However, if the analysis of household ownership is restricted to only non- widowed household heads, 720 of the 1,216 male headed HIV- HHs owned their house (59%) compared to only 266 of the 536 female headed HIV-HHs (49%). While this may positively indicate that asset transfer may be occurring after the death of a spouse in a HIV-HH, it points to the differences in home ownership between male and female headed households, if death has not occurred. In Indonesia, overall, female headed HIV-HHs are more likely to own their house than male-headed HIV-HHs (49% versus 41%) while the reverse is seen in NA-HHs (42% for female headed NA- HHs versus 49% for male-headed).

In Cambodia, overall similar levels of HIV-HHs and NA-HHs owned livestock (43% and 44%). However, in both households, female-headed households were less likely to own livestock than male-headed households, but no differences were seen between the disparities for HIV-HHs and NA-HHs. In Indonesia, perhaps reflecting the greater urbanicity of the survey participants, ownership of livestock was considerably lower (6% for HIV-HHs and 7% for NA-HHs). No differences between ownership by male-headed HHs (7%), and only small differences for female-headed HHs (3% for HIV-HHs versus 5% for NA-HHs). For non-motorized vehicles, in Cambodia, overall differences were seen (56% of HIV-HHs reported owning a form of non-motorized transport, compared to 60% for NA-HHs), and there were only minor differences between the sexes. However, in Indonesia, not only were differences seen between the types of households (19% of HIV-HHs owned a non-motorised form of transport; 25% of NA-HHs), but female-headed households (14% of HIV-HHs, 15% of NA-HHs) were less likely than male-headed HHs to own such an asset (21% of HIV-HHs, 26% of NA-HHs). In Indonesia, small differences were seen in the levels of HIV-HHs and NA-HHs who reported owning a motor vehicle (57% compared to 61%). Female-headed households were less likely in both situations to own such a vehicle, but surprisingly female-headed HIV-HHs fared better NA-HHs (43% compared to 32%).

In Cambodia, however, the reported attendance levels were equal for children in HIV-affected and non-affected households. The data shows how the impact of HIV on girls\u2019 attendance rates was generally more severe than for boys\u2019 rates. Again, other than in Cambodia, which showed only minor differences in the attendance rates of girls in HIV-affected compared to non-affected households, girls in HIV-HHs generally saw almost three times the drop in attendance rates as did boys in HIV-HHs. The most extreme differences were observed in China, where only 86% of girls in HIV-HHs were attending school, compared to 99% of girls in NA-HHs. In contrast the difference between boys in HIV-HHs and NA-HHs was much smaller (92% attendance versus 96%).

Figure 14 shows the impact of HIV on drop- out rates for children in HIV-HHs and NA-HHs in Cambodia, China, India and Indonesia. In all countries, children in HIV-HHs were more likely to have dropped out of school than the children in the NA-HHs, although there was only a slight difference in Cambodia. The general trend of increased drop-out rates in HIV-HHs is likely due to the need for those children to either take on income- earning positions, or to take over for household chores that the PLHIV were no longer able to perform. The table also highlights the specific vulnerabilities of girls in relation to school drop-out rates. Specifically, drop-out rates for boys were either equal or only slightly higher in HIV-HHs than NA-HHs across the region, while girls saw a much larger increase in drop-out rates (the largest being in China and Indonesia, where differences between drop- out rates for girls in HIV-affected and non-affected households were 13.8% to 0.9% and 6.1% to 1.0, respectively). Additionally, the Cambodia study investigated the average number of school days missed, and found that children in HIV- HHs were more likely to have missed 10 or more days of school in the previous school year than children in NA-HHs (15% compared to 12%).

The impact of ART on reducing morbidity and mortality in PLHIV, and improving their quality of life, has been well documented (Beard et al, 2009; Mahy et al, 2010). Evolving research into the positive impacts of ART, and how to best acquire those benefits, lead to continually changing recommendations for care. The most recent guidelines issued by WHO as to which PLHIV should be receiving ART in 2010, stated: \u201cAll adolescents and adults including pregnant women with HIV infection and CD4 counts of \u2264350 cells/mm3, should start ART, regardless of the presence or absence of clinical symptoms. Those with severe or advanced clinical disease (WHO clinical stage 3 or 4) should start ART irrespective of their CD4 cell count.\u201d Given the time-range of the study, it would be therefore be expected that lower percentages of the PLHIV interviewed in India in 2004 would be on ART when recommendations for ART in resource-limited settings recommended ART for: \u201cWHO Stage IV HIV disease, irrespective of the CD4 cell count; WHO Stage III disease with consideration of using CD4 cell counts <350/mm3 to assist decision-making; and otherwise WHO Stage I or II HIV disease with CD4 cell counts <200/mm3.\u201d Figure 20 displays the percentage of PLHIV who reported they were taking ART at the time of the interview, by sex. Overall, the percentages vary widely by country, from a high of 91% for males in Cambodia to a low of 53% for females in Indonesia. In Cambodia, most of the gender differences in ART usage were due to differences in stage of infection between males and females, and that may be the case for Viet Nam as well. However, it should be noted that the Viet Nam study reported that, in their qualitative interviews, female PLHIV indicated that they would often share their ART with their HIV-positive male spouses, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to get the medicine; both my husband and I got them from the project.

It is possible that a different definition of VCCT was used in the survey that is not described. 21 Key Findings 3.10 Transmission and Diagnosis The percentage of PLHIV who discovered their status through VCCT (rather than after a prolonged illness, pregnancy test, or other form of diagnosis) is reported in Figure 21. There were varying levels reported across the countries \u2013 from a low of 39% for males in India to a high of 89% (for both males and females8) in Indonesia. This may be partially due to overall access to VCCT centres in the different countries, as well as differences in the demographics of the surveyed populations (i.e., almost all of Indonesia\u2019s surveyed PLHIV were located in urban areas, where it may be assumed access to VCCT facilities is easier). The comparatively low rate of diagnosis by VCCT in India is surprising given the methodological design of the survey that involved using the VCCT centre counsellors to create the sample of PLHIV. In both India and Cambodia, however, males were significantly less likely to have been diagnosed through VCCT than females, indicating a greater need for providing education and awareness activities to men within those countries. This has important consequences for transmission, especially for those undiagnosed PLHIV with intimate partners, as the longer a PLHIV is unaware of their status, the greater the chances of them unknowingly passing HIV onto their partner. By increasing VCCT levels in specific key populations, transmission can be reduced. Additionally, the Cambodia Study 8 In Indonesia, there were identical levels of reported VCCT diagnosis in both males and females, with only 85 of 771 male PLHIV stating they were not diagnosed via VCCT (2 did not know) and only 34 of 335 female PLHIV (4 did not know). (United Nations, 2010) showed that there are often very high health expenditures associated with the care of opportunistic infections a person living with undiagnosed HIV must pay for, especially as they are not eligible for free care under government programs. Increasing levels of early diagnosis through VCCT can therefore have a positive impact on reducing the coping mechanisms used by HIV-HHs. Only Cambodia reported details about whether respondents were associated with a key population, so it was not possible to draw conclusions about regional similarities or differences regarding HIV and key populations. However, data were available on the mode of transmission reported by the surveyed PLHIV, as shown in Figure 22. Differences in survey methodology may partially explain differences seen in the various countries. For example, in China, the survey focused on poor rural areas, and specifically on PLHIV who were infected through IDU, commercial blood donation and heterosexual sex between spouses, so other significant groups of PLHIV, such as sex workers, men who have sex with men and people who inject drugs (PWID) in large cities were not included. However, these differences (and similarities) are important for drawing conclusions from the other findings in this report.

In Cambodia and Indonesia, PLHIV were specifically asked about spousal transmission, and again, sex-specific differences are seen in the responses, with significantly more females indicating they contracted HIV from their husbands than male PLHIV indicating they contracted HIV from their wives (in Indonesia, 77% of women indicated they had contracted HIV from their spouses, while 23% of men indicated the same). This has strong implications for the unequal impact of HIV on females, as discussed throughout this report. While the China study focused on particular modes of HIV transmission, the results were very similar to that found in the 2007 Joint Assessment of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Treatment and Care in China (SCAWCO et al, 2007). The largest difference seen between China and other countries in the region was the higher rate of transmission through blood donation (9% overall). The survey also showed that, in specific provinces (Hubei and Shanxi), over 70% of PLHIV indicated that commercial blood donation was the main mode of transmission (and over 80% for males). Importantly, those results reflect the pattern of transmission from several years before the survey occurred, and it is believed that the issues with commercial donation and HIV have been largely solved. Risk factors associated with injecting drug use are noted in several country studies, especially in males in China (62% of transmission) and Indonesia (73%). In Indonesia, the survey data were different from overall national averages, where heterosexual contact was reported as the main source of transmission (http://www. aidsindonesia.or.id), possibly due to the specific regions that the survey targeted. However, all data from Indonesia do suggest that HIV transmission through unsafe injecting practices is increasing, especially among males, and points to the need for additional education and awareness among people who inject drugs (Ministry of Health et al, 2007). 3.11 Food Support Due to the vulnerability of HIV-HHs to food insecurity (UNAIDS, 2008b), a number of countries asked households whether or not they were specifically receiving food support at the time of the survey. Sex-differentiated data is only available for Cambodia and Indonesia, and in both countries there were no significant differences between the percentage of HIV-affected households receiving food support, when analysing between male and female-headed households. In Cambodia, however, regardless of the sex of the HoH, HIV-HHs were more likely to have received food support than NA-HHs. FIGuRE 23 Households Receiving Food Support, by Sex of HoH 57.7% 4.4% 16.2% 56.4% 6.5% 16.9% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% HIV-HHs NA-HHs HIV-HHs Cambodia Indonesia % HHs Received Food Support Male Headed HHs Female Headed HHs 3.12 Stigma and Discrimination HIV can have a traumatic impact on an individual\u2019s sense of self- worth, personal security and their social standing within the household and community (USAID, 2006). Emotional, mental and sometimes physical manifestations of stigma and discrimination are not only personally damaging, but are often correlated with other medical co-morbidities, and can further reduce an individual\u2019s capacity to engage in productive economic activities. Internal stigma, stigma and discrimination can also reduce the likelihood of an individual accessing HIV testing, seeking treatment, or sharing their diagnosis and taking action to protect others. Figure 24 diagrams the inter-relationship between how the three different aspects of HIV-related stigma and discrimination (internal stigma, stigma and discrimination) can escalate one another and lead to a cycle that is difficult to break. Stigma within the community leads to discriminatory actions against the person living with HIV, which in turn leads to increased levels of internal stigma within the PLHIV, creating reduced socialisation, which can lead to further stigma in the community. FIGuRE 24 Conceptual Framework for Stigma, Discrimination and Internal Stigma Source: USAID, Breaking the Cycle: Stigma, Discrimination, Internal Stigma and HIV, 2006. 23 Key Findings The data displayed in Figure 25 and Figure 26 quantify the internal stigma experienced by the PLHIV in Cambodia and Viet Nam, by sex. In Cambodia, high levels of PLHIV reported having experienced shame, with women reporting it slightly more than men (48% versus 43%), but there were lower levels in Viet Nam (26% females, 25% males).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c47c63d2-ea5d-46cb-9ea8-d02991d57be6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c47c63d2-ea5d-46cb-9ea8-d02991d57be6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis of the Impact on Women and Girls", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36afa6c4334a2a1ec94728e5653c2cc05fe5385adb71a57cd4635c32e3539675"}, "2": {"node_id": "5315543d-a9b2-402b-8efe-69c27b7f7674", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf8da1a278806b457b29000969d56b7a512a08d7b230c1b68f96b3e3385a2cc3"}}, "hash": "3312c4c1791aa20d1fa6563fb5834b1a43226860a5c08672130988abd603a216", "text": "High levels of both males and females in Cambodia (62% males; 66% females) and Viet Nam (62% males; 70% females) reported low self-esteem, though females in both countries reported higher levels than males.

HIV prevention testing and counselling programmes promote the importance of status disclosure, especially to the PLHIV\u2019s intimate partner. However, in developing countries, stigma, discrimination, abuse and violence towards women are often a consequence of HIV disclosure (11% in developing countries, Maman, S. et al, 2004). Understanding how the PLHIV in these studies disclosed their status, and the reactions that resulted, are important for improved prevention and education activities. Many countries asked PLHIV at what point they disclosed their status to their sexual partner and/or spouse, and their responses are summarised in Figure 27. There are clear regional differences with regard to status disclosure, although potential observational bias exists in some of these results - for example, in Cambodia, bias due to the methodology used to locate PLHIV in the survey, as PLHIV known to home-based care teams are more likely to have disclosed their status than those not receiving home-based care. Overall, the highest levels of non-disclosure were reported in Indonesia (13% overall), followed by India (7%), China (7%) and Cambodia (1%). The rate of disclosure in Indonesia is important as it points to the need for greater education of PLHIV, and the general population, on the importance of sharing their status with their sexual partner. The data show that in China, India and Indonesia there were strong differences (and minor differences in Cambodia) in the percentage of men who immediately reported their status to their wife and the percentage of women who immediately reported their status to their husband (more female PLHIV reported immediately in both China and India, the reverse in Indonesia). The situation in India and China may be partially a reflection of culture, but also a reflection of patterns of intimate partner transmission (i.e., if the husband transmitted to the wife, he was already aware of her status, and vice versa), and may indicate higher levels of male to female transmission. In Indonesia, responses by sex were only available for PLHIV who were also responding as the heads of their household, so present a small, particular segment of men and women. However, for those particular PLHIV, women were considerably less likely to have disclosed their status to their intimate partner (26% had not revealed their status, compared to 11% of men). Based on other data in the Indonesia analysis, it is likely this is due to fear of discrimination and / or abuse (16% of female PLHIV who were once married reported their husband left them and no longer supported them and 10% of female PLHIV reported they had been physically abused for trying to refuse sex with their husband).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67e5182c-7cf8-4114-8af6-5339fc3afb37": {"__data__": {"id_": "67e5182c-7cf8-4114-8af6-5339fc3afb37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis of the Impact on Women and Girls", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10fc9f5a89199e9dde134ae01460c671d059741f26ada1e4aa61aefa2c038ec5"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6e75c0e-ef6b-43d8-8307-cd874a8d32c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "493ef42236ea276fdbe2f657ce879d737c8d513976ea7175b401b503f037b2ed"}}, "hash": "d79f243b414bf6bb0edc4e5415d6169b551b8974c497cb486be8d04aa8f65256", "text": "FIGuRE 27 Timeframe for Disclosure of HIV Status to Spouse / Partner, by Sex 86.3% 89.6% 74.8% 85.5% 69.3% 83.7% 63.0% 57.5% 12.6% 8.8% 17.2% 8.7% 23.6% 8.7% 25.7% 17.1% 1.2% 1.6% 8.0% 5.8% 7.1% 7.5% 11.3% 25.5% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Cambodia China India Indonesia % PLHIV Dislosed Status to Spouse...

In all three analysed countries, female PLHIV reported higher initial levels of support than the male PLHIV. However, that may be possibly due to the fact that many of their spouses were already HIV positive. The data show how spouses\u2019 attitudes changed overtime, as PLHIV also described their spouse\u2019s attitude towards them at the time of the survey. The largest change was reported by male PLHIV in China, where more than twice as many male PLHIV indicated spouses were supportive at the time of the interview (74%) in comparison to when they initially disclosed their status (30%) (a larger increase than for female PLHIV, who reported support went from 41% to 76%). As a result, almost equal numbers of male and female PLHIV in China reported their spouses were currently supportive, which was also the situation in Cambodia. In India, however, again male PLHIV reported a greater increase in support (from 42% to 87% compared to 45% to 75% for women), which resulted in more male PLHIV than female PLHIV reporting their spouses were supportive ta the time of the survey.

Data were not available for Cambodia or Viet Nam, and only one question was asked of those in Indonesia, \u201cHow is your attitude when interacting or one day interacting with a PLHIV?\u201d In Indonesia, 15% of NA-HH respondents indicated they would either avoid a PLHIV or keep their distance, and the percentage was higher for female respondents (19%) than for male respondents (14%). Similarly, in India females appeared less tolerant towards PLHIV than males: 63% of females indicated they wouldn\u2019t use the same health facilities as those used by a PLHIV (48% of males), 57% said they wouldn\u2019t allow their child to play with a child from a HIV-positive family (43% of males), and 42% stated they didn\u2019t feel their community would accept a PLHIV living within the community (compared to 32% of males). Possible economic repercussions of negative community attitudes towards PLHIV can be seen as 46% of females said they would not make food purchases from an HIV-positive shop-keeper (35% of males) and 56% of females said they would not accept an HIV-positive teacher (41% of males). In China, negative responses were lower for all questions except the one regarding the purchase of food (specifically in China the question was whether the respondent would purchase steamed breads) where 57% of respondents indicated they would not make a purchase from an HIV-positive shopkeeper. However, in China the bias was reversed, with females more likely to report a tolerant attitude than the males. Additionally, in India, people in urban areas were more open and tolerant than those in rural areas (data not shown).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93e754ff-3c61-4457-8644-587b9b9b8346": {"__data__": {"id_": "93e754ff-3c61-4457-8644-587b9b9b8346", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis of the Impact on Women and Girls", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "208875873e7d7d6e6219ba0011cbb2e47dae08d5a5c3b3010f24798a6687130e"}, "2": {"node_id": "494cb110-dc35-4e28-a405-63efc4a5add0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8c839c4198862ee6231b26907f6e2e3718d786eae8296598c26f75172bb7f20"}}, "hash": "b37d190cf557605f336e85f9feb9a9ec4dc259b2ae54d2e0297d003c69b02bc2", "text": "FIGuRE 29 Attitudes of NA-HHs towards PLHIV, by Sex 28% 30% 40% 42% 35% 36% 61% 37% 22% 23% 30% 38% 30% 28% 53% 27% 32% 24% 37% 48% 43% 44% 36% 41% 42% 30% 51% 63% 56% 54% 46% 56% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% NOT accept a PLHIV living in same community NOT interact with family of a PLHIV NOT share food with a PLHIV NOT use health facilities used by a PLHIV NOT allow child to play with child in HIV-HH NOT send their child to school with HIV+ child NOT purchase food from a HIV+ shopkeeper NOT accept a PLHIV as a teacher China Male China Female India Male India Female China: Asked of HoHs in NA-HHs; India: Asked of all adult members of NA-HHs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a47eca5-2735-4bfb-8415-b1f73cfde485": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a47eca5-2735-4bfb-8415-b1f73cfde485", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis of the Impact on Women and Girls", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "297b99cfbc76cc693801ca7394ac09d25f7f6ddb4df00698fc3020aa4919c3f7"}, "3": {"node_id": "b394ded3-35e0-41ab-a32c-ac5d16dc8840", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ed77ea8bc35af306813dc152866a28309d7170fe019778a4ca9e1bfa481e4c8"}}, "hash": "cdbb38c5fcec2c61c18a5f9b855041f5ee31d8bc5ab83a95836770df165cb377", "text": "The data in Figure 30 and Figure 31 highlight the percentage of PLHIV who disclosed their status to their community and their health professionals, while the data shown in Figure 33 highlight the main forms of stigma and discrimination those PLHIV faced because of their HIV status. Unfortunately, the same methodology was not used across the five countries, so the results are not directly comparable, but still give a good estimate of how various countries in the region are similar (and different) with regards 25 Key Findings to stigma and discrimination against PLHIV. In Cambodia, which used the \u201cPeople Living with HIV Stigma Index\u201d questionnaire (International Planned Parenthood Federation, 2008), a very high percentage of respondents (equal for males and females) reported they had revealed their status to their health professionals (99%), which is possibly due to observational bias through the use of home-based care teams to identify the PLHIV to be included in the survey. That compares to only 70% of PLHIV in China (again equal disclosure by the sexes) reporting that they revealed their status to their health facility. Additionally, while Indonesia did not ask all PLHIV if they had disclosed their status to their health professionals, only 59% of pregnant HIV positive women reported revealing their status (see Chapter 10). The lower rate of disclosure in China and Indonesia might be partially attributable to the higher rate of discrimination within the health sector reported by PLHIV as only 1% of PLHIV in Cambodia reported discrimination in their health facilities, compared to 13% in China and 30% in Indonesia. A high level of discrimination was also reported in Viet Nam, where 17% of PLHIV reported they had been discriminated against in the health setting, and the situation was worse for females, with 21% of women reporting discrimination in a health facility, compared to 15% of men. These high levels of reported discrimination point to an immediate need to increase sensitization and awareness of HIV in the health facility setting, as many PLHIV are currently not receiving the care they require, and are also unlikely to be receiving adequate education about transmission prevention, and other key support modalities. 26% of PLHIV in India reported they had disclosed their status within the workplace, with little difference seen between males and females. 10% of PLHIV in India indicated they had been discriminated against as a result, similar to 10% in Viet Nam and 4% in China (no significant differences between the genders). In China, levels of workplace-based discrimination are so low due to the largely rural agriculturally-based sector of the population who were interviewed, and for whom their household is the productive unit, so work-based contact with individuals outside the home is limited, and therefore labour-based discrimination is less likely. In Cambodia, approximately 86% of male PLHIV and 82% of female PLHIV indicated they had disclosed their status to their friends and neighbours, compared to 24% of males and 26% of females in India, and 48% and 51% in China. Again, it must be noted that the PLHIV interviewed in Cambodia were receiving visits from home- based care teams who, as part of their activities, conduct HIV awareness-raising community activities. Perhaps partially due to those activities, only 6% reported having been socially neglected or isolated by their community (no differences between males and females), compared to the high levels of social ostracism by the community in China, India, and Indonesia with 56% of PLHIV in China (no gender difference), 66% in India (no gender difference) and 26% in Indonesia9, (large difference between the sexes: 47% of females and 17% of males) reporting that they were either socially isolated or neglected. Levels were lower in Viet Nam (21%), but, like in Indonesia, a larger percentage of females than males reported such social isolation (28% for females, 17% for males). Additionally, high levels of verbal abuse were reported by PLHIV in both India and Viet Nam (37% had experiences such abuse), and while levels were lower, they still raise concern in Cambodia (21%), Indonesia (19%) and China (18%). In some countries, there was little difference between the level of verbal abuse reported by the sexes, but in Cambodia, 23% of females reported verbal abuse, compared to 16% of males and in Indonesia, 29% of females reported such abuse compared to 12% of males.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b394ded3-35e0-41ab-a32c-ac5d16dc8840": {"__data__": {"id_": "b394ded3-35e0-41ab-a32c-ac5d16dc8840", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis of the Impact on Women and Girls", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "297b99cfbc76cc693801ca7394ac09d25f7f6ddb4df00698fc3020aa4919c3f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "5a47eca5-2735-4bfb-8415-b1f73cfde485", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cdbb38c5fcec2c61c18a5f9b855041f5ee31d8bc5ab83a95836770df165cb377"}}, "hash": "0ed77ea8bc35af306813dc152866a28309d7170fe019778a4ca9e1bfa481e4c8", "text": "Additionally, an alarming 6% of PLHIV in Cambodia reported they had suffered form physical 9 Analysis was restricted to the subset of PLHIV who were also the HoH and status was known to the community. abuse due to their HIV status, and almost twice the number of females", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0188fa6-4128-440e-80cd-37ffcd1c8f48": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0188fa6-4128-440e-80cd-37ffcd1c8f48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis of the Impact on Women and Girls", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db845c3ed95145d97aa6da8855f97efab2e93e4e88b1078b590cf36bc9fbe6d3"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c3e40f6-a1d0-418b-9aa2-37f6f69e4fdb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5394a4bd4af2c92887344df9ed350962d815e91e6ccef306338171e65057fe4e"}}, "hash": "2c5a13baf00b7e6ee9053e7e49bcc39c3c9af79e4091b6d6e3dab0cf25c2a57f", "text": "(7%) as males (4%).

Figure 33 provides data on how women in the various countries demonstrated knowledge of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and prevention of mother-to-child-transmission. Overall, less than 50% of all pregnant women were informed of PMTCT, underlining the importance of increasing provider-based programmes for preventing mother-to-child transmission.

Of the 59% of females who informed their health care provider of their status, 90% were informed of PMTCT measures, so overall 46% of pregnant PLHIV had been informed of PMTCT. In Viet Nam, overall 78% of females in HIV-HHs noted that they were aware of PMTCT medications, but only 2% of those in NA-HHs were aware. These data raise two sets of concerns, the first of which is the high percentage of HIV positive pregnant women in Indonesia who did not inform their health professional of their HIV status (over 40%). As was discussed earlier, high levels of discrimination in health facilities were reported in the Indonesia study (over 30% of PLHIV reported being discriminated against in a health facility), so it is understandable that women are hesitant to disclose their status to health professionals.

As such, the data points to the need for increased sensitization training within the health profession, as the fear of discrimination, and hence reluctance to disclose status, is placing the lives of many unborn babies at risk. With regards to actual pregnancies, in Cambodia, the survey asked if women (aged 15-45) had given birth within the last year, while in Indonesia, the survey asked whether women (who had ever been married) had ever been pregnant, so numbers cannot be compared. In Cambodia, twice as many women in NA-HHs (12%) had given birth in the previous year than in HIV-HHs (6%). In Indonesia, 40% of HIV-positive married, divorced or widowed women indicated they had been pregnant or given birth since being diagnosed with HIV. In Viet Nam, 9% of women in HIV-HHs indicated they had been forced or persuaded to have an abortion, compared to 6% of women in NA-HHs. While data are not available for other countries, the result points to a need for more information on this issue, and for increased education and empowerment activities regarding the sexual and reproductive health rights of HIV positive women. With regard to PMTCT during pregnancy, it is important to note that all the surveys took place, either concurrently with, or before new WHO recommendations were published in November 2009, that indicate \u201cAll HIV-infected pregnant women who are not in need of ART for their own health require an effective ARV prophylaxis strategy to prevent transmission to their infant\u201d (WHO, 2009). This was a change from previous recommendations in 2006 when it was recommended that only populations with advanced clinical staging or low CD4 cell counts should be treated. Since more HIV-positive women who are in Stage I are likely to be pregnant, it would therefore be normal to assume lower ART rates for those women. However, the data provided here should be considered as an important baseline for following how the targets are met in the future. In Cambodia, 78% of pregnant HIV-positive women were on ART, while in Indonesia only 42% reported being on ART at some point during their pregnancy or delivery, as shown in Figure 34. The figure also shows data from Cambodia and Indonesia regarding breastfeeding practices, which similarly saw a recent change in guidelines at the time the surveys were being conducted. The recommendations were changed to \u201cMothers known to be HIV- infected (and whose infants are HIV uninfected or of unknown HIV status) should exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first 6 months of life, introducing appropriate complementary foods thereafter, and continue breast-feeding for the first 12 months of life.\u201d However, the data clearly indicates that HIV-positive women in Cambodia and Indonesia will need additional education to change their current practices - in Cambodia only 21% of women in HIV-HHs reported they breastfed their baby in the first six months, while 93% of FIGuRE 34 HIV, Pregnancy and Breastfeeding 78.0% 21.0% 87.9% 41.0% 45.0% 54.6% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% are on ART breastfed first 6 months gave baby other liquids % Female PLHIV who...

In Indonesia, 45% of HIV-positive women reported breastfeeding their baby, which is surprisingly high, and perhaps due to the low percentage who informed their health provider of their status, and were therefore not informed of the previous recommendations to not breastfeed.

This is due to the fact that men who buy sex constitute one of the largest groups of PLHIV, and they are often married, or will become married. Their wives, often believing they are at low risk due to their sexual interaction with only partner, are in fact vulnerable to infection. Figure 36 diagrams how an estimated 50 million women in Asia are at risk of acquiring HIV from their intimate partner relationships. FIGuRE 36 Dynamics of HIV Transmission in Intimate Partners Source: UNAIDS (2009) In India, a recent report on HIV and intimate partners showed that, while 22% of surveyed men reported having extramarital sex (EMS), only 40% reported using a condom in the EMS encounter (UNAIDS, 2009b). In contrast, only 6% of surveyed wives reported they thought their husband might be engaged in EMS. Globally, more than four-fifths of new HIV infections in women occur in marriage or in long-term relationships with primary partners (UNFPA, 2005) and in Asia, it has been estimated that over 90% of women living with HIV acquired the virus from their intimate partners (Silverman et al., 2008) but there is still fairly limited data on the subject. The data provided by these surveys, especially in Cambodia and Indonesia, which specifically asked about intimate partner transmission, provide new and significant insight into the situation. As reported in Section 3.11, the percentage of female PLHIV reporting that they acquired their infection through heterosexual contact was higher than that for males, in all countries providing data. The largest difference was seen in Indonesia, where only 4% of men but 63% of women indicated heterosexual sex as the mode of transmission. In Cambodia, 80% of men who stated they contracted HIV through heterosexual sex reported that the source of their infection was their spouse or intimate partner, while 98% of women indicated the same. In Indonesia, only 23% of men who reported heterosexual sex as the mode of transmission stated that they contracted HIV from their intimate partner, compared to 77% of women. Additionally, while it cannot be assumed what percentage of the transmissions were from their intimate partners, the large percentage of women in India (88%) and China (65%) indicating that their transmission was via heterosexual contact, and given the nature of the household-based surveys used, it is likely that the majority of those infections, as in Cambodia and Indonesia, were also through sexual contact with intimate partners.

In Cambodia, equal numbers of male and female respondents knew where to go for VCCT, but in India, women had much lower levels of knowledge than men (36% versus 52%). Given the higher numbers of female PLHIV who reported they were diagnosed through VCCT, this may indicate that VCCT knowledge is low in the general population, but since many females were infected by their partners or spouses, they were more likely to have gone for testing than male PLHIV. While the data from India are from 2004 / 2005, they point to a need for continued education on VCCT. While the majority of respondents in Cambodia, India and Indonesia reported they knew that condoms could be a form of prevention against HIV, results ranged from only 53% of women in India to 96% of men in HIV-HHs in Cambodia. Of concern was the finding that in all countries, females had lower knowledge levels regarding the use of condoms as a form of HIV prevention than males.

In Cambodia NA-HHs, males were more likely to report that having limiting their number of sexual partners was a form of HIV prevention (27% versus 20% of females). In Indonesia, 78% of men reported limited sexual partners, while only 67% of women did. In Cambodia, almost equal numbers of females and males in NA-HHs (23% and 25%) knew about the risk for HIV associated with IDU, and similar numbers were also reported in Indonesia (91% and 93%). Some of these differences between the countries may be due to how survey questions were asked \u2013 in Cambodia, respondents were not specifically asked if something was a form of prevention, but the respondents had to name as many options a possible, while in Indonesia, it is unclear how the question was asked. 31 Policy Conclusions The findings of this report of the multi-country studies call for urgent policy action.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c50a4aaf-b5e0-46a7-bb54-d25116f3aa84": {"__data__": {"id_": "c50a4aaf-b5e0-46a7-bb54-d25116f3aa84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Asia: A Regional Analysis of the Impact on Women and Girls", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e7001a3f55bc687e103c5d91dc0985b5404cdedbcadecc16a9fe23f86bb3b09"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d5573b0-002e-4995-b352-27686aa4a3ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-level-asia-regional-analysis-impact-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1377b3041940122e31b200cf760839a93b30c9f2cac341981e03e77fe37694d6"}}, "hash": "9f61191cd652740c020a260e1bf17f8aca225b2606796f8d21adbcefc39d3b9f", "text": "They demonstrate that as the epidemic matures it has significant and lasting impact on the ability of households to cope with the loss of family members, the loss of income, and the loss of educational opportunities, particularly for girls who are pulled out of school to care for sick and dying family members.

The studies in all five countries were taken at different times of economic growth and prosperity, spanning from the growth of 2004 to the downturn at the end of the decade. Nonetheless, the studies show that HIV households are disproportionately impacted, even in good times, and that women and girls within those households even more so. Their extremely vulnerable state underscores the need for them to be prioritized for social protection with concerted actions to mitigate the impact of the disease. Specific recommendations based on the studies are as follows: 1. Prioritize women and girls in HIV-affected households in various social protection schemes, by making necessary changes in eligibility criteria so that they become eligible. For example, pension schemes for widows have minimum age eligibilities, which can be above 40 or 50. Many women widowed by AIDS may not be able to access such schemes, as they tend to be young. Under such circumstances, the age restriction can be relaxed to extend coverage to them. In the Indian state of Rajestan, a special provision was made for HIV widows where the minimum age eligibility for widow pension was lowered from 40 to 16, resulting in the additional coverage of 1000 HIV widows.10 2. Maximize women\u2019s and widows\u2019 access to credit and income-generating opportunities by generating options for sustainable livelihoods, such as the provision of vocational skills, start up funds for micro-enterprise, partnerships with the private sector, and linkages with the market, among other initiatives. It is particularly important, in the context of targeted poverty reduction efforts, to focus on the most vulnerable groups. 3. Increase caregiving support systems to PLHIV and their households. The studies pointed out how women in HIV- HHs often become caregivers to the PLHIV members of their households, reducing their employment opportunities and the income generation of the households. Support for the capacity building of groups and networks of women living with HIV can be a key step towards reducing burdens on women in affected households. 4. Increase healthcare utilisation among female PLHIV by reducing social, physical, financial and other barriers, which will help maintain good health and reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV. 10 Johri, A. and Narang, A. (2011) Presentation given at the High-Level Technical Consultation on HIV-sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific, 27-29 2011, Siem Reap, Cambodia. 5. Create more opportunities for girls and women to learn about HIV and its prevention in school, community, and health setting. The studies showed that knowledge of HIV was low for women in China (31% had not heard of HIV) and Indonesia (28%), knowledge of condom usage for HIV prevention was low, and knowledge of VCCT sites also low. Given the high levels of intimate partner transmission that were reported in the studies, better educating women on their vulnerability to HIV if their husband has multiple sexual partners, and on condom usage, may help to further reduce transmission in this vulnerable group. 6. Prioritize efforts to keep children from HIV-affected households in school, especially girls, by targeting them in conditional cash transfer programmes. Additional interventions are needed to ensure that children from HIV- affected households receive the same level of education as children from non-affected households, and do not drop out in order to work or become caregivers. Conditional cash transfers should be explored, specifically targeting girls, to ensure increased enrolment and retention rates for HIV- affected children, thereby reducing the negative impact on human capital accumulation. 7. Strengthen legal empowerment measures for women living with and affected by HIV. Legal reforms should be stressed to improve women\u2019s equal rights to inheritance and property ownership, especially widows. These assets are critically needed, following the death of a spouse, to provide women and children with shelter and economic assets so they are better able to cope with the impact of the death of their family member. 8. Targeted interventions in health facilities to reduce stigma and discrimination against PLHIV. A key finding of the study was the high levels of PLHIV reporting stigma and discrimination within health facilities, and high levels of pregnant PLHIV who did not disclose their status within the health facilities. Policies should seek to change the attitudes of health workers, in order to avoid the dangerous consequences that may result from the discriminatory practices. 9.

Training and employment of PLHIV as counsellors can greatly contribute to reducing the mental distress experienced by people living with HIV. 10. Targeted interventions should be developed to address the negative self- esteem experienced by PLHIV and their family members. Continued community outreach and other programmes to reduce stigma and discrimination should be strengthened, and tools should be developed to measure home-based care\u2019s effectiveness in this area. This would include specific activities related to volunteer counselling services at the point of testing and notification. 32 11. Increase awareness of the importance of status disclosure to intimate partners. The studies showed that up to 13% of PLHIV in Indonesia had never disclosed their status to their spouses or intimate partners. Increasing disclosure, in conjunction with increased ART coverage and condom usage will help in reducing the transmission of HIV between intimate partners. While several countries have already scaled up social protection programmes for PLHIV since their studies were completed, continued evolution of those programmes is required to support the people, households and communities that are hardest hit by the economic crisis and the epidemic. The studies also point to the deleterious effect of HIV on the reduction of human capital not only due to death and morbidity of PLHIV but also due to reduced investment in the education of children. 33 References 5.

The survey was administered between December 2009 and February 2010 by Sanigest Internacional and the Centre for Advanced Study (CAS), and included a total of 3,972 households. Methodology Details The study surveyed 2,623 households containing a person living with HIV and 1,349 control households, with more than 17,000 total individuals (11,566 within HIV-affected households and 6,129 in non-affected households). The sample selected was representative at the national level, within the context of all HIV- affected households enrolled in an HIV support program, and stratified for representativeness at the urban and rural levels. This study used a two stage sampling methodology and the sampling consisted of three primary sampling units: \u2022\ufffd Provinces (first level cluster) \u2022\ufffd HIV-HH (second level cluster) \u2022\ufffd NA-HH (second level cluster) Within this context, HIV-HH refers to households with at least one member currently living with HIV. NA-HH refers to households where no family members have HIV. A list of 51 health facilities providing ART and OI services in 20 provinces11 as of December 2008 (National Center for HIV/AIDS, Dermatology and STD, 2008) provided the site-based frame for the first cluster-based level of sampling. A list of provinces was selected, based on composition of urban and rural districts and how many PLHIV attended each health facility. Figure 41 identifies which provinces were sampled, and randomized as locations for the study.

Selection of HIV-affected Households A simple random sample of PLHIV was drawn from the previously selected sites using lists of PLHIV from home-based care (HBC) networks as the frame.

However, it is a possible source of selection bias. (ii) Networks from NGOs that provide HBC were used for the second-stage sampling frame, and created a study population that consists of a greater percentage of HIV- HHs receiving HBC than would normally be reflected in the Cambodian population. This is a possible source of selection bias. (iii) The sample frame focused on individuals who lived within 20km of an ART / OI site, creating possible selection bias by excluding people with reduced access to healthcare. (iv) Only a very small percentage (<1%) of the sampled PLHIV had been diagnosed within the previous year. Given the drop in incidence, low levels would be expected, but some selection bias may be present as a result. (v) The survey asked if respondents were members of a key population. These include men who have sex with men, transgender individuals, sex-workers, injecting drug users, migrant workers and prisoners. However, it should be noted that due to the sensitive nature of the questions, it is likely that many individuals would not divulge that they identified with certain key population groups. China The Study on the Socio-Economic Impact of HIV/AIDS at the Individual and Household Level in China (UNDP, 2009a) aimed to quantify the impact of and response to HIV at the household and individual levels. The study was conducted from February through April 2008 by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Centre for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention (NCAIDS), and the Beijing Institute for Information and Control, and included a total of 1,926 households. Methodology Details Data were collected on both the household and individual levels in five high prevalence counties (Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hubei and Shanxi). All selected households were in poor rural areas. In Guangxi, Sichuan, Hubei, and Shanxi, where most of the PLHIV had not disclosed their HIV status, interviews were not carried out in the household. Enumerators and interviewees generally held the interview sessions at the CDC offices or at VCCT clinics. In Yunnan, the survey was conducted in the households, as most PLHIV had disclosed their HIV status. During household-based surveys, the interviewers could directly observe the impact of HIV on living conditions, household facilities, hygiene and other factors.

Of the 9,083 reported cases of PLHIV who were reachable in the selected counties in 2007, 11.3% (1,027 in 931 households) were selected for the survey. In total, 96 of the HIV-HHs were households in which both spouses were living with HIV. A total of 2,022 people were interviewed. Determination of sample size is not discussed in the final report. 38 Selection of HIV-affected Households Sample households were selected by using a combination of multi-stage and systematic sampling methods. In cooperation with local health departments and organizations, the field survey was conducted in five high prevalence provinces of China, namely Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hubei and Shanxi provinces. The survey included 931 PLHIV households (1027 PLHIV; 654 males and 373 females) and 995 non-PLHIV households (472 males and 523 females).

India The study on the Socio-Economic Impact of HIV and AIDS in India (UNDP, 2006) aimed to determine the impact of HIV at the household level with a focus on the relationship between, and distribution of, income and wealth, and changes in the structure of employment and social security. The study on the Socio- Economic Impact of HIV and AIDS in India was conducted by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) with the sponsorship of UNDP and National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) from October 2004 through May 2005, and included 8,292 total households. Methodology Details Data were collected at both the household and individual levels in six high prevalence states (Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur, and Nagaland). Provinces with the highest HIV prevalence were selected based on the Sentinel Surveillance of the respective State AIDS Control Societies (SACS). Five to seven districts in each state were identified from which to sample the households. The capital of each state was selected, and other districts were chosen based on their prevalence and distribution of PLHIV. Higher prevalence districts were chosen to save time and money. The table below shows the selected states and districts.

Sampling consisted of two primary sampling units: \u2022\ufffd HIV-HH \u2022\ufffd NA-HH Due to confidentiality, a list of PLHIV was not available from which to draw a sample of HIV-HHs. Some HIV-HHs were interviewed in their homes while others were interviewed at alternative locations, such as Voluntary Counselling and Testing Centres (VCTCs).

Investigators enlisted the help of VCTC staff who identified PLHIV through various NGO and government lists for home-based care and support homes, including general hospitals, tuberculosis hospitals, support home care, drop in VCTCs, and Networks of Positive Peoples. Since the majority of these facilities are located in urban areas, urban HIV-HHs are overrepresented in this study. Rural HIV-HHs were also much less likely to give consent for the study, thus increasing the urban bias. A maximum of two PLHIV were interviewed from each HIV-HH.

Respondents were restricted to adults aged 20 to 60. Selection of PLHIV for Case Studies For the purpose of the case studies, PLHIV with \u2018unique/typical\u2019 cases were selected for the in-depth interviews. Two or three case studies were conducted in each district and respondents were selected with the help of the investigators, local NGOs, and key informants. Survey Design Quantitative data were collected through household surveys using structured interviews. The survey instruments were developed by National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER), UNDP and the National AIDS Control Organisation. Qualitative data were collected through case studies and focus groups. Enumerators interviewed PLHIV with semi-structured in-depth interviews designed to allow respondents to speak openly about issues. A total of six focus groups were conducted as part of this study \u2013 one in each state. Participants were selected through the Network of Positive Peoples, and discussion encompassed the social and economic problems faced by network members, as well as the legal and other issues. All qualitative data is meant to support the household survey. Limitations Difficulty in obtaining a list of PLHIV from which to create a sampling frame was the fundamental weakness of this study. Other limitations are as follows: (i) Non-probability sampling of HIV-HHs does not allow for statistical inferences on population parameters or other estimates. (ii) HIV-HHs were oversampled in urban areas due to cost- effectiveness \u2013 a possible source of selection bias. (iii) Since PLHIV were recruited through public health facilities, investigators were not able to sample many middle and upper class HIV-HHs since these facilities typically cater to low-income people. (iv) The study was conducted six months after the government began to provide ART services. The data should therefore be interpreted as a baseline for that point in time, and not representative of the current situation in India. Indonesia The study on the Socio-Economic Impact of HIV at the Individual and Household Levels in Indonesia (UNDP, 2011) aimed to describe the impact of HIV on the socio-economic condition of PLHIV and their households in Indonesia. The study was conducted from April through May 2009 by the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) and UNDP in collaboration with the Indonesian Network of People Living with HIV (JOTHI) and included a total of 2,038 households. Methodology Details Data were collected at both the household and the individual level in two low prevalence provinces (West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara) and five high prevalence provinces (DKI Jakarta, East Java, Bali, and Papua). With the exception of DKI Jakarta, East Java and Papua, data were collected only in the provincial capitals. The table below shows the selected research location for both the survey and the in-depth interviews and focus groups. The sample size was determined using the quote method based on the number of estimated HIV cases in each province. Sampling consisted of three primary sampling units: \u2022\ufffd HIV-HH \u2022\ufffd NA-HH \u2022\ufffd PLHIV Within this context, HIV-HH refers to households with at least one member living with HIV. NA-HH refers to households where no family members have been diagnosed with HIV. As HIV-HHs were the primary target of the investigation, NA-HHs served as controls. Core questionnaires were administered to all selected households. In addition to the core questionnaire, HIV-HHs also answered the HIV module questionnaire. To gain further insight into socio-economic behaviours associated with HIV, PLHIV provided additional information missing from the core and HIV household questionnaires. Some of the PLHIV from the HIV-HHs were selected to participate in the in-depth interviews. Selection of HIV-affected Households A non-probability convenience sample was used to select HIV-HHs.

An enumerator assessed a respondent\u2019s suitability for an in-depth interview immediately after administration of the HIV module questionnaire. Selected PLHIV then continued with the in- depth interview. Survey Design Quantitative data were collected through household surveys. The survey consisted of the two parts, and additional qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews and focus groups. The focus group discussions involved informal discussions with community leaders, members of NGOs, PLHIV groups, officials of government agencies associated with HIV prevention, and other stakeholders. Discussions focused on factors relating to the socio- economic impact of HIV at the household level, including access to health services, stigma and discrimination. BPS and JOTHI jointly designed the survey instruments. The questionnaires were then field tested in Bandung City, and West Java Province. Collaboration between BPS and JOTHI continued through the finalization of the questionnaires. Limitations Difficulties in obtaining a list of PLHIV from which to create a sampling frame was the primary limitation of this study. Other limitations included: (i) Non-probability sampling does not allow for statistical inferences on population parameters or other estimates. (ii) The identification of HIV-HHs through the JOTHI network created a study population that consisted of a greater percentage of HIV-HHs involved in HIV activism than would normally be reflected in the Indonesian population. This is a possible source of selection bias. (iii) By selecting PLHIV with \u201ccomplex problems\u201d and association with high risk groups, the data collected through the in-depth interviews may not be representative of the challenges faced by the typical PLHIV in Indonesia. Viet Nam The study on the Socio-economic Impact of HIV and AIDS on Household Vulnerability and Poverty in Viet Nam aimed to assess the socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS on households. The study also provides recommendations on how the country should mitigate the impact of HIV at the household level through lessons learned, international best practices, and identifying areas for further research. The study was conducted from November through December 2008 by Strategic Consulting Company in consortium with Medical Committee Netherlands - Viet Nam, and included a total of 904 households. Methodology Details Data were collected at both the household and individual levels in six high prevalence provinces (HCMC, Hanoi, Quangninh, Langson, Caobang and Angiang).

Sampling consisted of two primary sampling units: \u2022\ufffd HIV-HH \u2022\ufffd NA-HH Here, an HIV-HH was defined as a dwelling in which at least one member was known to have HIV or to have died of AIDS less than a year prior to the start of the study. A NA-HH was defined as a household where, as far as could be determined, no member was known to have HIV, tuberculosis or pneumonia. Selection of HIV-affected Households While a list of PLHIV was available at health facilities, the research team did not use the list as a sampling frame due to confidentiality issues. As a result, the study is based on a non-probability sample. The field investigators working with the Viet Nam PLHIV Network and volunteers from GIPA worked with self-help groups to identify PLHIV. Subjects known to be HIV positive were referred by peer groups. Willing participants were asked to take part in the study. Field investigators attempted to include PLHIV at differing stages of infection, as well as match the nationwide 2:1 male to female ratio among PLHIV. Each HIV-HH was limited to two adult PLHIV informants. Selection of Non-affected Households For every HIV-affected household selected, one non-affected household was selected as a control - usually the closest neighbour of the HIV-affected household. This method attempted to pair houses with similar characteristics, other than the HIV status of household members. Staff at the commune health station or at the Women\u2019s Union at commune level helped to identify households that had similar economic and social status (type/quality of accommodation and number of family members) to the HIV-HH. Heads of non-affected households were restricted to adults aged 20-60 years. Selection of PLHIV for In-depth Interviews A total of 36 in-depth interviews were completed nationwide \u2013 a total of six per province (one male, one female, and one head of household interview in both rural and urban areas in each province). Semi-structured interviews covered all major themes within the household questionnaire, while allowing for new themes to emerge, based on researcher and/or interviewee input. Survey Design Quantitative data were collected through household surveys. Focus group discussions were conducted at national and provincial level. These involved stakeholders in HIV prevention, treatment, care and support, including service providers, program managers, communities and mass organizations, PLHIV, (I)NGO, activists, researchers, and members of the HIV Technical Working Group. The research tools included structured questionnaires for HIV-affected and non-affected households, and guidelines for in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The household survey instrument was adapted from the survey used in the 2005 study with additional inputs from the questionnaires used in the China and India UNDP HIV studies. The questionnaire was drafted in English, translated into Vietnamese, and piloted for cultural appropriateness. Limitations As in other countries, difficulties in obtaining a list of PLHIV from which to create a sampling frame is the primary weakness of this study. Other limitations are as follows: (i) Non-probability sampling does not allow for statistical inferences on population parameters or other estimates. (ii) Households containing family members who had pneumonia or TB were excluded from NA-HH eligibility. This is a potential source of selection bias. (iii) By selecting PLHIV with \u201ccomplex problems\u201d and association with high risk groups, the data collected through the in- depth interviews is not likely to be representative of the challenges faced by the typical PLHIV in Indonesia.

The South-East Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking: From Vulnerability to Free, Just, and Safe Movement Summary report A partnership initiative of: 2 Background and Context To break the silence of the millions of vulnerable women who are enduring the compound burdens of migration, trafficking, HIV, and exploitation, and to bring into the open for public debate the root causes of the multiple vulnerabilities that women and girls face in their daily lives, the first South-East Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking was held in Bali, Indonesia, on 6 August 2009. The Court was organized in conjunction with the 9th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP), and provided a safe and sensitive forum for women who had survived trafficking in the region to speak out. The 22 women from six countries who testified before the Court represented and spoke on behalf of millions in the region who, like them, have for too long suffered in silence.

It should also be noted that this specific Court on HIV and Human Trafficking took into account the experiences and lessons learned from two earlier Courts organized by AWHRC and UNDP in partnership with several other groups in the region: the South-Asia Court on Trafficking and HIV, held in 2003 in Dhaka, Bangladesh; and the Asia Pacific Court of Women on HIV, Inheritance, and Property Rights, held in 2007 in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Human Trafficking in South-East Asia South-East Asia is a major source, transit point, and destination in the global human supply chain, particularly of women and girls. Because of their poverty, their low position in society, and their disempowerment at various levels, women and girls are particularly vulnerable to various forms of violence, exploitation, trafficking, and HIV. In a region where migration offers one of the few real opportunities to escape endemic poverty, many women and girls start out on what they believe to be a dream opportunity, only to find themselves in the hands of deceptive traffickers.

Rampant human rights violations, gender inequality, severe deprivation, and unsafe migration, which create a fertile environment for trafficking of women, are the same factors that increase their vulnerability to HIV.\u201d Caitlin Wiesen, Regional HIV/AIDS Practice Leader and Programme Co-ordinator, Asia and Pacific, UNDP1 \u201cOf the total number of people trafficked globally, one third is from South-East Asia, and gender inequality and unequal power relations are the main fuelling factors for this phenomenon.\u201d Meutia Hatta, Minister for Women\u2019s Empowerment, Indonesia 3 BACKGROUND AND CONTExT girls are trafficked for various reasons \u2013 bonded and cheap labour, sex work, organ transplants, and womb surrogacy \u2013 sexual exploitation is foremost among these crimes throughout the region.2 Beyond being an appalling crime and a gross violation of human rights, human trafficking also leads to the spread of the HIV pandemic. Not surprisingly, those subject to sexual exploitation are most often powerless to protect themselves, and unprotected sex is a major factor in the transmission and spread of HIV. A Harvard University study confirms this link, revealing that HIV prevalence among women and girls who were trafficked in the Indian city of Mumbai was over 20 percent.3 Another Harvard University study, commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and released in 2009 at the 9th International Congress of AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, held in Bali, also indicates the heightened vulnerability of trafficked women and girls of South-East Asia to violence and HIV/other sexually- transmitted infections (STIs).4 While it is difficult to put an exact number on the women trafficked and/or infected with HIV in South- East Asia, even the estimates are staggering. The numbers reveal the enormity of the problem, but precisely because they are too large they can distract us from comprehending the pain and suffering that is experienced by each and every trafficked woman, each and every day. Both trafficking and HIV occur in a climate of denial and silence at all levels. There is silence about the violence committed against women and girls, and about their circumstances, including the abuse and exploitation they face in their living and working environments. At the same time, there is also the denial of HIV being a development challenge.5 And there is silence about the behaviors that make people vulnerable to HIV and about sex itself, which makes it extremely difficult to address HIV prevention or to talk about trafficking and sex work. This silence is not only aiding and abetting trafficking but is also allowing HIV to spread.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f806003f-0ea0-4962-85a5-7aac47f1f79b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f806003f-0ea0-4962-85a5-7aac47f1f79b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The South-East Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking: From Vulnerability to Free, Just, and Safe Movement - Summary Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94fa7f62e1b65ce03732dcf4e5272bcc352b891d97f7299d737655cc3256dad3"}, "2": {"node_id": "3df57993-b9ce-4382-bade-a45fb67a4989", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a39453611dcaa0656407e79a61feca019ca8a8189ec74de1b55644d8d6b31a84"}}, "hash": "7b0a44aa3e31e4e602fd1f0a48cd63e2114407a4355d3e419e9ffb42822d6bcc", "text": "This silence is not only aiding and abetting trafficking but is also allowing HIV to spread.

The memory, experience, knowledge, wisdom, and history of these women, who are so often silenced and subjugated by society, are made audible and visible in the Court. By highlighting the lived experiences and vulnerabilities of women, and by weaving together the testimonies of the survivors and the analytical framework provided by expert witnesses, the Court sought to create other reference points than those provided by the dominant rule of law. It also focused on another notion of justice for the affected women and girls, away from revenge and retribution towards restoration and restitution. By reinforcing the power of numbers rather than fighting in isolation, the Court sought to emphasize to these victims the importance of being part of massive collective efforts that spanned whole countries while simultaneously fighting for their rights and standing up against the individual inequities that they faced everyday. In so doing, it is hoped that those suffering from such injustice will be inspired and empowered to create another kind of future \u2013 one that honors the dignity of every woman and girl, and that is grounded in the most basic rights to health and well-being not only for themselves but for all in the region. 2 UNODC, \u201cGlobal Report on Trafficking in Persons\u201d (2009), p. 11. 3 J.

The testifiers had come from six countries of the region \u2013 Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand \u2013 to narrate their experiences in their own words. Each of the testifiers, most of whom were speaking for the first time before such a large gathering, was safely accompanied by a person from the organization that was currently providing her with support in their home country. In the Court, they were not interrupted or cross-examined. The jury was there not to prosecute but to bear witness to the personal stories of indignities, abuse, violence, pain, misery, and resistance. The audience was there to listen and empathize. The Court held four sessions, followed by remarks by the Eminent Jury members after all 22 testimonies were heard: Session One: The roots of violence without borders Session Two: Ensuring rights of migrants, domestic workers, refugees, sex workers, People Living with HIV, and other vulnerable communities Session Three: Evaluating laws that criminalize movement, mobility, and survival strategies Session Four: Celebrating resistance Each of the four sessions was divided into three sections, beginning with the creation of an aesthetic ambience through a performance by local Balinese dancers on themes relevant to each session. This was followed by the provision of an objective and analytical context for the session by an expert witness. Finally, the gathering heard the narrative of five to six testifiers, some of whom were assisted by translators who had accompanied them to the conference from their home countries. (The utmost care was taken to protect the identities of all testifiers.) Though many of the testifiers experienced moments of obvious emotional pain, each one showed remarkable courage and determination to help not only themselves but the many others who continue to suffer enslavement and abuse.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ed8abbf-ffdf-45a2-bef6-8202b71a6c48": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ed8abbf-ffdf-45a2-bef6-8202b71a6c48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The South-East Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking: From Vulnerability to Free, Just, and Safe Movement - Summary Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2febdda050e7b1ed3be4fd30df9452e74521bd03694972b3cb578461fec300d9"}, "2": {"node_id": "42e35fde-5e8d-425a-9f0b-8b2155eb186b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c0b043533261d0df1a3b8bc786c62057c79a6321854c4ac749f7b392dbf2cd7"}}, "hash": "9cbfa67eaa0de95ecab56651127008c005ebfcda27f469e01cdb790e9b20d8c4", "text": "The timing of the Court was absolutely critical as several recent studies as well as anecdotal evidence, including by the World Bank and UNDP, point in no uncertain terms to the severe stress caused by the global economic crisis on migrants and people living with HIV.6 Many countries are closing formal channels of migration, and few informal options remain for those seeking to migrate for work \u2013 particularly for those with limited skills and education, who must", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a7a0cc6-75ab-429d-b367-944651859bdd": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a7a0cc6-75ab-429d-b367-944651859bdd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The South-East Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking: From Vulnerability to Free, Just, and Safe Movement - Summary Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a60693ffe956ec632631a8df36016514a05438946d8c2b0175fad7532c48a4e"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a3f5a5c-7d01-4da1-b68b-d336c0c8c75c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1e8ff35c15f3dfe0b9e5beb6ec582e38f4cb99cf14d788be4d8c30c106e8e18"}}, "hash": "cc735fb41a4271834add06e785847e055115599c4879533fb4039627a07a8f15", "text": "often rely on unsafe channels.

Though this was the fi rst Court of Women conducted in the South-East Asia region, it was the 37th session organized by AWHRC (see below). The South-East Asia Court of Women is one manifestation of UNDP\u2019s long-term commitment to nurturing partnerships and processes to root out the deeply embedded societal norms and values that facilitate the persistence of such socially-sanctioned violence as traffi cking and sexual exploitation against women. One immediate outcome of the Court has been the forging of regional alliances and partnerships among the prominent stakeholders to address eff ectively the problems that plague the lives of poor women as a consequence of the migration/traffi cking/HIV nexus. History of the Courts of Women The Courts of Women is a process initiated in 1992 by the Asian Women\u2019s Human Rights Council and women\u2019s and human rights groups in Asia and the Pacif c. Beginning in 1995, El Taller, an international non-governmental organization (NGO) based in Tunis, in collaboration with the AWHRC, carried the process into many regions of the world, including Africa, Central and Latin America, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and North America. More than 30 Courts have been held to date. The Courts of Women are a sensitive and powerful media designed to reveal the interconnections between personal and public violence against women in various societies. This is a violence that has been increasing in numbers and escalating in nature; a violence that has become brutal. While not with any legal standing, the Courts are deeply symbolic and are an attempt to def ne a new space and a new politics for women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a3f5a5c-7d01-4da1-b68b-d336c0c8c75c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a3f5a5c-7d01-4da1-b68b-d336c0c8c75c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The South-East Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking: From Vulnerability to Free, Just, and Safe Movement - Summary Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a60693ffe956ec632631a8df36016514a05438946d8c2b0175fad7532c48a4e"}, "2": {"node_id": "5a7a0cc6-75ab-429d-b367-944651859bdd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc735fb41a4271834add06e785847e055115599c4879533fb4039627a07a8f15"}}, "hash": "e1e8ff35c15f3dfe0b9e5beb6ec582e38f4cb99cf14d788be4d8c30c106e8e18", "text": "They also provide a valuable venue for input by local, national, and international campaigns against dif erent forms of violence against women; and they contribute to a growing body of knowledge that will help to question, transform, and initiate alternative perspectives, institutions, and instruments that address the violation of women\u2019s human rights at all levels By challenging the dominant and conventional ways in which knowledge is acquired, the Courts of Women seek to weave together objective reality (through analyses of the issue) with the subjective testimonies of women; the personal with the political; the logical with the lyrical (through video testimonies, artistic images, and poetry).

It is a health problem, as traffi cked women and children are at heightened risk of contracting HIV and other STIs, and have little or no access to healthcare. It is a gender problem, as the factors underlying unequal power relations reinforce each other and are at the root of women\u2019s heightened vulnerability. It is a legal problem, as its victims are stripped of their human rights and lack any access to the means to redress the crimes committed against them. HIV and human traffi cking share many causal and consequential factors. Both are connected to the same spectrum of issues that are rooted in gender and economic inequality, poverty, deprivation, lack of opportunities, stigma and discrimination, human rights violations, disempowerment, unsafe mobility, and a life without dignity. Clearly, many of the factors that increase the risk of women to being traffi cked are the same as those that increase their vulnerability to HIV infection. As noted, human traffi cking happens in unsuspecting ways. Invariably, those women who manage to endure the nightmares of traffi cking \u2013 either because there is no hope of escape or because they believe that, dire as the situation is, it will allow them eventually to overcome their impoverished situation \u2013 often get caught in the quagmire of debt, bondage, stigma, and discrimination. Once so victimized, escape from this vicious cycle is almost impossible without external help. Tragically, the ordeals of traffi cked women continue even after they return home. For example, they are often rejected by their own family and community; and the harshness of social sanctions rises several-fold if the returnee is known to have contracted HIV. In this situation, many women are often left with little choice but to re- engage in sex work, as there is no other means of support available to them. One of the fundamental weaknesses in explaining and exploring the linkages among migration, traffi cking, sexual exploitation, and HIV is the lack of adequate data. This is primarily due to the sensitive and clandestine nature of the issues, the absence of a systematic approach in examining the dual vulnerabilities of traffi cking and HIV, and the strong stigma attached to survivors of traffi cking and to people living with HIV. Together, these intricate and delicate factors have deterred eff orts in the region 8 Shah, \u201cLayers of Silence,\u201d pp. 7-8. 9 Ibid. 10 United States Agency for International Development, \u201cStrategic Treatment for the Asia Regional Anti-Traffi cking Initiative\u201d (draft), (Washington, DC: 25 May 1999).

It attempted to draw out in particular the impact of development policies that are making poverty increasingly less visible and are creating new forms of vulnerabilities for women who are already victims of gender-based violence and who choose mobility or are forced to migrate in search of better livelihood options.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c322b780-813b-4c35-b87e-305944c1c01c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c322b780-813b-4c35-b87e-305944c1c01c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The South-East Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking: From Vulnerability to Free, Just, and Safe Movement - Summary Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d44e89ee1df76681bcc4be8fb05df421e72dcd2857e0e954b72be1a15cf293b8"}, "2": {"node_id": "5975c62c-eeb4-45fb-abf0-586302dde91d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "698fce82a960ca90e6ab0208a24aa528cc751f2d849a42c85c92125c078f85bb"}}, "hash": "fa4d9a51a62aa3dd13daf36b52b904b35794b17e9a22b661d7a5b3a8201e7f8b", "text": "In the regime of globalization women are brought to work in such informal sectors as domestic work, entertainment, and tourism that are totally unregulated and unprotected.

Rosa\u2019s Story Married and divorced at 15, Rosa, a native of East Java, went to Malaysia as a domestic worker in order to support her impoverished family. However, Rosa retuned to East Java within a few months, unable to cope with the pressures of a large household of eight. On return she married a man 20 years her senior, but learned after a few months that he had already been married nine times! By the time Rosa discovered the truth, she was pregnant. Even as she was blamed and abused by her family, she gave birth to a boy. With a baby now to fend for, she worked in a small shop owned by a neighbour; but with the baby\u2019s needs increasing, she became desperate to earn more. Lured by the promise of a good job in a shop in Bali by one of her neighbours, Rosa went to the island leaving her baby in the care of her mother. There she was made to work in a small restaurant, which she later realized was only a stopgap until the neighbour found a pimp to whom he could sell her. Without warning, Rosa found herself drawn into the sex industry, and she was helpless to get away as she had to provide for the baby and her family back home. Five years into the sex industry, Rosa is now HIV- positive. Her mother died last year and her sister takes care of her child. The family still believes Rosa is working in a shop in Bali. 12 PRESENTATIONS BY PANELISTS 12 A testi\ufb01 er making an emotional statement. KEY ISSUES HIGHLIGHTED IN THE COURT Session Two: Ensuring rights of migrants, domestic workers, refugees, sex workers, PLHIV, and other vulnerable communities 13 SESSION TWO It is important to understand that the sex industry is not limited to any one region: it is a global phenomenon. Large- and small-scale organized traffi cking networks operate across borders, actively recruiting women and girls, preying especially upon unsuspecting, impoverished, and desperate households. In addition to being a woman, if the victim is also poor and from a marginalized community, her vulnerability to traffi cking increases several folds.13 Women who are involved in the sex trade are most often powerless to negotiate protected sex, and women are also biologically more susceptible to HIV than men. Women are vulnerable at all levels \u2013 within the family, in the community, and in society \u2013 largely as a result of deep-rooted discrimination and the denial of basic human rights. These factors, together with the extremely demanding domestic responsibilities of women, deny them access to resources, education, training, and labour markets.14 And yet, for all such discrimination and limitation, women are often called upon to provide for their impoverished family \u2013 especially in situations when there is no man in the house, or when the man is incapable or unwilling to be the provider. Again, such strong family pressure makes girls and women highly vulnerable to traffi cking and exploitation.

For example, the region\u2019s restrictive immigration policies are often used to harass poor women who try to migrate for work, and are even used to treat them as criminals. On the other hand, these policies have little eff ect on the traffi ckers, who operate at various levels to facilitate cross- border migration as legitimate channels are fast closing. Anti-traffi cking eff orts in the region have focused on sex work, often leading to draconian and repressive policies that have caused great harm to non-traffi cked sex workers. Anti-traffi cking actions are also being used to justify a wide range of measures to suppress sex workers in general, rather than to address the specifi c situations in which people are forced into sex work. As a result, human rights violations are happening in the name of stopping traffi cking. It is commonplace in South-East Asia to deny adequate and appropriate protection to migrants who have suff ered serious rights violations, though under no circumstances should such protection be made conditional, particularly if such conditions can further endanger the person.19 As noted, sex workers and survivors of traffi cking particularly lack human rights protection. For example, counter- traffi cking eff orts consisting of raids, rescue, and detention can restrict civil liberties when handled inappropriately. Thus, traffi cking responses that are not grounded in a rights-based perspective can create more problems than those they seek to ameliorate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "765ec840-65dc-4094-a6e7-82dc36e82c42": {"__data__": {"id_": "765ec840-65dc-4094-a6e7-82dc36e82c42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The South-East Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking: From Vulnerability to Free, Just, and Safe Movement - Summary Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4408333c8459f4b031e785bbe01d4d6051f9ddaf68fc2b64a69b1d4cf9766e31"}, "2": {"node_id": "46b162e0-1b5a-4d53-ae77-c06c2d659826", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c68a55825eaf0763056d0129dab7f2089048b834d2d7466bf621d17ffcf4f483"}}, "hash": "88275d4739334c1c3dd890a4b91a34a58373428ca15495627ab25d0fe804740f", "text": "The anti-traffi cking laws that have been implemented in some countries of the region are ambiguous, and were enacted in haste in response to international pressure.20 They are also often abused or misused to re-victimize the very women they were designed to protect.

In fact, according to Article 24 of Cambodia\u2019s Anti-Trafficking Act, anyone in possession of a condom is deemed to be soliciting sex work; according to Article 10 any organization supporting sex workers is construed as being part of the crime; according to Articles 19 and 20 receiving victims is termed as assisting offenders and is construed a crime; and Articles 23 and 24 term as criminals any person who trains sex workers to negotiate safe sex.21 This reveals yet another dimension of the nexus of human trafficking and HIV: following the enforcement of the anti-trafficking law, more women are reported to be selling sex on the street for fear of police raids of entertainment establishments. This, of course, has only increased the vulnerability of women to trafficking, unsafe sexual practices, and HIV infection. At the time of the Court in 2009, over 500 women had been arrested in Cambodia as a consequence of the anti-trafficking law.22 According to a case study report from Cambodia, there was a 31 percent drop in the sale of condoms and the availability of condoms in entertainment places since the enforcement of the law; the number of women seeking STI testing and treatment at one public clinic dropped by 20 percent; and the number of entertainment workers contacted by NGO outreach workers was down by 10 percent.23 These figures could represent just the beginning of a larger trend with the potential for long-term public health consequences. Role of States, Laws, and Policies For centuries no other sets of issue have been more difficult to address than those raised by the trade in women\u2019s bodies, both within and across borders.24 Though the vulnerabilities of women and girls in the region to trafficking and HIV demand urgent attention, neither has been mainstreamed adequately at the policy or programme level. Governments first need to come out of their denial mode and accept that such atrocities are happening to women. In Indonesia, for example, international migrant workers are often called \u201ceconomic heroes\u201d as they bring in much-needed foreign exchange. Unfortunately, it is the foreign exchange that is appreciated more than the earners, whose needs are largely neglected by their government.

For example, current labour laws in Indonesia do not take any responsibility for the welfare of migrant workers because they have entrusted the whole process of managing and facilitating migration to private recruitment agencies, which charge exorbitant placement and facilitation fees, pushing the migrants into large debt even before they leave their country.26 In Indonesia, efforts to prevent trafficking and protecting migrants focus on tightening border security and preventing certain low-skilled migrants from leaving the country. Women migrants have borne the brunt of these measures, as they are now choosing risky migration options, making 21 Ibid. 22 Ibid. 23 Wiesen. 24 Sadik. 25 Chaowahem. 26 Ibid. 17 SESSION THREE them more vulnerable to abuse as much during transit as at their destination point. Of the 11 countries that make up the South-East Asian region, three have signed or ratifi ed the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families; and seven have signed the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Traffi cking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. But these conventions, which provide the bare minimum support for migrants and traffi cked persons, are not enough.27 Traffi cking must be seen largely as the failure of state policies as well as the consequence of the diminished role of the state, as the testimonials of the women in the Court so forcefully pointed out. Of particular concern is the silence around the deceit and coercion that is continuing without confrontation due to insuffi cient resources allocated by states and law enforcement machinery, and the inertia to prioritize the needs and safety of women who migrate. Because sex workers feel the need to hide from authorities, they often choose not to seek help in protecting themselves from sexually transmitted diseases, and they are overlooked by NGOs that may fear that their interaction with sex workers will criminalize them. Such criminalization also discriminates against HIV-aff ected individuals who may, due to desperation and fear of harassment, continue working in brothels and thereby exacerbate the spread of HIV. And, as transportation of a sex worker also constitutes an off ence, the workers\u2019 freedom of movement is likely to be restricted as well. Thus, the law, which lacks clarity and is highly confusing, is rampantly abused and used more for prosecution than protection, much to the detriment of sex workers and traffi cked women.28 As mentioned above, one issue of concern is re-traffi cking of traffi cked victims. For instance, after bailing out women from detection camps, where they are held after being rescued from brothels or bars, the employers, capitalizing on their vulnerability, force them to work again in sex work or sell them to another location. From the Court testimonials it seems that due to communication problems, lack of time, and the paucity of a national policy to tackle human traffi cking, offi cials hardly take the trouble to fi nd out if the detainees are victims of cross-border traffi cking. To address this issue, anti-traffi cking laws should include such specifi c stipulations as the provision of places of refuge for victims, social welfare protection offi cers, medical and psychosocial care , fast-track legal procedures, a recording of the victim\u2019s evidence of traffi cking, and immunity from prosecution for certain off ences, including illegal migration and false travel documents.29 It is also important to enhance the capacities of those responsible for enforcing the law, notably the police, prosecutors, and judges. They should focus on recognizing the characteristics of human traffi cking, and on understanding the technical provisions and implementation of the law.30 27 Ibid. 28 Ly. 29 Cambodian Women\u2019s Crisis Centre, \u201cTraffi cking of Cambodian Women and Children: Report of the Fact Finding in Malaysia\u201d (2005), pp. 28-29. 30 Ly.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ce6ab46-a194-4753-b1d7-76f7dbca3994": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ce6ab46-a194-4753-b1d7-76f7dbca3994", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The South-East Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking: From Vulnerability to Free, Just, and Safe Movement - Summary Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5487ed817ff82e2a4bdcc6fe528acfc04cc4908fe9767b346fb3c8aa6fea170"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f7d9125-a77c-42ca-a79e-dafb9cf1b98f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc8b4842873851420f39e982ea3e5aa0a684363d4529410d74177858e734b726"}}, "hash": "2a0a761d46adbdf030c7044ef55775780d96842c6c176bb55a22a836a31bbec1", "text": "28-29. 30 Ly.

It is estimated that the situation could potentially lead to a sharp rise in human traffi cking.32 In Thailand, for example, migration and traffi cking have always been cyclical, as the country\u2019s economy is heavily tourist-dependent: when tourist infl ow drops, there is generally a rise in migration and traffi cking. The current fi nancial crisis, however, coupled with such natural calamities as the 2004 tsunami and the 2010 earthquake have resulted in an even more pronounced impact on the levels of both migration and traffi cking.33 31 Taran, \u201cThe Impact of the Financial Crisis on Migrant Workers.\u201d 32 Wiesen. 33 Usa Lerdsrisuntad, Programme Director, Foundation for Women, Thailand, in South-East Asia Court of Women, Bali, 2009. Chanthy\u2019s Story Chanthy had to f nd a job to support her family, and with all avenues of work dried up locally in Cambodia, she went to Malaysia to work in a garment factory, where the employment agent promised her she would receive $200 a month. But once in Malaysia she was sent to work in a brothel, which apparently was connected to the traf cking network. When the brothel was raided, Chanthy was arrested. Not knowing the language, all Chanthy could do in court was to nod her head, and she was sent to jail for six months. Thirteen women arrested from the brothel were put in a small cell that allowed only two of them to sit at any point in time. There were women from all countries \u2013 Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and China \u2013 and no two women spoke the same language. It was only when a local NGO identif ed Chanthy as a victim and after f ve court sittings that she was released. The paperwork took three months to be completed as her agent had arranged for her to cross the border by road without a passport, despite having taken it from her. It is f ve years since Chanthy returned to Cambodia, but the trauma and pain that she endured in Malaysia still lingers. \u201cThe timing of the Court is signifi cant in that the current economic crisis has narrowed the opportunities for formal migration, making women in particular vulnerable to various forms of exploitation, including traffi cking. What is needed is collective and inclusive responses, given the diversity of views that exist on the issue.\u201d Jeff rey O\u2019Malley, Director, HIV/AIDS Practice, UNDP, New York 20 20 KEY ISSUES HIGHLIGHTED IN THE COURT Session Four: Celebrating resistance Eni Lestari Andayani making an expert witness statement. 21 SESSION FOUR The Court heard fi rsthand the stories of many survivors of traffi cking who had lived through exploitation beyond all imagination, and who are now playing a vital role in providing hope, care, support, and advocacy for the benefi t of the many women and girls in similar situations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5864f1c-9fb8-4a34-b7a6-6d110e885efa": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5864f1c-9fb8-4a34-b7a6-6d110e885efa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The South-East Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking: From Vulnerability to Free, Just, and Safe Movement - Summary Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3e95455350cfa64262287948a0d9e56bc7c20ab089b53cdda9dc0efcceb79cb"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1c8351e-ca01-40f7-85d6-2357ca55ff8a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2dc0723b8e01c0222e0e5d6976797f96fe60662c819113fd81444c76e00029b"}}, "hash": "85a5b9ad04e58c3ff58fe9825084d3e0d7fc403a5be512647b3cb19c06b9585a", "text": "It was an inspiration not only to hear of their resistance, endurance, and persistence but also to experience their courage and graciousness of those who willingly appeared before the Court in an eff ort to bring attention to the millions of women who are suff ering similar pain and humiliation in silence.

The testimonials brought out the point that while fi ghting for their rights, the migrant women also had to stand up against the oppressive and exploitative structures that should have, in fact, protected them. Their collective experiences reveal that all of them faced human rights violations as they tried to survive abject poverty. One point that was underscored by several testifi ers, who are now part of an organization fi ghting to protect and uphold the rights of traffi cked women, is that the process of recovery and empowerment becomes more signifi cant and meaningful if personal battles are fought jointly. For example, the Women\u2019s League of Burma is an umbrella organization of 12 entities that work to support and protect the rights of several thousand women traffi cked along the Thailand-Myanmar-India-Bangladesh-China border. Similarly, the Burmese Women\u2019s Union that is based in Thailand works for the empowerment of migrant and refugee women from the Myanmar-China border area. The Cambodian Women Crisis Centre supports and works to uphold the rights of women rescued from traffi cking; and the Positive Action Foundation in the Philippines strives to uphold the rights of migrant women. One point that was forcefully made by all testifi ers was that they survived traffi cking and the extreme pain infl icted upon them primarily through their individual will to make a change for themselves \u2013 and for others who are suff ering like them. They picked themselves up, and with determination challenged the structures that oppress and exploit them.34 The resounding message that comes through from the testimonials of the traffi cking survivors is that with a supportive and enabling environment, \u201cvictims of traffi cking\u201d can be empowered to become \u201csurvivors of traffi cking\u201d \u2013 living with dignity, hope, well-being, and good health. 34 Eni Lestari Andayani, International Migrant Alliance, Hong Kong, and Expert Witness, South-East Asia Court of Women, Bali, 2009. To begin to shift the discourse from one of control and criminalization to one of justice, we need \ufb01 rst to recognize and affi rm the coping and resistance strategies of women a\ufb00 ected by customary practices and disempowering norms and values that put them at the risk of traffi cking and HIV infection. We need to celebrate and build upon the strengths, achievements, and success stories of traffi cking survivors and migrant workers living with HIV who have overcome tremendous diffi culties and have been empowered to lead a positive life with dignity.

Shortly after migrating to Malaysia to work in a factory, Nining was forced into the sex industry. The income, which was much less than what the placement agent had promised, went to her impoverished family back home. When Nining became very sick in Malaysia for no obvious reason, she returned home, paying her employer for breaking her two-year contract. Only after recovering at home and going through the preliminary procedures of returning to work in Malaysia did Nining learn that she tested positive for HIV. Devastated, Nining attempted to end her life. Later, she came into contact with the Partisan Foundation through some other HIV-positive people, and her life changed dramatically. Today, Nining is determined to let no woman suf er from being unaware of the causes and prevention of HIV. Through the Partisan Foundation, she also actively disseminates information about women\u2019s rights, including reproductive rights.

Meme\u2019s Story Forced to marry at a very young age so that her impoverished family would have one mouth less to feed, Meme, from Central Java, was pushed into a life of extreme suf ering by a drug-addict husband. Hoping for a better future after having a child, Meme got set to migrate to Malaysia to work in a factory. The unsuspecting Meme crossed the Indonesia-Malaysia border by road with help from a local placement agent and was sold to a pimp in Malaysia. She had to entertain as many men as the brothel owner brought each day. Meme endured the pain and humiliation until she managed to surreptitiously call one of her friend\u2019s relatives for help. A police raid of the brothel the next day released her, but only to be put in a detention camp. After a few exhausting and arduous days, she returned home, where she discovered that she was HIV-positive. Though pained initially, she was counselled and trained by a local NGO, SPIRITIA, on HIV management. Inspired and determined to protect other women, Meme has now set up Smile Plus, an institution to help women living with HIV. Having reached out to thousands of women in the last three years, \u201cthere is a whole new life I am now experiencing,\u201d says Meme with obvious joy. 23 SESSION FOUR Talking Poleng The Poleng, ref ecting the Balinese point of view towards life, is a checkered cloth that signif es the concept of rwa bhineda, a Balinese view of the mutual dualism that makes up the whole world. It is about two opposites that depend on each other to exist, the yin and yang for harmony and balance. The Talking Poleng expresses the hope, solidarity and triumph of the women who have endured traf cking, violence, exploitation, and HIV. The Talking Poleng ref ects the quest for balance, prosperity and peace. Each testif er from the Court wrote her personal message to the world on a piece of cloth, which was then sewn together to create the Talking Poleng. The Talking Poleng was revealed at the Closing Ceremony of the Court, and then displayed at the Asia Pacif c Community Village Space. 25 JURY STATEMENTS Every jury member who listened to the testimonials of the women who had braved traffi cking, exploitation, and violence expressed their sense of profound admiration and respect.
