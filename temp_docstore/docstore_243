ecision-making positions that is useful for efforts to improve and expand women\u2019s roles in delivering democracy.45 c) Sex-Disaggregated Reporting on HIV/AIDS Efforts are underway to promote greater use of sex-disaggregated data on HIV/AIDS in policy-making where such data can show the gender differences in the transmission and the effect of the disease, thereby prompting gender-responsive action. Between 2008 and 2010, UNDP conducted studies on the socio-economic impact of HIV at the household level in India, China, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Indonesia.46 The sex-disaggregated data provided clear evidence that while more men than women are infected with HIV in the region, women shoulder a disproportionate burden of the disease. For example, the study revealed that an overwhelming majority of female widows from households impacted by HIV in Viet Nam, Indonesia, and India reported being denied a share of her husband\u2019s property and assets. Additionally, girls from HIV-households were far more likely to drop out of school than boys from the same households. The studies have helped with evidence-based programming in these countries. Similar studies are currently being conducted in Myanmar and Papua New Guinea. d) 2010 Asia Pacific Human Development Report on \u201cPower, Voice and Rights\u201d The collection of more complete and reliable data in addition to strengthened capacity for gender analysis was listed as one of eight vital points of the 2010 UNDP Asia-Pacific Human Development Report (APHDR) action agenda. These are essential steps towards formulating policy and programme interventions in the areas of economic power, political voice and legal rights that contribute to gender equality.47 The APHDR has set an impressive precedent for action by compiling data on a number of instrumental but lesser known gender indicators surrounding building economic power (including asset and property ownership, access to credit, and male-female differences in job sectors), promoting women\u2019s political voice (not only the participation rates of women in parliaments, but also within political parties and party leadership roles) and progressing women\u2019s legal rights (reservations to CEDAW, domestic violence legislation, and access to justice). In response to the absence of a consolidated repository that provides official disaggregated data for responsive policy making, the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security (MSDHS), together with UNDP Thailand, launched Thailand\u2019s first Gender- Disaggregated Data and Database Project in 2008. This now provides an integrated database that allows easy access and use of data disaggregated by gender, where information on comparison of women\u2019s status by indicators across provinces was used as reference during preparation of the MSDHS development plan.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5ccb7e1-6ea1-45a4-8b28-ad2c79d65b2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5ccb7e1-6ea1-45a4-8b28-ad2c79d65b2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidance-note-gender-statistics", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidance Note: Gender Statistics", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidance-note-gender-statistics", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f498ba563f441f04bd2a88944982dcdf9eb12f3bc441734100c1d198a0828840"}, "2": {"node_id": "063bfbcd-b792-40ab-8b9f-23354d384e50", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidance-note-gender-statistics", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bd6f2ebfd04931c33990938d7385b2c6cf3d97286a6464f19f65ae007928d73a"}}, "hash": "a12d2dbfeb811df79bd1ff84f246c0032688e627a5ced7f91cb0be747e160542", "text": "The database and associated systems will help Thailand to meet its obligations to international commitments such as the Beijing Declaration and Action Plan, CEDAW, and the MDGs.

So there is a need to collect data, both qualitative and quantitative, on unpaid work, to allow for better understanding of its extent, importance, and characteristics. Time-use surveys are a particularly important means to highlight the issue of women\u2019s unpaid work in addition to illustrating the various issues of informal work and work that is done in tandem with other activities. These surveys need to be undertaken regularly with their results being analysed and strategically disseminated. Giving visibility to unpaid work is a step towards valuing this work and its important contribution to economies and societies. This will help to promote and reach agreement on measures towards a fair distribution of household and care-related tasks between women and men, and addressing the consequences of unequal distribution of unpaid work through national policies. Regional initiatives such as the South Asian Association for Regional Coopertaion (SAARC) Gender Info Base could be supported and replicated.49 The Gender Info Base is a repository for both qualitative and quantitative data, its objective being to act as a comprehensive database of regional gender-related information that anyone can access. Under this initiative, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India have each conducted time-use surveys, recognizing that many activities carried out by women both at home and in the informal economy fall outside the scope of conventional data-gathering. Such surveys have provided a more nuanced understanding of women\u2019s economic contribution, enabling a higher level of gender analysis and allowing for improved monitoring of policy impact and thus improving the accuracy of predicting potential policy outcomes.50 Specifically, in the case of Pakistan, these surveys showed the macroeconomic implications of unpaid care work by comparing the time it took women and men to access public and private education and health services in urban and rural areas.51 National statistical organizations require further support to mainstream such surveys as a regular instrument. Ways Forward To fully realize the potential impact of gender statistics in the design, delivery, and monitoring of government services as well as development programmes, further efforts are needed to increase the quality, dissemination and use of gender statistics and sex-disaggregated data. Areas where more data collection and analysis are needed include gender-based violence, the male-female gap in assets ownership, and measuring women\u2019s unpaid work. In the case of cross-border migration, improved sex- disaggregated data collection requires the sharing of data between origin, destination countries and sub-national regions. Further work is necessary in all of the thematic areas mentioned above. For example, in the Pacific a multi-country study was carried out with UNFPA funding based on the WHO research protocol on Domestic Violence and Women's Health also covering sexual violence.52 UNDP could spearhead an analytical report that specifically examines the depth of violence against women in selected countries to highlight the severity of the situation as well as advocate for change. The findings of such reports could then be used to inform policy responses. At the national level, all ministries should take responsibility for the collection, monitoring and analysis of sex-disaggregated data, especially but not limited to matters that are of particular concern to 14 GENDER STATISTICS women. Ministries such as agriculture, commerce, education, finance, health, industry, infrastructure and labour should promote the availability and use of sex-disaggregated data and feed the resulting data into official statistical systems. This will require prioritization and political will by the whole of government, especially by departments responsible for fiscal matters. Additionally, the sustainability of such data projects is essential. Training for responsible government organizations and strengthening institutional capacity needs to be supported with long-term financial commitment so that sex- disaggregated data are used to underpin gender mainstreaming activities with sustainable results. For such institutional changes to be sustainable, attitudes must also change, both among officials within institutions and in society at large. Assessing gaps and change through measurement is part of building and strengthening results-oriented attitudes, because sex-disaggregated data reveal whether development efforts have had and are having positive results for both women and men.53 If women and girls benefit less from development than men and boys due to the persistence of discrimination and bias, then MDG achievement is likely to suffer. Advocacy efforts are therefore also an important aspect in developing an understanding as well as demand for resources to be channelled towards improved sex-disaggregated data.

There have been a number of commendable efforts to mainstream gender issues in UNDP\u2019s five thematic areas and in specific regional and country programmes as detailed in the \u2018Emerging UNDP Good Practices\u2019. However, these tend to be somewhat isolated successes that depend on individual efforts rather than on a systematic and sustainable approach. In addition to training, networking between different Country Offices, National Statistical Offices, Ministries and other organizations is a valuable tool, allowing individuals to draw on a range of experiences in order to improve their gender mainstreaming efforts. It is evident from these activities that improved and expanded collection of sex-disaggregated data through national statistical systems needs to go hand in hand with improved reporting, analysis, dissemination and active use of the resulting analysis. Capacity development of statistical literacy among policy makers is critical and should be built into all actions to advance corporate priorities. Gender statistics are also most beneficial when incorporated across a country\u2019s policy framework. They help to support sustainable policy and programme design, monitor the achievement of equitable results for women and men from all backgrounds, as well as strengthen our understanding of the position of men and women from different backgrounds. 15 GENDER STATISTICS Notes 1 Gender mainstreaming is the process of integrating a gender perspective into all aspects of institutions and programmes, with the aim of achieving gender equality.

Last accessed on 31 July 2013 at http://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/conceptsandefinitions.htm. 3 In this note, we mostly use the term sex-disaggregated data, since sex is a constant category that lends itself to statistical break-down, whereas gender is a concept that by its very definition changes through time as well as across cultures and hence is not static. However, when quoting other agencies, we have respected their use of the term gender-disaggregated statistics. 4 More information about the correlation between gender inequality and human development, and about the purpose, strengths and weaknesses of the GII can be found at http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/gii/. 5 MDG 3 is to \u2018promote gender equality and empower women\u2019. The target is to \u2018eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and in all levels of education no later than 2015\u2019. The indicators for measuring progress include: 3.1 Ratios of girls to boys in primary secondary and tertiary education; 3.2 The share of women in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector; 3.3 The proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments; and 3.4 The ratio of literate females to males if 15-24 year olds.

Types of Data: \uf0b7 Quantitative data, usually numerical in form, commonly are drawn from a large number of cases of units of analysis to compare and analyze the widest possible range of values across the cases. In this way, the structure of the data can be inferred, as well as homogenous generalizations produced that answer descriptive questions. \uf0b7 Qualitative data, usually non-numerical in form, consist of words, text, photographs, videos, sound recordings and the like. Although they are commonly drawn from a small number of cases, emphasizing the complexity and heterogeneity of the data to produce answers to explanatory analytical questions, qualitative data can cover whole populations, and so can be representative. The distinction between quantitative and qualitative data can however be very arbitrary.

Data Analysis There are many ways of analyzing data. Both quantitative and qualitative evidence presented numerically can be analyzed to understand how a variable varies. Variation can be numerical, but it can also be categorical, as variations across groups of variables are brought together on the basis of qualitative of criteria. 20 GENDER STATISTICS Indicators Indicators are evidence constructed from statistics or a data series. They are assembled to monitor and enable comparisons (between countries or across time) of selected areas of social and economic life. Indicators are standardised or have clear reference points. SMART indicators are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound; they can come from quantitative sources (censuses, labour force surveys, and administrative records) and from qualitative sources (focus groups, participant observation, qualitative fieldwork, and attitude surveys/interviews). Composite Indices Composite indices are numbers derived from a combination of various indicators, on the basis of an underlying model a multi-dimensional concept being measured. One important index is the Human Development Index (HDI). Source: UNDP Gender Team and Asia Pacific Regional Centre (2012).

The toolkit was prepared based on an unpublished \u201cResource Book for Human Development Impact Assessment (HDIA) of Trade Policy,\u201d written by Cecilia Oh, Yumiko Yamamoto, and Chatrini Weerantunge under the Asia Pacific Trade and Investment initiative (APTII) at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Regional Centre in Colombo in September 2008. The Resource Book drew broadly from an unpublished background study, prepared by Gerald Epstein and Rodney Schmidt for APTII, \u201cHuman Development Impact Assessment: Resource Book\u201d, dated February 2007, and from \u201cHuman Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policies,\u201d a concept note for programme development on trade and human development issues, prepared by Mumtaz Keklik and Emel Memis for APTII in 2005. The Resource Book also has adapted ideas and elements from existing literature on impact assessment, such as the World Bank\u2019s Poverty and Social Impact Analyses, the European Commission\u2019s Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)\u2019s tools for the Integrated Assessment of Trade-Related Policies (UNEP 2002), Women\u2019s Edge Coalition\u2019s Trade Impact Review (Gammage et al. 2002), and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\u2019s Promoting Pro-Poor Growth: Practical Guide to Ex-Ante Poverty Impact Assessment (2007).

Introduction This Toolkit for a Human Development Impact Assessment (HDIA) of Trade Policy aims to mainstream human development concerns into domestic policy-making through a participatory approach. Through demonstrating the likely or existing effects of a particular trade policy on people\u2019s lives, the HDIA may facilitate a greater understanding among policy-makers of the implications of their decisions while creating awareness of the same among, and support of, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs); and thereby foster greater and more informed debate on those decisions of trade policy. The concept of HDIA was put forward originally by the 2003 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report, Making Global Trade Work for People. The report \u2013 asserting that trade liberalization can have differential impacts for different countries and for different groups within countries \u2013 called for an analysis of current and future implications for human development of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements in various countries. A key message was that an evaluation of the multilateral trade regime should be based on whether it maximizes the possibilities for human development with a particular emphasis on developing countries. It further suggested that a HDIA would permit WTO members to estimate the \u2018real\u2019 implementation costs of current and proposed agreements, which otherwise would remain hidden and invisible in more conventional trade analyses. These HDIA outcomes could also inform future trade negotiations and ensure that trade agreements meet human development standards. The UNDP report, however, did not propose a methodology for the HDIA, save to suggest that the assessment should be conducted in an independent and impartial manner. 1.1 The need for an assessment of the human development impact of trade policy Although the proposal of the UNDP report has not been taken up in the WTO, it does not preclude individual countries from independently conducting a HDIA of their trade policies. Indeed, for several reasons there is an increasing need for a HDIA of trade policy to be undertaken. In the Asia-Pacific context, the need to understand the impact of trade on human development is illustrated by the remarkable, but unequal, growth in the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c96494cf-1efc-4f35-8029-1765e8625a67": {"__data__": {"id_": "c96494cf-1efc-4f35-8029-1765e8625a67", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7496c7cb09adbfc2d689c7d08d2fec9b025b5ddc0462b178a6e5784be431af4"}, "2": {"node_id": "7bdcc2ca-76ab-4ee8-a948-92d2eefc0b03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a205678bb1db1179a99b175e444829768ec46de9662c178328605e0d29df568d"}}, "hash": "18b1b8d175dbe31b8480b83a3069f5f3228738a1bbf038e03979adc800fd1fdb", "text": "Over the past two decades the region has witnessed the fastest economic growth in the world, with an average annual growth of gross domestic product (GDP) of over 7 percent during the period 1990\u20132003 (UNDP 2006).

There is little doubt that trade and financial flows are key underpinnings of much of the economic growth seen in the region. In 1990\u20132003, trade as a percentage of GDP increased from 45 to 81 percent for East Asia and the Pacific, and from 20 to 34 percent in South Asia (UNDP 2006). Yet the trade-led growth has not led to rapid poverty reduction and human development improvements across the region. Progress in reducing poverty varies widely among the sub-regions. For example, South Asia still accounts for 43 percent of the world\u2019s poor; and UNDP (2006) further notes that one of the most disturbing outcomes of the rapid increase in trade in the region is the rise of income inequality. Moreover, more than 20 percent of the South Asian population and 12 percent of the total population in East Asia and the Pacific are undernourished. Nearly 25 percent of East Asia and the Pacific still lack access to improved water access (ibid.). The Asian experience shows the potential of international trade to facilitate \u201ca two-way virtuous relationship between human development and economic growth,\u201d but highlights that a selective and strategic economic integration into the global economy is required to ensure this realization (Malhotra 2008). Given the prominence and prevalence of trade liberalization in the development strategies of virtually all developing countries, there is a demand for a clear assessment of the effects of new trade policies, as well as the strategies needed to ensure the so-called \u201cvirtuous relationship\u201d between human development and economic growth. 1.2 An analytical framework This toolkit, therefore, seeks to operationalize the concept of the HDIA in the context of an analytical framework by which policy-makers, trade officials, researchers, and CSOs in a country may identify the potential impact of a change in trade policy by focusing more directly on the promotion of widely shared human development principles. A methodology is suggested by which such linkages between trade and the relevant aspects of human development can be made, and through which a number of indicators that reflect the trade-related impacts on human development can be identified. 2 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit It is acknowledged that this is neither an easy nor exact task, since it is difficult enough to assess the actual impact of trade policy on income and growth. So far, a number of impact assessment tools have been developed to evaluate policy changes, including trade policy changes; however, such tools narrowly focus on economic growth, trade access, or the environment. This toolkit considers the broad range of impacts that these policy changes can have on the array of factors that affect human development or the effects they have on particular groups, such as women, farmers, or rural/ urban populations. The toolkit draws from the various impact analysis methodologies and approaches available, including the World Bank\u2019s Poverty and Social Impact Analyses, the European Commission\u2019s Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)\u2019s tools for the Integrated Assessment of Trade-Related Policies (UNEP 2002a), Women\u2019s Edge Coalition\u2019s Trade Impact Review (Gammage et al. 2002), and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\u2019s Promoting Pro-Poor Growth: Practical Guide to Ex-Ante Poverty Impact Assessment. There is as yet no single methodology for the analysis and assessment of the impact of trade on human development. The interaction between trade and human development is not straightforward. Rather, the relationship is a complex one, and demands an understanding of the intricacies of trade policy and the concept of human development within the specific context of a country, its economy, and its development policy. The HDIA is intended to assess and determine the human development outcomes of a trade policy change. A HDIA can go further, in that it does not take the trade policy change as an end in itself and, as such, explicitly questions the feasibility of a trade policy from a human development perspective. Hence, the HDIA is not merely an assessment of how trade policy affects key human development variables but also a means to identify measures that can facilitate the positive impacts or ameliorate the negative effects of the change. 1.3 HDIA procedure The HDIA of trade policy is not merely an analytical tool. The process of conducting HDIA is itself a form of capacity development in that it creates awareness of the linkage between trade and human development. It also encourages national ownership, which is crucial to effectively incorporate the policy recommendations that result from the HDIA into the process of national policy-making.

In many developing countries no reliable statistics at the household and sectoral level are available; hence, the socio-economic status of the affected group is not easily obtained. Their needs for better work and living environments can be gathered in the form of surveys and focus group meetings, if not already available from existing statistics or studies, and incorporated into the HDIA for fostering policy-making discussion. The interactive national forums, such as stakeholder meeting, are also important to validate the HDIA results and discuss the steps towards policy changes. The role of non-state actors such as Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs), industrial and producer\u2019s group, consumers\u2019 group, grassroots organizations, women\u2019s group, and academia is a key for success in this context. Choudhary et al. (2009), which reviewed the role of the non-state actors in trade negotiations in Asian countries1, found that the involvement of the non-state actors helped raise the awareness and capacity of various stakeholders through analysis and the simplification of the technical content and language of the trade agreements. It also helped to address possible impacts on the domestic economy. 1 There are three cases reviewed. The Philippine case study presents how the non-state actors such as rice farmers groups, their support NGOs, and people\u2019s organizations worked in coordinated matter against liberalization of rice industry with the proposal of lifting the quantitative restrictions and applying tariffs on rice imports. The Nepal case study highlights of an instance of the benefits of the government working together with the NGOs during the process of the WTO accession. The Thai case study documents the activities of the FTA WATCH \u2013 an organization comprising academic institutions, grassroots organizations and NGOs with the objective of advocating the civil society concerns from the Thai FTA negotiations. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 3 To some extent the involvement of non-state actors in influencing the trade policy formulation process has been successful. One famous example is the collapse of the 1999 WTO Ministerial Conference in the face of massive public disapproval, which was followed by the introduction of the WTO Doha Development Agenda. However, the involvement of non-state actors in decision-making process is yet to be firmly institutionalized. Even at the state level, consultation on trade policy and coordination of trade and development goals among different ministries and between ministries and the parliament has not been institutionalized. For example, in the case of the Japan- Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), the entry into force had been delayed for two years because some concerns over the environmental and social impact of the trade agreement were raised by the Philippines Senate during the process of ratification. Bernabe (2009) argues that multi-stakeholder consultations with the private sector, academia, and NGOs in the process of policy formulation could have produced a more development-oriented outcome of the EPA, as well as a speedy implementation of the agreement. Therefore, a central coordinating mechanism that can evaluate the competing sectoral interests and priorities and develop a coherent and balanced negotiating agenda and position is considered necessary in developing countries (Choudhary et al. 2009). The HDIA can be the first step towards the establishment of such a mechanism that can embed stakeholder consultation on trade and development within a national development strategy. One challenge that developing countries face is the lack of both financial and human resources in order to institutionalize the HDIA exercises and its monitoring mechanism. The HDIA of trade policy can be conducted at any stage of the process of policy change or trade negotiation (both ex-ante and ex-post analysis will be discussed below), and can be conducted as a stand-alone exercise as much as necessary. Examples of this are the UNDP Projects on the HDIA of the expiry of WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), and Nepal, and the HDIA of the WTO Accession in Mongolia. It can be also conducted as part of the country\u2019s Diagnostic Trade Integrated Study (DTIS) under the Enhanced Integrated Framework or of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) so as to mainstream the human development approach in such integrated studies. For example, Cambodia\u2019s 2007 DTIS analyzed the key challenges and opportunities for export development and sustainable human development of 19 products with export potential. The DTIS, with legal and institutional action plan, served as the basis for formulating and implementing the trade policy and trade sector development strategy within", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92452cce-8be0-49ab-acea-80a9c16d8fd6": {"__data__": {"id_": "92452cce-8be0-49ab-acea-80a9c16d8fd6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4530898d4344f8d7eae6ad53fca93ab87f8f0dd2a11a71df64bbcfff071abd1"}}, "hash": "c4530898d4344f8d7eae6ad53fca93ab87f8f0dd2a11a71df64bbcfff071abd1", "text": "the Royal Government of Cambodia. 1.4 Organization of toolkit This toolkit is the first attempt to outline the key concept of the HDIA of trade policy. The contents of the toolkit will be verified by those users who will implement the HDIA in respective countries, and it is expected that it will be revised in the future as more HDIA case studies and experiences enrich the quality of the guide. Specific examples of the HDIA exercise mentioned in this guide are limited to the cases from Asia, where the HDIA projects were first initiated by UNDP. However, the needs and concept of the HDIA are applicable for countries in other regions as well. The toolkit is organized as follows: Chapter 2 discusses the inter-linkages between trade and human development, and examines the methodology by which their relationship can be mapped out to enable an analysis of the impact of trade on human development. Chapter 3 discusses the suggested steps and checklist in conducting the HDIA. Chapter 4 summarizes key lessons learned from the experiences of the HDIA in the Asia-Pacific. The toolkit is intended for people who involve in trade negotiations. They are government officials from Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other relevant Ministries, and development practitioners and researchers who would assist the trade negotiation process in the country by providing technical support. However, it is used to turn information about trade and human development into practical action. Therefore, the toolkit is also intended to enable people and CSOs who wish to bring a human development perspective in trade agreements and policies to apply what is learned to their advocacy and capacity development activities. 4 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 2. Developing a conceptual framework for assessing the human development impact of trade policy In the Preamble to the Marrakesh Agreement,2 which established the WTO, WTO Members recognized that: their relations in the field of trade and economic endeavour should be conducted with a view to raising standards of living, ensuring full employment and a large and steadily growing volume of real income and effective demand, and expanding the production of and trade in goods and services, while allowing for the optimal use of the world\u2019s resources in accordance with the objective of sustainable development, seeking both to protect and preserve the environment and to enhance the means for doing so in a manner consistent with their respective needs and concerns at different levels of economic development \u2026. From this Preamble it may be inferred that the role of trade liberalization \u2013 for which the WTO has become the principal driver \u2013 is to provide a means for the achievement of higher standards of living, full employment, and sustainable development. Therefore, the ultimate aim of trade should be a sustainable and equitable development that brings about overall improvements in human welfare. 2.1 The relationship between trade and human development Conventional wisdom links trade to human development through economic growth (UNDP 2003). However, while trade can be a powerful source of economic growth, there is no automatic relationship between growth and human development. And while economic growth is a necessary condition for human development by expanding the material base for fulfilling human needs, economic growth alone is insufficient condition for human development. Economic growth that is employment-led and broad-based will raise the average household income and consumption. However, to the extent that human needs are met depends on resource allocations and the creation of opportunities for all segments of the population. Additional income can raise the level of human capabilities if it is spent on such areas as education, improved nutrition, and health care. Furthermore, there will be positive human development outcomes when economic growth and rising incomes contribute to an increase in government spending, and if such spending is directed towards reducing income inequalities, enhancing education and health care systems, and addressing gender inequality. Where rapid economic growth is not properly managed, however, it can result in or further exacerbate income and wealth inequalities across different social categories. There is growing recognition that greater economic growth alone may not necessarily lead to greater and more broadly shared human development, and that it should rather be regarded as a means to achieve developmental and human ends. Indeed, the failure to see that trade and other economic policies are means rather than ends can \u201ccrowd-out\u201d policies more likely to achieve significant advances in human development. This is especially true if countries adopt institutions and policies from abroad without first making sure they are conducive to advances in human development at home", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d071995a-6cef-49db-9484-be370f625724": {"__data__": {"id_": "d071995a-6cef-49db-9484-be370f625724", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c4f040a5022cd08204b42382ecab8fda8597ba1cf3050e3054cde375d998c79"}, "3": {"node_id": "82e1885a-151c-429a-aeff-a1d00d3ef3a4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81fd9f48a660194cd01e049bbc274d62ef40b48ec4bd0e18fedb275532322047"}}, "hash": "af23710e971dbea432861ed9eca5006df7c2d3af34f236dd9a81729e6fd44040", "text": "(Rodrik, 2001). Therefore, well-balanced strategies, incorporating elements of both pro-growth and human development-oriented policies, are required to ensure a mutually-supportive relationship between growth and human development (Ranis and Stewart 2005). There are empirical evidences that trade liberalization, by itself, might not contribute significantly to human development, especially if these policies are not accompanied by other measures. Harrison (2007), for example, reports on a number of empirical studies that suggest that trade reforms alone cannot reduce poverty and inequality unless it is accompanied by complementary policies, such as improvements in social safety nets and poor farmer\u2019s access to credit, technical know- how, and other inputs. Much other work, such as Stiglitz and Charleton (2005), finds similar impacts. Given the prominence and prevalence of trade liberalization in the development strategies of virtually all developing countries, there is a demand for a clear assessment of the effects of trade policies, as well as the strategies needed to ensure the so-called \u201cvirtuous relationship\u201d between human development and economic growth. 2 Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (1994), available at: www.wto.org. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 5 2.2 The scope of trade policies in HDIA The multilateral trade disciplines of the WTO have made deep inroads into areas previously seen as unconnected to trade. The WTO\u2019s jurisdiction now covers the so-called behind the border areas, such as services and Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), in addition to trade in goods. International trade regulation has extended its reach to production processes and, with this, the attendant consequence of having a more direct impact on the livelihoods and lives of individuals. For example, the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) requires the Member countries to enact a system of protecting plant varieties such as seeds and genetic resources either by patents or by an effective sui generis (meaning of its own kind) system or by any combination thereof (Article 27.3 (b)). Patent is a legal device that award exclusive monopoly rights for creators or innovators. Protection of plant varieties by patent, for example, could prohibit or limit farmer\u2019s ability to exchange or re-use seeds. This threatens traditional farming practices, food security, and agro-biodiversity. The similar broadening and deepening of the ambit of regional and bilateral trade arrangements also calls for a systematic assessment of the human development impacts of trade policy carried out by governments to meet their various trade obligations. Therefore, it should be noted that \u2018trade policy\u2019 in this book does not refer to trade liberalization per se nor traditional trade measure such as tariff rates. The HDIA suggests examining the ensemble of trade policies, including various trade agreements and measures on goods, agriculture, services, investment, IPRs, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, rules of origin, safeguard measures, subsidies, and so on, as necessary. Trade policies at the unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral level can be assessed. If the country is in the process of WTO accession, the HDIA of the WTO agreement would be useful to assist the country\u2019s negotiation strategy in line with development goals. A country can also conduct an ex-post HDIA of its WTO accession in order to monitor development impacts and to suggest trade, economic, and social policies to meet human development challenges, as required (e.g., Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Mongolia and UNDP Mongolia 2009). The human development impacts of Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) and Regional Trade Agreement (RTA) can likewise be assessed, and assessments by sector (e.g., manufacturing sector such as textiles and clothing or basic service sector such as health) or by negotiation category (e.g., negative or sensitive list3 in agriculture and investment) can be examined. Unilateral (domestic) trade policies as well as trade-related industrial policy \u2013 such as the set-up of an export process zone \u2013 can be also examined as part of decision-making process. In this way, the HDIA could lead to a debate over how to maximize the development benefits of new trade policies, minimize the costs of trade liberalization, or estimate the adjustment costs, and thus, make trade policy making more transparent and consultative.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82e1885a-151c-429a-aeff-a1d00d3ef3a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "82e1885a-151c-429a-aeff-a1d00d3ef3a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c4f040a5022cd08204b42382ecab8fda8597ba1cf3050e3054cde375d998c79"}, "2": {"node_id": "d071995a-6cef-49db-9484-be370f625724", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af23710e971dbea432861ed9eca5006df7c2d3af34f236dd9a81729e6fd44040"}}, "hash": "81fd9f48a660194cd01e049bbc274d62ef40b48ec4bd0e18fedb275532322047", "text": "2.3 The concept and indicators of Human Development Since the first Human Development Report was published in 1990, human development has become an important concept in economic policy discussions globally.

Hence, people are the centre of the human development analysis. Human development has two perspectives. One is the formation of human capabilities, which reflects the combinations of functioning \u2013 being and doing \u2013 in which one sees the value and has reasons to value, for example, improved health, knowledge, and skills (ibid.). The other is the real opportunity to accomplish what one values, whether it is economic, political, social, or cultural, by using these acquired capabilities. The HDIA, therefore, needs not only to assess whether people are the beneficiaries of (trade-led) economic growth but also whether trade reform ensures that people have equitable access to human opportunities so that they become the agents of development: 3 Negative list refers to \u201ca list of items, entities, products and the like to which the agreement will not apply, on the understanding that the agreement applies to everything else\u201d in an international agreement (UNDP 2006, p. xxvii). 6 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit Do they participate in economic growth as well as benefit from it? Do they have full access to the opportunities of expanded trade? Are their choices enlarged or narrowed by new technologies? Is economic expansion leading to job-led growth or jobless growth? Are budgets being balanced without unbalancing the lives of future generations? Are \u201cfree\u201d markets open to all people? Are we increasing the options only of the present generation or also of the future generations? -Haq (2003), pp. 20\u201321. Unlike gross national product, which focuses primarily on the quantity of economic growth, the human development concept is broad and open-ended in order to capture the quality and distribution of growth and its impact on overall human welfare. Many of the key components of human development \u2013 such as health, knowledge, and standard of living \u2013 need to be measured against a different yardstick. Human rights share \u201ca common motivation\u201d (UNDP 2000) with human development and can help refine the yardstick. Human rights standards (e.g. the right to education, the right to work, the right to health) can help us define desired outcomes or impacts \u2013 for example by assessing whether three key dimensions of social, cultural and economic rights are being fulfilled: Is work available but also accessible and of a decent quality? In addition, human rights principles (e.g. accountability, participation and non-discrimination) can help ensure a focus on the development process \u2013 for example by addressing questions such as: Who is responsible for and involved in decision-making? Who is left out and are there means of remedy for those? Since the \u201ccombination of the perspectives of human development and human rights gives us something that neither can provide alone\u201d (UNDP 2000), an effort has been made to integrate the two throughout this tool. 2.3.1 Indicators of human development The issues of what are the appropriate indicators of human development and how to measure human poverty or development remain an on-going discussion. UNDP\u2019s Human Development Reports (HDRs) have been using a composite index based on multi-dimensional welfare indicators. This widely-used measurement, the Human Development Index (HDI), captures the average performance of a country along three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. The indicators used to measure these dimensions are life expectancy at birth; education index based on adult literacy rate and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary education gross enrolment ratio; and adjusted GDP per capita respectively. It is acknowledged that these three components alone cannot capture the full scope and complexity of human development. Over the years, additional indicators have been created. In1995 gender indices \u2013 namely, the Gender Development Index (GDI) and Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) \u2013 have been added to the HDRs. In 1997 the Human Poverty Index, which measures deprivations in the basic dimensions of human development, was added. UNDP (2010) introduced a Gender Inequality Index, which replaced GDI and GEM. Other indicators such as inequality-adjusted HDI and multidimensional poverty index were also introduced.

HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 7 Trade policy change is expected to have an impact on various stakeholders through a number of transmission channels: e.g., prices, production/trade volume, budgetary distribution, and legal and regulatory framework. Each trade change is likely to have impacts through more than one such channel. For example, tariff reduction could have direct impacts on price of commodities as well as trade revenues. While determining causal relationships and channels of influence from trade policy to human development outcomes can present difficult conceptual challenges, it seems plausible to suggest that trade policy impacts can be analysed through their effects on the four essential pillars of human development \u2013 namely, productivity, equality, sustainability, and empowerment (Haq 2003). All these four dimensions are interrelated, as you will see below. Ideally, an examination of a set of the indicators would include each of the four components.5 2.3.2 Four pillars of human development A non-exhaustive category of indicators is summarized in Table 2.1. Trade indicators and other relevant data and questionnaires used in literature on the measurement of human development are summarized in Annex 1 for reference. Table 2.1: Linking trade reform with human development Productivity Equity Sustainability Empowerment Capability Enabling people to participate in the growth process.

Preservation of developmental achievements. Power to control or change one\u2019s life. Examples of indicator category Those related to physical and mental well-being of the people (e.g., health, nutrition, education, and access to relevant and appropriate technologies, training, and skills building). Employment, income, and access disparities between and among social groups (e.g., women and men), and disparities between and among geographical areas or regions. - Community well-being (e.g., protection of traditional knowledge and cultural resources, environmental sustainability). - Distribution of increased trade-related revenue to expenditures on social welfare programs. - Time-use. - Participation in decision- making processes at various levels. - Right to seek employment on equal basis with others. - Ability to hold property and to have property rights on an equal basis with others. The productivity component can be defined as that related to improvement of human capabilities, as an end in itself and as a means for people to participate in economic growth as well as to benefit from it. In this respect, productivity includes advances in health, education, and labour force capabilities among the groups most likely to be affected by trace policy change such as consumers, service users, workers, farmers and so on. In terms of how trade and trade-led growth can affect 5 See Asia Trade Initiative (2003). 8 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit productivity, the linkage can be expressed as investment in health, education, and skills of the people afforded by trade policy change. In this case, the indicators linking productivity include: enhanced access to health care, education, relevant and appropriate technologies, training and skills building. For example, questions to be asked are: A. How is the TRIPS Agreement\u2019s provision of pharmaceutical patent protection likely to affect people\u2019s access to pharma- ceutical drugs as a result of increased prices of pharmaceutical drugs or limited supply of generic drugs (see 3.2.2)?; and B. Does the establishment of export-oriented industries not only create new jobs but also provide safe work environment and opportunities for workers to obtain better skills? As mentioned earlier, trade policy change can have different impacts on different groups of people or regions; hence, the equality component must be assessed. Equality as a component of human development involves the \u201cprogressive equalization of access to opportunity for all members of society\u201d (Montes and Memis, 2005).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9384932-1aa0-480f-bcfe-221d7192d037": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9384932-1aa0-480f-bcfe-221d7192d037", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cbeabec7c1f0fcca2fd76b1496008c6655e3483584c1a079377a9133fe0d1462"}, "2": {"node_id": "83243122-fd4f-46f4-884f-2a0dfa9b6268", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e54b598a7c5d8444b4ca9d8c66ac5db9944253cf72e512d7459399772d7aacd4"}}, "hash": "1870bfbbc4db47c059889b81c34dfec768e887ed1dbc64986cd05bc41d8a992a", "text": "If initial conditions of income, assets, and job distribution, as well as access to credit, education/trainings, and health care services, are inequitable, a trade policy change may not bring better outcomes to the disadvantaged groups.

Given the examples above, we can ask, for example: A. How does the impact of adoption of the TRIPS Agreement differ on people\u2019s access to pharmaceutical drugs by their social class? In a country where the universal health care does not exist, increased price of the pharmaceutical drugs is expected to lower the poor people\u2019s access to the drugs. See 3.2.2; and B. Does the establishment of export-oriented oriented industries create employment and opportunity for skill develop- ment in rural area, which is usually lagged behind urban area economically? Sustainability is a key component of human development, based on the governing of physical, human, financial, and environmental resources in a manner that does not compromise the ability of future generations from improving their welfare. The relationship between sustainability and trade can be expressed as the ability to maintain or preserve developmental achievements. Higher income is important, as it is crucial for helping individuals, households, and communities achieve their goals and improve the quality of their lives. But if higher economic growth is accompanied by negative effects such as a degraded environment, less security, food insecurity, depletion of human resources because of exploitative terms of paid work and/or inadequate provision of care, and/or at the expense of future generations, then rapid trade-led economic growth will not necessarily contribute to human development. Within the trade context, indicators that may offer a measurement of this component might include: community well-being, including protection of traditional knowledge and cultural resources; environmental sustainability; distribution of trade-related revenue to social expenditures on education, health, and social welfare programs; a well-balanced lifestyle between paid and non-paid work; and leisure activities. In terms of empowerment, this component addresses people\u2019s capability to shape processes and events that affect their lives in terms of both the economic and socio-political/cultural aspects. In relation to trade policy change, the notion of empowerment can be expressed in terms of economic security and the ability to engage effectively and participate actively in decision-making processes that have an impact on one\u2019s livelihood. In this context, relevant indicators that may reflect the impact of trade would include participation of men and women who are likely to be affected by trade policy change in decision-making processes at various levels; the ability to hold property and to have property rights on an equal basis with others; and the right to seek employment on an equal basis with others. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 9 As we have made clear, the HDIA is intended to assess and determine the human development outcomes of a trade policy change. However, as we have also seen, a HDIA can go further in that it does not take trade policy change as an end in itself but, rather, explicitly questions the feasibility of a trade policy from a human development perspective. Hence, the aim is not merely an assessment of how trade policy affects key human development variables but also to identify measures that can facilitate the positive effects and/or ameliorate the negative effects of the change. The HDIA process will thus need to identify the specific trade policy to be assessed and the stakeholders upon whom it will have, or most likely have, an impact. The common characteristics of a HDIA process are6: \u2022\ufffd Assessing the feasibility of a particular trade policy change from a human development perspective. This means that the assessment does not take any policy option as a given, but instead analyses its human development implications. \u2022\ufffd Identifying both the positive and negative human development implications of a trade policy change, and recommending measures or policy changes that can realize the former and mitigate the latter. \u2022\ufffd A participatory exercise such as town hall meetings, surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions aimed at bringing together all relevant stakeholders and representatives of groups most likely affected by the policy or reform. The broad participation of all stakeholders will enrich the assessment and provide it with a comprehensive view of policy impacts. It may for example influence the choice of indicators used in the assessment, giving visibility to aspects that would otherwise be neglected by \u2018policy-makers.\u2019 Through demonstrating likely or existing effects of a trade policy or reform, the HDIA can facilitate a greater understanding among policy-makers of the implications of their decisions, give voice and representation to the stakeholders, and foster debate on those decisions. In this manner, the outcomes of a HDIA can mainstream human development concerns into domestic policy-making.

This may go some ways in helping to build and preserve the human development \u201cpolicy space\u201d for governments \u2013 that is, the ability of governments to make policies without being constrained by political or international legal forces \u2013 at trade negotiations. 3.1 Basic questions about the HDIA of trade policy This section addresses such basic questions about the HDIA of trade as what should be assessed, when and how a HDIA should be undertaken, and who should do so. 3.1.1 WHAT should be assessed? In terms of what policies to assess, this would encompass the range of trade policies that have been necessitated by the obligations and commitments under the WTO, those that are implemented by the government unilaterally, and those undertaken in response to commitments under BTAs and/or RTAs. This process can be comprehensive or specific, depending on the dimension and impact of the prospected policy change. Where a fundamental trade policy change has taken place, a comprehensive assessment is appropriate. A HDIA of a country\u2019s accession to the WTO is one example of a comprehensive assessment, since WTO accession will require a substantial policy and institutional shift. Such trade policy changes affect the range of human development components in various ways. As for the impacts on workers, producers, and traders, changes in market access for the import and export of goods and services might be a key issue. For example, imports of staple food that are produced domestically is often out of the list for liberalization because of concerns over food security and livelihood of farmers, particularly small farmers 6 These characteristics draw from a list suggested in Keklik and Memis (2005). 7 What we are aiming at is similar to civil society organization\u2019s effort to create awareness among media, consumer\u2019s groups and policy makers of the likely effect of patents on the accessibility and affordability of essential drugs so as to influence the country\u2019s negotiation position for free trade agreements. 3. Human development impact assessment of trade policy 10 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit and women farmers who lack access to credit and agricultural inputs. Commitments made under the WTO accession or regional free-trade arrangements may lead to a change in the legal, institutional, and regulatory systems of the member country. They are also likely to affect the policy space available to the government in terms of both trade and domestic economic and social policies. For instance, the WTO requires all member countries to enact the investment law that does not discriminate between private domestic and foreign investors. Thus, a country acceding to the WTO should examine the impacts of the WTO accession on sectors such as those provide essential services \u2013 e.g., health, education, and water \u2013 and take recourse to the flexibilities embedded in the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) to schedule limitations (Narsalay et al. 2009). Alternatively, impact assessments can be specific to a certain agreement or a specific change in the rules of international trade. For example, the human development impact of the TRIPS Agreement or of other new intellectual property rules \u2013 such as those under a free trade agreement \u2013 may be evaluated. Within this example, there can be a further narrowing of the focus; for example, the public health impact of patents on pharmaceutical products in terms of their effect on the prices and availability of medicines in the country, the impact of copyrights and patents on educational materials, and impact of patents and copyrights on traditional knowledge in agriculture and in cultural materials such as traditional weaving patterns or music. Thus, trade policy changes are likely to affect, to varying degrees, a wide range of stakeholders within the country; in this case, the stakeholders who are mostly affected are poor patients who require medicines, students, faculties and researchers in formal education system, and traditional knowledge holders such as farmers and indigenous people, respectively. 3.1.2 WHEN should a HDIA be undertaken? It is possible to undertake a HDIA before, during, and/or after the completion of a trade policy. An ex-ante assessment is intended to identify in advance the effect of trade policy changes or the introduction of new policies. Nearly all trade policy changes create both winners and losers among households, individuals within households, communities, and regions, and an ex-ante assessment can inform the choice, design, and sequencing of alternative policy options. During implementation, the monitoring of a policy change and its impacts can lead to refinement of the policy, to a reconsideration of the pace/ sequencing or institutional arrangements of the policy", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89433db2-dc62-4785-9415-75788e649a00": {"__data__": {"id_": "89433db2-dc62-4785-9415-75788e649a00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dfb6c51ddeed46c7ca20dd539f393b899f14bb4673ad6ec48f77136f229353cf"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6510a5c-175f-40f4-a529-c304d3f917c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b48c171355e87f2b7e248eea14798c585bd200ab61588aeca960eff29224427"}}, "hash": "b37afc72e81f1e38c06960a96325a0000396b91396054b1bd5a791ae45c3e0c7", "text": "(flanking measures), or to the introduction or strengthening of mitigation measures. An ex-post HDIA assesses the actual impacts of a trade policy, which helps to understand the likely impacts of future change. Ex-post impact assessments are important to check on the accuracy of the ex-ante analyses, to modify the policy or complementary anti-poverty policies, and to understand better how macroeconomic policies affect the economy and household welfare, both in the short and long-terms. Sometimes it may not be possible to make a clear distinction between ex-ante and ex-post assessments, since trade policy changes arising there from are part of a longer-term or on-going process. 3.1.3 WHO should undertake the HDIA? National ownership of the HDIA is crucial not only to verify the outcomes of the assessment but also to follow up the exercise with necessary policy measures that facilitate the positive impacts and/or ameliorate the negative impacts of trade policy reform. For these reasons, ideally government would lead the HDIA, with technical assistance from UNDP, so as to institutionalize the HDIA in policy-making. As discussed below, policy-makers from relevant ministries and the parliament together with representatives of the private sector, academia, CSOs, the media, and the vulnerable groups likely to be affected by trade policy change need to be part of the HDIA exercise in order to democratize the debate. While experts from academia and CSOs should be part of the HDIA study as key researchers, policy-makers can contribute as steering committee members to verify the findings and endorse the suggestions provided by the research team. Representatives of vulnerable groups need to be consulted through the HDIA exercise as their perspectives are important for the impact assessment. Involving them in the HDIA exercise is also the process of empowering them to derive benefits from trade. If the voices HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 11 of the stakeholders such as small farmers, factory workers, or indigenous people cannot be well-represented in a setting of consultation at national level, other means to reflect their concerns and opinions in a collective manner\u2013e.g., town-hall meetings, focus group meetings, surveys or interviews, are desired. 3.1.4 HOW should the HDIA be undertaken? Although specific conditions and relevance of issues can differ across countries, aspects of human development that are likely to be affected by the policy change can be identified, and the indicators can be selected in a systematic manner by examining the linkages and transmission channels. It is proposed that a series of questions \u2013 a HDIA checklist \u2013 can be used to help identify the main effects of a trade policy change, the likely transmission channels of the policy change, and the potential impacts on stakeholders, institutions, and the human development outcomes. It is by no means an exhaustive listing of pertinent questions, but the questions summarized in Table 3.1 can provide a common framework in which the linkages are identified. For each HDIA it would, of course, be necessary to tailor the expression of the indicators to the specific trade policy or reform that is being assessed and the stakeholders it will affect. 3.2 Stages and steps of the HDIA of trade policy It can be envisaged that conducting a HDIA of trade policy changes will comprise a number of distinct stages and steps. There are three broad stages in this exercise: pre-assessment, impact assessment, and post-assessment. Several steps will follow in each stage. For reference, a number of questions are provided in the form of a checklist for each step, with the hope that this would assist users to grasp the details (see Table 2). In a general sense, while the steps provide guidance in terms of actions or measures that are required to be undertaken, through a series of questions the checklist sets out the broad range of issues to be considered.

Today, many countries implement trade policies or engage in the negotiation for trade liberalization simultaneously at the multilateral, regional, and bilateral level. Changes in unilateral trade policies are also undertaken. With the establishment of the WTO in 1995, trade negotiations at multilateral level cover diverse topics beyond merchandize goods, including services, and IPRs. Therefore, it is necessary to narrow down exactly which trade policy is to be assessed. Is it the WTO agreement, BTA or RTA that is being assessed? Or is it a unilateral trade policy? If the WTO Member country were negotiating for BTAs, it may also be useful to ascertain whether those BTAs are compatible or consistent with each other. Within the selected trade agreements, are there any specific trade liberalization/ protection tools or sectors that would be more significant than others for the country? In the case of a HDIA of WTO accession or RTAs/BTAs, it is suggested to provide an overview assessment of the selected agreement and then select key sectors (e.g., agriculture, services) or trade policy tools (e.g., tariffs, standards) for detailed analysis since it would be costly in terms of both money and time to cover all the trade topics of WTO agreements. For example, in the case of Mongolia\u2019s review of its 1997 WTO accession, six sectors that are significant to the economy from a point of view of rural development, employment generation, and environment sustainability, and trade facilitation were assessed.8 Once a trade policy is selected for assessment, the next step is to consider the expected direct effects of the policy change. By identifying the transmission channels, one can determine the measure of human development to be assessed. The question will also help to determine the appropriate type of impact assessment tools or techniques that can be used. Trade policy changes can affect human development through one or more of the following channels: Prices: Trade policy changes, such as cuts in tariffs, can affect the prices of imports, exports, and other goods connected through the input-output structure of the economy9. Changes in prices can, in turn, affect individuals and households by altering the prices at which they can sell and buy commodities, leading to a change of their production and consumption levels. In turn, change in production levels and in the structure of domestic output would have a differential impact on employment, depending on the skills and gender of the workers involved in the production of output that contract or expand. Where the latter effects are likely to be significant, they should be assessed where possible. In the case of liberalization in services, privatization with foreign investment often brings about fees for services. This might undermine development goals \u2013 for 8 The six sectors are wheat, milk, meat, cashmere, minerals, and textiles and clothing (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Mongolia and UNDP Mongolia 2009). 9 However, it is noted that these price changes can be some time captured by powerful intermediaries in the value chain and hence do not get transmitted to small producers or small consumers. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 15 example, universal access to such essential services as education and health\u2013 where poor households depend on provision of public goods (Narsalay et al. 2009). Likewise, stricter IPRs are expected to increase the price of pharmaceutical products and treatments as the result of a lack of generic alternatives, reduced competition, and a longer period of market exclusivity. Transaction volume and output structure: The imposition or elimination of quotas or the implementation of trade remedies such as anti-dumping measures \u2013 i.e., mostly changes in relative prices described \u2013 affect production volume and composition. A change in production volume and composition as well as a change in volume of services transactions, in turn, can affect the welfare of workers through the quantity, quality, and distribution of employment, which is one of the most important factors to assess regarding wage labourers.10 In case of farmers and fishers who are mostly own account producers, a change in the export volume \u2013 for example, due to stricter SPS measures \u2013 could possibly affect their income levels directly. Budgetary distribution: Policy changes, such as tariff reductions and subsidies, have implications for government tax revenue and expenditure, and therefore can constrain government capacities and programs. Many developing countries do not have a well-developed tax system: Tax revenue from business or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "183525ff-f1c7-4046-a528-fdf4c3641657": {"__data__": {"id_": "183525ff-f1c7-4046-a528-fdf4c3641657", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3fc154890c2e23bdcc4db4976d585c4b4ff248a37ec49b24fb14b4f6358a751"}}, "hash": "e3fc154890c2e23bdcc4db4976d585c4b4ff248a37ec49b24fb14b4f6358a751", "text": "household properties is minimal. Therefore, significant share of the nation\u2019s tax revenue derives from trade-related revenue. Trade liberalization can lead to loss of precious government revenue, if it\u2019s not recovered by imposing other types of taxes. This can importantly undermine public provision of key social services. In the case of an increase in a government\u2019s budget \u2013 e.g., as a result of a rise in tax revenue by through tariffication or a decrease in trade-related expenditures \u2013 the question is whether the surplus has been used for the betterment of the people in terms of promoting human development. Seen another way, the implementation of IPRs standards and their enforcement can be viewed as an incentive for promoting innovation, while it is also argued that there are added costs to the public budget in terms of restrictions on access to patented goods if the universal health care system is in place (e.g., Thailand) and increased expenditure for the administration and enforcement of IPRs. Notably, there are cases that affect human development without going through one of the three channels mentioned above that are mostly refer to trade in goods. For example, a rise in temporary migration under the GATS Mode 4 can have positive economic impacts on the migrant\u2019s family through remittance while it can simultaneously bring about negative social impacts on the migrants and their family members (Varma 2008). In sum, the questions for the HDIA checklist are: \u2022\ufffd Which trade policy is being assessed? \u2022\ufffd Has the policy been implemented? \u2022\ufffd What are the expected effects of the policy change? STEP 1.2 Identify key stakeholders likely to be affected by the policy change Stakeholders of the policy change are all those people and institutions who will be affected by the changes, and therefore including institutions \u2013 government and private \u2013 that are likely to be responsible for managing the policy change and/or are able to provide information and opinions about the policy impacts. In the Scoping and Mapping step, efforts should begin with trying to identify those who will be most directly affected by the changes, followed by an identification of those who will be subject to important secondary effects as well. 10 An indirect effect on the welfare of the communities where the production site is located has also been observed. For example, EIC (2007) argues that with every five garment jobs created in Cambodia due to an increase in production in the post-quota period one job is created around the factory as the workers\u2019 demand for basic needs, such as food and accommodation, increases. 16 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit In order to identify those who are most likely to be affected by a policy change, there are three possible sources from which information or guidance may be obtained. These are: 1) Studies of impacts associated with such policy changes in other countries; 2) Theoretical knowledge/predictions of likely impacts; and 3) Participatory discussions/surveys/interviews with possible stakeholders. The appropriate level of disaggregation will need to be determined. The possibilities may include: household level, sectoral level (e.g. agriculture, non-agriculture, and services), and the sub-sectors within the sectoral breakdown. There may also be regional, class, ethnic, and gender breakdowns. For example, trade liberalization affect men and women within the same household differently given their division of labour. Men farmers tend to engage in commercial agriculture (e.g., production of cash crops) due to their advantage of accessing to financial loans and agricultural inputs while women not only work with men in the field but sustain subsistence agriculture (e.g., home garden) and activities such as weaving cloths and baskets to support the family\u2019s livelihood. Trade liberalization in agriculture brings impacts on commercial agriculture via change in price, standard, or export volume; thus, impact assessment on farmers and traders who engage in commercial agriculture is certainly important. However, impact assessment on subsistence agriculture and other cash- generating activities at home, which are mostly done by women, is equally important since changes in such activities and in division of labour by sex are often not documented in official statistics but are determinants of the family\u2019s well-being. In this process, one also needs to think what the concerned human development impacts are per stakeholder identified. Is it people\u2019s access to goods and services providing basic needs (e.g., health care and education)? Or is it food security or impact on environment sustainability? How one proceeds depends on what relationships and issues are most important to stakeholders, and which relationships and issues are most likely to be affected by the policy changes.

It will be crucial to identify the governmental, private, and non-profit institutions that will play a role and have a significant effect on the implementation of the policy change. Identifying these institutions will allow the HDIA process to involve these groups and institutions in generating knowledge, data, and opinions about the policy impacts. Certain trade policy changes and agreements can significantly alter the institutional, legal, and regulatory environment of a country. This is certainly true of broad-based agreements, such as joining the WTO, but it is also likely to be true of bilateral agreements as well. When major changes in the overall institutional, legal, and regulatory environment occur, the impact could be wide-spread and must be carefully considered. There may be significant changes to the legal and regulatory environment, and these can have far-reaching effects on human development \u2013 for example, in the areas of health, safety, food security, labour standards, and environmental regulation. They can also generate significant costs of compliance. Case studies and reviews of similar changes in other countries should be taken into account, and attempts should be made to assess the likely costs and distributional impacts.11 One of the central issues here concerns the costs incurred by the government to implement these changes.12 In sum, the questions for the HDIA checklist are: \u2022\ufffd Who are the people, groups, and institutions most likely to be affected? \u2022\ufffd Exactly how will they be affected by the trade policy change? 11 For example, Wyss and White (2004) on gender impacts; Gray (2003) on food security. 12 See Rodrik (2001) for average estimates of these costs. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 17 STEP 1.3 Mapping the linkages between the trade policy change and relevant aspects of human development Using the HDIA questions reviewed thus far and their outcomes will provide the basis for the mapping of the linkages between the trade policy change and the relevant aspects of human development, as well as their transmission channels. The completed linkage map will then help in determining the eventual scope of the HDIA and guide the development of the terms of reference. The question for the HDIA checklist is: \u2022\ufffd Have the trade policy change and human development linkages become clearer? If the answer is no, one should go back to literature review in step 1.2 on theoretical linkage and case studies, to come up with plausible linkages between trade and human development. Two examples of the mapping are presented below. 3.2.2 Examples of mapping: Case of assessing the impact of TRIPS Agreement on access to medicines STAGE 1: Pre-assessment \u2013 scoping and mapping 1.1 Identify the trade policy change and the expected trade-related effects Which trade policy is being analyzed? Has the policy been implemented? What are the expected effects of the policy change? In relation to the TRIPS Agreement of the WTO and access to medicines, the relevant provisions of the TRIPS are those that require intellectual property protection with the effect of extending the period of market exclusivity of pharmaceutical products. These include: \u2013 provisions on patent protection of pharmaceutical products \u2013 protection of test data, where applicable \u2013 copyrights or trademarks related to pharmaceutical products There should also be consideration of whether the provisions have been implemented through enactment of domestic legislation, since the TRIPS Agreement is not self-executing. In this regard, there exist three important transition periods under TRIPS: \u2013 1995\u20132000, at the end of which developing countries were obliged to implement the TRIPS Agreement; \u2013 2000\u20132005, which allowed an additional five years to put in place product patent protection for pharmaceuticals or agricultural chemicals for those countries without such protection at the date of application of the Agreement; \u2013 1995\u20132006 (extended to 2016 with respect to patents on pharmaceutical products and exclusive marketing rights), after which Least Developed Countries (LDCs) would be required to implement their TRIPS obligations. It can be expected that the Agreement\u2019s provision of pharmaceutical patent protection for a minimum term of 20 years will provide a (longer) period of market exclusivity for pharmaceutical products, and that with reduced or no competition there will be price increases for the patent-protected pharmaceutical products, which in turn will affect the availability and affordability of medicines. Pricing of pharmaceutical products in a country may be influenced by several factors, notably price controls, patent protection, and the availability of generic versions and/or other therapeutically similarly alternatives. 18 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit The price data for pharmaceutical products is not systematically collected in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8406259-ae4b-4f8d-bafd-2dd9719f0f30": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8406259-ae4b-4f8d-bafd-2dd9719f0f30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4dd5121c0daf3cd6bd4e161148967eef0bc19d81d79c9180486bee453ee69c3"}}, "hash": "c4dd5121c0daf3cd6bd4e161148967eef0bc19d81d79c9180486bee453ee69c3", "text": "all countries, and thus it will be necessary to undertake an assessment of the changes in prices of pharmaceutical products. Price comparisons can be made between \u201cinternational reference\u201d prices and/or international market prices of patented and generic versions, and between domestic prices of both generic and patented. Information about price changes would also have to co-relate to people\u2019s access to medicines, information for which may not be readily available. The implementation of the minimum standards for IPRs protection as required by the TRIPS Agreement means that the policy space to develop a home-grown intellectual property system has been restricted. In the case of pharmaceutical products, under TRIPS it is no longer possible to exclude pharmaceutical products from patent protection (unlike the situation pre-TRIPS). It is, however, possible for countries to make use of flexibilities inherent in TRIPS. Notably, in terms of time-based flexibilities, LDCs may still delay providing patent protection to pharmaceutical products until 2016. In terms of substantive flexibilities such as compulsory licensing and parallel imports, the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement clarified that these may be used where the interests of public health require it. 1.2 Identify key stakeholders likely to be affected by the policy change What people, groups, and institutions are most likely to be affected by the trade policy change, and how? In the case of access to medicines, patients or people needing treatment are the obvious group likely to be most affected by changes in the price of pharmaceutical products. It will be necessary to ask how they are affected by changes in prices and identify relevant factors; for example, whether there is a national health insurance scheme, or universal access policy, which can help absorb the price changes and ensure access to medicines, or whether most patients pay out-of-pocket for their medicines. Patients and their access to health care are the key concerns here. To measure the impact of patent protection, one could assess the changes in price of pharmaceutical products and their effects on: \u2013 Numbers of patients paying out-of-pocket for treatment \u2013 Continued availability of medicines (for which price increase has been recorded) through health insurance or universal access schemes \u2013 Rise in infection rates of disease for which treatment has increased in price, where applicable \u2013 Rise in mortality rates from disease, where applicable \u2013 Annual cost of treatment vs. GDP per capita The TRIPS Agreement obliges WTO Members to give effect to the provisions of the Agreement within their legal system and practice. This means enacting the appropriate domestic legislation to provide for the protection of the seven categories of IPRs as specified as in the Agreement, and ensuring that the procedures for enforcement of these rights are available under the law. The administration of IPRs typically involves the establishment of an Intellectual Property Office (or, more narrowly, a Patent and Copyrights Office), which would be responsible for the application, grant, and registration of the IPRs provided in the country. Several ministries are also key players in such a scenario. First, in terms of patent protection for pharmaceutical products and national policy on access to health, the Ministry of Health is an important actor. Second, given that a price increase in pharmaceutical products will affect public expenditure for public health, the Ministry of Finance should be aware of the policy change. Finally, the Ministry of Commerce and Trade is obviously a key institution for negotiation of any trade agreement. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 19 The pharmaceutical companies are also key players, both in terms of being patent holders and as generic manufacturers. In the case of the patent-holding manufacturer, patent protection may mean a longer period of market exclusivity, hence reduced competition. For the generic manufacturer, patent protection may prevent the production of a generic version of the product. 1.3 Mapping the linkages between the trade policy change and human development Case of assessing the impact of TRIPS Agreement on access to medicines National enactment and enforcement of TRIPS Agreement provisions with the efect of extending the term of market exclusivity of pharmaceutical products Human Development Concerns Gender-diferentiated Impacts Price increases for pharmaceutical products and treatments Lack or absence of generic alternatives A change in Trade Policy Transmission Channels (Expected trade- related outcomes) Public health and social policies Ensuring access to health and treatment as a human right Impact on sustainability of drug supply & procurement as aresult of absence of multiple sources of supply for medicines and treatments - Deterioration in patients\u2019 health, as a result of lack of access to treatment, with consequence efect on their economic and social", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2aefb5e2-225b-4eb3-9d87-e29c104d5078": {"__data__": {"id_": "2aefb5e2-225b-4eb3-9d87-e29c104d5078", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a0293fc3ae9cfeb33dc64e1ce06d477d2b1f93a0e5aa4deb2f4cfbe0801ba40"}, "3": {"node_id": "c21ba8b7-1e61-4f37-9a50-1914c3884357", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28f89fcde9e0e3ba0834f770aec69d4c2865fa06a17f0574c9836e31300c699e"}}, "hash": "87322b4df5ece16b5bcc13e73edb92d9a9a9a5e84b8ec6e5843c0efa4d96d213", "text": "well-being - Where applicable, rise in mortality rates in untreated patients, rise in infection rates of untreated disease, etc. Policy Implications Exploring options for cost containment in drug expenditure and increasing access Reduced competition Longer period of market exclusivity Free treatment programmes abolished, universal access policy revoked Implications for public health delivery system A change in Trade Policy Policy Implication Tarif reduction Introduction Pressure on health insurance schemes, availability of expensive treatments under scheme Pressure on public health budget, reduced allocations for drug procurement Local/domestic producers prevented from manufacturing generic alternatives Decreased access to treatment - - - Poor patients without access if free medication schemes restricted or abolished Out-of-pocket payments for treatments necessary if certain treatments are removed Gender-diferences in access to treatment from health insurance schemes e.g., ; e.g., Cost containment mechanisms; improvements in drug procurement strategies (pooled procurement), negotiations for discounts, etc. Use of TRIPS fexibilities compulsory licensing, parallel imports, 2016 transition period provide pharmaceutical patents (for LDCs) Case of assessing the impact of TRIPS Agreement on access to medicines Case of assessing the impact of tarif liberalization on public fnance 20 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 3.2.3 Examples of mapping: Case of assessing the impact of tariff liberalization on public finance STAGE 1: Pre-assessment \u2013 scoping and mapping 1.1 Identify the trade policy change and the expected trade-related effects Which trade policy is being analyzed? Has the policy been implemented? What are the expected effects of the policy change? Trade liberalisation policies could be undertaken in order to implement bilateral, regional, or multilateral obligations or in response to standard trade policy reform packages mandated by the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, or unilateral trade liberalization policies. Trade liberalization policies are implemented in the form of elimination or reduction of effective tariff lines or the \u201ctariffication\u201d of non-tariff barriers. Binding commitments such as those undertaken at the WTO will result in a loss of policy space and may negatively affect a country\u2019s ability to achieve human development goals. On the other hand, unilateral trade liberalization policies are not likely to restrict the policy space in the long run, as these policy changes can in theory be reversed, if necessary. Most countries also introduce revenue compensatory measures; these are often broad- based domestic taxes, such as Value Added Tax (VAT). Tariffication of non-tariff barriers as well as elimination of tariff exemptions and export subsidies will result in a revenue increase due to the additional tariff lines and the removal of subsidies. Unless revenue compensatory measures are in place, tariff cuts will result in a decline in revenue in the short run. However, in the medium term, the overall impact on revenues would depend on the effects of tariff cuts on the level of economic activity and on the aggregate revenue base. An increase in import volumes could offset revenue losses incurred by tariff cuts. Similarly, lowering export taxes could lead to a decline in revenue unless there is an increase in the volume of exports. Lowering tariffs could also result in an increase in the tax base by reducing the marginal benefit to evade taxes, leading to an increase in revenue. Table 3.2 summarizes the expected fiscal impacts of trade reforms. Table 3.2: Trade reforms and their expected fiscal impact Trade Reform Expected Fiscal Impact Mechanisms Tariffication Positive Transforming non-tariff barriers into their equivalent tariff rates automatically increases the tax base. Elimination of tariff exemptions Positive Eliminating exemptions automatically increases the tax base.

Source: Morales-Alikpala (n.d.). 1.2 Identify key stakeholders likely to be affected by the policy change What people, groups, and institutions are most likely to be affected, and how? Two transmission channels that have been identified are (1) prices of goods and services and (2) taxes and transfers mechanism. Whether an overall decrease or increase in revenue would result in a change in public spending on social services, infrastructure, and provision of utilities depends on a government\u2019s social policy. Automatic linkage between a change in revenue and a change in social spending cannot be assumed. The implementation of revenue compensatory measures such as VAT on essential goods and services could have adverse effects on people\u2019s well-being, especially among the low-income segments of the population. If an increase in revenues or replacement of forgone trade revenues from domestic tax sources could increase public spending on social services and provision of welfare payments, the negative impacts via VAT might be mitigated. Ministries of finance and planning are the key institutions that would affect the outcomes. The trade liberalization policies are most likely to change tax and customs administration systems and also result in increased expenditure for the administration and enforcement of newly introduced taxes/revised tax systems and customs procedures. Changes in public revenues may result in changes in social policies, and thus affect the provision of such public services as health and education. Continued 22 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 1.3 Mapping the linkages between the trade policy change and human development Case of assessing the impact of tariff liberalization on public finance 3.2.4 STAGE 2: Impact assessment Stage 2 is an integral element of the HDIA process, and relates to the actions taken to determine the appropriate tools or techniques to be used to assess the policy change in question, and to implement the tools/techniques. This stage involves the process of information and data collection, and the application of the data to produce the preliminary results of the assessment. In this step, the participatory nature of the HDIA comes to the fore, as mechanisms to facilitate effective consultations with stakeholders are identified and put in place. The key actions to be taken within Stage 2 are as follows: STEP 2.1 Assemble the HDIA team The first step is to identify and assemble the team of researchers and analysts who will carry out the HDIA. This team should consist of experts from universities, government, research institutes, and CSOs. It will be important to ensure that the skill sets of the team members correspond with the type of expertise as required under the TOR. In all cases, it would be desirable to ensure that the HDIA team has the benefit of local researchers and experts who, among other things, are able to provide the accurate socio-economic, political, and other contexts for the HDIA process.

Once assembled, the team should collectively analyse and validate the TOR and linkage map, confirming that the appropriate channels of transmission and human development outcomes have been identified, and making changes as necessary. In sum, the questions for the HDIA checklist are: \u2022\ufffd Has the TOR been developed? \u2022\ufffd Have consultants for the HDIA been identified? \u2022\ufffd Has the TOR been verified by the consultants? STEP 2.2 Identify consultation process and participatory approaches A key part of the HDIA is the consultation and participation of the stakeholders. As noted above, the HDIA is a participatory exercise, which aims at bringing together all relevant stakeholders and representatives of the groups that are likely to be affected by the trade policy change to enrich the HDIA with a comprehensive view of policy impacts. The participatory approach is crucial to understanding human development impacts as complex as those that can arise from policy changes, and can be invaluable for gathering data on, inter alia, what constitutes human development. The participatory approach is also vital to ensure the ownership and policy buy-in of the stakeholders in the HDIA process. The HDIA team should, therefore, establish an effective process by which stakeholders may participate in the various stages of the HDIA process. For example, when farmers, indigenous groups, unorganized factory workers or informal workers are the concerned stakeholders, the agents initiating the HDIA exercise \u2013e.g., government, UNDP \u2013 should facilitate various ways to involve them in the process. If mobility is a factor that prevents them from attending the consultation meetings in the capital city, town hall meetings or focus group discussions in respective community can be arranged before and after each national meeting. Surveys or interviews can also be conducted to gather information and data in details. It is advisable to set up a national steering committee of the HDIA drawn from the parliament, relevant ministries, the stakeholder groups (e.g., trade unions, consumer associations, farmer associations, and the private sector), academia, media, and relevant UN agencies within the country. It is particularly important to include government representatives among key members of the committee, as their ability to provide peer pressure would increase the likelihood that the government would act on the team\u2019s recommendations. Finally, all research reports should be examined by the steering committee before being finalized. In sum, the questions for the HDIA checklist are: \u2022\ufffd Have the key stakeholders and representatives of the groups affected by the policy change been identified? \u2022\ufffd Has the TOR of the HDIA national steering committee been prepared? \u2022\ufffd Has the national steering committee been established in a way that ensures a fair representation of all interested/ affected parties? STEP 2.3 Develop the appropriate indicators required for the HDIA A major task of the HDIA team is to draw an exhaustive list of what the required information would be based on the outcome of the mapping undertaking in Step 1.3 and to assess the availability of relevant data. It will be necessary for the team to undertake an inventory of available data so that a baseline set of data on the key indicators of the assessment can be developed. This could include: 1) public data at the national and international level; 2) data from governmental, non-governmental, and private institutions; and 3) information from interviews, surveys, and participatory meetings. 24 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit From this, missing data or gaps in data can be identified and a determination made as to whether the data can be collected prior to or as part of the assessment phase. The data inventory will help the team create an empirical baseline, from which changes stemming from the policy change can be tracked. A baseline established prior to the policy change is preferable. Where this is not possible, a baseline set of information should be established as early as possible to facilitate analysis of further impacts from the current policies and facilitate impact analysis of future changes. The baseline must include data on the key policy variables such as tariff rates and regulations,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b151d906-5d9e-4ab3-9dd3-a942460fc328": {"__data__": {"id_": "b151d906-5d9e-4ab3-9dd3-a942460fc328", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b73d82d41661526e30101dfb68c4a5efe4a4a9c8a1029216a8fe576a63a1472"}}, "hash": "5b73d82d41661526e30101dfb68c4a5efe4a4a9c8a1029216a8fe576a63a1472", "text": "human development variables to be examined, and other variables including intermediate variables such as prices and transaction volume. It is important to survey the existing structure of the economy in the areas relevant to the policy change, establishing a baseline for socio- economic or regional groupings and disparities required for analysis in addition to key macroeconomic and sectoral data. It can also refer to broad structural information in the economy, such as market structures, norms of household behaviour, and cultural norms that could affect evaluations of human development or responses to policy. In some countries some key human development indicators might not be gathered as a matter of course. Information on access to health care, gender equality, informal sector incomes, and so on might not be collected on a regular basis, or information on implementation of trade policy change might not be gathered. If some indicators are missing, it is important to identify ways to generate the necessary data as part of the tracking mechanism so that there will be a \u201cbaseline\u201d in the future. With data constraints, it will be necessary to identify the crucial gaps and to assess whether these can be \u2013 at least partly \u2013 overcome and how. Collecting primary data based on surveys with concerned group is often done. Findings from interviews with stakeholders as well as from focus group discussions are also useful to supplement the quantitative data. In sum, the questions for the HDIA checklist are: \u2022\ufffd What data are needed? Which data is available? \u2022\ufffd What are the data and knowledge constraints? \u2022\ufffd If a data gap exists, how can the gap be filled? STEP 2.4 Identify and implement the appropriate impact assessment tools and techniques There are different methods or tools for assessing the impact of trade reform. The tools differ in: \u2022\ufffd Complexity - theoretical sophistication and technical and data requirements; \u2022\ufffd Scope - coverage of agents and markets in the economy; and \u2022\ufffd Comprehensiveness - incorporation of indirect and feedback effects. The choice of which to use will depend on a number of factors, including the scope of the policy change being assessed, the data available, and the technical skills and time available for analysis. A complete impact assessment would normally involve the use of several tools before and after policy implementation, covering both short and long-term effects, and addressing complementary dimensions of human development and welfare. Once primary effects of the trade policy change are identified, the nature and magnitude of those effects can be examined by descriptive and statistical analysis, as well as by studying the impacts of these policy changes in other contexts. In short, a comparative analysis based on the literature and on descriptive statistics for the country in question. Annex 2 describes the type of analysis that can be done in the context of the HDIA, and the impact assessment tools for so doing, namely, qualitative and quantitative analysis. The key question for the HDIA checklist is: \u2022\ufffd What impact assessment tools and techniques will be used? HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 25 STEP 2.5 Detailed analysis and evaluation of impact assessment results The key action in this process is the analysis and evaluation of the results of the assessment. Given that one aim of a HDIA is to assess the feasibility of a particular trade policy change, identification of the positive and negative implications of the policy change are crucial to identifying appropriate monitoring and mitigation measures. In the case of an ex-ante assessment, the analysis of the results would be used to suggest modifying aspects of the trade agreement under negotiation or determine the type of monitoring mechanism to be established to monitor the impacts of the policy change as it is being implemented. For an ex-post assessment, the process will involve the detailed analysis of the results of the impact assessment, in terms of the impact of the trade policy change on the identified indicators of human development. The question for the HDIA checklist is: \u2022\ufffd Has the draft study been finalized? 3.2.5 STAGE 3: Post-assessment \u2013 feedback and policy dialogue The main action of this stage is to provide feedback to policy-makers as to the findings of the HDIA and, where necessary, devise and propose measures to improve the human development impacts of the policy change. As stated above, mitigation measures can be proposed. These proposals will then have to be tabled for consideration by the relevant stakeholders and government officials, and for implementation, if they are accepted.

As noted above, the participatory approach is an important element of the HDIA. Similarly, the development of post-assessment measures should be developed in conjunction with all stakeholders. Consultations with stakeholders should provide the contextual information and facilitate the identification of the most appropriate types of post-assessment measures that best fit specific country circumstance and implementation capacity. As noted above, policy space is the ability of governments to make policies without being constrained by political or international legal forces. Trade obligations, such as those entered into when governments join the WTO, will place certain constraints on the ability of governments to formulate and implement trade/economic policies and management. For example, reduction in tariff levels, restrictions on subsidies, prohibition on performance requirements, and so on place limits on the ability of a country to make trade policy space. Thus, it would be important to examine how such limits on policy space would affect the ability of governments to achieve developmental goals. There should also be a distinction made between binding multilateral and bilateral trade obligations, as opposed to unilateral trade policy changes. While the former two represent binding commitments that can involve the loss of policy space, the latter is different in that a government may, at least in theory, \u201cundo\u201d or reverse its own policy change. The important issue is to determine whether or not the loss of policy space as a result of a trade commitment will also affect a government\u2019s ability to take measures to promote human development outcomes. Where this is found to be the case, a HDIA may highlight this fact and suggest, where possible, mitigating measures. In the case of ex-ante assessments, it will be necessary to develop a monitoring mechanism aimed at collecting data to track the effects of the trade policy as it is put into place. There is a two-prong objective in the monitoring mechanism: that is, to validate an ex-ante assessment and to influence the reformulation of a policy. In this instance, consideration should be given to developing a coherent national monitoring system that links existing information sources with indicators. Frameworks for monitoring should be established so that they are implemented as soon as possible \u2013 both before and 26 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit during the implementation of the policy. Also in establishing the monitoring system, it will be critical to ensure participation, for example by ensuring that information, particularly from civil society, on the effects of the policy change feeds directly into the monitoring system. This information can be used to alter the policy implementation, to mitigate its impacts, and to reform the policy if it needs changing. While monitoring mechanisms can be suggested as a result of ex-ante HDIAs to track the likely impact of policy changes, mitigation measures may be recommended as an outcome of ex-post HDIAs so as to ameliorate the impact of a policy change. In these cases mitigation measures may range from reversing the policy (in the case of unilateral trade reform, this is possible to do without incurring sanctions) to re-negotiating commitments in certain agreements, to devising flanking policies to minimize the impact of binding commitments, etc. The other category of mitigating measures is to delay or suspend the implementation of the policy. Industrial policy that helps channel resources to growth and employment enhancing activities can also be designed and implemented. A range of non-trade measures can also be implemented to compensate for a loss in human development resulting from a trade policy change. Examples include tax reform, social insurance programs, education and re-training of workers. In addition to these mitigation measures at the policy level, an important and effective means for mitigation at the individual or group level is the establishment or, more often, effective use of redress mechanisms for individuals or groups that have been affected by changes in trade policies (e.g. access to justice or to effective trade union systems for groups of workers for whom the trade policy change has resulted in high unemployment). Apart from direct mitigating effects, effective redress mechanisms have a strong potential to bring negative impacts to the attention of policy-makers. This would allow for the initiation of a process to decide on the re-designing of the policy package, including re-sequencing of the policy changes, or, where possible, to abandon the policy altogether. In the case of an ex-ante assessment, mitigation measures can also be triggered when the likely risks and/or costs materialize.

STEP 3.2 Policy dialogue and re-designing the policy When the HDIA is completed, its findings and proposals should be disseminated and a policy dialogue should be facilitated to discuss them. While the HDIA may provide a means for evidence-based policymaking, it is acknowledged that policy formulation is also very much a political process. For this reason, establishing the mechanisms and forums for policy debate should be a key aim of the HDIA process. The policy dialogue needs to involve the people, groups, and institutions affected by the policy change, including the technocrats, researchers, and parliamentarians. As has been stressed, consultations with stakeholders at the various stages of the HDIA process are useful to understand their concerns, to identify the transmission channels, and to validate the technical analysis. Similarly, the policy dialogue can facilitate public acceptance or endorsement of the HDIA findings and proposals (or bring about revisions to the HDIA findings to improve it), and the support and ownership of the stakeholders will help to ensure effective implementation of its proposals. Where the HDIA proposals for mitigating measures or other changes are accepted, the HDIA team may be asked to develop a plan for the re-design of the policy. The last question for the HDIA checklist is: \u2022\ufffd What are the follow-up activities to implement the monitoring mechanism and policy suggestions?

Has the policy been implemented? What are the expected effects of the policy change? Full implementation of the WTO ATC on 1 January 2005 ended 40 years of quota-based trade in the sector, which had been \u201cmanaged\u201d through non-transparent bilateral deals known as Multifibre Arrangement (MFA). The quota system was supposed to be gradually phased-out over the 10-year period of 1995\u20132004; however, nearly 50 percent of all textiles and clothing products remained under the quota system until the end of 2004. Quota limits, when they existed, directly restrained the exports of large developing countries such as China. The elimination of the ATC, therefore, has been expected to benefit the large textiles and clothing producing developing countries by releasing quota limits. On the other hand, many LDCs such as Lao PDR and Nepal that had been able to expand production and obtain access to major markets under the MFA were expected to face the prospect of major structural and socio-economic dislocation. The two transmission channels examined were production volume and prices.14 The elimination of quotas was expected to lead to major shifts in trade and investment flows to the most competitive players. Lower volume of garment exports was expected in the least competitive countries, including the LDCs, which would likely lead to lower production and factory closures. Thus, a significant employment loss and, consequently, income loss was also expected; and given the high concentration of women in this industry, the gender impact of the ATC\u2019s expiration was of particular concern. It was also feared that increased competition could put workers\u2019 rights and protections at risk as lower wages and longer working hours would be required to meet lower prices and shorter lead times. 1.2 Identify key stakeholders likely to be affected by the policy change What people, groups, and institutions are most likely to be affected by the trade policy change, and how? Garment workers are the most vulnerable group to this policy change. Unemployment, income loss, and deterioration in health and work conditions are of immediate concern. The risk of losing jobs was higher among workers in small scale domestic garment firms that are usually subcontractors relative to larger firms or foreign-owned firms, which had direct business relations with the buyers. As most garment workers send part of their salary to their family in rural areas, indirect negative impacts on their family\u2019s well-being via declined remittance was also feared.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3fbf999-aaf5-4020-83f3-ddfebf13ac7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3fbf999-aaf5-4020-83f3-ddfebf13ac7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40506a01273426f1bcc8b7f642fddcc0dcbd471e15f6d8a5ed631d18af1224d9"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe8f975e-4abc-4809-a8f5-d37992cd469d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9456b7683c99acadef62b2afcbc209570474cfa181f919370e5c7c2a44e0c526"}}, "hash": "debccac4fd74911def2145eafecd53041cd40dc63389f71683abf0c2d509dabd", "text": "13 This section benefited from Adhikari and Yamamoto (2006), SAWTEE and AAN (2007), EIC (2007), CPI and NSC (2007). 14 A reduction in government trade revenue was another channel to examine the impacts", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90c1dda1-7ea0-41f7-96c1-7aaf14e18882": {"__data__": {"id_": "90c1dda1-7ea0-41f7-96c1-7aaf14e18882", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4191bd3bf58694c82bf202a1815516c598929ab7ae0155c4b28ab9987057aadd"}, "3": {"node_id": "855c1e30-382a-4c33-b504-7752ce7516ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "334848b53d696f0fbc376771f9cc24c9faeae15fbc0ae3416c508a868ea95d96"}}, "hash": "7fa20cd4b20e4d1effd70588b3ac55318460e16be81e2aacf9f2a02d65042c09", "text": "on public spending on social services, including social welfare programs for the unemployed, which could mitigate the negative impacts on garment workers.

Trade data was available from customs and national statistics. In general, however, basic information such as the living standards of garment workers \u2013 including wages and their basic needs \u2013 were not available. Moreover, due to the lack of proper time-series data both at the labor-market and household level, it was difficult to assess the impacts of the quota expiry with official statistics. Primary data were collected in the form of both questionnaires and interviews with employers at the garment factories, garment workers (and former garment workers in case of Nepal) and other stakeholders. Questionnaires are listed in EIC (2007) and Committee for Planning and Investment (CPI) and NSC (2007). 2.4 Identify and implement the appropriate impact assessment tools and techniques What impact assessment tools and techniques will be used? Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used in this project. Descriptive analysis summarized the findings from the stakeholder surveys and interviews as part of the ex-post analysis. Local partner agencies conducted the field surveys among garment workers in 2006, asking questions about their work conditions, health status, monthly income, consumption and saving behaviours, and use of remittances, among others. Since pre-expiry data did not exist, in some questions workers were asked to assess their current work and living conditions as compared to 2004. The surveys consisted of 365 workers (about 0.13 percent of total estimated garment workers) in Cambodia, 286 workers (1.1 percent) in Lao PDR, and 274 workers (6.2 percent) in Nepal. In the case of Nepal, 133 former-garment workers were also surveyed. In all three countries, 22\u201344 garment factories were surveyed regarding their production and export performances as well as future prospects. Interviews with other stakeholders, such as government officials from relevant ministries, trade union leaders, garment association representatives, and researchers, were also undertaken. In order to suggest possible trade negotiation strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of the expiry of the ATC, two scenarios of (1) duty-free market access to the United States (US) market and (2) flexible rules of origin in the European Union (EU) market were examined. Selection of the econometric tools in this ex-ante analysis depended on the key question that the HDIA team asked as well as the availability of the data and the econometricians or economists who would be able to 30 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit handle econometrics models. In case of Cambodia, a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model was used to assess the impacts of both scenarios. As for Lao PDR, a Partial Equilibrium Model was adopted for assessing the impact of scenario of better market access to the US market because it corresponded with the data available about the Lao garment exports to the United States. One the other hand, potential effects of flexible rules of origin were discussed simply based on the percentage share of Lao garments qualified for the EU rules of origin and are subject to tariff of Most Favoured Nation rate due to lack of disaggregated data. Nepal research team first asked the garment manufactures to quantify the benefits in export volume under the two scenarios. Based on this survey based opinion, a single-equation regression model was used to forecast the change in exports with zero tariff access to the US market, the largest market for Nepal garments. For results of the ex-ante analysis, please see EIC (2007), CPI and NSC (2007), SAWTEE and AAN (2007). 2.5 Detailed analysis and evaluation of impact assessment results Has the draft study been finalized? The draft study was written by the HDIA researchers and had been discussed at the national consultation meetings, which members of the NRG or NAB as well as the other stakeholders attended. Based on the comments and suggestions provided, the HDIA study was finalized. The key findings are summarized in Box 3.1. Box 3.1: Case study \u2013 HDIA of the ATC expiry in 2005 A drastic reduction in employment was confirmed in Nepal as the removal of quota systems affected its Ready-Made Garment (RMG) exports negatively.

Lower education, lack of skills (in both RMG and other sectors), and economic and social discrimination against women may explain the gender gap. Among those who were working at the time of the survey, the majority did not have a contract, which makes workers more vulnerable to a downturn of the production cycle and creates job insecurity. Sixty-four percent of the former RMG workers surveyed in Nepal claimed a decline in income after leaving the RMG industry. For most of those who were working, their level of income was not sufficient to meet their basic needs \u2013 even in countries with a rapid growth of RMG exports. With overtime pay and other benefits, the average monthly salary was $73 for Cambodian workers and $41 for Lao workers. At the time of the survey, the basic salary was fixed at $45 per month in Cambodia and about $26 per month in Lao PDR. About 90 percent of Cambodian and 56 percent of Nepali workers surveyed responded that their basic salary was not sufficient for their daily needs. Moreover, high inflation triggered by price hikes of petroleum and staple foods contributed to deterioration in their real wages. The majority of workers surveyed were satisfied with their current jobs, but a significant number complained about their low wage. The survey found RMG workers spend average 50-60 percent of their income on basic necessities, that is, food, housing, and clothing. Remittances account for 10-20 percent of their income. In order to cope with real wage loss, the former RMG workers in Nepal cut their savings, entertainment expenditures, and remittances. Some even limited their spending HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 31 on food. Without an appropriate compensation mechanism, lower food consumption worsens workers\u2019 health, whereas lower remittances are likely to bring deterioration in human development, especially among rural populations. Further reduction in real wages puts the well-being of both workers and their family members at risk. The poor health conditions of garment workers are well documented. Many experience health problems after being in the industry for several years. The causes for this vary, but one reason is the long working hours endured in order to meet \u2018just-in-time\u2019 delivery. Despite potential health risks, RMG workers are willing to work overtime out of the need for additional income, or often they are compelled to work additional hours in order to meet the demand of orders as they are received. In addition to the eight regular working hours, 2\u20134 hours overtime is common among RMG workers, who usually work six days a week. Under these conditions, it is not surprising that many workers reported problems of back pain and eye strain. Sources: EIC (2007), CPI and NSC (2007), SAWTEE and AAN (2007). STAGE 3: Post-assessment 3.1 Hold consultations with stakeholders to disseminate analysis and develop post-assessment measures What is the impact on policy space? How will it affect human development outcomes? What are the mitigation measures? What is the monitoring mechanism? The key findings of the final study on human development outcomes were discussed at the national workshop. For wider dissemination of the findings, the media was invited to the workshop and the press release of the report was distributed to them. In terms of policy space, the LDCs were keen to negotiate for duty-free and quota-free (DFQF) market access to major trading partners at the WTO Hong Kong Ministerial conference in December 2005 in order to ensure preferential market access, as a way to mitigate competition pressures from the expiry of quotas on textiles and closing. After the outcome of the negotiations failed to reach 100 percent DFQF market access, the Asian LDCs\u2019 hope was to negotiate DFQF market access with the United States at the bilateral level and to demand relaxation of the EU Rules of Origin requirements. The ex-ante analysis of the potential effects of such bilateral trade strategies showed, in general, significant increase in export revenue and employment although each country applied different assumptions and baseline scenarios. For example, the duty-free market access to the United States was estimated to increase employment in garment industry by 26 percent in Cambodia and by 29 percent in Lao PDR from the baseline scenario. In case of flexible EU rules of origin, the positive effects were not as significant as that of the US duty-free condition, partly due to low proportion of their exports to the EU with duty.

In countries experiencing export growth in 2006 \u2013 e.g., Cambodia and Lao PDR \u2013 trade unions together with government agencies and the International Labour Organization (ILO) need to ensure that the welfare of workers will not deteriorate as they work longer hours. For Nepal, it was suggested that government agencies together with financial institutions and NGOs should provide support for retrenched workers. As many of them did not find alternative jobs immediately after leaving the industry, the provision of training programmes and credit for self-employment is required. Because these social welfare programs are often seen by governments as overly costly, ideally the sustainable growth of the industry would be key to ensuring the sustainable livelihood of workers. A number of policies were suggested to improve productivity and efficiency of the industry, including improvement of trade facilitation, utility services, and other macroeconomic policies. Export diversification in terms of both markets and products is another way to mitigate the negative impacts of the quota expiry. 32 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit Multi-stakeholders groups such as the NRG or NAB are also responsible for ensuring the policy buy-in. Monitoring mechanism is necessary to ensure that policy suggestions and action matrices are adopted in the national planning or export diversification strategies. 3.2 Policy dialogue and re-designing the policy What are the follow-up activities to implement the monitoring mechanism and policy suggestions? Three other studies followed the HDIA to explore the export diversification and value addition strategy, trade and industry policies, and trade negotiation strategies related to the export diversification under this project. A number of advocacy activities, including national workshops and a series of television and radio policy dialogue programs and newspaper op-ed articles, followed in an effort to raise public awareness of the issues. In Cambodia the policies suggested by the project were aligned with the country\u2019s DTIS and the human development-oriented activities of the Trade Related Technical Assistance for Development Equity project of UNDP Cambodia. Export diversification strategies have been implemented since 2006.16 It was hoped that the project findings would likewise be integrated into an updated DTIS of Nepal in the near future so that implementation of the policies would follow. 16 See, for example, Ministry of Commerce and UNDP Cambodia (2011). HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 33 This section summarizes some of the experiences drawn from impact assessment exercises that have been undertaken by the UNDP so far. Although that there does not exist a long track record of such human development impact assessments, some lessons learned specifically draws on those that have explicitly attempted to use a human development framework.17 Some lessons 1. Clarify financial and time constraints and long-term goals Try as much as possible to clarify early on: (1) What are the long-term goals and stages of the project; (2) What steps are going to be taken over the life of the project; (3) What budget is available for the different phases of the project; and (4) What are the key time constraints/deadlines for the various stages. HDIAs can be complex and time consuming. Having a long-term view of the project is extremely valuable for identifying realistic goals along the way, while making sure they are likely to add up to the overall goals of the assessment. Also ensure that the scope of the analysis is sufficiently narrow to fit within the constraints of time, finance, and expertise. 2. Benefit from local knowledge In many countries there has already been a wealth of research in areas closely connected to the assessment issues at hand, and thus there are likely to be a number of locally-based experts with great knowledge about these issues. People in the country, whether they represent themselves as producers, traders, or consumers, know the problems in their daily business and life, and thus be able to describe potential impacts of trade policy on their activities well and address policy suggestions from their own perspective. Efforts should be made to enlist the support of such local experts, particularly those among vulnerable groups, at various stages of the exercise as much as possible. 3. Participatory approaches The HDIA takes the participatory approach seriously, but it is very difficult to implement and coordinate in practice. Participatory approaches can be expensive and involve lead time; moreover, those involved in the HDIA might not have a lot of experience with participatory approaches. Hence, those commissioning the assessments need to make a special effort to ensure participatory approach is part of the process and is undertaken by those with", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d9b66ad-143e-4b76-bbeb-a1d4a1f3183a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d9b66ad-143e-4b76-bbeb-a1d4a1f3183a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c288a5681493eb928c005edb5d24451c7314d248e3c15e415273ee4644b396b3"}, "3": {"node_id": "359158c6-39a1-4d09-9575-d8430a804511", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5acf3586558066366d2c2d7606e7f242a2ef14d0e90a30a44eb47872cd1d704"}}, "hash": "9cf25d1ba2816ab9fe42df37bd86feb29c67cc6e73b36e862a3ea7bfd0daa6f9", "text": "expertise in this area. 4. Build local capacity The participatory approach itself is the process of strengthening capacity of those who affect or being affected by trade policy to understand the impacts of trade policy on people\u2019s well-being \u2013 particularly the poor and other vulnerable group \u2013 and discuss policy actions. In many developing countries, national capacity in research, advocacy, and the process such as participatory approach is limited. Then, international consultant(s) might be requested to assist the HDIA team, at least at the initial stage of the exercise. One way to facilitate both points 2 and 4 is to consider pairing-up international consultants with local researchers or development practitioners, both to add local expertise and to enhance capacity building on both sides. 5. Avoid technical \u201cfetishism\u201d Avoid using the most sophisticated techniques for their own sake, especially if they are inappropriate to the problem at hand, or if sufficient data are not available. At the same time, do not be afraid to use the necessary amount of technical analysis in the assessment. 6. Getting buy-in In most cases to get buy-in from the government and other stakeholders there will need to be emphasis on developing policy improvements and reforms. That is, do not let the impact analysis as an end of the exercise. In addition, ensuring the presence of all interested and affected groups in the monitoring process is crucial for capacity development of the stakeholders as well as the outcome in sustainable human development. 17 UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre projects in Cambodia with EIC, in Lao PDR with NSC, in Nepal with SAWTEE and AAN, as well as its assist to Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Mongolia and UNDP Mongolia (2009). 4.

HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 37 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 37 Annex 1. List of indicators and data source Trade and trade-related macroeconomic data, human development indicators adopted from Ranis et al. (2006), questions that might help in constructing human development indicators adopted from Anand et al. (2006), Anand (2007), and Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI, 2008) are summarized in Tables A1.1-A1.5. However, none of these represents a fixed list of indicators for the HDIA of trade policy. Indicators appropriate for the objectives of the assessment will need to be selected as per the trade policy or agreement. A set of such appropriate indicators can only be constructed by considering the data that is available at the time of assessment and/or by collecting primary data. It should also be pointed out that some of the indicators listed here may be useful for a general broad-brush picture but they are often too broad and aggregated to be useful for any distributional analysis highlighting differences between various groups within a country. Therefore, please also look at national surveys such as Labour Force Survey, Demographic and health surveys, Living Standards Measurement Study, when available, since they are richer and more useful than international data sets in some cases.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6356fe99-8972-4c49-bf65-0dabd06f7c4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6356fe99-8972-4c49-bf65-0dabd06f7c4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7c598291a695e5a6bfa951a83da7557f19fec15c244f8cc408c0b346410e3ce"}, "2": {"node_id": "13750293-2d55-4bd9-b031-930e5b3bc8fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1a2473a1bc4b96eb59d0d0305c48c4db9acef3bfdb51d2eb60f816a275bd348"}}, "hash": "935d3fedc6ae238d0a90558cb9cdd4edaa9ca31e0ea00cacac4b7d032e1b4161", "text": "A.1.1 Trade and trade-related macroeconomic data Table A1.1 summarizes the trade and trade-related macroeconomic data that might be useful for a HDIA.

(2006) with slight modification. Ranis et al. (2006) enlarged the measurement of human development beyond HDI based on the extensive literature on well-being, including Nussbaum (2000). In addition to core HDI indicators such as per capita GDP, literacy rate, and physical well-being, 11 categories are introduced. These are: 1) Mental well-being (i.e., an individual\u2019s psychological state) 2) Empowerment (particularly of the deprived) 3) Political freedom 4) Social relations 5) Community well-being 6) Inequalities 7) Work conditions 8) Leisure conditions 9) Dimensions of security \u2013 political (i.e., freedom from political violence or instability) 10) Dimensions of security \u2013 economic (i.e., freedom from economic fluctuations) 11) Environmental conditions Within each category, Ranis et al. (2006) identified a potential set of measurable indicators, which are listed in Table A1.2. Many of these are available over a period of time or from various years. Therefore, they can be used as a baseline for ex-ante analysis or to assess before-and-after effects in the ex-post analysis. One should note that many of the indicators shown in Table A1.2 are based on a nation\u2019s total or average figures, and are not disaggregated by regions or industrial sectors. Aggregated data would be useful to analyze whether or not a country\u2019s socio-economic situation has improved after a change in trade policy.18 On the other hand, sectoral analysis may require collecting data similar to the framework introduced here (e.g., whether the percentage of informal workers in the industry increased after trade liberalization policy was implemented). 18 See \u201cOverview\u201d in MFAT in Mongolia and UNDP Mongolia (2009).

(2006) notes that male and female suicide rates are highly correlated, and neither is correlated with other variables in the same category. Therefore, it is not important which one to select. They chose the male suicide rate as an indicator of mental well-being because it is larger than the female rate in most countries. 20 Ranis et al. (2006) uses average response to whether one would want to live next to various types of people. Lower numbers indicate more tolerance.

(2006). It should be noted that there are other data that can be useful for the HDIA, even if they are not listed here. For example, Demographic and Health Surveys website (www.measuredhs.com/) has data on women\u2019s status and empowerment (e.g., women\u2019s autonomy, such as household decision making, free movement, and access money), domestic violence, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevalence, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours. As listed in the tables below, Labour Force Survey available from the national statistics office provides rich work-related data. Time-use data, when applied in gendered CGE models, assess the possible impacts of a trade policy change on the use of men\u2019s and women\u2019s time in paid work (market or productive activities), unpaid work (e.g., household or reproductive work), and leisure activities. The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) (unstats.un.org) has various economic statistics, demographic and social statistics, environment and energy statistics, and Millennium Development Goal (MDG) indicators as well as references to time-use data. Based on the three dimensions of economic, social and cultural rights (availability, accessibility and quality) the following indicators in Table A1.3 may be also useful: Continued Continues..

Table A1.4 displays the modified versions of the list in Anand et al. (2006) and Anand (2007), with selected questions that are most relevant to the HDIA of trade. This is not to argue that the stakeholder survey for the HDIA of trade should consist of all the questions listed below. Rather, we acknowledge that some of the categories/ indicators may not be applicable to the HDIA of a particular trade policy, and thus can be omitted. In addition, some of categories and questions need to be modified based on a country\u2019s particular context and the objective of the assessment. For example, Q3 in Table A1.4 asks whether one eats fresh meat, chicken, or fish at least twice a week \u2013 a question designed to identify the nourishing status of the interviewees and to measure bodily health. However, this question can be modified to conform to the cultural and religious sensitivities within an assessment country after consulting nutritionists as to the appropriate benchmarks for health measurement (e.g., protein). 24 Similar to Nussbaum (2000), Ingrid Robeyns identified a list of capabilities for gender inequality assessment in the context of post-industrialized Western societies. As our discussion is mainly focused on the HDIA of trade in developing countries, we will not discuss her list here. However, she clearly states the importance of taking \u201cdomestic work and nonmarket care\u201d and \u201ctime-autonomy\u201d into consideration. For more details, please see Robeyns (2003). 48 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit Table A1.4: Questions for identifying central human capabilities Main Corresponding Question(s) Response Code A.

Indicators were selected that would be internationally comparable and that would be able to identify changes in the dimensions over time. Needless to say, there are similarities between Tables A1.4 and A1.5. Thus, this is not to argue that the stakeholder survey for the HDIA of trade should consist of all the questions listed below. Rather, as discussed above, the omission and modification of questions should be considered based on a particular country\u2019s context and the objectives of the assessment. OPHI\u2019s list includes five categories: A. Employment: including both formal and informal employment, with particular attention as to the quality of employment; B. Empowerment, or agency: the ability to advance goals one values and has reason to value; C. Physical safety: focusing on security from violence to property and person, as well as perceived violence; Continued 50 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit D. Ability to go about without shame: to emphasize the importance of the dignity, respect, and freedom from humiliation; E. Meaning and value: to emphasize meaning, satisfaction, and their determinants. Each category includes a set of indicators that are addition to a set of standard questions asked in labour, household, and other kinds of national surveys. For example, on employment, standard labour surveys ask: \uf0fc\ufffdQuestion determining employment status (employed/unemployed/inactive); \uf0fc\ufffdRespondents\u2019 branch of economic activity (sector & occupation); \uf0fc\ufffdQuestions to determine formal vs. informal employment; \uf0fc\ufffdHours worked; \uf0fc\ufffdQuestion about job search, such as \u201cHave you made any effort within the past months to find work or to established a business or an enterprise?\u201d In Table A1.5 we duplicate the indicators in OPHI (2008) that we feel might be useful for the HDIA of trade policy, namely in the categories of employment, empowerment, and meaning and value. However, this does not mean that the indicators not listed here are of no value with regard to the HDIA; in some context they might also be useful. Please see OPHI (2008) for a full set of indicators as well as technical notes on survey implementation before conducting the HDIA of a trade policy.

Descriptive analysis of human development-related indicators and variables is particularly useful in instances in which the impact of trade on human development has not been previously examined (see Box 3.1). A2.2 Quantitative analysis Differentiated impacts by economic and social characteristics such as sex, age, ethnicity, educational attainment, and so on can be further examined by using statistical analysis tools. There are various tools that one can use. Selection of the tool or model depends on the question one asks regarding the relationship between trade and human development, and data availability. Introduction of various models is beyond the scope of this toolkit. Therefore, this section summarizes some examples of the quantitative analysis from the literature on trade and human development. These are: Social Accounting Matrix (SAM)25, CGE models, Partial Equilibrium Analysis, and Factor Analysis. A2.2.1 Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) A SAM describes all transactions taking place among various agents and institutions in an economy at one time. It embodies the idea of sectoral interdependencies (from input/output analysis) and the idea that income must always be equal to expenditure (circular flow). In a SAM the horizontal rows indicate incomes (or inflows); the vertical column entries are expenditures (or outflows). The row and column totals must balance. A SAM gives a snapshot of the structure of the economy, for example, where output is produced, who is producing it, what sectors are buying the output, and what inputs are used in production during a single time period. Since income equals expenditures, it also traces the flows of income to different sectors, and it can trace the flows of income to specific social groups. As a result of this analysis of interdependencies and circular flow, a SAM (properly disaggregated) can be used to look at backward and forward linkages in an economy. It can also be used to look at multiplier effects \u2013 that is, the ripple effects of a change in final demand throughout the economy, including its direct and indirect effects on employment, income and household well-being. In addition to providing a consistent framework of national accounts, a SAM also incorporates distributional and social dimensions by providing detailed information on various institutions disaggregated by socioeconomic characteristics, such as sex and household types, in addition to a number of sectors. An example of SAM is shown in Table A2.1.

Continued HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 57 The data sources are: \u2022\ufffd National account; \u2022\ufffd Input-output tables; \u2022\ufffd Labour force surveys; \u2022\ufffd Household expenditure surveys; \u2022\ufffd Time-use surveys, and so on. The down side of this process is that the construction of a survey based on a SAM is a formidable task, and can take several years even when undertaken by the statistical office. For this reason most researchers resort to non-survey techniques to update SAMs and input-output tables using various existing sources. Since constructing a SAM can be timely and costly, they tend to be updated relatively infrequently. Hence, SAMs in use often contain approximations that are only as accurate as the approximation itself. A SAM can be very useful for descriptive analysis, and it can be used in relatively simple ways to get first pass information on the impacts of changes in trade policies. For example, what would be the impact of an increase in market access from a trade agreement that would allow for an increase in exports of some key sectors? Simple manipulations of the SAM can give basic multiplier impacts on income and employment as well as linkage effects. This information can be even more informative if the SAM includes a gender breakdown for factors of production, information on the compositions and activities of households, and time-use data. SAM extension for better gender analysis Fontana and Rodgers (2005) proposes to extend SAM by providing a greater level of detail for existing accounts, for example, by further disaggregating agricultural sectors into female-intensive and male-intensive crops, if the issue of concern is gender relations in rural settings. They also suggest to add new data and to broaden definitions of what constitutes production or assets. A valuation of reproductive activities at the household level, for example, would contribute to this. Their suggestions on how to extend SAM to permit a richer gender analysis at all macro, meso, and micro-levels are summarized below. Macro- level analysis involves examining the gender division of the labour force between the different productive market sectors and the reproductive sectors. Meso-level analysis looks at the institutions that help structure the distribution of resources and activities for leisure that uses empirical estimates of the income elasticity of labour supply separately for women and men. It involves examining gender inequalities in public provision as well as gender biases in the operating rules of labour, commodity, and other markets. Micro-level analysis examines the gender division of labour, resources, and decision-making, particularly within the household. Fontana and Rodgers (2005) argue that SAM and CGE models describe macro-aggregates, but also can, and often do, incorporate a considerable level of detail for both \u2018meso\u2019 and \u2018micro\u2019 dimensions. Thus, they provide the opportunity to capture gender distortions at many levels.

This can be particularly pernicious because their complexity and, at times, false precision make them appear more \u201cscientific\u201d and valid than they actually are. Moreover, similar to SAM, the CGE model requires enormous input to create a meaningful analysis. Since this is costly and time consuming to implement, a CGE model should be used carefully and only for issues and in ways for which they are best suited. CGE models: An introduction CGE models provide comprehensive representation among impact assessment methodologies of economy-wide channels of transmission of macroeconomic policy to households. CGE models encompass nearly all agents and markets, although analysis of productive activities is limited to structural sectors, with limited reference to individual or representative enterprises or to enterprise surveys. They also cover both direct and indirect policy effects, including spillovers across sectors and markets, although feedback from microeconomic (household) behaviour back to the macro economy is also limited. CGE models are useful for analysis of income inequality and poverty because they specify in great detail how households earn and spend their incomes. Since most household income in poor countries comes from work, to obtain an accurate measure of policy-induced changes in income distribution, poverty, and welfare, CGE models usually differentiate labour by skill level, education, age, sex, region, or sector of employment. They may also differentiate capital assets by type, sector, or region, and land by type, region, or quality. However, in the standard CGE model, the behaviour of only a number of representative households, those featuring certain interesting characteristics as suggested above, is specified. This structure forces all households in a particular representation into the same income or poverty level. Thus, the greater the disaggregation of households (i.e., the greater the number of representative groups), the more accurate the actual and predicted change in income distribution and poverty. The CGE model is written as a set of simultaneous equations. Most of them are microeconomic, specifying how the quantities supplied and demanded in each market respond to price changes. For production and consumption decisions, household and sector behaviour is captured by nonlinear, first-order optimality conditions of profit and utility maximization. There are also macroeconomic constraints that have to be satisfied but are not necessarily considered by any individual actor. These 26 Many global analyses use the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model and its database of internally consistent global production, consumption, and trade. Furthermore, the massive and robust GTAP database is enriched by an abundance of detailed bilateral trade data, factor endowment usage for each sector of production, and government intervention on international trade for each country. However the downside of the GTAP database is that it does not usually provide sufficient detail for income distribution analysis within countries, in the sense of not providing highly disaggregation for socio-economic groups/household types/ factors of production, GTAP database package provides complete, user-friendly computer software. Like most of the fundamental CGE models, the GTAP was developed based on neoclassical theories. The model uses general equilibrium modeling package to calculate the solutions. The purpose of this package is to perform comparative static analyses for the world economies in response to change in bilateral/multilateral trade conditions. Welfare implementation can be performed in the model as well. GTAP is coordinated by the Center for Global Trade Analysis, Department of Agricultural Economics, Purdue University in the United States. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 59 constraints impose equilibrium on markets for factors and goods as well as on macroeconomic accounts for saving and investment, the government, and payments to and from the rest of the world. The main database for a CGE model is a SAM or an extended input-output table. But a SAM is merely an accounting system, which contains no behavioral features. It is the equations of the CGE model that define an agents\u2019 behaviour and explains all the payments recorded in the SAM. That is, the CGE model is calibrated to a base year. To do this, parameters and endogenous variables \u2013 those that are explained by the model itself \u2013 are given values so that the initial solution replicates the data in the SAM or input-output table for a given year. In addition, parameter values must be consistent within the model. For example, the efficiency parameter for the production function in each sector must make the quantity of output correspond to the quantities of factor inputs.

CGE models are usually constructed to treat a single policy change, such as trade liberalization. However, researchers can modify the model for extended analysis. New developments in CGE models are frequently revealed, which will make it easier to deal with multiple policy change at a time. The models can now handle many non-classical assumptions, such as imperfect competition (e.g., monopoly) and economies of scale. Furthermore, the development in dynamic CGE models seems to be useful in a long-run dynamic simulation in the future.27 And as long as a SAM is used as the database for a CGE model, household disaggregation could reveal more fruitful outcome of the models. It is not easy for the user of CGE models to check for complementarities obtainable by combining major macroeconomic policy reforms, such as trade liberalization and investment in education. They may sometimes not be able to capture the detailed effects of policy changes. CGE models can identify the winners and losers from a policy reform and help design programs to compensate the losers, especially those who are already poor. This contribution is important for policy-makers in managing their budgets. Analogous to the CGE model, the microsimulation model also highlights household behaviour, consumption patterns, and micro-level income distribution. The database of this model also comes in the form of an input-output structure. The advantage of this model is that the database used can be divided into a sub-group of population, such as gender, occupation, ethnicity, income, and so on. Since this type of model needs an enormous amount of detailed data about households, it is limited by household survey data to support the model. One crucial point to note is that most CGE models examine the \u201clong-term equilibrium effects\u201d of policy reform. Needless to say, this is a hypothetical construct since economies almost never converge to their \u201clong-term equilibrium.\u201d In this sense, CGE models provide estimated hypothetical impacts that must then be carefully interpreted. In principle, they can also incorporate equilibrium growth rates. Thus, CGE models are best suited for identifying the long-term winners and losers from trade liberalization, in absolute or relative terms. A CGE model is solved numerically using mathematical simultaneous (linear/nonlinear) equations solvers, including General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) and General Equilibrium Modeling Package software.28 One can develop a model and insert a SAM or input-output table database of your choice. However, the major problem for the software usage is that complex computer source codes are needed for converting mathematical simultaneous equations to computer languages. 27 Francois (1998) classifies CGE models into three levels: (1) the first class model - the model emphasizes the static effects of policy related to general equilibrium resources allocation; (2) the second class model - the model involves scales of economies and imperfect competition; and (3) the third class model - the model involves dynamic accumulation effects. Currently, there is a vast amount of research and development on the second and third class CGE models, the majority of which could be helpful for human development analysis. 28 The GAMS was developed by GAMS Development Corporation, www.gams.com. The GAMPACK is developed by Center of Policy Studies in Faculty of Business and Economics at Monash University, www.monash.edu.au/policy/gempack.htm 60 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit Several organizations have developed their own CGE model and sometime release it for public to use, with or without cost. For example, the \u2018standard\u2019 model developed by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is available from its website (www.ifpri.org), which can be applied to any country with a SAM. The IFPRI also has collected and made available a large number of country SAMs on their website. The main advantage of the package is its enormous database for world economies, especially information about bilateral trade. Using an input-output structure, the GTAP database (version 7) contains 57 sectors of production and 113 regions.29 Although the original GTAP model does not involve such real world complexities as imperfect competition and scale economies, multiple studies have suggested several adjustments to the original GTAP model that make it useful for a wide variety of cases.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db166762-b860-4998-8695-1bc71f0674e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "db166762-b860-4998-8695-1bc71f0674e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf1efd2ce69fb9347c8840f6a1ca6a9561e58e38eedb957a73d911920617154f"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e39fbb8-66da-49e7-b667-81585cc67351", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d26100609760551392dd4387ff3f48e0d2a8bbc27a38aa00f53ee1202434a0bd"}}, "hash": "92c1dcd657cc1c60294763e9b3548669bdd8a0de003ca6cf37db1a65ee4daf62", "text": "CGE models have come in for a great deal of critical assessment in recent years.

According to the study, trade liberalization seems to benefit all regions. The welfare and real wage improvement can be found in each region. However, countries with the same characteristics as the developed countries, such as capital-labor ratio and human development index, tend to have the biggest advantage while the LDCs gain the least. Moreover, inequality can be found in the simulation results in all regions except within developed countries. Changes in real wage for skilled labour tend to grow faster than that of unskilled labour in those regions. Quantitative limitations To assess policy reforms for a particular economy, key variables and parameters (numeric constants) are chosen so that pre- reform results from the CGE model conform as closely as possible to actual economic outcomes in a given year (the \u201cbase\u201d year). Often, these variables and constants are \u201cguessed\u201d since not all countries have the necessary data. Also, when data do exist, at the level of detail needed for a CGE, they are very expensive and time consuming to collect. Moreover, there are limitations in extending the CGE to include quality variables, such as non-tariff barriers, for instance. The standard for quantifying such variables has not been firmly set. Complexity As explained, the purpose of the CGE model is to simulate post-reform outcomes. However, a major problem is that the requirement to replicate \u201cas closely as possible\u201d base-year outcomes can be satisfied by virtually any model, making it hard to choose between alternative constructions or behaviour patterns. This inevitably leads to discussion about estimations of elasticities and parameters used within the model. Further, CGE models are so complex and full of technical assumptions and devices used to obtain base-year outcomes and macro-micro consistency that it is difficult to interpret the results. Finally, results are often sensitive to small changes in parameter values, many of which are somewhat arbitrary in practice because of data constraints. Adjustment costs Most CGE models cannot identify adjustment costs, that is, those who suffer disproportionately from the transitional adjustment costs of trade liberalization. Nor can they identify those who may become persistently poor because they cannot recover from transitional costs or adjust to the new situation without government assistance. To arrive at this information the analyst has to model the short-term dynamic process leading to economic equilibrium, which is very difficult, or use another methodology, such as participatory poverty assessments, which includes the poor to describe and analyze their living situation. 29 For details, please see www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 61 Misspecification and alternative closures One of the most important issues concerns the theoretical causal structure embedded in the CGE model. Different theoretical presumptions about causation are embedded in what are called \u201cclosures\u201d of the model. It makes a large difference for the quantitative outcomes of the simulations as to whether the model assumes full employment, no change in the government budget balance, and balanced foreign trade (as in the neo-classical closure) or whether the model allows for changes in government budgets, unemployment, and the trade balance. Aggregation and data integration As discussed below, different levels and types of aggregation by gender or ethnic group are possible in developing SAMs for use in CGE models. It is crucial to have the level of aggregation and the variety of data appropriate to the question at hand. Having gender disaggregated data, for example, allows the assessment of gender impacts, and time-use data in the household allows for analysis of impacts on processing of household reproduction. Empirical relevance Pre-reform model predictions for distribution or poverty should be checked against post-reform outcomes as revealed by labour and household surveys. One study that did this concluded that predictions from CGE models are not accurate (Ferreira et al. 2003). Even when the predictions are borne out by events, household survey analysis cannot determine whether the outcomes were caused by the policy reform or by some other force(s). Other considerations Changes to domestic consumer prices due to trade reform directly affect household welfare, if consumption of the affected goods accounts for a significant share of household spending. The responsiveness of domestic prices to a change in the price at border depends on the structure of domestic supply (by enterprises or farms) and demand (by households or, for intermediate goods, by other enterprises). It may also be affected by structural changes due to trade reform, if goods shift from traded to non-traded sectors, or if domestic markets are destroyed or created. To estimate the change in prices from an anticipated reform, one may conduct a value chain analysis, which documents", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9d8be8f-ceeb-4d72-a5d9-1ed81613b80d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9d8be8f-ceeb-4d72-a5d9-1ed81613b80d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7862f679270a6a009c130632ba054676dbd37f0968a059219e5271cd42ac4ef4"}, "3": {"node_id": "f1605e56-49da-499d-a0c0-af7525227bed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffd0b143afd2a4e61ca6b20ee83327f6e5b02ebb17404cef1890a4109b13f7f4"}}, "hash": "693011e4d7c2b6e521215a8dd2e3bcf3b71ad4f07b6ef572a1b7befdd14b1c5d", "text": "production and packaging of the good from the producers or importers to wholesalers and on to retailers. Or one may simply estimate, over time, the relationship between border and consumer prices for the goods, using periodic price surveys. Trade reform may also change producer prices, which also affect household welfare as adjustments to output affect wages and employment in the labour market. If trade reform enhances profitability or reduces costs in domestic production of the affected goods, demand for labour is likely to rise with output. Whether this leads to an increase in employment or wages, or some combination of the two, depends on labour market regulations and the supply of labour. To forecast this, one would estimate the labour intensity of production, the sensitivity of demand for labour to changes in output, and the responsiveness of labour supply to increased demand. Trade reform may have different effects on skilled and unskilled labour, depending on whether the affected sector uses skilled or unskilled labour intensively. Trade may also differentially affect men and women, younger and older people, experienced and inexperienced workers, or labour markets in different regions. A large share of government revenue in the typical developing country comes from tariffs and export taxes. Trade reform that lowers these tax rates without also removing exemptions may reduce revenue significantly, unless other taxes or sources of revenue are created to replace the lost funds. To maintain macroeconomic stability, the government may then be forced to reduce spending, including spending on social programs and rural infrastructure, both of which matter to poor households. Gender-sensitive CGE modelling CGE models are adaptable to a range of issues related to inequality, poverty, and other dimensions of human development. Fontana and some of her colleagues have made great progress in modifying the SAM and CGE framework to assess the 62 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit impacts of trade policy changes on women and men. Fontana and Wood (2000), Fontana (2001), and Fontana (2003) studied the impact of trade liberalization on women\u2019s and men\u2019s wages, jobs, and their time use between household work and leisure by using Bangladesh and Zambia SAMs. Raihan et al. (2010) assessed gender-differentiated impacts of domestic trade liberalization and the phasing out of Multi-Fibre Arrangements on wages, time allocation between paid and unpaid work, and leisure in Bangladesh. Raihan (2009) examined the gender-differentiated impacts of tariff reduction and implementation of VAT during the 1990s for Bangladesh on labour supply, wages, and time-allocation.

The study demonstrated that the microsimulation model does not have any effect when linked with the CGE model if the focus is on macroeconomic impact. However, when the focus is on poverty and inequality, the difference between the two models is crucial. Cororaton and Cockburn (2004) (cited in Ahmed and O\u2019donoghue 2007) investigated poverty effects of tariff reductions, which led to a reduction in consumer prices in the Philippines. Overall poverty was reduced between 1994 and 2000. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit 63 However, the developed regions including the capital region where the incidence of poverty was already low appeared to experience greater poverty reduction than the least developed regions. Moreover, problems of inequality seem to have increased, especially in a rural area. These studies have made a significant contribution to the model development since microsimulation models include important features regarding microeconomic details and behaviour that the CGE model lacks. At the same time, CGE models cover more ground on macroeconomic and international linkages. Although modelling the link is still very complicated and needs further development, successful linkage will introduce a powerful general equilibrium model to answer human development questions in detail. Dynamic CGE model A dynamic CGE model with informal sector and human capital accumulation has been developed in Gibson (2005) to verify the effects of globalization on growth and distribution. Among the study\u2019s many insights and conclusions, the primary finding suggests that a country\u2019s trade openness may lead a region to increasing poverty, unemployment, and stagnation. One important reason for this is the lack of human capital accumulation. Thus, a region may be uncompetitive in the export of skill-intensive goods if it has a low level of educational support or if its households have a low education budget, which leads to the problem mentioned above. A2.2.3 Partial equilibrium analysis Partial equilibrium analysis is an analysis focusing not on an entire economy but on a particular market or industry within the economy at a particular time. Hence, the Partial Equilibrium model, unlike the CGE models, allows for far fewer variables in the analysis. The Partial Equilibrium model normally treats every parts of the economy as exogenous except for the part of interest. Thus, it requires a much smaller database with fewer equations. A big advantage for this method is that it focuses on a particular household, firm, or industry, which can reveal some insightful details about that particular part of the economy. However, as mentioned above, this technique treats everything else as a constant, so it might not capture some indirect effects that may arise from the change in other parts of the economy. Partial equilibrium can be considered microeconomic analysis, and its limitations make it difficult to explore economy-wide effects of policy changes. However, the advantage of this method is that when we combine it with a CGE model, which does provide economy-wide effects, we can then induce that change in the partial equilibrium model for further information. CPI and NSC (2007) applied the partial equilibrium model to estimate the potential human development impacts of duty-free access to the US and EU markets in the post-ATC period, as discussed above. A2.2.4 Factor analysis: Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes (MIMIC) and Structural Equation Models (SEMs)30 Factor analysis is an econometrics model that assumes capabilities are unobservable variables seen only through a set of indicators. In the model, the observed values are postulated to be functions of a certain number of latent variables, called \u201cfactors.\u201d Therefore, the model provides a theoretical framework for explaining the functions by means of capabilities represented by the latent factors. By examining the relationship between causes and functioning via latent capabilities, the model is useful to identify parameters that can help in designing policies. Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes (MIMIC) Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes (MIMIC) is the simpler form of a Structural Equation Model (SEM). Observed variables (achievements/ functionings) are manifestations of a latent variable of capabilities, and there are exogenous variables that cause the latent factor(s). However, MIMIC does not take into account: (1) the feedback mechanisms; and (2) conversion from capabilities to achievement (e.g., two people with same capabilities but different functionings due to socio-cultural characteristics cannot be explained).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "661dd9b1-e2c0-46f2-9016-cec3025f1dc8": {"__data__": {"id_": "661dd9b1-e2c0-46f2-9016-cec3025f1dc8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c72d232100bf6a6da3a5f40840c37f8f87569c92dbb490d7a4df7671a9aa16b"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce438a80-5a6f-4f89-8c45-705b3db77ccf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "50689a7253a634cefa6a3ed6647581cad7e5217253af4d0f6e35225f91b751db"}}, "hash": "b0c4327831f95fa5c5c6a941af5252af10a6f6d00d49cb5f69dfcb5e6e61c2c4", "text": "Box A2.2 illustrates the theoretical framework of MIMIC. 30 This section is based on the theoretical framework and empirical studies by Krishnakuma (2007), Di Tommaso (2007a), and Di Tommaso (2007b). 64 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TRADE POLICY: A Toolkit Box A2.2: MIMICtheoretical framework Source: Di Tommaso", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d13b727c-a54c-49f2-aedf-b63c0203ae45": {"__data__": {"id_": "d13b727c-a54c-49f2-aedf-b63c0203ae45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy: A Toolkit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8452292f81dc337be3033ac6787e98c6fd4d93c403c8a9e366d4b63422bb0e11"}, "3": {"node_id": "df5cb166-3c0a-485a-a6ec-e14e4d0ad269", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/human-development-impact-assessment-trade-policy-toolkit", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3419fad6d357393a24c9ab1b0cbb7c138687f9c91195f5b31103061fa23c2f15"}}, "hash": "66600b476dac43d398114eac4afb29e0268a4973c4a9adb67707996ecb2b2c5d", "text": "(2007a).

Of key interest in the context of the impact of the implementation of stricter intellectual property protection under the TRIPS agreement on human development is the access of HIV patients to treatment, particularly access to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. Studies have shown that women\u2019s and men\u2019s behaviours in terms of access to ARV drugs differ. For example, studies in Asia found that when a woman is HIV positive, even if she was infected by her husband, she suffers more discrimination, stigma, and abuse than a man within her household and community, which in turn affects her willingness to seek treatment. A survey in India also found that one fourth of women did not seek treatment due to financial constraints, while this factor affected only 11 percent of men (Pradhan and Sundar 2006). Women\u2019s behaviour is also influenced by their marital status, economics status, and whether another family member (e.g., husband) is also HIV positive or not. Various social and cultural characteristics can also influence their capabilities and, thus, their functionings.

Hypothetically, if we can collect sample data among HIV patients who stopped taking ARV drugs due to price increases caused by the implementation of stricter IPRs protection under the TRIPS Agreement, by using SEMs we may be able to assess the direct impact of TRIPS on patient\u2019s well-being distinguished by such social characteristics as sex and marital status.

The connections between climate change and the increased incidence of hurricanes, droughts, massive floods, similar destructive phenomena and the ensuing human and material losses are now becoming more apparent. Caribbean and Pacific countries are Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and so face the vulnerabilities associated with their small size. Residents of remote rural villages and outer islands are particularly threatened. Climate risk cannot be adequately mitigated or managed without understanding and acting on the basis of how these risks play out on the ground among men and women. As women and men have different socially prescribed roles and therefore to a large extent, engage in different types of activities, and occupy different spaces, the exposure to risk and its impact on women and men cannot be considered or treated in the same manner. If risk management policies and practices are to be effective, there must be sensitivity to these differences in exposure and impact. We must also acknowledge, in the search for solutions, the various coping and adaptation strategies men and women undertake at the local level. For fragile countries and communities living in precarious situations, the way forward requires recognizing and mobilizing the talents and capacities of all, and moving beyond stereotypes. UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon recently noted that \u201cwomen hold up more than half the sky and represent much of the world\u2019s unrealized potential\u2026 they are natural leaders. We need their full engagement.\u201d In the field of disaster risk management and climate change, as in other development sectors, empowering and fully engaging women alongside men will be key to achieving progress. National disaster managers and regional coordinating bodies such as the Carib- bean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) and SOPAC Division of Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) have recently begun to address the gender aspects of climate risk management. However, much work remains to be done in order to consistently incorporate a gender perspective into ongoing disas- ter preparedness and management in Caribbean and Pacific island communities. 4 UNDP is facilitating an inter-regional programme to foster south-south partner- ship between CDEMA, SPC and other regional partners to share best practices and strategies around common climate risk management issues facing SIDS.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "161858df-76a6-410d-b32e-85237a747285": {"__data__": {"id_": "161858df-76a6-410d-b32e-85237a747285", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-disaster-risk-management-sids", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrating Gender in Disaster Risk Management in SIDS", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-disaster-risk-management-sids", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b66390ed32f64489be4ba6fffe6209e79f6bb7f62eac83912821cfd6a8afe574"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc302896-b977-40bc-b73c-a4a173e6a8e5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-disaster-risk-management-sids", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "922481bf5b15928f9826d558debd83d8abecb9ad8e78d8ebb2ef2d33a200bece"}}, "hash": "65460ea98936856f5c012578891ea7dc7b6b93f74fcc4b19694cabd3da3f8ac3", "text": "A critical element of this programme is the gender mainstreaming.

Both regions are highly vulnerable to natural disasters; this vulnerability is now greater due to an increase in extreme weather events such as drought, heavy rains, hurricanes and sea level warming and rise due to climate change and human activity on the ecosystem. Integrating gender into disaster risk management in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) is supported by the following considerations, as outlined in the Hyogo Framework for Action1: \u2022 A gender perspective should be integrated into all disaster risk management policies, plans and decision-making processes, including those related to risk assessment, early warning, information management, and education and training; \u2022 Disaster-prone developing countries, especially least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states, warrant particular attention in view of their higher vulnerability and risk levels, which often greatly exceed their capacity to respond to and recover from disasters. This guide outlines the vulnerability of SIDS in the Pacific and the Caribbean and explains how gender roles and responsibilities result in differential exposure and impact of disasters. Putting on a \u201cgender lens\u201d means analysing what men and women do in their daily lives, looking at how they interact and what specific needs arise out of this. By understanding gender the disaster manager will be able to: \u2022 save lives by better targeting of beneficiaries \u2022 ensure the effective and efficient distribution and use of resources in the plan- ning and implementation of all phases of disaster risk reduction \u2022 empower women and men to assess risks and undertake actions \u2022 enable participation of both men and women in every phase of the project and programme cycle in the area of disaster risk management. 8 Training workshops for disaster risk managers and practitioners on gender main- streaming have been held by UNDP and other agencies in the Caribbean and the Pacific. As a result, participants have called for concrete tools to help them iden- tify and integrate gender into their decision-making and actions on the ground in every phase of disaster risk management. This guide is a response to these calls. It is intended to provide national disaster management personnel working in the SIDS with a tool to strengthen their practice; it is not intended to be exhaustive and should be considered as an aid to complement pre-existing knowledge.

The term gen- der does not replace the term sex, which refers exclusively to the biological differ- ences between men and women; sex is determined at birth and is universal.2 Gender refers to the social attributes, opportunities and relations associated with being male or female in any given cultural or social group.3 Gender determines what is expected, permitted and valued in a woman or a man in a determined context.4 Gender relations are not fixed, but can and do change over time. Gender does not mean \u201cwomen\u201d. However, in most societies the female gender is defined as having less power and fewer opportunities, privileges and rights than the male gender. Given this disadvantaged position in many countries, the pro- motion of gender equality implies an explicit attention to women\u2019s empowerment. Gender equality means that each gender has equal conditions for realizing their hu- man rights and potential, to engage in political, economic, social and cultural de- velopment, and benefit from the outcomes. The Millennium Declaration states that gender equality is both a goal in itself (MDG-3) and a condition to combat poverty, hunger and disease and achieve all other goals. Equality between men and women is seen as a precondition for, and indicator of, sustainable development.5 An approach that takes gender into account recognizes that men and women have different priorities and needs and face different constraints, and thus different measures might be needed for women and men. Applying additional supportive measures to \u201clevel out the playing field\u201d is known as gender equity.

A gender analysis helps identify difference between men and women in terms of activities, conditions, needs, and control over resources and access to develop- ment benefits and decision\u2013making. Three elements need to be examined: \u2022 Division of labour. Men commonly are involved in the productive sphere whereas women often carry the reproductive tasks of caring for children, elderly and the sick, as well as running the household. Differences in social stature, wages or access to decision\u2013making due to a gendered division of labour must be considered. \u2022 Division of resources. Access to capital assets and control over resources impacts an individual or household\u2019s ability to mitigate the effects of disaster. \u2022 Needs. Practical and strategic needs differ greatly between men and women. Women, girls, boys and men belonging to different socio\u2013economic groups have distinct vulnerabilities, which shape the way they experience disaster and how they recover from it. When disasters occur, the mortality rate for women may be higher because they aren\u2019t warned, have not been taught to swim or have behav- ioral restrictions that limit their mobility in face of risk, such as leaving the house alone.6 When planning for disaster, one must be able to examine the needs and constraints shaped by gender. GENDERED DIVISION OF LABOUR IN SOME SIDS For livelihoods, women are usually in charge of planting food crops, weeding, assisting in harvesting, carrying crops from the plantation, marketing food crops and caring for small livestock such as pigs in Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea. Men engage in land preparation, selecting plantation site, controlling crop income and choosing what to give away and to whom. Export crops are said to be \u201cmen\u2019s crops\u201d. Fishing, in particular traditional \ufb01shing for household consumption and deep-sea \ufb01shing for local and international markets, is a male activity in Kiribati and Samoa. Fishing activities for women are con\ufb01ned to shallow waters where they forage for shell\ufb01sh, sea worms or sea cucumber for both family meals and road side vending. In Caribbean communities, women play traditional roles related to caring for children and the elderly, preparing household meals, caring for domestic animals in rural communities and fetching water.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "744b03f2-cd43-4c6e-b522-fc961e5933c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "744b03f2-cd43-4c6e-b522-fc961e5933c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-disaster-risk-management-sids", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrating Gender in Disaster Risk Management in SIDS", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-disaster-risk-management-sids", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21a54cb38e8729a2709931de37476877791ab5976ac4d90d30107847512a6f1b"}, "2": {"node_id": "efcb2237-8f74-45b8-86c4-89c9d3a1dee4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-disaster-risk-management-sids", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f632fd7800539d3c04b09f5fba614556ce5fa753186043eb05c7bceda1146a29"}}, "hash": "0e18ee6ee7d5c5cfcbfe170a5231df11cf95d4f6ceeb8e1cc00353486414911c", "text": "Although there are few cultural restrictions on women obtaining employment outside of the home, the imperative of domestic responsibilities often mean that women have a double workload.

The countries are widely variable in physical and population size. The most highly populated Caribbean countries are Cuba, (11.4 million), the Dominican Republic (9.6 million) and Haiti (9.0 million). The least populated countries include Saint Kitts and Nevis (40,000), Dominica (72,000), and Montserrat (5,879). In terms of territory,9 continental Guyana and Suriname are the largest in the region. Cuba is the largest island country in the region, with a land mass of 110,860 km\u00b2, followed by the Dominican Republic (48,730 km\u00b2) and Haiti (27,750 km\u00b2). Montserrat (102 km\u00b2) is the smallest island in the region. Haiti is by far the poorest country. The small island developing states of the Caribbean include Antigua and Bar- buda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the Netherlands Antilles, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos, and the United States Virgin Islands.10 Issues and Concerns: SIDS Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean and the Pacific share a number of characteristics which make them vulnerable to external threats.

Environmental degra- dation, such as the destruction of mangroves and coral reefs, often exacerbates vulnerabilities and can be the factor that transforms a climate extreme, such as a heavy downpour, into a disaster. Predicted sea level rise will lead to a greater occurrence of coastal erosion, storm surges and damage to human settlements. It has been estimated that, in the 1990s alone, the cost of natural disasters in the Pacific region was about $US2.8 billion dollars,12 mostly affecting the Melanesian countries. For example, Samoa has reported an average economic loss worth 46% of the annual GDP during disaster years between 1950 \u2013 2004.13 Cyclone Heta, which devastated Niue in 2004, with wave heights of 13.7 metres.

In 2009 the world witnessed the severity of the Haiti earthquake, in which an estimated 230,000 people died, 300,000 injured and 1,000,000 were made homeless.

Gender and Vulnerability: SIDS Men and women in the Pacific and the Caribbean face challenges that increase their vulnerability to the impact of disasters. This includes poverty, food insecurity, unequal access to decision making and resources and dependent economies \u2014 REASONS FOR INTEGRATING GENDER IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT \u2022 Women and men \u2013 in their respective social roles \u2013 are differently affected by the effects of climate change and variability. \u2022 Women and men \u2013 in their respective social roles \u2013 are differently affected by climate protection instruments and measures; \u2022 Women and men differ with regard to their respective perceptions of and reactions to climate change and variability; \u2022 Women\u2019s and men\u2019s contributions to climate change and variability differ, especially in their respective CO2 emissions.

Enhancing Gender Visibility in Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change in the Caribbean GENDER SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT CYCLE PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT CYCLE CHECKLISTS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES 17 issues which are common in SIDS. The threat of natural disasters is a constant in the lives of the people of these regions. Female poverty is of specific concern in terms of disaster management. The worldwide increase in women\u2019s poverty is caused by factors such as lower wages, increased workload, insufficient social support systems, violence, meager op- portunities for participation in decision\u2013making and limited access to education and productive resources.17 This poverty exacerbates vulnerability in situations of crisis. Research suggests that the poorest are often the most severely affected by disasters as they have the least resources to buffer against the event.18 In the assessment of Grenada following Hurricane Ivan, when poverty data is crossed with gender statistics, it is evident that 52% of poor households, with the largest families, were headed by women. Poverty leaves women more vulnerable and dependent in times of disasters. Access to fewer resources is compounded by responsibilities as the primary caregivers to children, the disabled and the elderly, leaving poor women without time and assistance to prepare adequately for disasters, attend to post\u2013disaster reconstruction or ensure successful recovery. Rural poverty also requires special consideration in the assessment of natural disasters in SIDS, since, in addition to potential loss of property, rural conditions following a disaster and ability to recover may threaten food security at a house- hold, community and national level. Female and male livelihoods are both affected by natural disasters; farmers, agricultural workers or fisher folk are some of the worst affected. In both regions, workers in the tourist industry can be negatively impacted by natural disasters, which tend to interrupt the tourist economy and may result in damage to tourist facilities. Post\u2013disaster employment may be centred on re\u2013construction, favouring POVERTY AND VULNERABILITY IN HAITI The overall incidence of poverty in Haiti is 77%. In rural areas, which are home to 60% of the population, 88% of people are below the poverty line and 67% are extremely poor or indigent. Rural people have a per capita income that is about 1/3 of the income urbanites. The poorest groups of rural people in Haiti are: (i) women who are heads of households; (ii) rural workers who depend exclusively on wage labour; and (iii) landless people. Scarce household and public resources and consequent environmental degradation have resulted in a limited capacity for response on the part of households to recurrent natural crises.

GENDER SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT CYCLE PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT CYCLE CHECKLISTS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES 19 Disaster Risk Management Cycle A disaster is a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a soci- ety causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.22 Disaster risk management (DRM) is a process for reducing, mitigating or prevent- ing the risk of disaster. It involves systematically incorporating a number of strategies in areas of administration and management, within the community and in institutions and organizations, through policies, programmes and projects to reduce the impact of natural hazards and other threats on people and the envi- ronment using structural and non\u2013structural methods.23 The main goal of disas- ter risk management is to reduce the risk of disaster by reducing vulnerability and building resilience within communities, households and individuals. \u2022 Risk is expressed by the formula, Risk = Hazard x (Vulnerability - Capacity).24 The risk of disaster occurs therefore, when people are vulnerable and exposed to a range of hazards such as earthquakes, cyclones and hurricanes, drought, toxic spills or civil conflicts. Vulnerability is reduced by enhancing or leverag- ing the varied capacities of men and women and building resilience. \u2022 Vulnerability is caused by the sum of social, economic, environmental or physi- cal factors which increase people\u2019s susceptibility to be adversely impacted by a disaster event. This increases the risk of loss of life and/or property. The more clearly those vulnerabilities are identified and understood, at all levels and within all groups, the more successfully individuals and communities can be better prepared to withstand disaster events. \u2022 Resilience is defined as the capacity of a system, community or society potentially exposed to hazards to adapt, by resisting or changing in order to reach and maintain an acceptable level of functioning and structure. This is determined by the degree to which the social system is capable of organizing itself to increase its capacity for learning from past disasters for better future protection and to improve risk reduction measures.25 In order to incorporate gender into disaster risk management, it is important to understand the four phases of DRM Cycle. The pre\u2013disaster phase includes mitigation and preparedness; the post\u2013disaster phase includes response and recovery. Gender analysis related to the vulnerability and capacities of men and women in each phase is necessary to ensure the best outcomes for men and women, boys and girls in the event of a disaster. GENDER SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT CYCLE PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT CYCLE CHECKLISTS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES 20 Pre-Disaster Phase The main objectives of risk reduction can be summarized: 1. Mitigation \u2014 Mitigation is defined as a sustained action to reduce or elimi- nate risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. 2. Preparedness \u2014 Preparedness can best be defined as a state of readiness to respond to a disaster, crisis or any other type of emergency situation.26 Examples of mitigation activities: \u2022 Structural activities - Retrofitting buildings to better withstand earthquakes - Building dams to prevent floods - Building retaining walls to protect against landslides - Planting forests to buffer against storms - Engaging in agricultural mitigation measures (i.e. crop diversification, plant- ing of shelter breaks, food storage programs) \u2022 Non\u2013structural activities - Development, review and implementation of legal frameworks that protect the human rights of men, women and children - Reviewing legal frameworks to ensure that an enabling environment for structural mitigation requirements are adequately covered (ie. land\u2013use planning, building codes) - Training and education to ensure that mitigation programs will be supported and properly implemented - Appropriate governance structures to ensure the full participation of men and women in decision\u2013making that affects them Implementing mitigation programs and activities requires the participation and support

Gender norms foster more \u201crisk taking\u201d among men and \u201crisk avoidance\u201d among women, with implications for preparedness and safety in disasters. Women tend to seek out information regarding disasters and pay greater attention to warnings. \u2022 Men and women\u2019s roles dictate how they use resources that impact on the environment, how environmental impacts affect their livelihoods differently, and what their risks might be during a natural hazard. o In the Paci\ufb01c, women and men face different environmental impacts depending on where they \ufb01sh. Coastal erosion will impact upon women\u2019s livelihoods since they tend to \ufb01sh in near-shore areas, while environmental impacts, such as rising sea temperatures, will reduce \ufb01sh stocks and result in more male unemployment because men engage primarily in deep seas \ufb01shing. o In the Caribbean, carrying water exposes women and men to health problems. Women\u2019s greater use of water for household chores and domestic use, together with their vulnerabilities exposes them to serious health risks. Some women suffered miscarriages because they carry water throughout the nine months of their pregnancy. \u2022 Women are often found in much smaller numbers in formal and informal decision-making bodies and consultations on disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. They are therefore less likely to receive critical information for emergency preparedness and less likely to participate in decision making and policy development in these \ufb01elds. \u2022 In some communities in the Paci\ufb01c, the formal risk management sector, such as the disaster management and meteorological services are still dominated by men. On the other hand, NGOs that contribute to risk reduction through environmental manage- ment, health and social services, and community-based management have 80% female leadership. In some communities in the Caribbean, more women tend to participate and are represented in neighbourhood campaigns and grassroots mitigation strategies.

GENDER ISSUES IN THE POST-DISASTER PHASE \u2022 During the emergency and recovery stages, women extend their reproductive role from the family to the community with non-remunerative duties such as providing safe spaces for abused women, child care and peer support. They host displaced women and families, meet broader community needs as volunteers, use women\u2019s organizations to fundraise and advocate for the needs of vulnerable people to help move their communi- ties forward. It is important not to view women as victims, they also have capacities that can be called upon in response and recovery phases. \u2022 In quantifying the loss in a household, there must exist the understanding that the house is not only a place for living, but also a productive area for women, and plays a key role in their social and economic relations in the community. \u2022 Damage assessments are often blind to gender considerations; \ufb01nancial proposals and recovery programmes/projects tend not to address gender, a fact which contributes to the poorest sectors staying poor on a permanent basis. This absence hinders gender equality, which directly affects the women \u2013 causing a negative impact on their recovery capacity, while indirectly affecting the entire community \u2013 since the women assume the majority of the basic social activities implemented by the government in the aftermath of a crisis. \u2022 Traditional gender relations can be reinforced by disasters, and existing inequalities exacerbated, leaving women even more vulnerable to subsequent crisis. \u2022 There are also moments of opportunity for women to challenge prevailing gender norms, e.g. using relief funds to leave an abusive relationship, developing new job skills and gaining self-con\ufb01dence and leadership skills through collective action to meet women\u2019s needs and interests. \u2022 Men and women are affected by loss of employment, housing, crops and assets in the aftermath. Due to the gendered division of labour, women were least likely to obtain immediate means of securing a livelihood, whereas men are usually able to engage in new opportunities for construction work.

Managing recovery requires building national capacities, restoring coping mechanisms, empowering communities and determining root causes and vulnerabilities which make communities disaster\u2013prone.29 The recovery phase, like the mitigation and preparedness phases, provides excellent opportunities for introducing mechanisms to advance gender equality through gender analysis and gender mainstreaming. Among the activities included in this phase are: \u2022 Mainstream disaster risk reduction in the recovery/development process \u2014 strengthen national systems for disaster risk reduction; review existing policy, or develop new policy as necessary; ensure that appropriate information about disaster risk is available; develop specific projects to build capacities in the government and civil society; set up new governance structures or improve existing structures for greater accountability. \u2022 Promote participatory approaches and decentralised planning and program- ming for recovery \u2014 ensure that men and women are involved in the assess- ment, planning and programming stages of recovery. The role of women in communities and households should be taken into consideration in planning and programming. \u2022 Enhance safety standards and integrate risk reduction in reconstruction and development \u2014 conduct damage assessments; repair and rehabilitate damaged social and primary infrastructure utilizing improved building codes and safety standards, including roads, bridges, health facilities, markets, water supply infrastructure, etc. \u2022 Improve the living conditions of the affected communities and sectors \u2014 ad- dress employment and livelihood concerns, including short-term gender sensi- tive alternative income generating opportunities; repair and rebuild houses paying attention to improved safety standards; resettle families in safer locations; address housing and land tenure issues; address environmental and water resource issues; address psycho-social issues including post disaster stress. \u2022 Build local and national capacities for increased resilience, risk management and sustainable development \u2014 strengthen local level capacities for planning, conducting risk mapping, developing early warning systems through training and simulation exercises.

There is a lot of scope for conflict between stakeholders in this activity and great skill must be exercised in its facilitation. In a pre\u2013disaster scenario, the involvement of both men and women will allow for a more comprehensive identification of vulnerabilities and program interventions that address prevention and mitigation. In a post\u2013disaster setting, high participation of both men and women will set a more balanced trajec- tory for dealing with the priorities and needs arising out of the disaster. Research is an important step in problem identification. Baseline information collected from primary or secondary sources, disaggregated by sex and other key variables should provide insight into the problem, an understanding of the stake- holders involved, and the context in which they operate. Various tools \u2014 such as problem analysis, situational analysis, and stakeholder analysis \u2014 can be used to analyze this data. Participatory risk assessments, vulnerability and capacity assessment and damage assessments are key methodological approaches that generate information necessary for DRM project design.

The cost of implementing the project Methods of procuring material for the imple- mentation of the project Are procurement procedures transparent and is there gender balance and gender equity in the procurement procedures? The best method of delivering an output based on cost, sustainability, equitability and stability. This is normally done when communities identify options within a mitigation action plan. Should the training of community members in early warning systems be done by experts from outside of the community, or should it be facilitated through a partnership of external specialists and trained community members? Costs and benefits to the stakeholders Will the success of the project be excessively dependent on the non-remunerative activities of women? Methodologies for further research Have focus group discussions with men and women who have a store of traditional knowledge about climate change been held? Has research been conducted to examine gaps identified in the baseline study? Participatory mechanisms to ensure full partici- pation of primary stakeholders How to include groups such as children and youth? Children, youth and schools can play an important part in the implementation of early warning systems and the dissemination of information. Bench mark indicators for monitoring and evaluation What will these be and how will the information be collected? External challenges to the project/program implementation Is there high levels of crime in the area, com- munity seasonal activities or festivals that may prevent full participation of community members in meetings that are necessary for project implementation? A work plan is prepared, management structures agreed upon and the need for any specialists identified. Gender analysis should be integrated into project and operational design in order to attain equitable outcomes.

The financial feasibility and potential social, economic and environmental impacts of the project, as well as technical soundness, gender sensitivity and sustainability should be scrutinized. Further consultation may take place with stakeholders. The primary stakeholders \u2014 the men and women in communities \u2014 should be made aware of the activities that constitute the project/programme and be given an opportunity to provide feedback. Donor agencies also provide expertise at this stage of the process. Once the project is appraised, it is ready for approval and funding is made available or sought. Implementation: Important components of implementing project plans and activities include: \u2022 Strict monitoring to ensure timeliness in the roll out of activities. (e.g. if train- ing activities for the disaster preparedness begins before public awareness and communication is implemented, no one may turn up for training) \u2022 Actively promote women\u2019s dignity and empowerment \u2022 Challenge attitudes that discriminate against women; this should be done in a manner that strengthens the enabling environment for gender equality \u2022 Support women to carry out their responsibilities in their traditional areas of authority Encourage women and men to take on non-traditional gender roles freeing up women to take on more strategic roles and allowing men to share the labour in the reproductive or domestic sphere \u2022 Support women\u2019s right to ownership and control of strategic assets such as housing and land, as well as the right to sustain- able livelihoods through income generating and remunerative opportunities \u2022 Protect women and children from the likelihood of increased violence following disasters \u2022 Secure male support for programme activities that uphold women\u2019s rights and empowerment \u2022 Be aware of the vulnerabilities of different groups such as widows, female heads of households, children, and women and men with disabilities \u2022 Establish mechanisms that enable both female and male bene\ufb01ciaries to give feedback on all programmes \u2022 Promote activities that are safe and appropriate, which include the participation of children in community-based disaster risk reduction activities GENDER IN PRACTICE: PROJECT DESIGN GENDER SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT CYCLE PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT CYCLE CHECKLISTS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES 29 \u2022 Effective and efficient management of the budget.

Monitoring is a continuous process over the lifetime of the project. Monitoring and Evaluation: Monitoring ensures that the intended objectives are being achieved, or activities are being modified as needed to achieve intended goals. Monitoring activities include assessing whether the timelines are realistic, the target beneficiaries are utilizing the outputs as planned and/or if the budgetary allocations are adequate. Identifying gender\u2013sensitive indicators to assess progress and collecting sex- disaggregated data are also a part of monitoring. A project designed to raise community awareness and improve disaster prepared- ness can monitor to see if training schedules fit the flow of community work life; if not, the project will fall short of its objectives. Similarly, if the budget allocated for mitigation works is inadequate, or the people are ready to work on a project but no equipment is available for the work to start, the project will also fall short of its objectives. Evaluation may be conducted in the middle as well as the end of the project; the purpose of evaluation is to measure impact in the medium and long term, to ascertain whether the project or programme design was appropriate and to provide feedback on how to move forward. Monitoring and evaluation are com- plementary activities. A good evaluation depends on information collected during the monitoring process, and the monitoring framework for subsequent phases of the project can benefit from evaluation feedback. \u2022 Are gender concerns being addressed as planned in the project design, during the implementation of activities? \u2022 Are there any emerging or unanticipated gender concerns? \u2022 Does the project implementation team have access to gender expertise as needed? \u2022 Is there gender balance in the participation of primary stakehold- ers during project activities?

Community members are most familiar with the social issues that affect them. This is one of the reasons why a participatory approach to obtaining data is vital. When undertaking risk or vulnerability assessments, some areas of data are essential for targeted project/pro- gramme design and implementation.

These include: \u2022 The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development \u2022 Agenda 21 \u2022 The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation; and \u2022 The Millennium Development Goals Within the Mauritius Declaration are statements with special, direct and immedi- ate importance to the goal of gender equality. These include the following: \u2022 Recognition of the need for good governance (statement 11) \u2022 Recognition that particular attention should be given to building resilience in SIDS, including through technology development, capacity building and human resource development (statement 12) \u2022 Recognition that women and youth, as well as the civil society are playing a key role in promoting sustainable development activities in small island devel- opment states, and encourage them in their efforts (statement 15) \u2022 Reaffirmation of SIDS commitment to creating a world fit for children (state- ment 16) \u2022 Recognition of the increasing incidence of health issues, particularly HIV and AIDS which impact disproportionally on women and youth (statement 17). The Mauritius Strategy represents an update, and reinforcement of key concerns and strategies originating from the BPoA, as well as an identification of new and emerging concerns. Each of these 20 sections represent an opportunity to inte- grate gender analysis into the implementation of the strategies identified: 1. Climate change and sea-level rise 2.

The Opening Activities \u2013 especially the Introductions and Expectations Check \u2013 help set the tone of the training workshop. Look for ways to create a friendly atmosphere for the participants and facilitators to feel more at ease in each other\u201fs presence and encourage sharing and open discussions. Introductions and expectation check will set the tone of the training workshop. Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 3 Some examples of lively ways of Introductions and Expectations Check to use: a. Participants select an adjective starting with the first letter of their names describing certain characteristic they possess and draw this using their bodies. b. Participants choose and an animal or object which represents him/her, draws this on paper, introduces himself/herself to the group and explains the drawing. If women and girls are given a different colored paper than the men and boys, this exercise can be used again in Module 2 of the training. 2. Emphasize that in this training workshop, the participants actively interact and engage among themselves and with the facilitators. All critically reflect on their perspectives, attitudes and practice. 3. Learning objectives indicate the expected outputs for each session. Each session helps in the attainment of the overall learning objective/s for each module as contained in the training design. Local and community based disaster risk management is now recognized as a necessary and effective approach to reduce disaster frequency, damage and loss. The participation of and benefits from disaster risk management of all sectors of the community has to be ensured and supported. Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 4 Training Objectives and Programme Context and Rationale The Hyogo Framework for Action, the global roadmap for disaster risk reduction from 2005 \u2013 2015 recognizes both community participation and gender-sensitive disaster risk management. Gender perspective is a cross-cutting principle of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2000 \u2013 2015: on Building Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disaster, which states that: \u201cA gender perspective should be integrated into all disaster risk management policies, plans and decision making processes, including those related to risk assessment, early warning, information management and education and training.\u201d The international community is coming up with policy and practical guidelines on how to mainstream gender in disaster risk management for national governments. This training seeks to fill gaps in practical guidance in gender mainstreaming in disaster risk management at the local and community. Women\u201fs vulnerability in disaster situations is often emphasized, but their contributions to the safety of their home and community is generally unrecognized. Women have unique needs in emergency and disaster situations which have to be addressed, but they also have unique capacities which form the basis for leadership and participation together with men in community based disaster risk management.

Who assists the community? 4. Have each group pick a creative form to present their workshop results (such as a panel interview or drama using their maps and discussion results). If the participants come from the same community, the groups can focus their reports on the general community profile, the disaster experiences and damages incurred or the community and family actions to prepare for, cope with, respond to, and recover from disasters. 5. Ask each group to listen attentively to each of the group reports, especially noting different effects of disasters on the community, men, women, boys and girls and how they prepare for, cope with and recover from disasters. Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 10 6. After all the groups have reported, have a plenary discussion for questions, clarifications, and comments on the group reports. 7. Summarize the presentations and discussion on the community profile, disasters experienced and current responses. 8. Briefly link the local disaster experiences to the Philippine disaster situation. 9. Point out that the results of the workshop on local disaster experiences will be used in the succeeding sessions.

Philippine Country Profile - Disasters, 2007, The OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database, www.em-dat.net - Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain - Brussels - Belgium\" Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 11 Tips to Facilitator 1. In the workshop, questions on effects on men, women, boys, and girls are asked. Note answers or difficulty in providing answers on the different effects of disasters on women and men, and take these into consideration for discussions in Module 2 on Gender Perspective in CBDRM. 2. Psychosocial effects of disasters, especially armed conflict, are usually noted for women and children. However, the loss of property and livelihood also has psychosocial effects on men. An example of cultural effect of disaster in Muslim areas is the inability to exercise obligations in praying. 3. It is not necessary for the groups to work too long on their reports. More details will be added in Module 3 on Gender Sensitive Community Risk Assessment. 4. An alternative method for the workshop is to have the participants do an Activity Profile of men and women (boys and girls) in \u201cnormal times\u201d and during disaster situations and after the disaster. 5.

Natural Hazard Exposure The Philippines is one of the countries in the world that is prone to natural hazards. It recorded a total of 373 disaster events triggered by natural hazards from 1905 to 2006 or about 4 incidents per year (OFDA/CRED, 2006). The country\u201fs exposure to disaster is largely due to its location and geographic landscape. Composed of 7,107 islands, it is one of the world\u201fs largest archipelagos. It has a long coastline which makes it vulnerable to sea-level rise from climatic conditions. The Philippines is located along the Pacific Ring of Fire, making it vulnerable to earthquake, tsunamis and volcanic hazards. It has 220 volcanoes, 22 of which are classified as active. It lies along the Western Pacific Basin, a generator of climatic conditions such as monsoons, thunderstorms, intertropical convergence zones, typhoons and El Ni\u00f1o. On the average, 20 tropical cyclones cross the Philippine area of responsibility annually. The damaging elements of tropical cyclones are high winds, storm surges and floods. 2. Impact of Disasters The impact of disasters in terms of lives lost and damage to property is staggering. Deaths from natural disasters in the 1990 decade and in 2000-2006 have increased compared with the 1980 decade levels. A significant number of deaths are caused by tropical cyclones. The National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) has estimated that an average of 500 people are killed each year due to tropical cyclones during the period 1970-2002. The high number of deaths in the 90s was mainly due to the 1990 earthquake that struck Luzon and the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption wherein lives lost numbered about 2,000 and 6,200 respectively. The NDCC recorded a tot1al number of 36,019 deaths caused by natural disasters from 1980 to 2006 (Table 1). Table 1. Deaths from Natural Disasters in the Philippines: 1980-2006 Years 1980 - 1989 1990 - 1999 2000-2006 No. of Deaths 3,217 24,247 8,555 Source: NDCC The average cost of direct damage from natural disasters from 1970 to 2006 is estimated at PhP15 billion at year 2000 prices (Table 2.2). Direct damage covers damage to agricultural crops, public infrastructure and private homes. Damage is highest at about PhP70 billion in 1978 when 15 disasters struck the country. Other major disasters with high direct damage are the Luzon earthquake in 1990 (about PhP66 billion), the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in 1991 (about PhP33 billion) and the droughts in 1984 and 1987. As a result, the declines in gross domestic product (GDP) were estimated at: (a) 1.2 percent due to the 1990 Luzon earthquake; (b) 0.9 percent due to the Pinatubo eruption; and (c) 0.5 percent average due to typhoons every year.

Death toll from the Typhoons Ondoy (Ketsana) and Pepeng (Parma) in September and October 2009 reached 956, plus 736 injured and 84 missing. More than 9.3 million people \u2013 about 20% of an estimated population of 43.2 million living in the affected regions --- were severely affected. Damage was estimated at $3.22 billion in productive sectors of agriculture, industry, commerce and tourism.

Illustrate and explain the basic concepts of disaster and disaster risk management 2. Discuss the features of the Community Based Approaches in Disaster Risk Management 3. Describe the process to undertake in Community Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM) Key Points 1. There are 3 basic ingredients which make up a disaster \u2013 hazard, vulnerability and capacity. A hazard like a cyclone by itself is not a disaster but becomes a disaster when it strikes a vulnerable community or group whose capacity is inadequate to withstand or cope with its adverse effects, resulting in damages, loss and disruption in community functioning. 2. Disaster risk is the likelihood or probability of suffering damage or loss from the interaction of certain hazard with vulnerable conditions. 3. Disaster risk management (in the past referred to as disaster management) encompasses a broad range of activities to increase capacities and reduce vulnerabilities to prepare for, cope with, respond to and recover from disaster events. 4. The stress in disaster risk management is on the pre-disaster activities of prevention, mitigation and preparedness. 5. Community participation in disaster risk management is recognized as important to reverse the increasing trend in disaster occurrence and losses. People in the community suffer most the disaster damages. In reality, they are the first responders in any disaster and it is to their interest to protect themselves and reduce disaster risk. 6. Basic process of community based disaster risk management involves the following steps: 1) initiating the process; 2) participatory risk assessment; 3) Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 19 participatory risk reduction action planning; 4) strengthening of community based disaster risk management organization; 5) community managed implementation of the disaster risk management plan; 6) monitoring and evaluation and progressive improvements towards safety, disaster resilience and community development Methodology \uf027 \u201cShaking Table Demonstration\u201d, Matching Exercise and Interactive Lecture Process 1. \u201cShaking Table Demonstration\u201d to illustrate the concepts of hazard, vulnerability, risk and risk management. Step 1: Shaking hazard Place the cup, drinking glass and bottle on the table \u2013 the cup in the center, the glass by the edge and the bottle anywhere on the table. Introduce yourself as the hazard, a \u201cshaking hazard\u201d, which will hit the table. Ask participants to describe what will happen to the cup, glass and bottle when the hazard hits the table. The effect or consequence will be falling, breakage, etc. Ask participants to explain why there will be different consequences for the glass, cup and bottle, although all have been exposed to the same hazard. Explain that the cup, glass and bottle have intrinsic vulnerabilities such as shape, thickness, and what they are made of aside from extrinsic vulnerabilities such as location or distance to the edge of the table. Discuss that cup, glass and bottle as the elements at risk have different risk consequences as determined by its particular vulnerabilities. Step 2: Fire hazard Now introduce yourself as another hazard \u2013 for example, a fire. The same elements are exposed to this new hazard but now have different risk consequences \u2013 the plastic bottle will melt, the glass may Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 20 crack, but the cup may not be damaged. Explain that this demonstrates that vulnerabilities and risk consequences are hazard-specific. So, for example, saying that \u201cwomen and children are vulnerable\u201d is not specific. It is better to say that \u201cin a flood, women and children have higher risk of drowning\u201d; this in turn points the way to particular risk reduction measures such as training in swimming, climbing, running.

Step 3: Risk Management measures Explain that if the hazard cannot be prevented from reaching the community and households, then actions are taken to protect the elements at risk. To illustrate the concept of protection, put the cup on a saucer to make it more stable, and move the glass to the centre of the table to prevent it from falling off. 2. Use the \u201cShaking Table Demonstration\u201d and the results of the Workshop on Local Disaster Experiences to elaborate on the basic concepts of disaster and disaster risk management. 3. Ask the participants questions like: \u201cIf a typhoon hits an island without any people, is that a disaster?\u201d Differentiate between hazard and disaster. \u201cIf a typhoon hits your community what happens? What are damages? Who are damaged? Why?\u201d What do people do to prepare for the typhoon\u201fs strong winds and the resulting flooding? What do people do to cope and respond to the disaster situation?\u201d 4. There are 3 ingredients which make up a disaster \u2013 hazard, vulnerability and capacity. A disaster occurs when a hazard strikes a vulnerable population or community whose capacity is inadequate to withstand or cope with its adverse effects, resulting in damages, loss and disruption in community/society functioning. 5. On the other hand, a hazard is a phenomena, event, occurrence or human activity that has the potential to cause injuries to life and damages to property and the built and natural environment. Differentiate between natural, human- Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 21 made or combination/socio-natural hazards. 6. Explain further that vulnerability is a set of prevailing and long term factors and conditions or weaknesses which adversely affect the ability of individuals, families and communities to protect itself, cope with or recover from damaging effects of a disaster. Vulnerability explains why people and property located in areas where hazards occur can suffer damage and loss. Give examples of vulnerability using discussions in Sessions 1. Stress that aside from physical exposure, there are other dimensions of vulnerability \u2013 material, social, economic, cultural and environmental factors or weakness or problems. 7. Capacities are the knowledge, skills, resources, abilities, coping strategies and strengths present in individuals, families, organizations/institutions and the community. Give examples of capacity. 8. Go back to the definition of disaster. If the disaster has not yet happened, we talk of disaster risk. Disaster risk is the probability or likelihood of harmful consequences or expected losses resulting from the interaction between the hazard and vulnerable conditions. The disaster has not yet happened and we have the opportunity to reduce the likelihood that a disaster will happen or that damages and losses will be significantly reduced. 9. Follow the discussion on disaster risk with explaining the concept of elements at risk. The elements at risk are who and what can be damaged \u2013 people (lives and health); household and community structures (houses, school, community center); community facilities and services (bridges, roads, hospital, electricity, water supply), livelihood and economic activities (jobs, work place, production equipment), the environment (natural resource base). 10. Show the visual of the family standing by the mountain with the rock about to fall. Ask questions to clarify the concept of hazard, vulnerability and capacity, disaster, disaster risk leading to disaster risk reduction. Sample sequence of questions can be: \u201cWhat is the hazard?; \u201cWhat happens if the rock falls on the family?\u201d If the rock has not yet fallen, is that already a disaster? Why was the man crushed? Can the man avoid being crushed? What are the family\u201fs capacities? How can they use these capacities? 9. Summarize the discussion by showing pictures of the rock restrained from falling, building a protective shelter for the family so they will not be hurt when the rock falls, or running to safety. Use these pictures to define disaster risk management, prevention, mitigation and preparedness. 10. Define risk management as a range of activities that contribute to increasing capacities and reducing immediate and long-term vulnerabilities to prevent or at least minimize damaging impact in a community Explain that before, the term disaster management was commonly used. Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 22 Now, by using the term disaster risk management, we stress that disaster risks can be reduced. We can prevent, mitigate or prepare for disasters by mainly protecting and strengthening the elements at risk. 11. The main objectives of disaster risk management are to prevent and mitigate disaster and prepare effectively for occurrence of all hazards through enhancement of local capacity.

Emphasize that an explicit statement of being gender-sensitive is a key feature of CBDRM and how to integrate the gender perspective in CBDRM is the focus of the training workshop. 15. Discuss briefly that integrating gender into CBDRM involves both process and content. Process refers to ensuring active and sustained participation of women and men in the 6 key steps of the CBDRM process. Content looks into the differing impacts of hazards and disasters on men and women, analyzes the differential vulnerabilities of women and men, and addresses concerns and needs of women and men in the pre-, during, and post-disaster situations. Further explain the concept of gender equality and gender equity. Equality means both women and men enjoy the same rights, are accorded the same respect and status, and have equal conditions and opportunities for realizing their full potentials, to contribute to the development of their communities and countries, and to enjoy the benefits of development. Equity means giving more to those who have less on the basis of needs, and Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 23 Materials Needed 1. \u201cShaking Table Demonstration\u201d - table, china cup and saucer, breakable drinking glass, plastic water bottle 2.

A disaster is an event or occurrence, sudden or slow-onset which causes widespread human, material or environmental losses. HAZARD A disaster occurs when a hazard strikes a vulnerable population or community whose capacity is inadequate to withstand or cope with its adverse effects, resulting in damages, loss and disruption in community/society functioning. A hazard is a phenomena, event, occurrence or human activity that has the potential for causing injuries to life and damaging property and the environment. There are three types of hazards: a. Natural - cyclone, earthquake, volcanic eruption, tsunami b. Human-made - fire, pollution, industrial accidents like leakage of toxic waste, oil spill, armed conflict c. Combination or socio-natural hazards - flooding and drought can fall under this category if it is due to deforestation Vulnerability is a set of prevailing and long term factors, conditions and weaknesses which adversely affects the ability of individuals, households, organizations and the community to protect itself, cope with or recover from the damaging effects of a disaster. Vulnerability is present in the community or society even before the disaster happened. Although greater physical exposure (people, infrastructure or economic activities located in an area where earthquakes, landslide or flooding occur) leads to greater loss of lives, there are other dimensions of vulnerability --- material, social, economic, cultural and environmental factors and conditions or weakness or problems in the community or society which can cause damage or loss from hazards: a. unsafe locations and number of people, property, and community facilities physically exposed DISASTER VULNERABILITY CAPACITY Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 26 b. design and construction of houses and buildings c. lack of settlements planning d. conflict in the community e. lack of knowledge and skills on preparedness and protective measures f. attitude of helplessness and dependence g. social inequity h. poverty Capacities are the knowledge, skills, resources, abilities, coping strategies and strengths present in individuals, households, organizations and the community which enable them to prevent, mitigate, prepare for and cope with damaging effects of hazards or quickly recover from a disaster. Some examples of capacity a. ownership of land and safe location and construction of home b. adequate income c. savings d. adequate food sources e. family and community support in times of crises f. responsive local government g. enabling legislation h. strong community organizations i. local knowledge Disaster risk is the probability of harmful consequences or expected losses (death, injuries, property, livelihoods, economic activity disrupted or environment damaged) resulting from interactions between natural or human-induced hazard and vulnerable conditions. Risk depends on exposure to the consequences of uncertainty or potential deviations from what is planned or expected disruption to everyday life following the formula Risk = probability (p) x loss (l). Disaster Risk can be expressed as a function of hazard x vulnerability or a function (hazard, exposure, vulnerability). How one copes depends on capacity and readiness to respond to an emergency and crisis. The equation Disaster Risk = Hazard x Exposure of Elements at Risk x Vulnerability emphasizes particularly the physical aspects of vulnerability. Risk is the anticipated or potential consequences of a specific hazard interacting with a specific community at a specific time. Risks are a combination of probability (the likelihood of a hazard occurring) and of the consequences or outcomes for the community if exposed to the hazard. Risk results from the interaction of three functions namely hazard, vulnerability and exposure. Beyond expressing a possibility of physical harm, it is crucial to recognize that risks are inherent or can be created or exist within social systems. It is important to consider the social contexts in which risks occur and that people do not necessarily share the same perceptions of risk and their underlying causes.

Disaster Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 28 Disaster Risk Management Activities a. Before the disaster - prevention, mitigation and preparedness Prevention - Measures taken to eliminate the hazard or to avert a disaster from occurring by impeding the hazard or putting a barrier between the community and the hazard so that it does not have harmful effects. This includes dams and embankments that eliminate flood risks, land use regulations that do not permit settlements in high risk zones, seismic engineering designs which ensure the survival and function of a critical building in the event of an earthquake. Mitigation - Measures taken to protect the elements at risk prior to the impact of a disaster to minimize its damaging effects. This includes engineering techniques and hazard-resistant construction, improved environmental policies, and public awareness. Preparedness - Measures taken in anticipation of a disaster to build readiness for response and ensure that appropriate and effective actions are taken during the emergency and recovery. This includes contingency planning, stockpiling of equipment and supplies, development of coordination arrangements, public information, early warning system, training, drills and simulation exercises to develop readiness. b. During the disaster - Emergency responses to save lives, reduce health impacts, ensure public safety, and meet subsistence needs of affected people c. After the disaster - Recovery: rehabilitation and reconstruction; building back better Disaster Resilience is the capacity of a system, community or society to resist or to change in order that it may obtain an acceptable level in functioning and structure. This is determined by the degree to which the social system is capable of organizing itself, and the ability to increase its capacity for learning and adaptation, including the capacity to recover from a disaster.

Gender perspective in CBDRM contributes to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. The goal is building a safe, disaster resilient and developed families, community and society. Essential Features of CBDRM Participatory process and content - Community members (including all vulnerable groups) are involved in the risk assessment, identifying solutions to community problems and risk reduction measures; community directly shares in the benefits of disaster management and development Responsive - CBDRM measures are based on the community\u201fs felt and urgent needs; considers the community\u201fs perception and prioritization of disaster risks and risk reduction measures so the community has ownership of these Integrated - Pre-, during, and post-disaster measures are planned and implemented; community has linkages with other communities and the various levels of the disaster management system (especially for vulnerabilities which the local community can not address by itself) Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 31 Proactive - the stress is on on prevention, mitigation and preparedness Comprehensive - Community risk reduction covers structural (\u201ehard\u201f/physical) and non- structural (\u201esoft\u201f e.g. preventive health, training, public awareness) risk reduction measures; mix of short-, medium-, and long-term measures to address vulnerabilities are planned and implemented. Multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary - Mobilizers of all stakeholders; combines local knowledge and resources with science and technology and support from outsiders; addresses concerns of various stakeholders while upholding the basic interest of the most vulnerable sectors and groups Empowering - Through CBDRM people\u201fs options and capacities are increased; the community has more access to basic social services through concerted action; more control over the natural and physical environment; builds confidence to participate in other development endeavors Developmental - CBDRM contributes to addressing and reducing the complex relation of conditions, factors and processes of vulnerabilities present in society; community development gains are protected; measures to address vulnerabilities are opportunities for development Process of CBDRM : Transforming Vulnerable to Safe and Disaster Resilient Communities The goal of CBDRM is to transform vulnerable or at-risk communities to be safe, disaster resilient and developed communities. Although steps may vary from community contexts and organizational mandates, the process for community based disaster risk reduction can be generalized as follows: 1. Initiating the process and establishing rapport - Establishing rapport with the community and having an initial understanding of the community and its disaster context. Initial orientation with the community on CBDRM. 2. Participatory Community Risk Assessment \u2013 participatory assessment of hazards, vulnerabilities, capacities and people\u201fs perception of risks 3. Participatory Community Disaster Risk Management Planning - identification of short-, medium-, long-term measures to reduce risk and vulnerability and enhance capacity and resilience 4. Formation and Strengthening of Community Based Disaster Risk Management Organization - community organizing and mobilization, capability building in community based disaster preparedness and mitigation; formation of community disaster volunteer teams; formation of disaster management committee/s within existing community organization to spearhead plan implementation.

Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 35 Recovery. The restoration, and improvement where appropriate, of facilities, livelihoods and living conditions of disaster-affected communities, including efforts to reduce disaster risk factors. Resilience. The ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions. Sustainable development. Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Gender and Gender-Sensitive Disaster Risk Management Gender refers to the roles, responsibilities rights, relationships and identities of men and women that are defined or ascribed to them within a given society and context \u2013 and how these roles, responsibilities and rights and identities of men and women affect and influence each other. The roles, etc, are changeable over time, between places and within places. Conceptual framework for disaster reduction, UNISDR Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 36 Gendered disaster vulnerabilities arise from barriers to resilience based on sex or gender or both. These may multiply the effects of poverty or people\u201fs exposure to health hazards or patterns of social vulnerability such as literacy or mobility. Gendered disaster vulnerability may also be a roots cause of increased risk, for example when gender violence constrains women\u201fs freedom of movement and ability of girls and women to access shelters. Men may be at increased risk due to risk taking, norms of masculinity or over-representation in dangerous occupations and roles in disaster contexts. (Enarson, 2009) Gendered disaster capacities reflect the skills, relationships, and knowledge gained through women\u201fs and men\u201fs life experience. Includes the resources and strengths of men and women which can be used to protect themselves from hazards and manage emergency situations and recovery. Women\u201fs capacities are usually not recognized or credited though their leadership at the grassroots level, interpersonal and groups networks and skills, cultural and environmental knowledge are vital survival and recovery resources in hazardous environments. (modified from Enarson, 2009) Gendered community risk assessment extends traditional hazard and risk assessments to reflect a context-specific understanding of gender relations. Research methods and tools are used that build on the ideas, feelings and observations of women and men. (Enarson, 2009) Gender discrimination refers to any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of socially constructed gender roles and norms which prevent a person from enjoying full human rights. (Enarson, 2009) Gender division of labor concerns the allocation of the tasks and responsibilities of men and women at home, at work and in society according to patterns of work that are felt to be acceptable in a particular place and time. Gender equality reflects the value that both men and women are free to develop their personal abilities and make choices without the limitations set by stereotypes, rigid gender roles, or prejudices. Gender equality means that all persons are free to realize their full human rights and potential to continue to contribute to national, political, economic, social and cultural development, and to benefit equally from them, regardless of their gender. It does not mean that women and men have to become the same, but their rights, responsibilities and opportunities will not depend on whether they are born male or female, or how they self-identify. (Enarson, 2009) Gender equity refers to fairness of treatment for women and men, according to their respective needs.

Whether based on differential or equal treatment, the outcome supports the efforts Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 37 and abilities of both women and men equally to reduce harm and increase resilience to hazards and disasters. (Enarson, 2009) Gender-sensitive disaster policy or practice implies the efforts to incorporate gender concerns into all phases of program and project design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. These policies are supported by family-friendly organizations with strong leadership for the the process and outcomes of gender mainstreaming. (Enarson, 2009) Gender mainstreaming is a strategy for making women\u201fs as well as men\u201fs concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated (UN ECOSOC) Gender roles refer to how men and women should act, think and feel according to norms and traditions in a particular place and time. Gender valuation of work refers to the social and economic values attached to different tasks and responsibilities of men and women Gendered access to resources, facilities, services, funds, benefits and decision making refers to the differences between men\u201fs and women\u201fs rights and opportunities to make use of these resources and to take part in decision making, due to norms and values existing in a particular place and time Gender-based analysis is an analytical tool that uses sex and gender as an organizing principle or a way of conceptualizing information. Gendered control over resources and decision-making processes refers to differences between women\u201fs and men\u201fs rights and power to decide on the use of resources, gain benefits, and take part in decision- making processes, due to norms and values existing in society. Gendered life experience refers to the influence of both sex and gender (biology and culture) on people\u201fs activities, relationships and capacities. Sexual difference creates distinct needs, for example for reproductive health care in disasters. Gender difference may place men and women at increased risk due to the nature of their livelihood, family responsibilities and community roles. Gender differences vary for boys and girls as well as adults, and that they cut across all other social categories such as class, caste, age, ability and ethnicity. (Enarson, 2009) Gender sensitivity or using the Gender perspective means that: \uf0b7 A differentiation is made between the needs and priorities of men and women; \uf0b7 The views and ideas of both men and women are taken seriously; \uf0b7 The implications of decisions on the situation of women relative to men are considered: who will gain and who will lose; and \uf0b7 Action is taken to address inequalities or imbalances between men and women Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 38 Practical gender needs relate to people\u201fs basic, material needs for day-to-day survival. Concern is improving the conditions of men and men through more efficient resource use, but do not challenge existing gender roles and divisions of labor. Sex refers to the biological nature of being male or female. The biological characteristics of men and women are universal and obvious. Sex roles are those that are bound to one particular sex due to biological factors, for example, giving birth. Strategic gender needs relate to women\u201fs empowerment and to what is required to challenge the gender balance of power and control to achieve gender equality. Strategic gender needs are addressed by challenging existing gender roles and relations between women and men. Programs set out to change the relative positions of women and men in order to promote empowerment and gender equity. Women\u2019s empowerment refers to the process in which women reflect upon their reality and question the reasons for their situation in society.

Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 40 Learning Objectives At the end of this session the participants are able to: 1. Differentiate between the concept of sex and gender 2. Cite international and national mandates for women\u2018s empowerment, gender equality, and integrating gender in disaster risk management 3. Discuss the importance of integrating gender perspective in CBDRM Key Points 1. Disaster impacts and risk are experienced differently by women and men. 2. The participation of women and therefore benefits from and contributions to disaster risk management remain the exception rather than the norm. 3. The Hyogo Framework for Action 2005 \u2013 2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters is the roadmap for disaster risk reduction. The HFA calls for taking a gender perspective in disaster risk reduction. 4. Meaningful involvement of women and men in and benefits from disaster risk management requires the integration of a gender perspective. Methodology Introductory activity \u2013 \u2015My challenging tasks\u2016 Interactive lecture Module 2 Session 1: WHY THE GENDER PERSPECTIVE IN CBDRM? Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 41 Process 1. \u2015Challenge: The work I do\u2016. Divide the participants into 4 groups. Assign each group a task to act out: a. Laundry work, cooking (\u201clabada, luto\u201d) b. Caring for the baby, cleaning the house (\u201chele, linis\u201d) c. Managing the office, carpentry (\u2015manager, karpentero\u2016) d. Drive taxi, mechanic (\u2015drayber, mekaniko\u2016) Each group then acts out its task and then calls on the another group to respond. The object to is to catch the other group off guard or not coordinated in their response. \u2015Labada, luto, laba luto\u201d to \u201chele, linis, hele linis\u201d. \u2015Hele linis, hele linis\u201d to \u201cmanager, karpentero, manager, karpentero\u201d. \u2015Manager, karpentero, manager, karpentero\u201d to \u201claba, lunto, laba luto\u201d. \u2015Laba luto, laba luto to \u201cdrayber mekaniko, drayber mekaniko\u2016 and so on. 2. Ask who usually does the work which were acted out? Ask for other examples of work usually done or associated with women and men. Also note if these are paid or unpaid work and some emergent changes and reversals in work and roles. 3. Link the introductory activity to the concept of gender. Ask participants \u2015 Is there a difference between sex and gender? What is sex? What is gender? 4. Summarize answers. Differentiate sex and gender.

They are created and maintained by social institutions such as families, government, communities, schools, churches, and media. They are learned in the early stages of childhood. Girls are taught to be feminine, while boys are taught to be masculine. Feminine traits include being modest, submissive and nurturing. Masculine Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 42 traits include being domineering and aggressive. Women, because of the feminine traits attributed to them, are expected to be good homemakers and nurturers of family members.

Society\u2018s tendency to assign roles, attitudes, behaviors, characteristics and expectations to individuals based on biological differences results in gender stereotypes (fixed, unquestioned beliefs or images about women and men, transmitted from generation to generation) and unequal relations between women and men, with men being considered the superior sex mainly because of their stronger physical characteristics. The four spheres of work of women and men are: - Productive sphere: the capacity to produce goods; an economic function which is remunerated or paid - Reproductive sphere: the capacity to provide viable offsprings; usually unpaid - Community management: activities/tasks undertaken for the community at large - Community politics: tasks related to community decision making Women tend to assume the reproductive and community management roles, while men dominate the productive and community politics roles. Men are the decision makers and leaders. Women\u2018s participation in the production sphere is increasing, but they tend to be concentrated in sectors related to their caring and nurturing roles or are in lower levels compared to men. Generally, women and girls have fewer opportunities, lower status and less power and influence than men and boys. 7. Further explain that these gender differences are largely unfavorable to women and lead to gender inequality and cuts across all socioeconomic development, including differences in vulnerabilities to disasters, and different capacities to cope with, respond to disasters and reduce risk. Lack of access to information and resources puts women more at risk. Cite some differences as reported during Module 1 Session 1 Workshop on Local Disaster Experiences. 8. Note that there are increasing number of alternative family structures which may lead to reversal of gender roles like when the care of children are entrusted to the father when the mother takes on work abroad or when both parents work abroad and entrust the care of younger children to the older siblings. Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 43 9. Stress that gender issues are not only women\u2018s issues, but are development issues as well. Discrimination against and women\u2018s subordinate position in society have to be addressed for them to participate, contribute to and benefit from development and disaster risk management. At the international level, the importance of equal rights for women has been taken up by agreements such as the 1976 Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and 1995 Beijing Platform of Action adopted at the Fourth World Conference of Women. Gender mainstreaming strategy for making women\u2018s as well as men\u2018s concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and implementation of policies, programs and projects in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. In the Philippines, there are numerous mandates to promote and fulfill women\u2018s rights and foster women\u2018s empowerment and gender equality, notably Section 14, Article II of the Philippine Constitution, the Women in Development and Nation Building Act (Republic Act 7192), the Philippines Plan for Gender Responsive Development for 1995 to 2025, and the Magna Carta of Women (Republic Act 97101 which has just been passed in August 2009). 10. Discuss the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005 \u2013 2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters, the global blueprint for disaster risk reduction efforts. Its goal is to substantially reduce disaster losses -- in lives and in the social, economic, and environmental assets of communities and countries. The Framework offers guiding principles, priorities for action and practical means for achieving disaster resilience of vulnerable communities. The 5 priority areas for action are: a. Ensure that disaster risk reduction is a national and a local priority with a strong institutional basis for implementation b. Identify, assess and monitor disaster risks and enhance early warning c. Use knowledge, innovation and education to build a culture of safety and resilience at all levels d. Reduce the underlying risk factors e. Strengthen disaster preparedness for effective response at all levels Gender is a cross cutting theme in the Hyogo Framework for Action is gender. \u201cA gender perspective should be integrated into all disaster risk management policies, plans and decision making processes, including those related to risk assessment, early warning, information management, and education and training\u201d. 10.

The Magna Carta of Women includes Sec. 10 Women Affected by Disaster, Calamities and Other Crisis Situations relevant for emergency response and recovery and other sections in Chapter IV Rights and Empowerment and Chapter V on the Rights and Empowerment of Marginalized Sectors are relevant for disaster risk reduction. 11. Highlight that CBDRM is now recognized as a necessary approach to reduce disaster losses at the local and community level. Integrating the gender perspective in CBDRM not only addresses differing vulnerabilities of women and men and strengthens their particular capacities, but can contribute to gender equality and women\u2018s empowerment. 12.

For the introductory activity \u2015Challenge: the Work I do!\u2016, all groups can be made to act out work and roles of women and then these can be linked to the women\u2018s multiple burden. 2. Women make up half of the world\u2018s population. In the Philippines, of the total projected population for 2009 of 92,226,600, 49.7% (45,857,700) are women while 50.3% (46,368,900) are men. 3. The Magna Carta of Women recognizes that women\u2018s rights are human rights. It seeks to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women by recognizing, protecting, fulfilling, and promoting all human rights and fundamental freedoms of Filipino women, particularly those in the marginalized sector. 4. Gender sensitivity training materials and guides for gender mainstreaming in government can be found and downloaded from the website of the National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women, www.ncrfw.gov.ph. The Magna Carta of Women will transform the NCRFW into the Philippine Commission on Women. 5. Sex-disaggregated data are statistical information which differentiate women and men and allow one to see the gaps in their condition and position. A example of this is the Reference \u2015Selected Data on Men and Women in the Philippines\u2016 which can be obtained from the National Statistical Coordination Board, http://www.nscb.gov.ph/gender/index.asp \u201cA gender perspective should be integrated into all disaster risk management policies, plans and decision making processes, including those related to risk assessment, early warning, information management, and education and training.\u201d - Hyogo Framework for Action 2005 \u2013 2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 46 Core Messages for Gender Sensitivity and Analysis in the Philippines 1. Society tends to assign roles, attitudes, behaviors, characteristics and expectations to individuals based on biological differences. Biological determinism upholds the belief that because the reproductive system is by nature the characteristic of the female sex, women\u2018s physical make-up is consequently more delicate. Women are, therefore, viewed as being too weak to take on strenuous activities unlike men who have sturdier physiques and are thus able to take on heavier tasks. This tendency results in unequal relations between women and men, with men being considered as the superior sex mainly because of their stronger physical characteristics. 2. Gender roles are the product of a society\u2018s culture, beliefs, and values. They are taught and reinforced by society\u2018s structures and institutions, such as the family, school, community, church, government, media, and other social organizations. 3.

Women were allowed to study but values of feudal- patriarchal and bourgeois system were inculcated v. Chastity, virginity and the double standard of morality prevailed vi. Prostitution increased as cabarets were established in the haciendas and entertainment clubs proliferated where the Americans had military bases Japanese invasion i. Rampant sexual abuses: comfort women ii. Served as symbol of their authority/control As a result of the colonial past Belief that women are under the authority of the: \uf02d ruling class, powers-that-be, government or religious authority \uf02d family \uf02d husband 5. The learning of gender roles begin in early childhood. Girls are taught to be feminine, while boys are taught to be masculine. Feminine traits include being modest, submissive and nurturing. Masculine traits include being domineering and aggressive. Women, because of the feminine traits attributed to them, are expected to be good homemakers and nurturers of family members. Men, as masculine beings, are expected to be the family provider and to be responsible for its survival. 6. Gender roles have resulted in gender bias, manifested in the following: i. Marginalization, women\u2018s participation in development is limited to traditional roles, programs and projects, especially those related to maternal and child care, day care centers, and nutrition. It results in failure to recognize women\u2018s concerns in other areas, particularly within the economic sectors. Despite their crucial role in production, they are considered as a non-essential force in the economy. Hence, women are unable to develop their potential to the full. Their contributions to development remain unrecognized and undervalued. ii. Subordination, or submission, sometimes due to force or violence, or being under the authority of one sex. Because of this, women have less access to and control over available resources and have no personal autonomy. Women have secondary status in society iii. Multiple burden, or the condition in which women perform many, overlapping and heavy workload, tasks and responsibilities despite their limited time and energy. This multiple burden refers to doing unpaid work in the home, paid work as a member of the workforce, and community management work, and all other work necessary for the survival of the family. iv. Gender stereotyping, or the tendency to assign fixed, unquestioned and unexamined beliefs and perceptions about women and men. Society instills an image of women as weak, dependent, subordinate, indecisive, emotional and submissive. Men of the other hand are strong, independent, Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 48 powerful, dominant, decisive and logical. v. Violence against women whether threatened or actual, perpetuated on women simply because they are women. It includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, incest, pornography, battering, trafficking, and abuse whether psychological, verbal or economic. These acts of violence reinforce male dominance over women. vi. Within the family, it is the father or husband who makes the important decisions. The mother may be asked but if their opinion differ, the father has the last say, invoking that he is the head of the family. Women and children are considered as property or mere extension of the father/husband. Domestic violence is considered a private issue (CWR) vii.

In this gender division of labor, men are the decision makers and leaders. Women\u2018s roles are secondary to men\u2018s roles even if these tend to be multiple roles performed simultaneously. 9. Gender roles determine not only women\u2018s cultural and social status but their economic and political status as well. In all these spheres, women\u2018s status has been secondary to men\u2018s. 10. The manifestation of gender bias show that the power relations between men and women are far from equal or balanced but grossly skewed in favor of men. To put it another way, gender relations are not level but stratified, and women are found at the lower rungs.

Process the exercise. Ask for the identities of those who have moved farthest forward. Who made forward steps? Who made backward steps? How can the participants relate this to gender and power relations? To vulnerabilities and capacities of men and women? Summarize by linking to the feature of CBDRM as an empowering process, especially for marginalized and highly vulnerable groups and sectors. 3. Note that gender and power relations are situated in political, socio- economic, and historical context of society. Disasters aggravate women\u2018s vulnerability. Explain further that gender equality in disaster risk management has been focus on women\u2018s needs and interests because they tend to be neglected in disaster risk management. However, it is not just all about women. Cite examples of men\u2018s particular vulnerabilities in disaster situations which are often not recognized. 4. Enumerate and discuss the key steps in community based disaster risk management. i. Initiating the process and establishing rapport - The community approaches an NGO or local government to assist them initiate CBDRM in their community. Alternatively, the community is prioritized for support by an NGO or the local government. Partnership involves establishing rapport and building trust. While the NGO and/or local government gains an understanding of the community and disaster context, the community Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 58 is oriented on CBDRM. ii. Community Risk Assessment \u2013 participatory assessment of hazards, vulnerabilities, capacities and people\u2018s perception of risks.

Gender-based community risk assessment is the sound basis for planning and implementation of appropriate and adequate gender-sensitive risk management measures. Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 62 GENDER-SENSITIVE CBDRM \u201cNevertheless, .women are not only victims, they are also agents. Further, women and men, working together, can identify those hazards that threaten their homes and livelihoods and work together to build safer communities.\u201d \u2013 Helena Molin Valdes Women, disaster risk reduction and sustainable development, Helena Molin Valdes ,A gender approach in disaster risk reduction is built of the understanding that both women and men are part of the same society which as we know, does not mean we have the same rights, education and options to manage \u2013 nor in \u2015normal\u2016 times, neither when disaster strikes. Examples from recent tsunami-stricken South Asia, Central America, India and the Pacific, show that women can act as agents for change. Several studies do confirm, however, that women are most of the time much worse affected than men when a disaster strikes and less benefited when recovery begins. We therefore need to address the specific concerns of women already when designing disaster reduction policies and measures. The Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters represents a solid commitment and basis benchmark and indicates the way forward to substantially reduce disaster losses through its principles, 3 strategic goals and 5 priority areas for action in reducing risk to disasters. It states as part of the cross-cutting principles, that: - A gender perspective should be integrated into all disaster risk management policies, plans and decision-making processes, including those related to risk assessment, early warning, information management and education and training. - Both communities and local authorities should be empowered to manage and reduce disaster risk by having access to the necessary information, resources and authority to implement actions for disaster risk reduction. Disaster reduction policies and measures need to be implemented with a 2-fold aim: to enable societies to be resilient to natural hazards, while ensuring that development efforts decrease the vulnerability to these hazards. Sustainable development is not possible without taking into account multi-hazard risk assessments in planning daily life, and as such is an issue that impacts on the lives of both men and women. Given that the magnitude of a disaster are partially influenced by the political, economic and socio-cultural contexts, mainstreaming gender into disaster reduction policies and measures translates into identifying the ways in which women and men are positioned in society. This enables the mapping of not only the ways in which the lives of women and men may be negatively impacted, but also the ways in which they can contribute to disaster reduction efforts In other words, cultural patterns that structure the lives of women and men must also be clearly understood. Women\u2018s and men\u2018s differing needs, roles, and social power in different social and Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 63 cultural contexts need to be taken into account. Men are usually seen as primary income generators while women\u2018s economic activities, often the mainstay of the household economy, are less visible. Women carry the primary responsibility for the care of children, the elderly, the disabled and the ill whose mobility and survival in disasters may be limited. Gender-specific dependencies and vulnerabilities based on reproductive differences are relevant in disasters, as is the respective ability of women and men to participate fully in household, community and national decision-making about hazard and risk.

GET THE FACTS. Gender analysis is not optional or divisive but imperative to direct aid and plan for full and equitable recovery. Nothing in disaster work is \u2017gender neutral\u2018. Plan to: - Collect and solicit gender-specific data - Train and employ women in community-based assessment and follow-up research - Tap women\u2018s knowledge of environmental resources and community complexity - Identify and assess sex-specific needs, e.g. for home-based women workers, men\u2018s mental health, displaced and migrating women vs. men - Track the (explicit/implicit) gender budgeting of relief and response funds - Track the distribution of goods, services, opportunities to women and men - Assess the short- and long-term impacts on women/men of all disaster initiatives - Monitor change over time and in different contexts 3. WORK WITH GRASSROOTS WOMEN. Women\u2018s community organizations have insight, information, experience, networks, and resources vital to increasing disaster resilience. Work with and develop the capacities of existing women\u2018s groups such as - Women\u2018s groups experienced in disasters Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 64 - Women and development NGOs; women\u2018s environmental action groups - Advocacy groups with a focus on girls and women, e.g. peace activities - Women\u2018s neighborhood groups - Faith-based and service organizations - Professional women, e.g. educators, scientists, emergency managers 4. RESIST STEREOTYPES. Base all initiatives on knowledge of difference and specific cultural, economic, political and sexual contexts, not on false generalities: - Women survivors are vital first responders and rebuilders, not passive victims - Mothers, grandmothers and other women are vital to children\u2018s survival and recovery but women\u2018s needs may differ from children - Not all women are mothers or live with men - Women-led households are not necessarily the poorest or most vulnerable - Women are not economic dependents but producers, community workers, earners - Marginalized women (e.g. undocumented, HIV/AIDS, low caste, indigenous, sex workers) have unique perspectives and capacities - No \u2017one-size\u2018 fits all; culturally specific needs and desires must be respected, e.g. women\u2018s traditional religious practices, clothing, personal hygiene, privacy norms 5. TAKE A HUMAN RIGHTS APPROACH. Democratic and participatory initiatives serve women and girls best. Women and men alike must be assured of the conditions of life needed to enjoy their fundamental human rights, as well as simply survive. Girls and women in crisis are at increased risk of: - Sexual harassment and rape - Abuse by intimate partners, e.g. in the months and year following a major disaster - Exploitation by traffickers, e.g. into domestic, agricultural and sex work - Erosion or loss of existing land rights - Early/forced marriage - Forced migration - Reduced or lost access to reproductive health care services - Male control over economic recovery resources 6.

It covers 400 villages and 40,000 women members of SEWA in Gujarat to achieve gender equality in recovery. The following good practice in working with the poor, women and government can be derived from the Jeevika Project: 1. Targeting the Poorest of the Poor: The poorest of the poor were prioritized in the Jeevika Projecdt because the effects of disasters on them are disproportionately high and debilitating, and can lead to debt dependency, loss of meager resources, and ultimately migration. Targeting was based on pre-existing poverty and livelihood analysis. Village Development Committees is formed by the villagers themselves and consists of the poor and women members. 2. Risk Management: The risk management approach taken by the Jeevika Project integrates risk reduction in developmental activities. It makes mitigation central, directly in the villages, across local institutions and in livelihoods of women. 3. Capacity Building: In the Jeevika Project, capacity building is an ongoing, dynamic and endless process of realization where both the women and practitioners learned and shared lessons. Training covered a broad range of subjects such as midwife training, agriculture and animal husbandry, women health and child care training, functional literacy, micro-finance, disaster mitigation, etc. 4. Convergence with Government: While SEWA acts as the main facilitating agency for implementation, the overall management responsibility is lodged with the Rural Development Department of the Government of Gujarat. The Jeevika Project is helping the government to improve its performance in providing basic services through strengthening local governance capacities. 5. Micro Planning: Participatory Micro Planning serves as an effective local governance tool for planning, implementing, budgeting and monitoring the Project activities together with the Village Development Committees. 6. Livelihoods Security: Women develop alternative livelihoods and strengthen existing ones through improving skills base. Forward and backward linkages with market and source of raw materials and improvement of quality of products. Building water storage facilities and rainwater-harvesting structures shortened women\u2019s time in getting water. Time could be allocated to more productive work as well leisure, which led to improving women\u2019s health. Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 66 The Eight Point Agenda: Practical, positive outcomes for girls and women in crisis, UNDP Bureau of Crisis Prevention and Recovery 1. Strengthen women\u2019s security in crisis: Stop violence against women \uf0b7 Violence against women is an affront to the foundations of human rights, human decency and human dignity. \uf0b7 Rape and sexual violence are not collateral damage: they are methods of war. Perpetrators of these war crimes must be held accountable\u2014 by their communities, governments and by the international community. \uf0b7 Violence against women also impedes progress in poverty eradication, combating HIV/AIDS, and peace and security. \uf0b7 Men and boys have a critical role to play in reversing the pandemic of violence against women. 2. Advance gender justice: Provide justice and security for women \uf0b7 Laws to protect women\u2018s rights must be included and enforced within legal frameworks. \uf0b7 Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems, e.g. through free legal services. \uf0b7 Custom, tradition or religious beliefs should never serve to excuse or justify violence against women. 3. Expand women\u2019s citizenship, participation and leadership: Advance women as decision- makers \uf0b7 Women need the skills and confidence to influence the decisions that directly affect their lives, including through direct participation in government and the security sector. \uf0b7 Women are often denied access to business transactions and excluded from negotiations surrounding land titles.

A commitment to integrating a gender perspective in the implementation of HFA means ensuring that DRR programs are responsive to the needs and priorities of grassroots women living and working in disaster-prone communities. Huairou Commission members\u2018 experience shows that women\u2018s ability to participate in decision making processes, interface with government institutions and access and control resources are key to shaping effective disaster risk reduction processes. Right to Participation, Financial Resources, Community Participation and Information, Actual and Fair Participation were selected as key indicators that represent critical enabling factors for grassroots women\u2018s participation in the local implementation of the HFA. FINDINGS The focus group discussion and consultations undertaken during the action research, along with HC\u2018s ongoing project and documentation work worldwide, provides ample evidence that the grassroots women leaders from the 23 organizations engaged in the study are actively engaged in disaster risk reduction preparing for emergency response and greater accountability from local and national governments. Participants reported that women are: monitoring and improving access to basic services, negotiating for safe & secure housing, connecting families and communities to government entitlements and poverty reduction programs, and pioneering sustainable livelihoods and natural resource management approaches. Despite this, grassroots women have assessed their performance in DRR as being poor and noted their distance from DRR information, planning, implementation and evaluation activities leading us to conclude the following: 1. Women report they are excluded from emergency preparedness and response programs Although the largest and most well resourced elements of risk reduction are typically emergency preparedness and response, grassroots women responded they have not been included in these programs. 2. Information gaps between national programs and grassroots women organizations exist While governments have reported that they have comprehensive DM programs, women consistently stated that they were not aware of disaster management programs at the national level, nor did they understand what resources or entitlements were available through their government programs.

At present, national and state level risk reduction programs lack mechanisms (and mandates) for linking grassroots women\u2018s local networks and initiatives to their programming. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Establish principles and standards of accountability and engagement with poor communities with women, to enable them to participate as citizens, rather than beneficiaries, in shaping DRR policies and programs. 2.

Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 70 Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 71 Module 3 GENDER- SENSITIVE COMMUNITY RISK ASSESSMENT Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 72 Learning Objectives At the end of this session the participants are able to: 1. Identify hazards which may affect the community 2. Identify particular hazards which threaten men, women, boys and girls 3. Describe gender-sensitive participatory hazard assessment process and tools Key Points 1. Hazard assessment involves the identification of hazard to which the community ( women, men, boys, girls, elderly) are exposed to and the study of the characteristics of these hazards. 2. Hazard assessment should combine local knowledge with scientific/technical hazard and risk assessments and studies covering the community, especially for hazards and disasters which do not occur regularly or which the community have not experienced in their life time. 3. Participatory tools are to stimulate involvement and as a visual aid in focus group discussion and analysis with women and men in the community.

Interactive Lecture Buzz Session: Putting on the gender lens Module 1 Session 1: HAZARD ASSESSMENT Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 73 Process 1. \u201cCyclone, Flood, Earthquake\u201d. Ask the participants to group into 3s. Within each group, show that 2 persons will hold their hands up high to form a roof and house with third person in the middle. The \u201cIt\u201d (person not in the groups of 3s) shouts \u201cCyclone, Flood, Earthquake\u2026Cyclone, Flood, Earthquake\u2026 Cyclone, Flood\u2026When the \u201cIt\u201d stops at \u201cCyclone\u201d and again shouts \u201cCyclone\u201d, the houses will move to form a new house for the person in the middle. When \u201cFlood\u201d is called out by the \u201cIt\u201d, the person in the middle of the house will move out to find another home. For \u201cEarthquake\u201d, the houses and persons in the homes all move and everybody forms new groups of 3s. The \u201cIt\u201d tries to take his/her place as a house or person in the home for each call of \u201cCyclone, Flood, and Earthquake\u201d. The person who is left out of a group/home becomes the \u201cIt\u201d. 2.

The nature, location, intensity and likelihood (probability or frequency) and behavior of the threat are then studied. 5. Ask participants: \u201cHow do we identify hazards or threats?\u201d Summarize answers. Explain that most often; the community people know about hazards and disasters which they have experienced in the past or the experiences which were shared by their elders. Emphasize that Participatory Risk Assessment combines scientific/technical knowledge and local knowledge. The information about hazards which the community has no experience of or of emerging threats are usually brought to the community by outsiders such as experts, the government, academicians, or NGOs. Many hazard maps and studies are now available but the community members have to have access to this information. Show Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 74 a sample of hazard or risk map prepared for the city or municipality covering the community. 6. Buzz session: Instruct participants to put on their gender lens or glasses. Have the participants discuss briefly with the person to his/her right the different hazards and threats which men and women, boys and girls in the community are exposed to. What hazards are common to men and women? What are particular hazards threatening men only? Only women? Have a pair run through their list the hazards to which the others add on to. Facilitate discussion on common and particular hazards men or women are exposed to. Write these on flip chart or tack pictures on the board or wall of these hazards. 7. Discuss and demonstrate the hazard assessment matrix to characterize hazards and participatory tools to use. Involve participants who have experience in use of participatory rural appraisal, participatory learning and action and participatory risk assessment tools in the demonstration.

The study of the characteristics of the hazard is specifically useful in the community designing early warning system and scheduling of preparedness and mitigation activities. 2. For the technical aspects of hazards and what are particular elements at risk in the community, a resource person from the scientific or academic community or from the local government can be invited. 3. For community development, people are familiar with the use of participatory tools for situation analysis. There are many references for data gathering tools. Various tools on community risk assessment and action planning can be obtained from the ProVention Community Risk Assessment Toolkit website www.proventionconsortium.org/projects/tools_CRA.htm 4. To get differing perspectives of women and men, all women and all men groups can be formed to do the hazard assessment. All women and all men focus group discussions can bring out differing perspectives of men and women. Community members in Pikit, North Cotabato, discuss the history of conflict and flooding, impacts, and their activities before, during and after the disaster.

Women are on average more vulnerable to disasters due to their increased vulnerability across all of these conditions. The intersection of these factors with economic, racial, and other inequalities, create hazardous social conditions that place different groups of women differently at risk when disastrous events unfold (Enarson, 1998). Physical aspects Assessing physical vulnerability looks mainly at how location and the built environment can make disaster impact worse. Poor women are usually in the wrong place at the wrong time because they cannot improve the quality of their houses, choose a good location to live, or store food adequately, due to a lack of resources (Cannon, 2002). Poor men are also physically vulnerable to natural hazards but poor women tend to be more vulnerable due to gender-based inequalities, such as fewer opportunities, less access to resources, and more limited mobility than men in the same social class. Social and cultural aspects Assessing social vulnerability looks at the wellbeing of individuals, communities, and society. It includes access to basic human rights, education and literacy levels, good governance, organizational systems, values, customs and ideological beliefs. Gender inequalities in these areas make many women more vulnerable to disasters, compare with men: Women have different social roles - Differences in socially assigned roles of men and women result in different skills, which can increase women\u201fs disaster vulnerability (Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper, 2007). - In many countries women\u201fs traditional role is to look after and protect children and the elderly as well as their family\u201fs domestic property. During seasonal disasters, women\u201fs intensive domestic roles mean they have demonstrated excellent risk management and coping skills. However, limits on women\u201fs social roles can also often mean that they lack skills needed to survive major catastrophes, such as swimming, climbing, understanding and responding to warning signals, or participating in disaster prevention. (Castro Garc\u00eda and Reyes Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 2006; Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper, 2007). - In many regions only boys learn to swim or climb trees, which reduces women\u201fs survival chances in case of flooding or other hydrometeorological events. Most Bengali women have never learned to swim (Genanet, 2004).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5966aa2b-6ced-442e-866f-aecaf557d3fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "5966aa2b-6ced-442e-866f-aecaf557d3fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrating Gender into Community-based Disaster Risk Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "090beb4732afa5f0599398afc3c5c3e350b52eee4720f04673dcadb4854095a7"}, "2": {"node_id": "0fd92c92-8d3b-4774-9b5b-2192f34c85ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "acbcd7504d1cc780b07cbb31b3b7704318772f3d1880cbde7ff732ec92648381"}}, "hash": "b9bb68439e05d8bb16e6f950f209c8d8b9501f637fa4d9dfcc9f9be1245ec56f", "text": "Most Bengali women have never learned to swim (Genanet, 2004).

Women are less well targeted by public information - In many cases, women do not receive hazard warnings because their behaviour patterns or information preferences are not taken into account. It is assumed that they will simply absorb information from men in the community. - In the case of the 1991 Bangladesh Cyclone, warning information was transmitted by men to men in public spaces, meaning women did not receive information directly (Genanet, 2004). - In Peru, early warning messages about the arrival of El Ni\u00f1o were only transmitted to the fishermen, who were warned that fish abundance was going to be severely affected and that this could have serious economic implications. Women were not alerted since they were not directly involved in fishing \u2013 but in fact, they managed the household budgets. Had women known about the onset of El Ni\u00f1o, they would have saved more household funds and budgeted differently to prepare for the event, reducing the eventual economic impact. (Anderson 2002). Women have poorer health - Disasters tend to exacerbate existing gender inequalities in health. For example, women already have poorer nutrition, which increases the burden on women coping with hazards that affect food production, such as drought. (Cannon, 2002). Women are more prone to nutritional deficiencies because they have unique nutritional needs (especially when they are pregnant or breastfeeding), and in some cultures are lower on the household food hierarchy. In some regions, women\u201fs nutrition is particularly precarious. In South and Southeast Asia 45 to 60 percent of women of reproductive age are underweight and 80 percent of pregnant women have iron deficiencies (FAO, 2000). There are also more female than male famine victims due to bias against female babies and children (Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper, 2007). - Women are also more predisposed to infections, and are more exposed to communicable diseases. For example, in the Lushoto region of Tanzania, plague affects women more than men because men sleep in beds and women and children sleep on the ground where there is a greater risk of coming into contact with rodents infested with plague bearing fleas (Boender and Thaxton, 2004). Also, women in many countries are in charge of cooking which exposes them to indoor pollution, which causes a total of 1.2 million deaths a year (World Health Organization (WHO), 2007). This increases women\u201fs vulnerability to disease that spreads in the aftermath of disasters that have damaged health and sanitation services. - Studies have reported worse reproductive health for women after disasters. For example in Israel, an increase in delivery rates was reported during the 48 hours following an earthquake, with a particular increase in premature delivery. Also, social taboos about menstruation and norms about appropriate behavior have contributed to health problems for young women in disaster situations. A study reported that during the 1998 flood in Bangladesh there was an increase in perineal rashes and urinary tract infections in adolescent girls because they were not able to properly wash and dry their menstrual rags (WHO, 2005). Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 80 Economic aspects Women\u201fs access to assets (physical, financial, human, social and natural capital), largely determines how they will respond to a given hazard. The more assets people have, the less vulnerable they are (Moser and Satterthwaite, 2008); while the greater the erosion of people\u201fs assets, the greater their insecurity. Compared with men, women are poorer, have less access to developing entrepreneurial skills, less ability to access financial resources like credit, savings or pensions, less ability to buy and own land, are paid less if paid at all, and their income is less secure. - Over 95 per cent of female-headed households in the Asian region are reported by the Asia Development Bank to be below the poverty line. - An analysis of credit schemes in five African countries found that women received less than 10 per cent of the credit awarded to male smallholders. Inequitable access to markets and credit means less ability to prepare for or recover from hazardous events. - In sub-Saharan African countries women are often acknowledged as owners of crops, but not of land. Their rights to use land can often only be asserted through association with men, as mothers, daughters, sisters or wives.

A typical low-income rural woman, she does not have the resources to move and loses everything, including her livestock. (In the ActionAid, Wedoand UNDP event in Cop 13 in Bali). Environmental aspects Women and men use and understand natural resources differently. This results in gender- differentiated impacts when the abundance, accessibility or state of natural resources changes. These changes might limit women\u201fs access and control over natural resources (i.e. land, water, cattle, and trees) and reduce their abilities to provide for their families. Women are particularly affected by drought and desertification. - In many places, women are traditional gatherers of water, and of natural resources from the wild. - The loss of harvest and livestock due to drought and desertification results in a disproportionate impact on women because in regions where they are the primary agricultural producers. Rural women produce half of the world\u201fs food. In developing countries, they are responsible for 60-80% of food production. - In Southeast Asia, women provide up to 90% of labor for rice cultivation. - In Egypt, women represent 53% of all agricultural labor. - In sub-Saharan Africa, women produce up to 80% of basic foodstuffs both for household consumption and for sale (FAO).

Vulnerability Assessment is a participatory process to identify what \u201celements are at risk\u201d per hazard type, and to analyze causes and root causes why these can be damaged. 2. Capacity Assessment is a participatory study to understand how people cope with and survive in times of crisis and to identify resources which can be used to prepare for, prevent and/or reduce damaging effects of hazards. 3.

Using flooding and earthquake as the hazard examples, facilitate a discussion on the \u201celements at risk\u201d per hazard type. Identify and analyze the factors, causes/root causes why the \u201celements at risk\u201d can be damaged. For flooding and an intensity 7 earthquake, ask the Participants \u201cWhat damages will the communities incur?\u201d Ask further \u201cWho will be damaged?\u201d \u201cWhere will the particular damages be felt?\u201d \u201cWhy will damages be incurred?\u201d 4. Summarize possible damage scenarios to people (their lives, health, livelihood), household and community structures (houses, schools, community center, public buildings), infrastructure (as roads, bridges, electricity, water supply, telecommunications), commerce and industry (products, raw materials, machinery and equipment), and the natural environment. Cite some causes of damages, for example for earthquake. old buildings, congested buildings, densely populated areas, poor electrical wiring, presence of flammable materials, construction on previously low-land will high rise apartments will be heavily damaged. Fire fighting and rescue teams will have difficulty maneuvering in narrow roads. People will have difficulty moving about because of obstruction in the roads or narrow roads. Poor materials and poor construction processes are causes for the building collapse. 5. Explain that usually technical and scientific risk assessment will focus mainly on physical vulnerability, but there are other vulnerability (and capacity) factors to consider -- social/organizational and motivational/ attitudinal vulnerability. Show and run through the Categories and Factors for Vulnerability and Capacity Assessment and give examples from previous sessions. The unsafe conditions are what are visible, but further analysis through a process of asking \u201cWhy?, Why?\u201d will uncover factors, causes and root causes of vulnerability. Show the Disaster Crunch Model as a framework for looking into the dynamic factors and root causes in the progression of vulnerability. 6. Ask \u201cWhat are local capacities which can be used for disaster preparedness and mitigation/prevention?\u201d Emphasize that social/organizational and motivational/attitudinal capacities are important especially when physical/material resources are limited. Local knowledge which was discussed in local signs of a hazard event is part of capacities or use of indigenous materials like the \u201ekanungkong\u201f (bamboo which produces the sound kung, kung, kung when hit with the stick) to relay warning. Other examples of capacity of Filipinos: Strong sense of family and support and community cooperation, the \"damayan\" and \"bayanihan\"spirit especially in times of crisis. Community and people\u201fs organizations share among members food and other resources to survive, family and community Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 84 organizations give care and encouragement to face difficulties. Exposure to many adverse conditions has also inculcated in the Filipinos to have a persevering effort to survive and rebuild. Being \u201cmadiskarte\u201d (resourceful) coupled with the Filipino wit and humor are attributes which have seen the Filipinos through many crises. 7.

Conduct gender-sensitive participatory community risk assessment 2. Identify hazards which affect men and women in the community 3. Identify elements at risk and vulnerabilities of men and women 4. Identify coping strategies and capacities of men and women 5. Rank priority disaster risk and community problems of men and women to address in action planning Key Areas of Inquiry 1. Local Disaster Experiences; Hazards/Threats (women, men); Disaster impacts (women, men) 2. Perceptions and priorities of men and women regarding disasters, hazards vis-\u00e0-vis other community problems and issues 3. Characteristics of Hazards in the Locality 4. Elements at Risk to Hazards: Who and what will be damaged? Where? 5. Risk Conditions, Factors and Causes: why elements are at risk: Unsafe conditions, factors and causes of unsafe conditions; particular vulnerabilities of men and women 6. Coping Strategies: How men and women prepare for and cope with hazards, respond in disaster situations 7. Capacities: knowledge, skills and resources present in the community; resources which men and women have access to and control of; who benefits from the use of these resources? 8. Priorities of men and women (disaster risks, community problems and issues) to address in the immediate term, medium term, long term in disaster risk management planning; What are solutions of women. What are recommendations of men?

Have the groups review secondary data, especially if there are no scientific/technical or government people joining the field work. These include community profile and hazard and risk studies covering the locality.

Key areas of Inquiry: (following mainly the sessions of the training/workshop as guide on how to also do gender-sensitive community risk assessment) Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 95 Methodology 1. Group preparations for gender sensitive community risk assessment 2. Field work or classroom work 3. Collation of data and analysis of information 4. Group presentations 5. Debriefing of participants\u201f field work experience - Local Disaster Experiences; Hazards/Threats (women, men); Disaster impacts (women, men) - Perceptions and priorities of men and women regarding disasters, hazards vis-\u00e0-vis other community problems and issues - Characteristics of Hazards in the Locality - Elements at Risk to Hazards: Who and what will be damaged? Where? - Risk Conditions, Factors and Causes: why elements are at risk: Unsafe conditions, factors and causes of unsafe conditions; particular vulnerabilities of men and women - Coping Strategies: How men and women prepare for and cope with hazards, respond in disaster situations - Capacities: knowledge, skills and resources present in the community; resources which men and women have access to and control of; who benefits from the use of these resources? - Priorities of men and women (disaster risks, community problems and issues) to address in the immediate term, medium term, long term in disaster risk management planning; What are solutions of women. What are recommendations of men? 6. Each group should assign tasks to team members \u2013 who will be the lead and support facilitators and documenter for the discussion on each of the areas of inquiry and tools to use. 7. If digital cameras are available per group, take pictures as Participatory Risk Assessment Teams go around the community to easier share findings/results among groups. 8. Allow at least half a day to go around the community and interact with community members. 9. Each group will then compile their findings in one big map and show the pictures to support their findings. 10. Each group then reports on their findings and analysis to the plenary group. 11. Ask if each of the groups have items for clarification or addition to each of the group reports. Summarize the reports. 12. Debrief the participants about their insights, feelings, learning from the field work. Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 96 Materials Needed 1.

Checklist for Gender-sensitive Risk Assessment 2. Sample Community Risk Assessment Design Tip to Facilitator 1. Plastic sheets can be overlaid on the community base map for the hazard map, vulnerability map and capacity map. Alternatively, tracing paper can be used for better storage since the colors on the plastic sheets can smear. 2. If there is a GAD Focal Person in the community (or barangay/village), it may be good to invite him/her to join the gender-sensitive community risk assessment field work. Linkage between the local government\u201fs GAD plan and gender-sensitive CBDRM can be established. 3.

Use community risk assessment results to identify gender sensitive disaster risk management measures 2. Explain the key steps in identifying appropriate and adequate risk management measures 3. Discuss considerations in making disaster risk reduction gender-sensitive Key Points 1. Participatory Community Risk Assessment is the sound basis for disaster risk management planning. The results of the Hazard Assessment, Vulnerability and Capacity Assessment and understanding of people\u2019s perception and prioritizing of disaster risk are used to identify adequate, appropriate and acceptable disaster risk reduction measures. 2. Prevention covers measures to provide permanent protection from disasters or reduce the intensity/frequency of a hazard event. 3. Mitigation reduces the hazard event and/or limits its destructive and disruptive effects on the elements at risk. 4. Preparedness involves measures taken in anticipation of the disaster event to ensure that appropriate and effective actions are taken during the emergency Module 4 Session 1: GENDER-SENSITIVE DISASTER RISK REDUCTION Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 105 Methodology Group Work -- \u2015Market Market\u2016 Interactive lecture Process 1. \u2015Market Market\u2016. Divide the participants into 3 to 4 groups \u2013 one group each all women and men, and 1 or 2 other mixed grouping. Alternatively the grouping for the gender-based community risk can be retained. Give a basket and a budget of Php 50,000 to each team to select from the market a mix of risk reduction measures or solutions based on the results of the gender-based community risk assessment. Each group then presents the items selected from the market and its criteria for allotting the Php 50,000 on these items. Facilitate a discussion on the mix of risk reduction measures which were selected. Note the hazard is being addressed and which measures selected reduce vulnerabilities of men, of women, or both. Ask: \u2015Are there new risk or vulnerable conditions which are created or increased with the proposed measures?\u2016 Ask further: \u2015 Are there any existing local capacities which are undermined or reduced because of the proposed measures? Are there capacities which remain untapped? Do women gain or lose? Do men gain or lose?\u2016 2. Summarize the Group Work and run through the basic steps in identifying appropriate risk reduction measures. Emphasize that using the results of the risk assessment, a wide array of risk reduction measures to protect or reduce damages to the elements at risk are identified. i. Review the gender-based community risk assessment (HVC assessments) ii. Prioritize elements at risk iii. Identify possible risk management solutions: how to protect and strengthen the elements at risk and how to reduce the impact of the hazard iv. Check which vulnerabilities are addressed and which capacities are used v. Compare measures with resources, skills, organizational mandate, etc. vi. Rank measures and reach consensus: prioritize which measures are to be undertaken immediately, in the short-, medium-, and longer- term Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 106 Cluster the measures into prevention, mitigation and preparedness. Add that it may sometimes be difficult to strictly categorize if this is preparedness or mitigation or prevention. It may be useful to show again the pictures of the family and the rock and cite examples or show pictures of structural and non-structural mitigation and preparedness activities. Stress that the important point is it that the interventions reduce disaster risk. Simply put, the measures eliminates the hazard or reduces vulnerable conditions and increases capacity and protects and strengthens the elements at risk to withstand, resist or reduce damage or loss from the hazard event. Structural and non-structural prevention and mitigation measures include: - engineering works (bridges, protective dikes, embankments); - safe building design and construction; - retrofitting; - coastal wind breaks or shelter belts (planting of coconut trees along the beach), mangroves reforestation; - safety measures at home, in the community and work places; - strengthening livelihood and food security - strengthening community health; - nutrition improvement and food security; - literacy program; - relocation to safer location; - risk communication and public awareness; - risk assessment - risk reduction planning; - land use planning and zoning; - legislation; - strengthening institution and organizations; - environmental management; advocacy on disaster and development issues; - insurance and micro-insurance Preparedness measures - setting up systems for early warning; - evacuation drill; - training on evacuation center management; - training on emergency operations center management; - strengthening coordination and institutional", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4decc883-6393-4d14-8b6a-503c5e48b2fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "4decc883-6393-4d14-8b6a-503c5e48b2fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrating Gender into Community-based Disaster Risk Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1f76dc93bbe08287914cbff89b1cb99b4ee626b9fcca76e9838ea1feaad106c"}, "3": {"node_id": "fbe67e31-3864-41f8-b984-0eaf8244bbe5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22f25534e2c9458ec62ba816aa779aeafa45d1d716e015b28a89713f5375ad30"}}, "hash": "2559ead985cb5e929694a2ebf096f72ba23b328317e45e687f00cfd4c375e875", "text": "arrangements; - stockpile of supplies and logistics - contingency planning Emergency Responses and Recovery measures include: - search and rescue; - first aid; - evacuation; - evacuation center management; - damage needs capacity assessment; - immediate repair of community facilities and services; Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 107 - relief delivery - clearing the debris - psycho-social counseling & stress debriefing; - medical services - recovery after the disaster such as rehabilitation and reconstruction activities (building back better; within the framework of mitigation) Note that the next session will focus on emergency response and recovery. 3. Stress that while structural measures can be implemented in partnership with other stakeholders like the government e.g. embankment, raising homes, roads, schools, evacuation centers and provide access and mobility during flooding like the construction of a small bridge. Note with the participants that aside from the relatively big funds for construction, structural measures need technical feasibility and should follow a permit process from local authorities. 4. Communities can very well undertake non-structural measures. Explain about early warning and evacuation as part of preparedness measures especially for typhoon and flooding when there is time to give warning so that people are kept safely from the flood waters and harm\u2019s way. Stress the importance of involving women in the design of early warning system and ensuring that early warning reaches them since they are mainly responsible for preparedness and care the children, elderly and sick during emergencies. Part of preparedness for an emergency is also having trained people to undertake Search and Rescue Teams, or putting out fires, and trained people in First Aid. Stress that while these are usually traditional roles of men in disaster risk management, but women can also be trained and supported to undertake these roles. 5. Discuss Public Awareness or as it is now referred to as Risk Communication. Note that Risk Communication is now associated with a systematic and ongoing dialogue among various stakeholders, should consider gender issues which affect processing and disseminating understandable warning messages and risk information. 6. Since poverty limits the capacity to cope with hazard events, strengthening livelihood and food security are important non-structural mitigation measures. Health is an important resource to earn livelihood and making the community robust and healthy is part of risk reduction. Environmental management activities should be linked as well to disaster risk reduction, livelihood and food security and health. Emphasize looking at interfaces for poverty reduction, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation within sustainable community development. 7.

Gender-sensitive CBDRM activities may be advocated to be covered by Gender and Development (GAD) plans and budgets of government agencies and local government units. For government agencies, this is 5% of yearly budget. Local government units can use 5% of development fund for GAD programs. 2. The Disaster Crunch Model has a counterpart Disaster Release Model which can be a guide to organize measures to undertake immediately and in the short-, medium, and long-term period. The progression of vulnerabilities \u2013 unsafe conditions, dynamic pressures and root causes -- are addressed to have safe conditions and resilient communities. 3. Disaster risk reduction activities in the areas of livelihood and food security, health and nutrition, access and control over resources, participation, promoting and fulfilling rights are also development-related interventions. For climate risk, disaster risk reduction overlaps with climate change adaptation.

The main manifestation of climate change is in altered rain pattern and recurrent heavy rains. There are also erratic monsoons that disrupt planting seasons and negatively impact crop yields. These factors pose tremendous problems for the livelihoods and economic security of the women in the affected area. This is compounding an already existing and deepening agrarian crisis linked to under-investment in rural development, trade liberalization in agriculture, and land conversion policies that have eroded rural livelihoods and incomes, causing many women to take up jobs as domestic helpers in cities or migrate overseas, often illegally, in search of economic opportunities. Amihan notes that the climate change crisis disproportionately affects women farmers vis-\u00e0-vis men farmers in at least three ways. First, since women manage, control and own fewer resources \u2013 especially land \u2013 than men, they have fewer assets to sell to cope when harvests collapse either because of floods or droughts. Second, more women than men fall into chronic indebtedness related to climate induced crop failures because micro-credit is largely targeted at women and because, as managers of production and household expenses, they are under stronger pressure to bridge resource gaps. One study found that some 94% of women involved in rice production borrowed money from informal moneylenders, small convenience stores, cooperatives and relatives to finance rice cultivation and augment household expenditures. Third, when food shortages arise from poor harvests linked to weather problems, women prioritize the food needs of male household members and children over their own. Drawing from a rich body of local and traditional knowledge, people in the countryside have begun to adjust to extreme weather variations using a variety of adaptation and coping strategies. Agricultural adaptation strategies include practicing crop diversification, planting crop varieties that are resistant to droughts, floods and pests; cultivating at higher levels; practicing contour farming; planting bamboo to prevent soil erosion; and constructing temporary drainage canals. Financial coping strategies include engaging in off-farm work; looking for other sources of income at home and abroad; taking out loans from money- lenders, relatives and friends; selling off livestock; seeking government financial assistance; renting out, selling or pawning farm plots; and reducing food consumption. With limited resources and support, women farmers are organizing and strategizing in order to secure their livelihoods and access to basic needs. In particular, Amihan members in the provinces of Rizal, Pampanga, Quezon and South Cotabato are increasingly engaged in organic farming initiatives, integrated pest management programmes, agro-forestry, and tree-planting projects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "accde7a2-c114-4718-8690-3a3888c26a2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "accde7a2-c114-4718-8690-3a3888c26a2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrating Gender into Community-based Disaster Risk Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b46b00adf70ce098ff857404231023139a151883faf254445f7e34209fd3c315"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ac789fe-a0e7-47e9-9dbd-ed3a90d73848", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea00f91c9287edc394b11b0a4b7865ceecab3ce73c304dccd400e9c08363652c"}}, "hash": "2912036603229379cd08c2fa64d1f6be5de431bf217e63e7ee12738ecdb79d7d", "text": "Women farmer members in Montalban and Rizal are beginning to cultivate a traditional, indigenous variety of rice that does not require massive doses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and is more resistant to pests than commercial varieties. 1 Excerpt from case study: The Women of Amihan and the impact of climate change financing, Training Manual on Gender and Climate Change, GGCA, 2008.

While this alternative practice of farming rice yields only one harvest a year, it is respectful of the environment and generates significantly lower GHG emissions than commercial farming. At the same time, it adapts rice farming to the prolonged wet seasons brought about by climate change. From the point of view of the rural poor and women, the protection of their livelihoods and sources of sustenance are paramount, entailing adaptation measures that build climate resilience into agriculture and fisheries, ensure people\u2019s access to potable water and other necessities, and provide social insurance and protection, among others. Amihan also calls for government support and funds directed towards rural communities \u2013 and especially rural women \u2013 for the provision of subsidized organic seeds, fertilizers and pesticides; access to affordable agricultural technologies; dissemination of agro-forestry techniques; and provision of low-interest farm credit and crop-insurance schemes specifically targeted at small farmers. In addition, it is currently lobbying Congress to repeal the 2006 Bio-fuels Act. Amihan notes that plantations of jatropha, a major bio-fuel crop, require high chemical inputs that would cause the soil to dry out. Amihan is also pushing for the passage of an agrarian reform bill aimed at promoting land reform, by establishing certainty of land tenure and encouraging farmers to invest in climate proofing (as well as addressing basic issues of justice and equity). In addition, Amihan is beginning to conduct advocacy around climate change at the global level.

Located at the junction of the Marikina and Nangka Rivers, flooding and erosion are major hazards that confront the community. Most of the residents of North and South Libis, the most frequently flooded areas in the community, are informal dwellers. Mobilizing Capacities of Women and Men in Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation The organization as been involved in disaster preparedness and mitigation activities since 1995. It has about 130 members, 80% of whom are women. After a one-day Disaster Management Orientation in June 1997, Buklod Tao immediately formed a Disaster Response Committee (DRC) composed on 33 members and formulated a Counter Disaster Plan to protect the community from damages due to regular flooding. Three disaster management teams were organized and emergency rescue and evacuation plans were detailed, including fabrication of 3 fiberglass boats using local expertise and labor. From the Barangay Council, Buklod Tao was able to secure one life jacket. From other sources, the organization secured funds (Php 30,000 or around US$600) to purchase flashlights, ropes, megaphones, first aid kits, and materials to build three rescue boats. Two months after, a typhoon hit the community. Although several houses were swept away by the flood waters, no one was killed and many people were able to save their belongings. Since then, when typhoons or flooding hit the area everybody can be brought to safety because of flood-level monitoring, early warning, evacuation, rescue operations, setting-up of an emergency operations center, and relief assistance of the DRC and Buklod Tao. Buklod Tao has harnessed women and men\u2019s local knowledge (internal to the community but not necessarily traditional) and capacities in disaster preparedness and mitigation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97014b9d-9484-4a4e-bcac-f633594c5e8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "97014b9d-9484-4a4e-bcac-f633594c5e8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrating Gender into Community-based Disaster Risk Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "640b6589bca54639bb2b272de5f5f3ff094dc8cf0e25d08da058fa9fa46f10b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd9029b5-8391-4f33-82f6-2f3cee6b487a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c766ff20c503c5a09ae58b4af1f2c2e426db6440b366ed438b3f0d42e51edf01"}}, "hash": "15a895b1b0a3b415f501be9c1614d329c8d31eb79d7f7741f908ee612a63a5f7", "text": "Notable application of these local knowledge and resources include: - Three additional fiberglass rescue boats have been fabricated while the original 3 are maintained in good working condition - Sandbagging of the riverbank to control erosion during rainy season; - Aside from watching the dark clouds in the upper Montalban mountains (which indicate that it is raining upstream), the community also monitors hourly rainfall intensity information through regular telephone calls to the Effective /Flood Control Operation System (EFCOS) of Metro Manila Development Authority, which has telemetric rain gauge stations in Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 114 strategic places along the rives; (unfortunately this has recently been stopped by EFCOs due to high cost of maintenance) - The community together with the Metro Manila Development Authority has put flood markers or gauges on the bridge which Buklod Tao monitors to give warning if evacuation is needed; - Cries of pigs in pens by the riverbank alert sleeping families during the night of rising flood waters.

Because of the organization\u2019s work in disaster preparedness and mitigation, many organizations partner with the community in various risk reduction and community development activities. Involvement in a participatory action research on participatory risk assessment and planning with the community children lead to another engagement to involve local youth . Buklod ng Kabataan was subsequently formed, trained in theater arts and performs in the community and other venues to raise awareness on the importance of disaster risk reduction and environmental management. Activities in the production of life vests and reusable products such as bags, sun visors from recycled materials links disaster preparedness, livelihood strengthening and environmental management.

SL1 during that rainy night was heard in all the mobile radios asking for the water level monitoring at the gauge measurements painted against the pillar of the nearby Batasan-San Mateo Bridge (San Mateo town, village of Banaba, province of Rizal). Another mother, Belen de Guzman, whose code name is NL2 is in charge for the monitoring of the water level of Marikina River. Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 115 The following morning of 17th July, the flood waters of the adjoining two waterways in our community - Nangka and Marikina rivers- were steadily rising. Many families were trapped in the second level of their homes- all located at the danger area very proximate to the embankments of the two rivers. Mid-morning of 17th July, Pina Verbo who bravely maneuvered the rescue boat with her rescue rope to ferry children, mothers and older persons to safer haven of our community\u2019s evacuation center. The President of Buklod Tao, Ka Ampie Doblado leads the women and men members of Buklod Tao and the community in disaster preparedness and mitigation. She shares her sewing skills for the organization\u2019s livelihood activities linked to disaster preparedness and environmental management. In 2007, Buklod Tao revived the involvement of mothers in producing useful products from recycled materials (aluminum juice packs, plastic packs for vinegar, soy sauce etc.) which they started in 2005 as part of their environmental care campaign. Initiated mainly by mothers who are active members of the organization. Women make bags, sun visors, wallets, folders and similar items. Male members, children, neighbors, and partner organizations also contribute to the initiative in their own capacity to collect recyclables. The organization can now accept bulk orders from various organizations. The income earned from making their products helps the poor families involved pay for school fees and electricity bills, as well as to meet other basic needs such as food and clothing. A small part of the income goes to the initiative\u2019s operational funds. Buklod Tao received no aid agency funding for this initiative. The goals of the livelihood-related activity linked to environmental care can be summarized as follows: - To foster awareness, among the community members, of the significance of ensuring a healthy and sound environment to achieve a safe and liveable habitat. - To enhance the community\u2019s inherent capacities to reduce their vulnerabilities - To seize opportunities that allow families to protect themselves and the environment from life-threatening conditions and, at the same time, contribute to meeting family subsistence needs through income-generating activities. - To advance", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "068b1fa1-f3ec-4415-bc19-f979326fb6cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "068b1fa1-f3ec-4415-bc19-f979326fb6cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrating Gender into Community-based Disaster Risk Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e4487bda44ba76ffd774b9ff7ba9e65a50edb218f2ebecefc30eb925782bd6a"}, "3": {"node_id": "ec5ae172-8782-4d24-a4fa-0d263317395c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ec8ef94df2cd42f1278dc511a7c46349ee94ec127fa619b1a8192ab539b12d2"}}, "hash": "389f82d8c28fb354e1deac906f68e1af080f1c583a53f63dbdd3903baee9e27b", "text": "environment-friendly initiatives to protect the future of coming generations. As a result, a gradual improvement in environmental care and community safety has been observed.

Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 116 Women and Men of Barangay Mangin Together in Disaster Preparedness Dagupan is a city in Pangasinan Province is only one meter above sea level and has seven river systems running through it. Unsurprisingly, the city is under constant threat of flood. Flooding occurs so often, in fact that it was treated as commonplace. It was not a threat to prepare for, rather, it was an event to live with. This was the same sentiment from Barangay Mangin, one of the communities hardest hit by floods. It had a Barangay Disaster Coordinating Council (BDCC), but it was more of a reactive body that came to life only during disasters with no preparedness and mitigation efforts. Appreciation and actions favoring disaster risk management started in 2006 with The Program for Hydrometeorological Disaster Mitigation in Secondary Cities in Asia (PROMISE). PROMISE is a partnership project of the City Government of Dagupan, Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (CDP) with the support of OFDA-USAID \u2013 brought community based disaster risk management (CBDRM) to Barangay Mangin and 7 other pilot barangays in the city. The project\u2019s goals were to: 1. Adopt specific hydro-meteorological disaster preparedness and mitigation measures to manage hydro-meteorological disaster risk by stakeholders in Dagupan City; 2. Increase stakeholder involvement and further enhance strategies, tools, and methodologies related to community preparedness and mitigation; 3. Strengthen networks and links among relevant risk management institutions / organizations for improving potential and capacity for application and dissemination of lessons learned Following participatory risk assessment and risk reduction action planning in Mangin now stands as a community with defined emergency preparedness and sustainable mechanisms in CBDRM taken on by women and men together. During the Participatory Community Risk Assessment, community members recalled disaster experiences with the use of the time line, drew hazard maps, discussed local government and community people\u2019s disaster management actions before, during, and after flooding, drew venn diagrams of organizations within and outside the community who can support them in CBDRM, analyzed livelihood and community problems, and proposed solutions. Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 117 Study and meetings of the community members with the city officials and specialists resulted in the setting up a flood preparedness early warning and evacuation system. A key component of the early warning system in Barangay Mangin are the flood gauges in strategic locations in the community to be monitored and the use of the kanungkong -- a bamboo instrument which was traditionally used to call community members to assemble at the village hall for meetings, alert people or call children home \u2013 to relay warning to community members. Meanwhile, the barangay is hooked up to the City Emergency Operations center by radio. Barangay Mangin chose to implement rice retailing cooperative endeavor as a small-scale mitigation project. A seed fund of about US$300 from PROMISE was matched by a counterpart fund from the community\u2019s Senior Citizen Club. The rice retailing provides cheaper option for consumers and the profit is earmarked as a fund for maintenance of disaster preparedness equipment. Profits are also earmarked for the repair of emergency equipment. The women of Mangin rose to the challenge to ensure safety of their families and community. Working with men to carry out their barangay disaster preparedness and mitigation plan, the Barangay Disaster Coordination Council was reorganized, 6 women took leadership of different committees namely Supply, Communication, Evacuation, Relief and Damage Control.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec5ae172-8782-4d24-a4fa-0d263317395c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec5ae172-8782-4d24-a4fa-0d263317395c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrating Gender into Community-based Disaster Risk Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e4487bda44ba76ffd774b9ff7ba9e65a50edb218f2ebecefc30eb925782bd6a"}, "2": {"node_id": "068b1fa1-f3ec-4415-bc19-f979326fb6cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "389f82d8c28fb354e1deac906f68e1af080f1c583a53f63dbdd3903baee9e27b"}}, "hash": "4ec8ef94df2cd42f1278dc511a7c46349ee94ec127fa619b1a8192ab539b12d2", "text": "The women together with the men lead the community in the implementation of its Barangay Preparedness and Mitigation Plan..

Group participants into 4-5 groups. Give each group a set of pictures of emergency and disaster situations to study. These can cover flight from home and community to safety, rescuing children, inside the crowded evacuation center, lining up for relief assistance, clearing the debris. For each picture, the group is to tell her/his/their story in the first person as \u2015My/Our Story\u2016. Facilitate a discussion of various needs and responses in an emergency or disaster situation. 2. Define emergency responses -- measures taken immediately prior to, during and following disaster impact. These are directed The aim of emergency response is to save lives, control the threat to the survival of affected population, protect property, and arrest further deterioration of the situation. Note that individuals, households, the community and the local government are the first responders in any emergency, crisis or disaster situation in the community. 3. Discuss that presently, emergency measures are usually targeted at communities without conscious gender considerations. Emergency measures which families and the community undertake and participate in include: \uf0b7 Evacuation to pre-identified evacuation center with family supplies; assist families with children, elderly, sick \uf0b7 Evacuation Center Management: manage sanitation, food, health, security, information, resource generation and networking \uf0b7 Search and Rescue \uf0b7 Helping one another with food and non-food items; encouraging and consoling \uf0b7 Temporary shelter (indigenous materials, salvageable materials, plastic sheet) \uf0b7 Emergency repair of critical facilities (bridge, water, electricity, etc.) \uf0b7 Emergency Health Services \uf0fc First Aid \uf0fc Sanitation \uf0fc Water supply \uf0fc Personal hygiene \uf0fc Control of communicable diseases \uf0fc Managing mass casualties \uf0fc Managing nutritional deficiencies \uf0b7 Psychosocial interventions \uf0b7 Tracing/family reunification for cases of displacements \uf0b7 Advocacy/issue projection especially for human-made disasters 2.

Rehabilitation covers actions taken in the aftermath of a disaster to enable basic services to resume functioning, to assist affected people self-help efforts to repair physical damage and community facilities, to revive economic activities and provide support for the psychological and social well-being of the survivors. While it focuses on enabling the affected population to resume pre-disaster patterns of life, it should strive to \u2015build back better\u2016 by reducing vulnerability and improving living standards. Building back better is not only about infrastructures, but also covers community and family relations. 6. Application of gender analysis tools in designing recovery programs. These are also the gender-based community risk assessment applied to the post-disaster situation. \uf0fc Involve women on planning \u2015how to build better\u2016 \uf0fc Strengthening livelihood and community health \uf0fc Ensuring that socio-economic projects do not add to women\u2019s multiple burden \uf0fc Framework: increasing capacities and reducing vulnerabilities \uf0fc Building back better is not only about infrastructure but also covers community and family relations \uf0fc Ensuring transparency and accountability \uf0fc Gender-sensitive considerations for disaster risk reduction also applies in recovery - Addressing vulnerabilities and practical and strategic needs of women and men: safety at home, community, workplace; Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 122 livelihood security; food security; health and nutrition - Valuing women\u2019s work and contributions; recognizing and mobilizing women\u2019s strengths in coping with and mitigating disasters and supporting their families; providing access to and control of resources needed for risk reduction - Gender analysis of disaster risk management solutions: who benefits?

Recognize that women and men in the community have capacities which should be mobilized and supported in their self-help emergency measures to speed up recovery. 2. The Magna Carta of Women (Republic Act 97101) includes Sec. 10. Women Affected by Disaster, Calamities and Other Crisis Situations for emergency and recovery which can be used to provide for women\u2019s special needs in emergency situation and rehabilitation. Sec. 10. Women Affected by Disasters, Calamities, and Other Crisis Situations. \u2013 Women have the right to protection and security in times of disasters, calamities, and other crisis situations especially in all phases of relief, recovery, rehabilitation, and construction efforts. The State shall Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 124 provide for immediate humanitarian assistance, allocation of resources, and early resettlement, if necessary/ It shall also address the particular needs of women from a gender perspective to ensure their full protection from sexual exploitation and other sexual and gender-based violence committed against them. Responses such as psychosocial support, livelihood support, education, psychological health, and comprehensive health services, including protection during pregnancy. 3. Micro-credit is usually open to women in emergency and recovery since women have good track record in repayment of loans, but this could also lead women to more indebtedness \u2013 borrowing from another institution to pay off existing debts. Micro-credit institutions have to look into incorporation of mutual benefit assistance in times of emergency and longer term support to community organizing and development. Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 125 UNDERSTANDING GENDER NEEDS IN DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT IN THE PHILIPPINES Women and men are differently affected by disasters. 1. Women are prone to vulnerability from poor nutrition and vitamin and iron deficiency 2. Stress and disruption during natural disasters lead to increased incidence of sexual violence and domestic abuse 3. Breakdown of community norms and protection may lead to a rise in sexual exploitation. 4. Relief efforts respond to overall population and are based on patriarchal societal structure. 5. Targeted support to women is a good strategy to ensure health and well-being of the whole family/community. The following are general recommendations to understand each gender\u2019s needs in disaster risk management and disaster risk reduction in the Philippines: (i) Capacity: Strengthen the capacity of local women to contribute to the community\u2019s natural risk reduction efforts. (ii) Data: a) Describe women\u2019s vulnerabilities during natural disasters to understand better how to address them. b) Document best practices for women\u2019s involvement in disaster risk reduction in the Philippines. The following specific recommendations apply to the cluster approach: Food and Nutrition (i) Policy development: (a) Grant women control over food aid to ensure efficient distribution and reduce corruption and sexual exploitation. (b) Design food programs to provide for the unique needs of women and girls, for example, iron supplements and vitamin A. Water and Sanitation (i) Services: (a) Bring sources of water as close to people as possible. Women and girls are usually responsible for collecting water, a task that can become time consuming, physically exhausting, and dangerous if the source is far away. (b) Provide latrines and washing facilities close to the living area to lower the risk for attack of women and girls. (c) Provide women with sanitary menstruation products for their dignity, comfort, and mobility. Without them, women may be inhibited from carrying out daily tasks. Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 126 Health (i) Services: (a) Provide urgent, safe motherhood interventions, which can mean the difference between life and death for pregnant women and their newborn babies, as well as for other children and relatives under their care. (b) Ensure that women have access to family planning services, maternal health care, and post-partum care during disasters.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "449d552c-a7dd-46e1-9d8d-734d32cc61b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "449d552c-a7dd-46e1-9d8d-734d32cc61b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrating Gender into Community-based Disaster Risk Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c89ca9b95c2f683ee6657bbde24430dd4e5183c2ec1b0b3dd2a25c70f54ac58d"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a489607-b2af-4124-8667-cce3792cc6ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b45f1e29e79dcfcee31a0b8b8dbbad1420c45a5cb415dfa17742ee3fd5b40898"}}, "hash": "a66c6b8458bc6e15d8c0ab7f52da6a0f8a11c856ff8975a53b3641391dfa2cf7", "text": "Camp Management/Logistics (i) Policy implementation: (a) Assess the needs of women and men with respect to the location of camps and access to sustenance farming land and use of local resources, including local markets, water, and forest products.

Women should be invited to be part of committees and join committee meetings. It is important that the field humanitarian team has knowledge and skills in gender mainstreaming and use of gender analysis tools to inform approaches to project activities to facilitate the participation of women in beneficiary targeting process, designing project approaches, and in decision making in the use of relief resources at the household level. This case study focuses on ways of mainstreaming gender in emergency cash programmes implemented in typhoon and landslide affected communities in Albay Province. It discusses ways how the strategy had met women\u2019s needs (practical needs and advanced the promotion of women\u2019s strategic needs) during emergencies, the degree to which they were involved in decision-making in the planning and implementation, and the feedback gathered on the roles women had played from beneficiary men, local leaders and other stakeholders. Context of the response Typhoon Durian (local name Reming) was the 3rd in a series of super typhoons to hit the Philippines in the last quarter of 2006. Philippine National Red Cross assessment report noted that there were 1,992,387 people affected, 194 persons killed, 217,546 totally damaged houses and 124,354 houses partially damaged in 7 provinces. Overall, 2.7 million people were affected by the 3 supper typhoons. Oxfam GB in the Philippines focused its response in Albay province, where, 65% of the population was affected. The focus for the emergency response was to meet the immediate needs of affected families and help them in livelihoods recovery targeting about 5000 affected households. The main aim of the response was to provide women, men and children affected by Typhoon Durian with: \uf0b7 Access to basic water and sanitation facilities. \uf0b7 Knowledge and support on how they can protect themselves against public health threats. \uf0b7 Cash grants to meet immediate emergency needs of affected families \uf0b7 Livelihoods recovery programming between March and June 2006 The project The rapid needs assessments showed that households were not accessing their normal sources of income while markets were found to be functional and that food prices had not changed dramatically. Two rounds of cash grants distribution was done during the emergency phase. The first round was a one-off blanket distribution with each family receiving 1,000 Pesos (~20 USD)benefiting some 3,951 families in 18 evacuation centers in the three municipalities of Daraga, Camalig and Guinobatan province of Albay The second round was a targeted distribution for 411 families that were considered to be hardly hit by the typhoon or who were referred to as \u2015hardship\u2016 cases staying inside and outside the evacuation centers in Camalig and Daraga.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5fb993b6-2fad-454b-8ac1-c670161c8869": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fb993b6-2fad-454b-8ac1-c670161c8869", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrating Gender into Community-based Disaster Risk Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e42c5e61ec53e2534b259ec05d3a488e4e85ec67c8434fc978f98345e2e26303"}, "2": {"node_id": "5aaf2209-3a01-45cd-9fd8-ea2159ea6190", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1127359ad42e5809abd03e2f245f006fdaf4e7beedcf89b4be2f010c91e03583"}}, "hash": "ca1de29bfd18232c5dd56faf527fc3fb4850fa8fdf45a5b4e78afd39fa5f01ae", "text": "These included families that had lost family members, female and elderly headed Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 128 households.

In terms of uses of cash grants: start up capital (28%), reserved for use upon relocation (19%), food (15%) and medicines (10%). Incorporating gender perspective in Project implementation and monitoring Recognizing that a disaster has differential effects on men and women, boys and girls across ages. This can only be determined when data is gender disaggregated. The team had difficulty gathering gender disaggregated data during rapid assessment because population in evacuation centers were registered only as households upon arrival. So what appears in the camp chief and Department of Social Welfare and Development\u2019s list was only the names of family heads which were usually males and the number of dependents. Another factor is the movement of populations outside of the evacuation centers where no formal registration is being done by government agencies as they are oftentimes scattered is small clusters. Secondary data from government prior to the disaster were then used like men- women ratio, distribution by ages and gender, etc. The team also believes that gathering and validating population figures is an on-going process in any response delivery. Working through the evacuation center committees, the public health team and Community Health Workers worked on details of the data to reflect the most vulnerable groups such as the number of under 5s boys and girls, number of pregnant women, number of lactating mothers, orphans & unaccompanied minors, women of reproductive age, elderly, men and women with disabilities, widows/ers, and other vulnerable sectors like those with chronic illness, those with injuries, etc. This consolidated data was used as planning parameters by the whole team. Follow through discussions proceeded with specific groups to determine vulnerabilities of each and their corresponding immediate needs. Demands for public health response to improve water and sanitation facilities, improve hygiene practices for disease prevention, and environmental clean- up was overwhelming in evacuation centers. This was responded to by the public health teams. Referral to the department of health systems were done for IDPs with specific ailments and reproductive health needs. Other basic needs of women including sanitary pads and underpants were distributed as part of the hygiene kits for families. Targeting the most vulnerable: Defining vulnerabilities among households While the first distribution provided a blanket coverage to all those staying at the evacuation centers, the second round was done thru selective targeting of the most vulnerable households staying inside and outside of the evacuation centers. Multi-approaches to community mobilization and various forms of community sensitization were employed during the selection of the beneficiaries. The team conducted a series consultation with representatives of government agencies, municipal and barangay leaders to set the parameters for identifying who are the most vulnerable households. They have described it in general categories such as those with no income and not receiving remittances, which had lost one of their members during the disaster especially the bread winner, and women headed households, elderly, disabled or sickly families. Location specific barangay/sitio leaders, the evacuation centers management committees and the displaced households decided on the selection criteria and process of selecting beneficiary households. The criteria and the verification process were not uniform in all sites. Instead, they depended on Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 129 the IDPs\u2019 perception as to who are the most vulnerable families in their community. The process being community-driven reflects the appreciation of the affected that people/households were affected differently and that men, women and children in different circumstances and categories have special needs during emergencies. Here are some examples consolidated from men and women group discussions in different evacuation centers: Single-headed families, including those headed by widows, Husband or the family head was injured and cannot work anymore, Big family (more than 6 family members) having low income, Survivors of the disaster (e.g. orphan below 18 years old).

During assessment, the team also looked at gender disaggregated data on different livelihood groups before and after the disaster. In one evacuation center (Daraga North Central Elementary school) during the Typhoon Durian response, the population was divided into four major livelihood groups before the disaster. Ranked no. 1 was tricycle driving, Rank 2 was construction laboring, participated by 100% males, Rank 3 was vending (food, vegetables/fruits, etc) where 80%women were involved and 20% men participation, Rank 4 was contractual labor for handicraft shops participated in by 5% men and 95% women. However, the percentage of population participating in each activity was not determined. After the typhoon and about 4 weeks in the evacuation center, labor participation rate was assumed to have dropped drastically as there were only about 16% of the households which had some source of income. Rank1 of their sources is tricycle driving where about 10% of households were dependent on; Rank 2 is vending with about 5%, Rank 3 is contractual labor on handicrafts with 1%. No one was engaged in construction work. There was also a change in gender participation, tricycle driving was still 100% male\u2019s job, there was a noted decrease by 10% men involvement in vending while a noted 10% increase of women involved in vending. A major factor attributed to this was that traditional sources of income and traditional productive assets were lost or damaged by the typhoon. For example, some men lost their equipments such as push carts or bicycles they were using before in their livelihood activities. For the women, what had increased were petty trades such as selling snack food, selling vegetables in small quantities which they carry around in baskets or display in some corner in public places. To some extent, this demanded more women to work outside their homes. This is an example of how disasters affects roles men and women play in the household and the increasing pressure on women to contribute more in productive work for the family to survive post disasters especially in this case where about 85% of the household heads lost their jobs and productive assets and opportunities for jobs is difficult.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f33a4a13-b12f-4ba9-a518-de928e34aab8": {"__data__": {"id_": "f33a4a13-b12f-4ba9-a518-de928e34aab8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrating Gender into Community-based Disaster Risk Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e41ae31d1da8c92e7dab43241aaee3a50af863c45554c3cc294ae08981c9083f"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ecd931e-752e-4eb4-b35f-00630bf090c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ea6b33165fccc307d036d2ce42fd43b71696125096e4f854091282ba1a06af5"}}, "hash": "100a6cfa0e053b194d74d863102f5d9fb122ff4cfc244ed5fd5b796d6c286f74", "text": "Rapid Assessment in Emergencies at North Daraga Evacuation Center With Villagers from Bagumbayan Livelihood groups Livelihood Before Typhoon Durian Livelihood After Typhoon Durian Ranked by numbers Participation % Percentage of participation Ranked by numbers Participation % Percentage of participation Male Female Male Female Tricycle drivers 1 No data 100% 0% 1 10% 100% 0% Construction workers 2 No data 100% 0% 3 0% 100% 0% Vendors (ballot, mixed consumer items) 3 No data 20% 80% 3 No data 20% 80% Handicraft contractual workers (per piece) 4 No data 5% 95% 4 1% 5% 95% Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 131 Promoting equal representation of women and men in response structures at the field level/or evacuation centers committees Composition of evacuation center committees varies in size depending on how large the population was and the natural clustering of families from their village of origin.

However, it was encouraged that IDPs be represented by sitio or puroks or barangays representing their places of origin. This was adopted in many evacuation sites with a slight adaptation as to identify with allocated rooms within the evacuation center. So, for this project the IDPs preferred to be represented thru their room leaders (as likely families from the same sitio or barangay were assigned to the same classroom cum evacuation room). Membership of EC committees composed of representatives from the respective \u2015rooms\u2016 plus the DSWD representative and the camp chief. The number ranged from 7 to 15 members. When project staff was asked to facilitate the selection process, one of the criteria put forward was equal representation of men and women in the committee. Women comprise the majority in the committees as more often \u2015room\u2016 population choose women representatives as they are evacuation center \u2013bound because of child caring responsibilities. In Bagumbayan EC for example, they have a 15 member committee with only 4 men representatives. Being hands-on, women leaders were active in mobilization for public health activities because they were concerned about health risks affecting their children; they were also responsible for household tasks of collecting water and doing the laundry for their families. One positive result of this is that women were given opportunities to develop their leadership skills, increase their confidence in their work as they become exposed to influences outside the home being able to participate in trainings, project meetings and dialogues with government leaders. It had also raised their status among their community members as during the emergency, their newly found confidence in meeting with agencies and government, and networking skills had earned the community more relief resources to tide them through the crisis. This was appreciated by men members of the community. Project policies that promote participation of women in project implementation During the sensitization process in communities, consultations with government, and other stakeholders, and in its communication strategy, Oxfam had articulated its advocacy on gender and had explained the rationale of putting in gender specific policies and its adoption thru the indicators set in the project. These include the following: \uf0b7 Promoting women participation in all the processes within the project cycle. Supporting the staff fulfill the gender standards in delivering humanitarian responses e.g. conduct of women only group discussions with women staff facilitating , etc. \uf0b7 Advocating for equal representation of men and women in project committees; \uf0b7 Advocating against any form of discrimination and protection of women and children in evacuation centers e.g. Ensuring that women\u2019s privacy are respected thru secure construction of toilets and bathing facilities, etc \uf0b7 Targeting women for trainings and leadership development; \uf0b7 Policy on cash distribution where women were to receive the cash in behalf of their households. Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 132 Feedback on women participation Sensitivity of interventions to women\u2019s practical and long term needs can be judged by the beneficiaries themselves based on their perception of appropriateness of the assistance, timeliness of the delivery, and sensitivity of the processes employed to existing social and cultural norms of the community. For the Typhoon Durian Response, feedback from the beneficiaries was gathered on the 6th to 7th week after the emergency thru a real time evaluation. The following were noted: Targeting households but distributing grants to women was very much appreciated by the beneficiaries. Targeting women was based on the knowledge that they were mostly in the evacuation centers and they usually manage the household budget; grants were thus mostly managed by women (85%). Generally women (44%) or both partners took decisions on the use of cash and in only a few cases men (9%). This probably had positive effect on limiting the misuse of cash, even though beneficiaries confirmed few a cases of cash being used for cigarettes and other non-essential needs. A similar finding but with a greater percentage of women\u2019s management over the cash grant was reflected in an evaluation with beneficiaries and other stakeholders for families who were targeted or prioritized to receive cash. Women had prominent role in the management and in the decision on the use of cash. They mostly managed the grants (91%) and decided on the use of cash with their husband (76%) or solely by themselves (21%) and in only a few cases men (3%).

As to the general impact of cash grants distribution to relationships at the household level and the community. Some families shared that the assistance had given husbands and wives renewed hope after the disaster and had kept them much closer in the family. The beneficiaries expressed agreement over providing cash during emergencies as they felt it empowers people as they are given the choice of meeting their immediate needs. And since the women decides or makes decision together with their husbands, on the uses of cash they have received, agencies are assured that will be used to benefit children and other members of the household.

As time and rumors passed and their houses continued to stand unmolested, complacency settled in the community. Things began to change, however. In 1985, several homeowners were made to tear down parts of their houses to comply with decree that there should be no houses within 5 meters of the tracks. In slow succession, the threat materialized. In 2001, then Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council chair chairman Mike Defensor rode through the tracks and announced the impending rehabilitation of the train tracks and in 2003, the National Housing Authority conducted a census to assess the density of the community that would have to be relocated. Under threat and short of options, the women of the community turned to the Grassroots Women\u2019s Empowerment Center (GWEC), an organization that seeks to contribute to the empowerment of women by creating bonds between the disadvantaged and professional women in urban poor communities. Not having much experience in housing concerns, GWEC asked for the aid of the Center on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE). COHRE started a series of housing workshops and worked with GWEC to educate community leaders on housing rights. A slow start to an uphill battle In the beginning, GWEC had to be creative in pushing their information campaign forward. A team of five GWEC members and some women leaders conducted these information drives in the affected communities. First in Caloocan then farther along the railway to Tayuman, Blumentritt, Dimasalang, and as far as Laguna, the team used loudspeakers and borrowed karaokes to spread their message. Initially resistant despite some 365 families who had already been evicted, the community was eventually worn down by the team\u2019s persistent door to door approach. In the end, and estimated 3, 000 families from Caloocan and 4,000-5,000 families in Tondo were reached by the campaign. A long road Once organized, the leadership of the group, mostly women, now had the task of better understanding the situation. The group wrote letters to President Arroyo s well as some key members of government seeking clarification on the plans for the railway project. The distilled answer to their letter was: \u2015people\u2019s right to housing will be respected.\u2016 As further talks with the government ensued, it was confirmed that there would be evictions. The key issue then became suitable relocation. Unknown to them at the time, it would be 3 more years before a suitable relocation site was found. Uprooting and Replanting Not wanting to be suddenly disconnected from livelihood and accustomed environment, the community did not accept the initial offer of relocating them outside Metro Manila. After it was Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 134 determined that in-city relocation was not possible, the women of the community took up the task of scouting for a suitable relocation area outside the city. Aside from not having money to spare, these women initially also had to pacify husbands who scolded their wives for always going out on trips. Worse, after finding a suitable area in San Vicente Bulacan, they were shunned by the local community, reviling them as criminals. In March 2008, GWEC was invited to view a site in Caysio, Bulacan.

Secure tenure \u2014 People are protected from arbitrary forced eviction, harassment and other threats. 2. Affordability \u2014 The amount a person or family pays for their housing must not be so high that it threatens or compromises the attainment and satisfaction of other basic needs 3. Habitability \u2014 Inhabitants must be ensured of adequate space and protection against the cold, damp, heat, rain, wind or other threats to health o structural hazards. In this respect, women must also be protected from domestic violence, a clear threat to their health. 4. Accessibility \u2014 Disadvantaged groups such as the elderly, children, the physically and mentally disabled, HIV positive individuals, victims of natural disasters and other groups should be ensured some degree of priority consideration in housing. 5. Location \u2014 Housing must be situated so as to allow access to employment options, health care services, schools, child care centers and other social facilities. The location of housing is especially vital for women to allow them the opportunities to fulfill other fundamental rights. 6. Availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure \u2014 Adequate housing requires access to potable water, energy for cooking, heating and lighting, sanitation, washing facilities, food storage, garbage disposal, drainage and emergency services. The importance of the proximate availability of these services is clear, considering the reality of many women\u2019s daily lives, often bearing the primary responsibility for the care of household, children and other family or community members. 7. Cultural adequacy \u2014 Housing must allow for the expression of cultural identity and recognize the cultural diversity of the world\u2019s population. Women must be given the chance to partake in the planning of housing to ensure a reflection of their collective identity.

To ensure that care for children would be a priority following the tragedy, World Vision Development Foundation (WVDF) included in its emergency response the establishment of Child-Friendly Spaces (CFS) in 2 evacuation centers. A total of 286 directly-affected families stayed at Cristo Rey Regional High School and 218 families form 4 neighboring villages declared as high risk areas were housed at the Catmon Elementary School in St. Bernard. Through the CFS, WVDF aimed to provide psychosocial care and a sense of safety to the children. The creative activities allowed children to share their ideas and feelings were designed to help children cope and deal with their negative emotions caused by their tragic experience. By creating opportunities for children to play, express themselves, and interact with other children in the CFS, children could regain a sense of normalcy. It\u2019s important to include the wider community, especially community leaders, and to get them enthusiastic about providing a safe place for children. The CFS provides an opportunity for the community to unite for a common purpose. A CFS is an open area where children and youth can come from home and meet other children, learn some age appropriate competencies that help them deal with the risk they face, be involved in expressive and some educational activities and relax in a safe place, which is focused on them. It is both a protective environment and one that enables children\u2019s health physical, psychosocial, moral, and spiritual development. CFS give children the sense of safety, structure, and continuity that provide support amidst overwhelming experiences. A CFS can be created in a school, a community center, a tent(s), or an open space either in a camp or in a community. It must be a place where girls and boys feel safe.

Explain the importance of the Gender-Sensitive Community Disaster Risk Management Plan 2. Discuss the process of the Gender-Sensitive CBDRM Plan 3. Craft a Gender-Sensitive CBDRM Action Plan Key Points 1. The Gender-sensitive Community Disaster Risk Management Plan unites the community in commitment and actions in achieving its vision of safe, gender- fair, resilient and developed families and community 2. The sound basis of the Gender-sensitive CBDRM Plan is the gender-based community risk assessment 3. The Gender- sensitive CBDRM Action plan addresses practical and strategic gender needs through appropriate disaster risk management interventions before, during and after a disaster. Methodology \u2015Vision of Safe, Gender-Fair and Disaster Resilient Community\u2016 Interactive Lecture Workshop, Plenary Presentation and Discussion Module 5: GENDER- SENSITIVE CBDRM PLANNING (ACTION PLANNING) Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 139 Process 1. \u2015Vision of Safe, Gender-Fair and Disaster Resilient Community\u2016. Group Participants into 4 \u2013 5 groups. Have at least one group each be composed of all women and all men, while the other groups can be mixed groupings. Have each group discuss what the families and community will look like if they have implemented gender-sensitive disaster risk management measures, \u2015What is your vision of a safe, gender-fair, and disaster resilient community?\u2016 Have the groups draw this \u2015Safe, Gender-Fair and Disaster Resilient Community\u2016 on kraft paper or flip chart paper. Facilitate a discussion of the similarities and differences of posters drawn by the various groups. 2. Compare with the current disaster situation, using maps and pictures from the community risk assessment. Ask the participants: \u2015How do we go from the current situation to the envisioned situation?\u2016 Summarize answers. 3. Explain that if the Participatory Gender-based Community Risk Assessment unites the community in common understanding of its hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities, the Gender-Sensitive (or Responsive) Community Disaster Risk Management Plan unites the community in commitment and actions in disaster risk reduction. Note that as in all the processes in integrating the gender perspective in CBDRM, the participation of women is required and enhanced. Note that participation involves process and content. Process will involve ensuring presence of women, respecting and recognizing their contributions as well as having support mechanisms in the family and community for them to participate. Content would cover not only practical gender needs but also strategic gender needs within the framework of reducing vulnerabilities and increasing capacities to protect individuals, families and community from impacts of hazards. 4. Compare the planning process in gender-sensitive community based disaster risk management to planning for a trip similar to bring the community from its current situation to its envisioned situation of safe, gender-fair and resilient community.
