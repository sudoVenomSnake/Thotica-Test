Weak environmental regulations, particularly for nitrogen and phosphorous from animal manure in waterways and soil b. Cumulative impacts from point and non- point sources of pollution, particularly nitrogen and phosphorous from animal manure, are contributing to excessive nutrient loads in waterways and soil High magnitude of impact: Excessive nutrient loads in local water resources and soil impacting native wildlife.

KBAs are present in virtually all countries and oceans (but only 56% of KBAs globally have legal protection): see a global map here. IMPACTS TO CC: HIGH IMPACTS FROM CC: HIGH Probability and magnitude of impact: Livestock production both contributes to climate change and is at risk from its impacts. On the contribution side, globally, the livestock sector contributes 18% of global GHG emissions (cumulative emissions from energy, waste, land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) and agriculture for feed production) (FAO 2006). The agriculture sector as a whole accounts for ~24% (IPCC 2014) of global GHG emissions, so the livestock sector accounts for 75% of all emissions from agriculture. Thus, the likelihood and magnitude of the impact is high (i.e. the livestock sector contributes to climate change through GHG emissions, and is a significant proportion); however, given that livestock\u2019s major use is meat, the specific contribution for leather use is difficult to assess and warrants further research. The likelihood and magnitude that livestock production will be impacted by climate change is high, because: \u2022 Livestock products would become costlier if agricultural disruption leads to higher grain prices. In general, intensively managed livestock systems will be easier to adapt to climate change than will crop systems. \u2022 Pastoral systems may not adapt so readily. Pastoral communities tend to adopt new methods and technologies more slowly, and livestock depend on the productivity and quality of rangelands, some of which may be adversely affected by climate change. In addition, extensive livestock systems are more susceptible to changes in the severity and distribution of livestock diseases and parasites, which may result from global warming. Note on farmed animals: if energy for running the farms is from non-renewable sources then there is a contribution to GHG emissions (but these are relatively limited compared to other more energy- intensive parts of the value chain). Domesticated animals: Typically livestock species are not considered invasive species. Note that the IUCN/SSC Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) classifies feral cattle (animals escaped into the wild) as invasive alien species (but feral pigs, goats and rabbits have higher negative impacts on native biodiversity, especially in small islands). Risks would be high where such escapes occur and impact native species and ecosystems.

MANAGING THE IDENTIFIED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES As a biodiversity risk and opportunity assessment is conducted, potential action areas to mitigate risks to, and realize opportunities for, biodiversity conservation emerge. It is recommended to consider taking some initial steps that can help to ensure that relevant policies, strategies and action plans are developed and implemented coherently and systemically. Establishing and publicly communicating such commitments, ambitions or aspirations can be inspiring and demonstrates a clear and coordinated direction for biodiversity action planning. These steps include: Define clearly your commitments in relation to nature conservation. Based on your product lines and the results of the risk and opportunity assessment identify the areas that emerge as priority in terms of highest risk and opportunities. In the apparel sector, the following types of commitments are likely to match some of the risks and opportunities: o Move to deforestation-free supply chains: Ensure that major product lines using raw materials that are based on terrestrial ecosystems (such as cotton or plantation agro- ecosystems, or natural forest ecosystems), will only source from existing managed landscapes for agriculture or forestry activities. o Promote land restoration: For raw materials or commodities that have a potential impact on land use (for example cotton), join or develop land restoration initiatives at the landscape level (i.e. help bring back productivity to adjacent areas, thereby reducing the risk of natural habitat conversion for other land uses, including food production). o Substitute more hazardous chemicals with less hazardous ones: As evidence improves on impacts of industrial chemicals on human and environmental health, best practices, laws and international norms related to such chemical use, substitute more toxic substances with less toxic ones, and improve the targeting and precision of chemical use to minimize non-target impacts. o Sustainable water management: Across the value chain, commit to using and managing water resources sustainably. Advanced corporate strategies should aim to recognise, map and reduce water risks for wider multi-stakeholder benefits at river basin scale. This approach should underpin work on mitigating biodiversity risks (for example water quality), and encourage business to support better public sector policy development, regulatory mechanisms and monitoring. o Contribute to sustainable livelihoods: Benefit local communities in your supply chains (particularly in developing countries) that are dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods by creating opportunities for sustainable natural resource management (for e.g. good agricultural practices, water stewardship) with the aim of transforming these supply chains for both community and conservation benefit.

Distinguish between animal welfare and biodiversity conservation issues. Both issues are critical, but clearly distinct. The strategies and actions shall be clearly separate in order to ensure that the impacts are correctly addressed as well as the opportunities. Furthermore, partners on the ground and globally will very likely be different for these two issues. Adopt the mitigation hierarchy. In developing a sustainability strategy for biodiversity, it is advisable to use the mitigation hierarchy as a framework for action. This calls for three main steps: o Define what impacts can be avoided and address them first (for e.g. avoiding sourcing of wild species that are globally threatened) o Define options for minimizing environmental impacts and maximizing conservation opportunities (e.g. purchasing organic or sustainably-certified cotton minimises the impact of intensive agrochemicals on local biodiversity in production regions; identifying areas near cotton plantation for restoration). o Assess your residual impact (including the sourcing of raw materials) and consider compensation actions such as biodiversity offsets or other conservation actions (e.g. improving the management effectiveness of legally protected areas in managed landscapes where offsets are not possible because of the absence of natural areas with similar biodiversity to that being negatively impacted from residual effects). Develop, in collaboration with other end users, a Net Positive Impact strategy to offset the impacts at the landscape level (IUCN, 2015). Identify sustainable value addition your company can contribute to. In the assessment of negative impacts from supply chains, also consider the potential for positive impacts from certain activities (including on local livelihoods) such as sustainable wild species sourcing and sourcing from smallholder farmers as a means of supporting local livelihoods and employment. Integrate Sustainability in the conceptual phase of the business development. A sustainable design approach offers the possibility to incorporate environmental or biodiversity factors into the conceptual design phase such as the selection of the raw materials. In addition, it allows the Biodiversity offsets Biodiversity offsets are measurable conservation outcomes resulting from actions designed to compensate for significant residual adverse biodiversity impacts arising from project development after appropriate prevention and mitigation measures have been taken. The goal of biodiversity offsets is to achieve No Net Loss and preferably a Net Gain of biodiversity on the ground with respect to species composition, habitat structure, ecosystem function and people\u2019s use and cultural values associated with biodiversity.

Develop and implement a sustainable use strategy relating to wildlife resources. From the perspective of maximizing opportunities for biodiversity conservation, the apparel sector can play a major role in supporting the sustainable use of wild resources. Sustainable use is recognised as a conservation strategy by IUCN, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). IUCN recognizes that \u201cthe ethical, wise and sustainable use of some wildlife can provide an alternative or supplementary means of productive land-use, and can be consistent with and encourage conservation, where such use is in accordance with appropriate safeguards\" (18th Session of the General Assembly (Perth, 1990), Rec. 18.24).

Decision-making on the mode of production should be treated on a case by case, or species by species basis, giving consideration to each of these factors. The most appropriate production method may be sustainably wild caught harvest, where species can demonstrably be harvested sustainably using the most appropriate harvest methods, thereby benefitting from lower production costs, as well as delivering benefits to local communities through employment or opportunities to earn income associated with harvest. Alternatively, it may be that intensively managing resources in a captive environment is most suitable based on existing operations or supply chains (which enable natural systems to be left alone from sourcing) or consumer preferences for a given product but which may also present opportunities for local communities to benefit through associated employment opportunities. The challenge to selecting the most appropriate strategy is working through the combination of factors in order to mitigate the risks and identify the opportunities which will deliver maximum benefits for the conservation of biodiversity, maintenance of ecosystem services and opportunity for supporting local livelihoods. 9 See resources on sustainable design from UNEP: http://www.unep.org/resourceefficiency/Business/SustainableProducts/DesignforSustainability/tabid/78845/ Default.aspx 22 The strategy should include: 1. Assessment of the species 2. Identification of best practices for harvesting/colleting 3. Develop a monitoring plan to assess practices and identify benefits 4. Developing a trusted and cost-effective traceability system for sourcing species 5. Determine credible claims that can be made in relation to the use of these species in its production lines. Annex 1 provides more details on the process for establishing a strategy for the sustainable use of wild resources. To conclude, it should be noted that from the perspective of risk mitigation, this sector\u2019s high risks to biodiversity stem largely from the raw materials and manufacturing parts of the value chain, which can be locally and/or globally distributed. In general, it is therefore suggested to work on action planning with different partners and at different scales (relevant to the size of operations and supply chain distribution). It should be noted that proactively taking a sustainable design approach for the design of a product (which would typically take place within the manufacturing part of the value chain) would play a critical role in improving its sustainability performance. Indeed, the conceptual design phase holds the most influence on decisions defining the raw materials, supply chains and manufacturing processes needed for the final product. 23 ANNEX 1: SUSTAINABLE USE OF BIODIVERSITY A.1 Introduction to wildlife trade Wildlife trade, the sale or exchange of wild animal, plant and fungi resources by people, takes place to meet a range of human wants and needs (Broad et al. 2003). It includes the harvest and trade in live animals and plants, animal skins and furs, bones and trophies, plant seeds, oils, and resins, among many other derivatives, for nutritional, medicinal, socio-economic and cultural reasons. This includes the use of wildlife as food, medicine, pets, collection items, as decorative, fashion and luxury items, and as timber. It takes place at local, national and international levels and supports the livelihoods of millions of people in the developing world, in particular indigenous peoples and local communities, but also in developed regions. For instance, it encompasses the sale and exchange of wild animals and plants for subsistence purposes in the developing world but equally the retail of luxury products (e.g., handbags made from crocodile or snake skin) in high-end markets (e.g., in Europe). Quantifying wildlife trade is inherently difficult because much of it occurs through informal networks and is poorly monitored. However, international trade has been estimated to be worth US$323 billion annually (TRAFFIC 2014), the majority of which comprises fisheries and timber, and wildlife trade is growing in terms of value and volumes (Roe 2008). Excluding fisheries and timber, international trade has been estimated to be worth US$61 billion annually (Engler 2008) and involves a plethora of wildlife species and their derivatives among mammals (e.g., furs, skins), birds (e.g., live, feathers), amphibians and reptiles (e.g., for pets, skins), invertebrates, plants (including orchids and cacti) and corals. The trade in wildlife has primarily been governed by regulation both nationally, through laws and regulations, and internationally through CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora which entered into force in 1975.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f10a85ed-43e8-4755-9ea7-a75aef629fa8": {"__data__": {"id_": "f10a85ed-43e8-4755-9ea7-a75aef629fa8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity risks and opportunities in the apparel sector", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31b47a37b392ff7faeffe069754a565b8ff5ce7a4b60e480f9e04ef9e9c5694b"}, "2": {"node_id": "471810b2-9c61-4ff0-974b-2e4412d3cf5d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a26ba6a0a74c97e6593d88b5424239974f0fb931c9b69104a315c46f0dbc800"}}, "hash": "52389d59fb2e0034240d63efe3296bda5470cfd7f9602c0be6a37197d1b22d1e", "text": "However, while most wildlife trade is legal, that is it takes place within national laws and conventions, large volumes of illegal trade also takes place which contravenes these measures.

Key to ensuring that wildlife trade does not threaten biodiversity is making sure that it does not exceed biologically sustainable levels, i.e. is unsustainable. This is the focus of the CITES Convention which applies to international trade and which relies on a regulatory approach. A predominantly regulatory approach has also been championed and prioritised in recent years as a result of increasing levels of illegal trade, for example, the need to strengthen regulation, enforcement and trade restrictions. However, although strengthening regulations may be appropriate to address illegal trade in some circumstances, in others instances strict regulation may be problematic for ensuring sustainable harvest and trade of wildlife. For instance, this could be the case where it prevents trade which is legal, sustainable and well-regulated and which could deliver positive outcomes for biodiversity conservation in terms of species and habitat conservation, and benefits to local communities in terms of livelihoods. A.2 Introduction to sustainable use The conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of ecosystem services relies on careful management and protection of wildlife resources, and where wildlife is traded, to ensure that trade does not occur at unsustainable levels. Sustainable use is defined by the Convention on Biological 24 Diversity (CBD) as the \u2018use of components of biological diversity in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity, thereby maintaining its potential to meet the needs and aspirations of present and future generations\u2019 (CBD 1993). Where the harvest and trade in wildlife resources is unsustainable, i.e. occurs at a level faster than biological recovery, it can threaten wildlife populations, the existence of species, and detrimentally impact ecosystems. It also threatens the livelihoods of those people who depend on wildlife resources in the long term. This may be through income generation as part of their daily livelihood strategies or as an additional source of income, by removing their ability to benefit from use which is sustainable, which also impacts their ability to contribute to conservation efforts. Unsustainable harvest and trade leads to declines in populations of wildlife species and in extreme circumstances can lead to local, or even global, extinction of species or sub-species. There are a number of examples where overexploitation has led to diminished populations or the depletion of natural resources, including non-timber forest products such as nuts and seeds (NTFP; Neumann and Hirsch 2000) and the extinction of the Javan Rhino Rhinoceros sondaicus in Vietnam in 2011 as a result of overexploitation for its horn for illegal trade (Brooks et al. 2011). However, declines in populations or the loss of species from ecosystems, especially \u2018keystone species\u2019 \u2013 those that have a significant impact on their native ecosystems (Power et al. 1996) \u2013 can also result in cumulative impacts on ecosystems and ultimately threaten ecosystem integrity and function. For example, species declines or losses impact on species-species interactions (e.g., predator-prey relationships) which can have additional effects along the food chain \u2013 so called \u2018trophic cascades\u2019 (Pace et al. 1999). An example would be where a species is lost in an area where it is the primary prey for a predator, so with the loss of the prey species can be the loss of the predator species. Loss of species can also impact on other ecosystem services such as nutrient cycles, seed dispersal or pollination, as is the case with unsustainable harvest of species for bushmeat in Africa and Asia (e.g., Harrison et al. 2013), resulting in the erosion of ecosystem function. Millions of people around the world depend on wildlife resources to varying degrees and unsustainable harvest and trade also affects them in a number of ways. First, it can inhibit their ability to harvest and trade species sustainably and thereby reap the socio-economic and other benefits of doing so, ultimately meaning that they need to pursue alternative livelihood strategies. Similarly, where species become rare and the costs associated with harvest increase, harvest of particular species may no longer be feasible as a livelihood activity and people may similarly need to consider alternative livelihood means (Cooney et al. 2015).

Each of these impacts is negative both for biodiversity and for people\u2019s livelihoods \u2013 unsustainable harvesting and trade can remove the incentive for local people to value and become stewards of species and habitats found in and around their communities. Conversely, where species can be sustainably harvested and traded, under the right conditions, both harvest and trade can have positive impacts for both biodiversity conservation and local livelihoods. These conditions include species\u2019 biological characteristics, governance factors (e.g., laws and policies and their enforcement and implementation), supply-chain factors, and end-market factors (see Cooney et al. 2015). There are good examples from around the world where these conditions have enabled legal, sustainable trade which has been beneficial both to species and people\u2019s livelihoods. Examples include the sustainable harvest and trade of vicu\u00f1a in South America, crocodiles in some African countries, and trophy hunting of Markhor in Pakistan, which have 25 resulted in increasing populations of these species in the wild and social, economic and development benefits to local communities who live with or close to these species. A.3 How to use CITES: Appendix I, II and III A.3.1 What is CITES? The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is an international agreement between Governments and is a UN Convention. The aim of the Convention is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival in the wild. Much of the focus of the Convention is on putting in place mechanisms to guide sustainable legal trade of species but CITES also focuses on combatting illegal trade. Because the trade in wild animals and plants crosses international borders, international cooperation is required to monitor and regulate trade to safeguard certain species from over- exploitation. In recognition of this need for such international collaboration, CITES was agreed by 80 countries in 1973. The Convention entered into force on 1 July 1975 and has 181 Parties as of June 2015. More than 30,000 plant and animal species are listed on the three Appendices of the Convention, depending on their biological status and the impact that international trade may have upon this status. A.3.2 How CITES functions? CITES is an international agreement (a treaty) to which States (countries) adhere voluntarily. States that sign and ratify the Convention ('join' CITES) agree to be bound by it and are known as Parties to the Convention. Although CITES is legally binding on the Parties \u2013 in other words they have to implement the Convention \u2013 it does not take the place of national laws. Rather it provides a framework to be respected by each Party, which has to adopt its own domestic legislation to ensure that CITES is implemented at the national level. The Convention works by subjecting international trade in specimens of selected species to certain controls. All import, export, re-export and introduction from the sea of species covered by the Convention needs to be authorized through a licensing system. Member countries, known as Parties, work together in a variety of ways to fulfil the Convention\u2019s aims. For instance: - Species listed on CITES Appendix I are threatened with extinction at least in part because of international trade, so trade for commercial purposes is prohibited. Trade in specimens of these species is permitted only for exceptional non-commercial purposes (such as for scientific research). Species on Appendix I include, for example: tigers; almost all whale species; all marine turtles; elephants; all the great apes; as well as some crocodiles. . However, in some cases, Appendix I species can be traded if they are closed-cycle captive bred (where no animals, including young / eggs, are taken from the wild) which has been established to be without detriment to the wild population. In order to trade internationally, such facilities must be registered as \u201cCITES-registered captive breeding operations\u201d. Captive breeding facilities have been established for a number of Appendix I listed crocodile species for example, including Alligator sinensis, Crocodylus moreletii, C. acutus, C. porosus and C. siamensis. - Species listed on CITES Appendix II are species that are not yet threatened with extinction, but may become so unless international trade is regulated.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53ddaf73-ff72-4dfb-a671-d92a6c5f3305": {"__data__": {"id_": "53ddaf73-ff72-4dfb-a671-d92a6c5f3305", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity risks and opportunities in the apparel sector", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f36d744f2a72728afabe74b291949971b674960757afd392b32ee1c3f9eb4d6"}, "2": {"node_id": "9189e52d-e050-4b87-b7a4-a1434d8a1e0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f8ca11d273e10b521617417ea9ad1fbefe9add8e06debebea8f96ea109baa44"}}, "hash": "f0a734a2308ac6859577ddf3f12190222ad79346bf23ce3b1a3e90f715b3dab1", "text": "Species can only be exported when the exporting country has determined that the international trade will not be detrimental to the species\u2019 survival in the wild and is in compliance with their own national and domestic legislation.

The source of traded Appendix II species may be from the wild (if managed in a way that is non-detrimental to the species) or also through ranching / captive breeding (where animals are raised in captivity but stock, for example eggs / young, may be supplemented from the wild, which must also be non-detrimental to the species). - When a species is listed on CITES Appendix III by a range State (the State / nation whose territory is within the natural range of distribution of a species), exports from that range State (and other range States that also list the species) are only allowed when the Management Authority is satisfied that the specimen has been legally obtained. Exports from other range States (that have not included their own populations of the species on Appendix III) must be accompanied by Certificates of Origin, stating the exporting country. A good example of this is ramin (Gonystylus spp.), which Indonesia included in Appendix III of CITES in 2001. In order to comply with CITES\u2019 requirements, each CITES Party is required to designate a Management Authority to issue permits for trade in species listed in the CITES Appendices and a Scientific Authority to provide scientific advice on imports and exports. CITES enforcement is often the responsibility of Customs, Police and similar agencies. A.3.3 The IUCN Red List The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122 is the world\u2019s most comprehensive information source on the global conservation status (threat of extinction) of animal, plant and fungi species and their links to human livelihoods. It provides information and analyses on the status, trends and threats to species in order to inform and catalyse action for biodiversity conservation. Each Red List assessment for a species includes a rich compendium of information including geographic range (including species distribution maps), habitat, ecology, population size and trends as well as threats, global status and conservation actions being taken to reduce or prevent extinctions. The Red List uses an objective system to assess the global risk of extinction of a species based on past, present, and projected threats. Species assessments are made using a standardized process that includes the rigorous IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria which are based on population size, trends and structure, as well as geographic range. Species are assigned to one of eight Red List Categories, from Least Concern to Extinct or Extinct in the Wild, according to whether they meet the quantitative thresholds for at least one of the five criteria. Species listed as Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable are collectively described as threatened. The three \u201cthreatened\u201d Red List categories all mean that the species has been found to have a high threat of extinction at the global level. Critically Endangered species face an extremely high level of threat for global extinction, Endangered species face a very high level of threat and Vulnerable species face a high level of threat for extinction. Each category is denoted quantitatively through evaluation against five different criteria that focus on population trends, size and geographic distribution. For example, if the population of a species at the global level reduces by 80 to 90% over a 10 year period (or specified period based on the species\u2019 life history) then it qualifies to be Critically Endangered. The highest standards of scientific documentation, information management, expert review and justification are used in the process. An independent review process must take place before publication of a species assessment on the Red List. Inclusion of a species on The IUCN Red List does not necessarily mean that it should be a priority for a particular kind of conservation action, or that 27 legal regulations automatically apply to it in any country or region, though countries often do use Red List assessments to make conservation and management based decisions. A.3.4 IUCN Red List Link to CITES IUCN Red List data is used in a number of international policy fora including CITES, CBD and the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is used regularly by Parties (countries) to CITES, for example when considering if species should be added to or are appropriately listed on CITES Appendix I, II or III (meaning that international trade restrictions / controls are implemented for these species)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "002a0692-2a3f-4faa-bae5-1c51e941fa7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "002a0692-2a3f-4faa-bae5-1c51e941fa7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity risks and opportunities in the apparel sector", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed075ac25d3e7d3fcd9e4c3381ec75aa1bbc348e4e4205f88d8fc4a07072b227"}, "3": {"node_id": "810e43cf-4c61-4815-8d27-abe7df2bf20d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab86ab3e91d7e438d0b6953befe3f3f299211baa25091bc06d6ad662426c0da8"}}, "hash": "1f35be8193260a4bac2341359e79ab9d33b78e1e29cdc61c169640c701326854", "text": "and for reviewing whether international trade levels of CITES-listed species are too high (detrimental) for the survival of the species. IUCN attends all CITES meetings and presents IUCN Red List data and other types of information there to assist countries with decision-making. IUCN is an International Governmental Organization (IGO) so is an observer to CITES since only countries / Parties to the Convention can make CITES decisions, for example to list species on the CITES Appendices. However, IUCN\u2019s role is to provide independent, science-based information to the meetings in partnership with its scientists in the Species Survival Commission. In this regard, for each major CITES meeting (the Convention of the Parties or CoP), IUCN along with TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, which is a joint programme of IUCN and WWF, independently review all proposals to add, transfer or remove species from the CITES Appendices in a project called the CITES Analyses. TRAFFIC\u2019s work focuses on trade specifically, and its\u2019 mission is to ensure that trade in wild plants and animals is not a threat to the conservation of nature. TRAFFIC engages in activities such as investigating and analysing wildlife trade trends, patterns, impacts and drivers, including illegal trade, as well as providing information, encouragement and advice to the private sector on effective approaches to ensure that sourcing of wildlife uses sustainability standards and best practices. The CITES biological criteria for determining whether a species should be added to the CITES Appendices are based very closely on the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, with the IUCN Red List providing additional information for considering whether species require trade restrictions. Countries use IUCN Red List data to assist with CITES decision-making as well as for implementing species conservation and management decisions at the national and trans-boundary level. Generally, species that are on CITES Appendix II and can be traded commercially are not threatened on the IUCN Red List while most of those on CITES Appendix I that cannot be traded commercially are threatened on the Red List. However, a global Red List threatened status (e.g. Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable) for a species does not necessarily mean that it should not be used or traded, for example in the case of Appendix I species that can still be bred in closed- cycle captive breeding facilities and traded since no animals from the wild are used. Another example is the CITES Appendix II listed species Python bivittatus (Burmese python) which is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List \u2013 captive breeding of the species is common and contributes to local livelihoods as outlined in a recent publication by the IUCN SSC Boa & Python Specialist Group. Another consideration is that although a species may be listed as globally Least Concern, the species may be more threatened in particular countries, making site-specific sourcing information important. Normally for CITES species, important differences between countries in the threat status of a species is reflected in the CITES Appendices (e.g. if a species is less common in one country it can be listed in CITES Appendix I rather than II). However, it is important to also check the status of species on national-level Red Lists. IUCN provides guidelines for these regional assessments, though does not usually endorse them \u2013 however, they are valuable sources of local information. Legal and governance conditions within the country where species / species products 28 are sourced is also important in terms of whether environmental / sustainable trade safeguards such as CITES are adequately implemented. A number of species on CITES Appendix II are good examples of those being used and traded sustainably through sustainable management regimes and captive breeding.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "810e43cf-4c61-4815-8d27-abe7df2bf20d": {"__data__": {"id_": "810e43cf-4c61-4815-8d27-abe7df2bf20d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity risks and opportunities in the apparel sector", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed075ac25d3e7d3fcd9e4c3381ec75aa1bbc348e4e4205f88d8fc4a07072b227"}, "2": {"node_id": "002a0692-2a3f-4faa-bae5-1c51e941fa7d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f35be8193260a4bac2341359e79ab9d33b78e1e29cdc61c169640c701326854"}}, "hash": "ab86ab3e91d7e438d0b6953befe3f3f299211baa25091bc06d6ad662426c0da8", "text": "Examples of this include: \u2022 Yellow Anaconda in Argentina (Eunectes notaeus, CITES Appendix II) \u2013 more information here \u2022 Broad-snouted caiman in Argentina (Caiman latirostris, CITES Appendix I except for Argentina which is CITES Appendix II) \u2013 more information here and here and here \u2022 Vicu\u00f1a (Vicugna vicugna, CITES Appendix I except for certain populations in various countries in CITES Appendix II) and Guanaco (Lama guanicoe, CITES Appendix II) in Andean countries \u2013 more information here \u2022 Chinese Alligator (Alligator sinensis, CITES Appendix I) and Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis, CITES Appendix I) \u2013 more information here and here A.3.5 Mapping IUCN Knowledge and Tools A number of reports, tools and guidelines have been developed by IUCN already for helping businesses and companies determine what considerations to take in terms of sustainably sourcing and using species.

This can be done through the following checks and considerations: \u2022 The company can check whether the species they are using or plan to use is listed on CITES Appendix I, II or III. Appendix I species cannot be traded commercially unless, in some cases, through closed-cycle captive breeding (where no animals are taken from the wild). Appendix II species can be traded internationally for commercial purposes but only accompanied by permits which state that the trade is non-detrimental (assessed by government authorities 30 in the exporting State). Appendix III species can also be traded internationally for commercial purposes but similarly require appropriate permits or certificates. \u2022 The company should also check whether the country that they are sourcing from is an active Party to CITES and implementing the decisions and resolutions of the Convention (e.g. countries which are not subject to export bans caused by non-compliance with CITES). \u2022 Companies should also work only with businesses that abide by CITES regulations. In this way, companies can use existing international mechanisms such as CITES to ensure that they are meeting the highest level standards of environmental safeguards for their products possible. \u2022 The country itself where the species is sourced may have national-level measures / certification standards in place for sustainable wildlife-based production facilities / use of wildlife species - this should be investigated. \u2022 If the species of interest is not listed in the CITES Appendices, then companies can determine whether the species they are using or plan to use is listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122, in particular as globally threatened (Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered). Special attention should also be paid to species which have not yet been assessed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened species (though they might have been assessed nationally, see below) or are listed as Data Deficient (so cannot be categorized because there is not enough information about them) or Near Threatened. \u2022 Companies should check whether there is a National Red List for the country that they are sourcing from and, if so, whether the species that they are using or plan to use for their products is listed on the National Red List as threatened. In this regard, companies can check whether the species has been protected at the national level. Note that if a species is threatened, it does not necessarily mean that it cannot be used as some species can still be either wild-sourced in a sustainable way or can be farmed / captive-bred meaning that there is no take from the wild and thus no negative impact on the wild population of the species but the following provides some guidance of considerations in that regard. \u2022 Companies can check whether they can source relevant species from farming operations or from the wild \u2013 in some cases there may be no choice (e.g. the species is only available through captive breeding operations) but in other cases, there may be reputable suppliers who are sourcing species from the wild in a way that is both sustainable and advantageous to the conservation of the species as well as to the livelihoods of local communities. Consideration of whether to source species from the wild should include the following (Cooney et al. (2015)): \u2022 Decisions regarding wild harvest of threatened species should be made on a case by case basis, taking into account species\u2019 biological characteristics and the social, economic and institutional context. \u2022 Decisions should be based on the best available knowledge, scientific information and indigenous and local knowledge. \u2022 Consideration should be given to the incentives and revenue for conservation generated by wild harvest, including likely impacts on cooperative relationships with indigenous and local communities, human-wildlife conflict, retention of species habitat, and the motivations and capacity of key stakeholders to carry out actions for protection, conservation and sustainable use in the short and long term. \u2022 The status of the specific regional/ national/ subnational species population subject to harvest, not just its global status as threatened, should be considered. \u2022 The reasons that a species is listed on the Red List should be considered before decisions about harvest are made to assess the likely impacts of harvest. 31 \u2022 For species listed under Red List criterion A, the reasons for decline of the species\u2019 population should be considered before decisions are made on harvest in order to assess whether harvest will exacerbate decline or not. \u2022 For species listed under Red List criterion B, local abundance of the species should be considered to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6494b04a-2bc2-4d72-9de8-d296d7d5fb77": {"__data__": {"id_": "6494b04a-2bc2-4d72-9de8-d296d7d5fb77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity risks and opportunities in the apparel sector", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69b6577f9ee4bcd9bf90e5cdcee2bfcb1585c51bed2dfd154b31f2fc2e17d237"}, "3": {"node_id": "d41528f4-a091-41d5-b89a-ae17f2dfa9cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "841f4c42c223be516b7431c3a6e2c5a9c8f1276dd0af33ab406a1ff457e995ce"}}, "hash": "f9ec278d1e09871310a9532e273522a7dcc52a0ca5179921a0bf24345a9f8475", "text": "assess whether harvest may be sustainable. \u2022 For species listed under Red List criterion C or D, the likelihood of adequate monitoring and management of the species should be considered. \u2022 Consideration of the form of harvest strategy most likely to promote sustainability should be made, given the characteristics of the species and context of use. \u2022 The form of production approach most likely to promote sustainability, given the characteristics of the species and context of use, should be evaluated. Some additional information on business engagement in CITES can be found in the World Economic Forum publication entitled \u201cGreen Light \u2013 Creating the Business Case for CITES: A New Finance Mechanism\u201d which has a section on Traceability and Technology. Also, in terms of traceability, the CITES Secretariat with leading business entrepreneurs launched a smartphone application in 2013 called \u2018ASKING', which allows consumers to query the wildlife source their products are made from, with the intent of ensuring the sustainable use of species for food, medicine or fashion products. There are various emerging tools and guidelines that can assist companies in ensuring that they have the processes and checks in place to ensure sustainability from source material to product. A.3.7 Implementing a sustainable use strategy: wild caught vs. intensively managed wild resources In order to most effectively mitigate the negative impacts and promote the positive impacts of the apparel sector on biodiversity conservation and the maintenance of ecosystem services, it is important to evaluate the costs and benefits of different production systems, that is, the means of producing wildlife resources for harvest and trade, and their associated potential impacts on biodiversity and livelihoods in the short and long-term. A major consideration in particular, is whether sourcing from the wild or intensively managing wild resources in a captive environment (e.g. farming, captive breeding, ranching) will have better outcomes for conservation and livelihoods. Another crucial consideration in decision-making is the species\u2019 global conservation status and its status regionally, nationally and sub-nationally. Decisions on whether to use species from the wild or from farms should be made on a case by case basis and consider factors including why species may be threatened as well as opportunities for incentives and revenue generation for conservation (See Section 5.3.6). Key factors to consider in the formulation of strategies to ensure sustainable use of wildlife resources include species biological factors, governance factors, supply-chain factors and end-market factors, each of which has a number of considerations (Cooney et al. 2015) as outlined below. Species factors \u2013 is a species suitable for sustainable wild harvest and trade and/or intensively managed captive production? o Are target species resilient to wild harvest?

Costs and benefits as well as potential impacts for wild caught vs. intensively managed resources Wild caught production There are costs, benefits and potential impacts associated with wild caught vs. intensively managed resources. The costs, benefits and impacts of wild caught production include: Costs \uf0a7 Higher harvest costs \u2013 sourcing from the wild can result in higher harvest costs associated with identifying and procuring target specimens of species from the wild. \uf0a7 Less control over quality \u2013 sourcing from the wild can result in less control over the quality of production, for example, disease affecting species, condition of animals. \uf0a7 Less control over production volumes \u2013 sourcing from the wild can result in less control over the rate of production which will be dependent on reproductive rates of species. Benefits \uf0a7 Lower production costs - harvesting from the wild can result in lower production costs as species/ derivatives are produced in the wild without input of resources such as food needed as a part of intensively managed production approaches. Potential Impacts \uf0a7 Where wild harvest and trade is industrial it could marginalise local communities. \uf0a7 Where wild harvest of species normalises collection it could lead to illegal trade, placing greater harvest pressure on wild populations and beyond sustainable levels. \uf0a7 Sustainable harvest and trade could provide incentives for local people to conserve species in the wild and therefore conserve habitats, and thereby contribute to the conservation of ecosystems. \uf0a7 Sourcing from the wild at sustainable levels could provide an opportunity for local community members to gain employment / earn income. \uf0a7 Sustainable sourcing of wild caught specimens of species could lead to increases in populations of target species; \uf0a7 Sustainable sourcing of wild caught specimens of species could deliver local economic development benefits in the developing world; \uf0a7 The delivery of benefits to local people can go beyond economic benefits to broader livelihood and development outcomes, for example building community networks and local enterprise development (see Cooney et al. 2015). \uf0a7 Adoption of robust standards or certification systems for sustainable harvest and trade from the wild could provide opportunities for apparel companies to implement good practices, monitor the impacts, and communicate the sustainability outcomes to demonstrate leadership in responsible harvesting from the wild. Intensively managed resources Key costs, benefits and impacts of intensively managed resources include the following: Costs \uf0a7 Higher production costs \u2013 intensively managing resources can result in higher production costs associated with housing, feeding, breeding, and maintaining resources (e.g., veterinary costs) intensively in captive environments. 34 \uf0a7 Focusing production exclusively on intensively managed resources could remove incentives for the conservation of species in situ resulting in habitat loss and degradation and the erosion of ecosystems. \uf0a7 Intensive ex situ production can adversely impact on wild populations where wild animals are caught to stock or re-populate captive operations, to supply feed for captive animals, or are laundered as animals produced solely in captivity. Benefits \uf0a7 Lower harvest costs \u2013 intensively managing wild resources will likely result in lower harvest costs as a result of species being in captive environments which can be harvested at will. \uf0a7 Greater control over quality \u2013 intensively managing resources should mean there is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac4b95be-50b6-4324-9efd-48effede23b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac4b95be-50b6-4324-9efd-48effede23b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity risks and opportunities in the apparel sector", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5517859c9ea12ab9e19403c819f2b14416d4600863fcdc33499bb15a4f49055d"}, "3": {"node_id": "e92a3f7a-9d2a-4e25-b8e6-ca4ea4c96efa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/biodiversity-risks-and-opportunities-apparel-sector", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4afb4c950e31e31e975dcd72c7c24f8f2feff8fb356119a11383e2bb7e5af3cd"}}, "hash": "70e3d6780d7d2b6fdac7d0cde8c34710364121dc08302525bd69f2627878cb3d", "text": "greater control over the quality of production (e.g., maintaining species free of disease). \uf0a7 Greater control over production volumes \u2013 intensively managing resources should mean there is greater control over the rate of reproduction and therefore production rates, subject to biological parameters of the species concerned and ethical considerations (e.g., not \u2018overbreeding\u2019).

Sustainable farmland, healthy forests, clean water and abundant habitat stand to become more valuable as the global population climbs to 9 billion by 2050. Already, pioneering investors have put together financial solutions that combine real assets, like tropical forests, with cash flows from operations in fields such as sustainable timber, agriculture and ecotourism. Conservation finance, as this field is called, represents an undeveloped, but emerging private sector invest- ment opportunity of major proportion. Today, about $52 billion per year flows to conservation projects, the bulk of it in public and philanthropic funds. The best estimates are that $300 to $400 billion per year is needed to preserve healthy ecosystems on land and in the oceans, and with them the earth\u2019s natural capital stock of clean air, fresh water and species diversity. Filling this gap to finance the preservation of the world\u2019s precious ecosystems will require $200 billion to $300 billion in additional capital, and private investment capital may be the main source of additional capital. Attracting such a level of private capital will require attractive risk-adjusted rates of return, in addition to clear and measurable conser- vation impacts. In the current environment, investors are looking for an edge to drive excess returns. Increasingly, they are seeing conservation impact investing as a way to achieve substantial environmental and social impact alongside market-rate financial returns. The growth of the conservation finance market is opening the way for banks to pool risk across geographies and asset types, which corresponds neatly with our core expertise of aligning capital with attractive and sustainable investment opportunities.

Over time, con- servation investments will be considered as traditional fixed-income, venture capital or alternative investments, which can easily fit in the portfolios of institutional, high-net-worth and even retail investors interested in large-scale, high- impact ecosystem conservation. In this report, we propose a toolkit with a number of scalable, repeatable and investable ideas for substantially growing investment into the conservation sector. Implementing these will require a strong collaboration between the financial and environmental communities on new and creative ways to solve the financial structuring and conservation challenges at hand. The continuing disappearance of Earth\u2019s last healthy ecosystems is sadly no longer news. What is news is that saving these ecosystems is not only affordable, but profitable. Nature must not be turned into a commodity, but rather into an asset treasured by the mainstream investment market.

As in our prior report (Credit Suisse, WWF, and McKinsey, 2014), we understand conservation finance as a mechanism through which an indirect or a direct financial investment is made to conserve the values of an ecosystem for the long term. In this report, we focus on investment mechanisms that activate one or more cash flows generated by the sustainable management of an ecosystem, which in part remain within the ecosystem to enable its conservation, and in part are returned to investors. The report emphasizes the need to match existing conserva- tion finance project strategies with appropriate financial vehi- cles and available investable funds with the long-term intent of creating a conservation finance asset class. While important for conservation, this report does not focus on related topics such as the improvement of industry supply chains (unless directly related to conservation, such as agriculture and fish- ing), commodity finance, or carbon/climate finance. Furthermore, the report does not take a normative approach to the question of what conservation finance is or should be. Its approach is based on mainstream definitions such as those provided by the Global Canopy Programme (2012) and WWF (2009). This report is primarily targeted at mainstream investors \u2013 that is, institutional investors, (U)HNWI, and retail investors \u2013 who are interested in learning more about investment structures that provide a market-rate return and a positive conservation impact. The report should also help conservation project devel- opers better understand the possible funding options provided to them by the private investment sector. It is targeted at those who are willing to take the plunge into the \u201cfinancialization\u201d of conservation finance projects in order to try to tap into those deeper capital pools. Executive summary In our last report, published almost two years ago, we focused on introducing an investor\u2019s perspective to the conservation finance field. We highlighted the unmet demand for conserva- tion funding, accessible cash flows, and the investment capital that would be available on a large scale. Since then, the field has developed rapidly and grown in depth (e.g., new struc- tures, technologies, and players have entered the space) and breadth (e.g., more sizeable products are being launched). This report reflects these recent developments and expands on some of the key themes of the last report. Over four chapters, we (1) re-emphasize the importance of financial vehicles as a bridge between project funding needs and investor interests; (2) argue that developing recent changes to the relevant enabling conditions may accelerate a further market uptake; (3) build a deeper understanding of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0fd6e40-f57b-4496-8aeb-f377bd385802": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0fd6e40-f57b-4496-8aeb-f377bd385802", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Conservation finance : from niche to mainstream", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b759994f562c6d3204e7b1fb27ba61258cf65345ec02a7c46ea324ce6115976"}}, "hash": "9b759994f562c6d3204e7b1fb27ba61258cf65345ec02a7c46ea324ce6115976", "text": "the challenges to this growth and possible related solutions, based on our findings from an NGO workshop and a series of investor interviews; and (4) identify three paradigm shifts along the project matu- rity lifecycle that could unleash the next period of growth in the conservation finance field. We find that three paradigm shifts will be essential to overcom- ing some of the key market barriers and enable faster growth. These shifts are: \u0191 Incubating \u2013 moving from idiosyncratic and disaggregated early-stage testing efforts to a business curation approach that brings together business, conservation, and techni- cal know-how and provides the necessary infrastructure and engagement to rapidly prototype and test promising new ideas with scale-up potential. This approach addres- ses how to move from a concept to a commercial busi- ness model. \u0191 Scaling \u2013 moving from ad hoc attempts to scale proven projects along a standardized and mainstream scaling approach, including \u2013 where necessary and available \u2013 risk mitigation levers. This phase emphasizes steps that can be taken to remove barriers to scale. \u0191 Mainstreaming \u2013 moving from tested, medium-scale project implementation models to large-scale and established con- servation finance products that are attractive to the main- stream investment market. This phase focuses on putting together financial products that have already overcome the scaling barriers, with an emphasis on aggregation. We expect these paradigm shifts to provide a major boost in reaching the total estimated conservation finance investment potential of USD 200 - 400 billion (see Chapter 1 for details). We have identified a number of conditions in the enabling environment that should help spur the ambitious growth trajec- tory that we have set out (see Chapter 2): a continuing low- yield environment with large amounts of available capital for mainstream conservation investment products with adequate risk-return profiles; new technologies and tools that allow bet- ter tracking of the environmental impact (in particular of inno- vative incubator projects); a growing pipeline of in-the-money projects that are ready for scaling; and an investment market with rapidly growing impact and many new deal structures applicable in the conservation context. The paradigm shifts will also impact persistent barriers to fur- ther growth in the conservation finance market (see Chapter 3): high search and transaction costs are addressed through a standardized approach that aims to identify projects suitable for investment, mitigate any addressable risks, and apply proven scaling strategies. Projects are scaled by using two system- atic scaling strategies: replication and structuring. Ultimately, we believe that these paradigm shifts will under- score the need for NGOs and/or project developers, public stakeholders (e.g., DFIs, scientists) and private actors (e.g., foundations) as well as the investment community to bring their respective strengths and expertise to the table and collaborate more closely. Truly sustainable market growth that also delivers measurable conservation benefits should be in the interest of all. Finally, in Chapter 4, we propose a few product structures that we believe could have a long-needed catalyzing impact on the broader conservation investment market. 7 8 Conservation finance: linking conservation projects with investor expectations In our last report (Credit Suisse, WWF, and McKinsey, 2014), we focused on analyzing the supply side (i.e., the investor perspective) in conservation finance with the aim of linking it to the perspective of conservation project developers. To help establish conservation finance as an asset class,1 we then proposed to structure investment opportunities along three simple modules: (i) direct investment in underlying ecosys- tems; (ii) investment in establishing and maintaining the infra- structure of and business models focused on these ecosys- tems; and (iii) investment in additional mechanisms centered on environmental markets or regulatory arbitrage. Since the publication of our last report, substantial research has been published that enhances the common knowledge in the field. For example, NatureVest and EKO Asset Management (now Encourage Capital) published the results of a landmark conservation investor survey that put investment of the sur- veyed investors in the period from 2009 to 2013 at USD 21.5 billion, with significant growth potential over the next five years (NatureVest/EKO, 2014). However, the literature to date has provided less understanding of how conservation finance vehicles should be structured in order to make them investable on a large scale and accessible to more investors, which would accelerate their market growth. The objective of this report is to identify product structures that have the potential to establish conservation finance in main- stream investment markets. For this purpose, we thoroughly analyzed both sides of the conservation finance equation: on the one hand, typical conservation and restoration projects, their cash flow patterns, associated risks, and, more generally, their operational characteristics.

To test our assumptions about project and investor needs, we reviewed available literature on conservation finance and related fields such as impact investing or, more broadly, infra- structure finance. We also held an NGO ideation workshop (see box on p. 14) and conducted a series of global interviews with institutional and high-net-worth investors as well as prod- uct experts covering these investor segments. Conservation finance market \u2013 key characteristics and investment potential 1 Without taking sides in the broader debate of whether impact investing \u2013 or a submarket like conservation finance \u2013 constitutes a new asset class on its own or spans traditional asset classes, in this report we follow the argumentation provided by JP Morgan (2010). As such, the identifying characteristics of an asset class include the demand for professionals with a unique set of investment/risk management skills; structures on the buy side that are organized around and allocate capital to these skilled professionals; industry organizations and networks dedicated to the investment class; and the adoption by the investment community of metrics, benchmarks, and ratings that standardize performance and risk measurement. One of the biggest barriers for further conservation market growth is a philosophical one. Many environmental interest groups fear the perceived \u201ccommodification\u201d that comes with translating conservation projects into financial terms. At root, many players are just not really comfortable with the idea of taking elegant, bespoke projects and reducing them to fungi- ble cash flows and products. These types of players are much more interested in solutions that personalize financing and connect money to projects with a \u201cface\u201d. While new technology is certainly enabling the growth of these kinds of financing markets (e.g., peer to peer or crowd sourcing), the capital accessible through those channels is simply not enough to address the conservation challenges and opportunities con- fronting us. Financial products are bridging project funding needs and investor interests in the conservation space. Our starting hypothesis was that a concerted, systematic effort focused on structuring investment products that provide a conservation and financial bottom line would be the best way to overcome the current gap between conservation project funding require- ments and the capital available to cover these needs. Figure 1 illustrates this vital link between the project (demand) and investor (supply) sides. On the one hand, there are proj- ect developers \u2013 most often NGOs \u2013 that have different financing demands (e.g., large up-front investment required to acquire land or working capital demand to buy seeds or machines) and require capital to be able to generate or aug- ment cash flows. Such cash flows can be generated, for example, by investment in the restoration of large landscapes, watershed protection, or ecotourism. More and more investors, on the other hand, seek new oppor- tunities to invest their capital in a way that generates both a market-rate financial return and a nonfinancial impact (i.e., environmental and/or social). A recent survey by Credit Suisse and Campden Wealth Research (2015) in Asia-Pacific showed that impact investing products are already considered to be a separate asset class by more than two-thirds of the investors surveyed. However, it is important to understand that these investors have certain expectations tied to their investments (e.g., return, risk, impact). They require more precise quantifi- cation of the risk-return characteristics of the investment vehicles. CHAPTER 1 9 2 One example would be the Luxembourg-based Althelia Climate Fund, an impact investing vehicle dedicated to capturing financial value that arises from investments in land use, forestry, and agriculture, applying best-in-class social and environmental governance. This eight-year, closed-end fund targets competitive returns through the production, distribution, and sale of certified soft commodities (e.g., FSC timber, cocoa, coffee) as well as undervalued environmental assets (e.g., carbon emission reductions). 3 One example would be the series of recent District of Columbia bonds, the proceeds of which were used to improve water quality and provide flood mitigation and waterway restoration around Washington, DC. 4 Qualified or accredited investors \u2013 the term varies between countries \u2013 are investors who are financially sophisticated and have a reduced need for the protection provided by certain government filings. Currently, the predominant financial vehicles found in the conser- vation finance market are debt and equity funds, the simple use of proceeds bonds and notes. Notably, debt and equity funds are prevalent since they enable project and cash flow aggregation into one common financial vehicle.2 Furthermore, funds typically allow for risk diversification,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b8d326c-75a8-4cc8-988f-2f168c790004": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b8d326c-75a8-4cc8-988f-2f168c790004", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Conservation finance : from niche to mainstream", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19cfd162d605a7e26470e9e1dbf236f8c256d7ab17954522af47c044fb8b9a4f"}, "3": {"node_id": "67dbf926-fb10-4943-87b2-72504e7cfe1b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "411c9a0e777c7e0bc189ec5ea28f958fd0451df1fb99869da3fe605a3ddc1e7c"}}, "hash": "47990d31f2543676ea2189cf0f7805825bc3c58ae152815709d3f5684462ec68", "text": "and mainstream investors are well acquainted and comfortable with their structure. Bonds usually require larger deals (i.e., USD 100 million and above) due to high marketing and underwriting costs and may depend on the issuer3 having a strong credit rating. While the historical funds and bonds in the conservation finance field have been targeted more at qualified investors4, certain types of notes (e.g., promissory or structured notes) have also been made accessible and affordable to retail inves- tors due to the much lower required minimum investment sizes (e.g., The Nature Conservancy\u2019s Conservation Notes). Notes are comparable to other fixed-income products that mainly support a diversified project portfolio of non-profit organiza- tions or loan funds, and typically offer investors a fixed financial return. In addition, direct investments \u2013 through either debt or equity \u2013 are also feasible for finance conservation projects, in which case the investor funds a single or a set of conservation pro- jects directly without any intermediary financial structure. Unless the investor is open to co-investments, such direct investments do not offer participation by the broader invest- ment market and are thus not further considered in this report.

Global baseline data is limited and fragmented, and there is no established methodology for aggregating the investment potential of the various submar- kets that make up the entire conservation finance market. For the purposes of our report, we have developed a working estimate of the total capital expected to be invested in the global conservation finance market by 2020. Our calculations were built on the current and expected market sizes of the most mature submarkets such as sustainable forestry, sustainable agriculture, and ecotourism. The underlying data for these submarkets was taken from Ecosystem Marketplace (2013), the leading source on markets and payments for ecosystem services. In a next step, the investment potential was derived based on typical capital turnover ratios in the forestry, agri culture, and tourism industries. Assuming these numbers and assumptions are accurate, we calculate a total investment potential of USD 200 - 400 billion in the conservation market between now and 2020. In comparison, total bankable assets in 2014 of retail, (U)HNW, and institu- tional investors amounted to approximately USD 175 trillion. As indicated in Figure 3, we assume that the vast majority of this investment potential could be seized through proven proj- ect types and business models (e.g., in sustainable forestry, agriculture, or ecotourism) for financial instruments with a comparatively low risk (i.e., mature equity and debt).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67dbf926-fb10-4943-87b2-72504e7cfe1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "67dbf926-fb10-4943-87b2-72504e7cfe1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Conservation finance : from niche to mainstream", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19cfd162d605a7e26470e9e1dbf236f8c256d7ab17954522af47c044fb8b9a4f"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b8d326c-75a8-4cc8-988f-2f168c790004", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47990d31f2543676ea2189cf0f7805825bc3c58ae152815709d3f5684462ec68"}}, "hash": "411c9a0e777c7e0bc189ec5ea28f958fd0451df1fb99869da3fe605a3ddc1e7c", "text": "10 Figure 3: Estimated total invested capital in conservation finance5 Project stage Early stage, proven concept Mature Early stage, new concept Financial instruments by risk appetite Mature debt and equity Venture capital", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b21165e2-a59a-4da0-907f-cf8f4efd23b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b21165e2-a59a-4da0-907f-cf8f4efd23b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Conservation finance : from niche to mainstream", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "876a26a8319eb2875a624b8158841ec99e87997f5df554e0577dc26769e36a70"}, "3": {"node_id": "10633043-640e-4ad4-bf0f-7e210e556312", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "885fc438400fa9da9f2c64de79fa172c5f1c12a657a3d8673a0d47b17b8596ba"}}, "hash": "49e853cc8c38eb9d005df098ab63ef7d492803f0f9572754fe34636faf047181", "text": "Concessionary capital and operational support 0 - 10 30 - 60 130 - 210 0 - 10 10 - 30 20 - 40 5 - 10 10 - 20 < 5 USD bn 5 These estimates are based on asset class splits in impact investing (GIIN, 2015), our evaluation of the maturity of conservation areas listed in the most recent market survey (NatureVest/EKO, 2014), and market data provided by Ecosystem Marketplace (2013). 11 12 New opportunities emerging in conservation finance Over the last few years, we have witnessed a number of significant developments impacting the stages of the invest- ment cycle from initialization to commercialization of conserva- tion finance activities. In our view, there are five critical disrup- tions that positively impact the enabling environment for con- servation finance and that will help foster the supply of investment capital. First, the current low-interest environment is likely here to stay, at least in the medium term. Investors \u2013 in particular institu- tional investors \u2013 are searching for a positive yield at this point. They welcome any new opportunities with reasonable risk- return profiles and no or little correlation to traditional equity markets. Conservation assets have generally exhibited lower correlation to other asset classes, since natural resources, such as forests or fresh water, are usually independent from macroeconomic developments, such as inflation. In this regard, conservation investments in the current environment offer comparatively attractive financial returns and at the same time allow for diversification into traditional stock or bond portfolios. Second, the global impact investing market is scaling at dou- ble-digit rates as investors have become more comfortable with its products. Increasingly, investors also target environ- mental conservation within their impact investing activities (GIIN, 2015). The conservation investment market, as a sub- sector of impact investing, has been growing faster than the broader impact market, albeit from a low starting position. Over the last decade, private investment in conservation has more than doubled, with sustainable forestry and agriculture invest- ments as main drivers of growth (NatureVest/EKO, 2014). In line with our previous research (Credit Suisse, WWF, and McKinsey, 2014), the more recent investor survey has shown that wealth-preservation and return-seeking structures in par- ticular have attracted mainstream investors. Third, new types of collaboration are emerging between inves- tors, NGOs/project developers, and public entities, which have enabled the blending of nonconcessionary and concessionary capital.6 Conservation projects hold promise for private and institutional investors who want to diversify their portfolios. Yet, many investors have held back from investing in the field because they do not see the risk-return relationship as attrac- tive. While still underutilized, public and philanthropic investors recently started using their resources to create more favorable conditions for the private sector to get engaged (Leytes, 2015). Such catalytic credit enhancement tools, such as first- loss capital, can encourage the flow of capital from investors to conservation projects by improving their risk-return profiles. Fourth, a pipeline of \u201cvalue projects\u201d is increasingly available in the conservation space, thanks to a focus on the performance and effectiveness of conservation outcomes in value chains. Underlying subsectors, such as sustainable agriculture, eco- tourism, or sustainable seafood, outgrow the traditional non- conservation segments of their markets. For instance, the market for FSC-certified forest products alone is expected to quadruple over the next five years to more than USD 200 bil- lion (Ecosystem Marketplace, 2013). Furthermore, certified agricultural products, as well as sustainably branded seafood product markets, are scaling quickly, reflecting the growing pipeline of profitable projects to be invested in. And fifth, the landmark 2015 Paris agreement on climate change between 196 UN member states has emphasised the importance of CO2 sinks. The agreement rekindles the inter- est in forest protection, afforestation and better soil manage- ment \u201crecognizing the importance of the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of the greenhouse gases\u201d. It clearly calls for addressing \u201csources and removals by sinks\u201d as equally important levers available to combat climate change. This agenda is highly congruent with the conservation agenda outlined in this report. Whilst no compensation mechanism has been defined yet it is seen by many as a long term source of additional funding. There is also an emergence of \u201cseal of approval\u201d standards, such as the IUCN Green List, designed to address investor and beneficiaries\u2019 needs for transparency in demonstrating impact in conservation projects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10633043-640e-4ad4-bf0f-7e210e556312": {"__data__": {"id_": "10633043-640e-4ad4-bf0f-7e210e556312", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Conservation finance : from niche to mainstream", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "876a26a8319eb2875a624b8158841ec99e87997f5df554e0577dc26769e36a70"}, "2": {"node_id": "b21165e2-a59a-4da0-907f-cf8f4efd23b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49e853cc8c38eb9d005df098ab63ef7d492803f0f9572754fe34636faf047181"}}, "hash": "885fc438400fa9da9f2c64de79fa172c5f1c12a657a3d8673a0d47b17b8596ba", "text": "New technologies and tools enable better and more affordable monitoring of the performance and impact of conservation projects.

The images gained with Google Trekker should help scientists better assess the quality of a particular area\u2019s fish habitat or better quantify waterway damage. Through the use of such technologies, the transparency and measurability of the impact of conservation efforts is likely to increase dramatically, which in turn enhances the credibility of the conservation market with regard to both the impact of an investment as well as the stability of the cash flows generated by the underlying projects. CHAPTER 2 6 As one example, USAID has provided a loan guarantee to the Althelia Climate Fund, covering 50% of potential losses at investment/portfolio level. 13 The challenges to conservation finance market growth The continuous growth of the conservation finance market illustrates that attempts to monetize environmental externalities are slowly coming to fruition. Yet, some obstacles remain that could \u2013 if removed \u2013 unleash even faster market growth. The challenges pertinent to conservation finance are not typically experienced by classic investments. Also, since it is a relatively heterogeneous field, only some of the challenges listed below apply to a particular project or related financial structure, while others may not in the specific context. As we have extensively covered these challenges in our last report, this section will primarily focus on highlighting relevant new aspects. Based on our market review, five barriers on the project side stand out as affecting accelerated growth of the conservation finance market. These are: \u0191 High search costs \u2013 while conservation projects with good risk-return profiles exist, they are not easily identified by project developers and/or investors. The main reason for this is that there is no standardized process for tracking and evaluating investable opportunities. Solid, well-grounded project development takes time, yet, currently, conservation financing is rarely integral to the concept and design of the best examples initiated. As such, many project developers base their search for cash-flow-generating activities on a portfolio of historical projects. Instead, they could apply a rigorous and standardized identification and evaluation pro- cess based on predefined impact and investability criteria. Equally, investors tend to stick to their guns and apply rela- tively narrow investability criteria, thereby missing possible opportunities to structure and develop vehicles with more adequate risk-return profiles. \u0191 Lack of track record of developers and projects \u2013 few pro- ject developers have a track record in developing cash-flow- generating conservation projects. Also, they usually lack experience in setting up venture-stage businesses, certainly at the scale usually required for investment products. Project feasibility studies or proof of concepts are often lacking, and do not fully ensure that adequate social and environmental safeguards are observed. These issues com- bined impede the matching of project funding needs with experienced investment capital. \u0191 Collateral \u2013 collateral can reduce financing costs significant- ly and lower the financial risk for investors. Often, however, what could serve as collateral has not, or not properly, been established (e.g., land rights in developing countries). In addition, project developers have not been trained \u2013 nor would it be the most efficient use of their expertise \u2013 to think about what could be used as a potential collateral for the investments (e.g., monetizable cash flows). They there- fore miss an important opportunity to reduce risk. In the absence of adequate collateral, many small organizations or project developers do not have the required balance sheet or rating to get the significant amounts of debt needed to fund larger conservation finance projects. \u0191 Scalability/replicability \u2013 scalability is one of the key con- cerns in growing the conservation finance market. At this stage, only a few projects are scalable beyond a USD 5 million threshold. Often, the challenge to scaling is opera- tional: training a few hundred local farmers can be managed through local intermediaries, but training thousands is usu- ally beyond the capacity of those intermediaries. Consequently, the average project size remains small. This results in high transaction costs driven by a larger number of heterogeneous transactions that need to be bundled to reach scale. \u0191 Monitoring \u2013 a final barrier worth mentioning is the lack of tested and agreed upon standardized frameworks for moni- toring conservation impact. This is essential to ensure that financing is not being directed at programs that yield little or no conservation benefits. In addition to the bottlenecks on the project side, we have also observed some challenges on the financial structuring/inves- tor side: \u0191 Predictability of underlying cash flow sources \u2013 while eco- system service markets, most notably the carbon markets, have matured significantly in recent years, they remain volatile given their comparatively small sizes. The lack of price predictability generally hampers", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "334fd460-1df7-48df-bd0f-d83ec58eb492": {"__data__": {"id_": "334fd460-1df7-48df-bd0f-d83ec58eb492", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Conservation finance : from niche to mainstream", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8ea59a9fc640e53bcb23f4de54a70dd78092a99dfcc4d495040f4e2a24288af"}}, "hash": "c8ea59a9fc640e53bcb23f4de54a70dd78092a99dfcc4d495040f4e2a24288af", "text": "investment in what are often long-term conservation projects with corresponding lock-in periods. \u0191 Capacity \u2013 finding the right inestable conservation project requires a wide variety of skills usually not found in one organization. While NGOs know how to evaluate environ- mental impact, product developers and investors have ample experience in assessing the investability of particular assets, neither is typically experienced in evaluating how to assess and balance risk, return, and impact. \u0191 Lack of cash flow aggregators \u2013 few conservation projects today are big enough to be structured as marketable stand- alone investment products. Thus, aggregating distinct but complementary projects with potentially different structures is required. These aggregators need to be able to bundle a diverse set of cash flows (illustrated in Figure 4) and mold them into a single investment product. CHAPTER 3 14 Figure 4: Typical cash flow patterns to be aggregated by a conservation finance vehicle Type Invest up front, manage, and sell Invest up front and generate recurring returns Invest gradually and build returns Invest continually and generate recurring returns Examples Buy degraded farmland, restore, and sell Buy shrimp farms, convert to sustainable operations, capture returns Help fishermen fish sustainably (net size change, etc.) and capture part of incremental returns Invest in upstream watershed protection and receive payment from downstream water users Cash flow pattern Investment Benefit In order to better understand the requirements and constraints from a project development point of view, we invited participants from 15 NGOs \u2013 most of them with global operations \u2013 to a virtual workshop. The specific workshop objec- tive was to discuss the financing needs and challenges they deal with individually in implementing conservation finance projects. The following common themes emerged from the rich discussion at the workshop: 1. Blended capital structures can address the heterogeneity of investor expectations regarding risk, return, and impact, as well as lower the overall financing costs, thereby increasing the impact of conservation-focused capital. 2. Some emerging players in the conservation finance space are bringing a rigorous investment and project develop- ment mindset to the field, which demonstrates that conservation impact and financial return can go hand in hand. 3. Scalability and replicability are top of mind for several NGOs. New methods are emerging to operationally scale above a USD 3 - 5 million barrier by leveraging local banks or cooperatives or regional/national conservation trust funds as intermediaries. Some project developers are starting to think from the outset about how their projects should be designed so they can be replicated and scaled. 4. Substantial transaction costs accrue even for relatively small investment amounts, which can sometimes be financed through grants provided by private foundations or development finance institutions. Replication and scaling is another strategy to address high transaction costs. 5. By clarifying what can be used as collateral, several projects could massively reduce their financing costs. Addressing underlying challenges like unclear land rights or the access to marine resources could help solve the problem. 6. Transparency about how the benefits of the projects are split between the investors and the other stakeholders can attract impact-oriented investors. While investor requirements differ, some investors will require detailed nonfinancial impact reporting. Six key takeaways from an NGO workshop 15 The next quantum leap \u2013 pathway to establishing conservation as an asset class The challenges of growing the conservation finance market to an institutional scale are surmountable. To overcome these challenges, we consider that some paradigm shifts are essen- tial in different project stages along the market cycle, namely: \u0191 Incubating \u2013 moving from idiosyncratic and disaggregated early-stage testing efforts to a business curation approach that brings together business, conservation, and technical know-how and provides the necessary infrastructure and engagement to rapidly prototype and test promising new ideas with scale-up potential \u0191 Scaling \u2013 moving from ad hoc attempts to scale proven projects along a standardized and mainstream scaling approach, including \u2013 where necessary and available \u2013 risk mitigation levers \u0191 Mainstreaming \u2013 moving from tested medium-scale project implementation models to large-scale and established con- servation finance products that are attractive to the main- stream investment market Promising early-stage projects are often hindered by a lack of established cash flows, missing collateral, and limited financial knowledge or access by the project developers. Overcoming these challenges is the classic strength of an incubator process. Private and public foundations have been playing quite actively in the incubation space, nurturing innovation with specific projects. With a more sectoral approach, foundations such as the ones that have a conservation focus and NGOs would be the natural facilitators for such incubator projects. Where feasible, they should join forces with investors and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e75c52b3-cebc-45a6-9f33-109343ccc3b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e75c52b3-cebc-45a6-9f33-109343ccc3b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Conservation finance : from niche to mainstream", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cae79780150d82a2e36aa1779f25361a84c0410ea0d6f654b1fbada56fb8775a"}, "3": {"node_id": "378b0dc5-bef7-4fe8-b974-2767eb468bd1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ece657c8a1577922d2ae2f412ed2297be15f1e4088ddbd252f16bd11230b4ec7"}}, "hash": "164ecd3551d80e1186bbcbb7c28569c3569d031a53521872931e88914c3dc843", "text": "other interested stakeholders in setting up such a venture. The incubator could provide conservation start-ups with the infrastructure, knowledge, and access to financing necessary to develop their ideas to a proven-concept stage. In this early phase, the project proponents should try to team up with risk-prone investors to allow for risk sharing among actors with differing degrees of risk appetite, return targets, and impact expectations. Based on a market review, plenty of potential ideas exist to be tested in such incubators, such as: \u0191 Substitutes fund \u2013 venture capital fund focused on substitu- tes to products that have a detrimental impact on the con- servation and preservation of nature (e.g., investing in the research and development of substitutes to meat, palm oil, diamonds or rhino horns). \u0191 Marine protected area bond \u2013 bond that establishes a port- folio of privately managed marine protected areas (MPAs) based on the strategy of scientific scoping, lobbying, and consensus building with affected stakeholders. Financial benefits are generated through concessions over future cash flows generated by the MPAs (e.g., license fees, (blue) carbon credits, and mitigation banking). \u0191 Conservation impact bond \u2013 also known as an environmen- tal impact bond, this bond is analogous to a social impact bond, a pay-for-performance contract in which a govern- ment typically pays for the achievement of a cost saving conservation outcome (e.g., storm water reduction or forest fire suppression). A developer implements a project (e.g., removal of impervious structures) with a third party that is financing the project and taking on the project risk/econo- mics. Conservation impact bonds are usually complex and therefore costly to structure, lack a harmonized conservati- on impact measure, but are potentially impactful. \u0191 Insurance payments for risk mitigation \u2013 conservation- focused insurance products (e.g., a flood mitigation bond) could be disruptive by linking project finance, conservation objectives, and insurance mechanisms. For example, a sea wall with conservation benefits could be built through an up front investment by an insurance company that values the lower flooding risk for adjacent properties and reduced disaster payments in the future. Given the limited market potential in the short to medium term, developing a full incubator approach has not been the focus of this report. Yet, we hope that these initial ideas will provide others with a starting point to guide their project development and financing efforts. A comprehensive mapping exercise of the available pipeline of incubator projects would help support the pathway to growing this early stage of the market and further steer the discussion. Moreover, each of the three para- digm shifts requires different partners and roles, and these will require a separate, thorough analysis. CHAPTER 4 Incubating what comes next \u2013 growing early-stage projects in the conservation product pipeline 16 While many organizations and project developers are experiment- ing with new conservation finance concepts, few have applied the rigorous tools from the investment world to this area. We believe that there is a real opportunity to professionalize the execution of conservation finance transactions, thereby over- coming key existing barriers, such as scaling, risk, and search costs. Growing high-potential ideas \u2013 strategies for scaling conservation finance Conservation finance could benefit tremendously from a more systematized and strategic approach to scaling and replicating projects that addresses the issue of high transaction and struc- turing costs. Two approaches show particular promise: \u0191 Replicating and expanding an established and homogenous project type and financing it through plain equity and/or debt vehicles. For instance, applying the same project management approach to setting up and improving the performance of marine-protected areas and financing them through user fees could be used in a number of geogra- phies/jurisdictions around the world. The first suite of MPAs would provide a proof of concept and a track record to support the financing case for the areas to be set up sub- sequently. This scaling model would work best for project types that operate in a similar regulatory and political envi- ronment and do not require a large degree of tailoring to local circumstances. \u0191 Structuring multiple heterogeneous projects and bundling them into a single product with a tailored risk and return sharing vehicle.

Identifying, deciphering, quantifying, and \u2013 where possible \u2013 mitigating the risks involved in conserva- tion projects will make investors much more comfortable with the emerging asset class. Notably, some investors in the space are at least as concerned with having any relevant risks in connection with an investment properly identified rather than having all of them eliminated or substantially mitigated. The solution here has to be about trans- parency, reporting, and monitoring of risks and impacts. The risk mitigation concern, however, can be addressed effec- tively by designing a financial product with built-in risk mitigation. Utilizing the right set of risk mitigation strategies adapted to the specific context will reduce default rates and, consequently, the financing costs of conservation investment products. We illus- trate the most prevalent risk mitigation strategies and their impact in Figure 6. An important topic for further analysis will be how risk mitigation strategies can be mapped against investor preferences. We believe that if the above considerations are seriously taken into account, they could have a substantial effect on conserva- tion finance transaction volumes. The availability and effectiveness of these strategies is context- specific. More mature conservation markets, such as sustain- able forestry or sustainable agriculture, usually have a wider array of risk mitigation tools available. It is, however, important to note that the availability of strategies is fairly equal for projects within the same conservation sectors (e.g., agriculture vs. fish- eries). It is further worth noting that there are complementary interven- tions in the regulatory/governance environment that can change the risk mitigation potential for these sectors (e.g., introduction of rights-based management in fisheries changes what you are able to do). In order to assess the risk mitigation potential of different con- servation sectors, we have illustrated available strategies for each conservation area in Figure 7. Check marks indicate the availability of a strategy for the respective conservation focus. For example, sustainable forestry lends itself to almost all risk mitigation strategies: technical and operation assistance could sometimes be utilized in settings where a wider community of land owners or users is involved. Since sustainable forestry projects typically acquire land or usage rights that can be used as collateral, this strategy is avail- able as well.

Areas such as sustainable forestry, agriculture, or fisheries- related activities offer sustainable cash flows and a compara- tively bigger number of available risk mitigation techniques, which will make investments in these areas \u2013 other things being equal \u2013 more attractive to the mainstream investor. The above-listed risk mitigation strategies are not exhaustive. Depending on the context, other strategies could also be suc- cessfully applied (e.g., peer-to-peer lending, such as Kiva, as a source of concessionary capital to lower the default risk for other investment tranches, traditional portfolio diversification, or secu- ritization techniques applied to the conservation context). Minimize transaction costs through standardized pro- cesses for investments High transaction and structuring costs were one of the most frequently cited concerns at the NGO workshop described above. These costs relate to activities such as scaling the inter- ventions and generally monitoring the impact. While some of the cost issues can be resolved through technical assistance facili- ties and grant funding, it will be impossible to fully address this structural barrier in a nascent field. We therefore believe that a standardized project evaluation process would go a long way to improve the situation. Projects that are extremely challenging or commercially unfeasible could be eliminated up front, thereby drastically reducing transaction costs. In order to provide such a standardized framework to evaluate the wider investment potential of a particular project, we devel- oped a project investability funnel.8 The funnel looks at evalu- ation criteria in four areas, which we consider relevant from an investor perspective to holistically assess the investment prospects of a particular conservation project: (i) targeted market, (ii) project characteristics, (iii) project financials, and (iv) project management. A funnel such as that illustrated in Figure 8 could provide a methodology to quickly screen a large number of project ideas in different development stages, and support to identify the ones that warrant further investigation as investible projects. 8 The funnel intentionally focuses on investment criteria and touches conservation impacts only tangentially. A similar funnel is being developed by the IUCN to evaluate and assess projects from a conservation impact perspective.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4620e04-96ad-40f5-b344-07998217f60a": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4620e04-96ad-40f5-b344-07998217f60a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Conservation finance : from niche to mainstream", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe0df3c4313077492135b8d8d883a0fb9855ee7ea874cfb42e642abb1b2d0732"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6e74c1f-a747-4bbb-af3c-a32c51c743a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ed415beaf2f52883d940db0c7d21bc4788c59f44ff75cc8974bd50a163ee413"}}, "hash": "1e2b9085ed5d7222df83bca88332e041811e25b7aee8ebc88c8589a86017ae7c", "text": "19 Figure 8: Potential evaluation criteria for conservation finance investments \u25aa Regulatory framework \u2013 is a certain legal framework required and does it exist elsewhere? \u25aa Growth \u2013 is the market growing and can it absorb rapid", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "233a21e4-452a-4301-9a21-a9060a076b72": {"__data__": {"id_": "233a21e4-452a-4301-9a21-a9060a076b72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Conservation finance : from niche to mainstream", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "405bc7c5692b43c5e6e6ea8f4e6e6b1ba811b7f42a487aa13501628d8e03d07b"}}, "hash": "405bc7c5692b43c5e6e6ea8f4e6e6b1ba811b7f42a487aa13501628d8e03d07b", "text": "growth of 1 project type? \u25aa Maturity \u2013 how big, trans- parent, and volatile is the market?

Evaluation criteria from investor perspective Market 1 Project 2 Financials 3 Management 4 How could such a funnel be applied? In the case of a sustain- able forestry project, for instance, the regulatory and market environment within which the project has set out to generate its cash flows would be vetted. There would have to be positive indications that the sale of sustainably harvested timber and forest carbon credits is a viable business model in the specific context (e.g., market absorption capacity of project). Also, the applicable regulatory framework would need to be stable and conducive to long-term growth. If this first step were completed successfully, the proposed proj- ect structure would be thoroughly analyzed in a second step. The possible use of risk mitigation tools in the forestry sector, which we discussed in the previous subchapter, would be considered. In addition, other project-specific criteria, such as the expected stability of the cash flows to be generated by the project, or endorsements by relevant NGOs and certifications/product labels (e.g., FSC for timber products, IUCN Green List for pro- tected areas), would be scrutinized. If the project was going to be replicated, another evaluation criterion would be dependency on local conditions that cannot be found elsewhere. Third, typical financial characteristics such as the expected finan- cial rate of return, the potential guarantees, the proposed term, and the fee structure of the forestry project would be duly consid- ered. Here, the focus should be on a commensurate risk- return- impact profile that would satisfy the targeted investor segment. Last, the management experience and capabilities of the team running the forestry project would be audited. Important features in this respect, for instance, would be managers with a track record in forestry and/or running an operation of the proposed scale as well as investment management skills. In summary, the three tools and approaches (i.e., scaling strate- gies, risk mitigation strategies, investability funnel) presented in this chapter each address a particular set of challenges. Overall, the toolkit presented in this chapter illustrates several novel approaches to meeting the challenges of scaling, risk transparency, and transaction costs. By applying these tools, it will be easier to identify projects that have growth potential quickly and effectively. This, in turn, will allow the projects to grow into proven-concept conservation investment products. To that effect, it should be further examined how best to connect the investor community with the conservation community to support the integration of the above considerations into project design. Building on the process standardization, the next part of this report focuses on how to evolve from scaled ideas into main- stream financial products. 20 Demonstrating a successful mainstream product might be the most important next step for the growth of the conservation investment field. Simple and large-scale mainstream investment products will be the catalyst for exponential growth of the con- servation finance marketplace.

Once the market is comfortable with the general notion of the field and its investability, less mature structures and conservation areas may find fertile soil to grow. Based on our expert sessions with both project developers and investors, we have identified a few examples of structures with mainstream investment potential. To arrive at at these examples, we applied three filters: the maturity of the conser- vation market targeted by the project, the scale of financing available for the relevant financial instrument, and the struc- ture of the financial vehicle. First, such mainstream products should leverage conservation markets that are sufficiently mature and have reached the scale necessary to absorb larger investment volumes. Based on avail- able market data, sustainable forestry, agriculture, and ecotour- ism stand out as possible markets that meet this threshold of maturity and scale. Second, mainstream products need to avail themselves with financing sources that are available on a large scale. A close analysis of the impact investing landscape has indicated that mature debt and equity investments are most likely to yield the volume of financing required for a mainstream product. Third, the mainstream product structure should be easy to understand, versatile, and scalable. These particular criteria seem to be met by simple bond and fund structures. Our global investment potential estimations in the first chapter underline the above assumptions by showing that the highest investment potential for mainstream products lies in the mature project/mature financing quadrant (see Figure 9). Establishing the asset class with mainstream products \u2013 building on what already works Figure 9: Investment potential is highest for mature projects with mature financing Project stage Early stage, proven concept Mature Early stage, new concept Financial instruments by risk appetite Mature debt and equity Venture capital Concessionary capital and operational support Mainstream \u25aa Replicate on bigger scale or structure bundled projects \u25aa Biggest conservation markets \u25aa Transaction costs smaller relative to size Incubate \u25aa Test new high-potential ideas \u25aa Require significant guarantees USD 160 - 280 bn Scale \u25aa Scale proven-concept projects \u25aa Quickly growing markets \u25aa Will require some guarantees/concessions to compensate for risk USD 30 - 80 bn USD 10 - 40 bn Total investment potential 21 By applying the above filters, focused on the size of the conserva- tion market, the availability of financing, and the product structure, we have identified two concrete mainstream pro duct ideas: Mature Conservation Markets Fund A closed-end USD 200 million fund with a maturity of 10 to 15 years and a return target of 10 to 15% of premiums paid that would invest in 10 to 20 projects in the most mature conservation markets, such as sustainable forestry, sustain- able agriculture, and ecotourism. With underlying projects certified by FSC, Fairtrade, and ecotourism labels, this fund would generate financial returns from the sale of sustainably harvested timber, non-timber products like cocoa and forest carbon, and other payments for ecosystem service (PES) credits in the voluntary and compliance markets. Given the premium (e.g., 15 to 25% for FSC wood from tropical forests, or 5 to 20% for certified cocoa) many of these types of proj- ects are paying (WWF, 2015; IISD, 2014), these are just smart, economically attractive business opportunities waiting for mindful capital infusions and project developers. The fee structure would mirror classic private equity investments. Ecosystem Green Bond A sovereign-issued bond covering an ecosystem at a larger scale, deemed worthy of protection, and using the proceeds to finance any conservation-related activities in this ecosystem. The protected ecosystems could be a system of terrestial national parks or marine parks. The sources of repayment would be cash-flow-generated activities by the ecosystem (e.g., user fees for access to parks). To reduce risk and pricing and increase appeal, full or partial repayment would be guaranteed by the sovereign or an international finance institution. The size of this bond would depend on the relevant ecosystem. Coupon payments would be in line with the issuer\u2019s credit rating. The successful placement of such mainstream investment products in the market could be crucial in lifting conservation finance to its next stage. We conducted several investor interviews as part of this study, mostly with large institutional investors and (U)HNWI to test our mainstream and scaling ideas. Below, we summarize the consolidated feedback of these discussions. Financial risk and even more importantly, a lack of transparency on relevant investment risks, are often of much higher importance for investors than pure return or conservation impact considerations.

Equity-like investment ideas need to demonstrate that their expected cash flow scenarios are realistic and accurately priced, based on relevant track records, tailored cash flow predictions, and disclosure of the sources of cash flows. In that respect, sustainable commodities have generally been considered as more reliable than the more volatile markets for carbon credits. For projects with financial guarantees, the credibility and nature of the guarantee were listed as the most important aspects; other considerations, like guaranteed cash flows or collateral, were considered less relevant. For institutional investors, the risk-return profile of a product outweighs any other characteristics. Low correlation with other asset classes helps ensure a diversification effect. The conservation impact of a product is generally of little importance. In establishing conservation finance as an asset class, full guarantees may have the undesirable effect that the investor focuses the most attention on the guarantee itself and does not necessarily understand how the product design and structure result in conservation impacts. Consequently, future investments without a similar guarantee become less likely. Emerging themes from investor interviews 22 Conclusion Although the conservation finance market has grown quickly over the last decade, it is still far from reaching its estimated medium-term potential of USD 200 - 400 billion. As we have outlined in this report, four central challenges are keeping the conservation finance market from growing at a faster pace: little commercial support for early-stage project ideas with scale-up potential, substantial search and trans- action costs in connection with the identification and implemen- tation of conservation projects, high perceived risk, and the lack of scalability and replicability models for existing projects. However, these challenges can be addressed. Three para- digm shifts can help accelerate the maturation of this market: \u0191 Moving from idiosyncratic and disaggregated early-stage testing efforts to an incubator approach that brings together business, conservation, and technical know-how and provides the necessary infrastructure to rapidly proto- type and test promising new ideas with scale-up potential. This step could address the lack of commercial support for early-stage ideas. Setting up an incubator would provide an opportunity for key stakeholders interested in furthering this field \u2013 investors, NGOs, foundations, and other con- servation finance actors \u2013 to bring their respective strengths to the table and collaborate in estab lishing a pipeline for the conservation finance market. \u0191 Moving from ad hoc attempts to scale proven projects towards a standardized and mainstream scaling approach, including \u2013 where necessary and available \u2013 risk mitigation levers. This approach would address the issue of high per- ceived risk through a multi-pronged risk mitigation strategy, reduce transaction costs through standardized processes, and enable the scaling of promising ideas through dedica- ted strategies. The implementation of this shift should be taken on by conservation-savvy investors who are familiar with rigorous investment approaches. \u0191 Moving from tested medium-scale project implementation to large-scale and established conservation finance products that are attractive to the mainstream investment market. This step would make conservation finance available to a much wider spectrum of investors. Mature projects and vehicles contribute to the growth of investor comfort with the field and allow other less mature projects to follow in their footsteps later on. The implementing drivers behind this shift would need to be large investors or financial institutions that have the capacity to originate deals at an institu tional scale. If the short-term objective was to massively grow the invest- ment amounts flowing into the conservation sector, interven- tions should be focused primarily on developing mainstream products. In the medium to long term, incubation and scaling efforts are equally important to ensure that a healthy pipeline of investment opportunities is maturing. This report has focused on conservation projects that gener- ate conservation-based cash flows to repay the investor. Yet, beyond this focus, other opportunities also exist with the potential to significantly increase investment volumes in con- servation. One type of structure that warrants further explora- tion involves decoupling the invested amount from the conser- vation impact it aims to support. For example, it is possible to envision a financial product in which the principal is placed in mainstream investments and it is the returns (which are gen- erated over time or monetized up front at financial closing) that are invested in conservation projects, either in whole or in part. Either way, such a structure would provide the risk capi- tal \u2013 by providing a backstop to the higher-risk conservation cash flows \u2013 to enable early-stage conservation projects, and thereby", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3601fbef-68da-41f3-b8ae-cdd9ad524a6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3601fbef-68da-41f3-b8ae-cdd9ad524a6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Conservation finance : from niche to mainstream", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-finance-niche-mainstream", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebfe0bae8fb345c562b47fb1b6147458599d7c989e90d6da826f34fbc70885c1"}}, "hash": "ebfe0bae8fb345c562b47fb1b6147458599d7c989e90d6da826f34fbc70885c1", "text": "support the further development of the conservation investment market. One way or another, in order to grow the conservation invest- ment market to scale it will be critical to develop and package investment proposals that provide a market-rate return and leverage multiple sources of finance to reduce risk and maxi- mize impact. In view of the persistent budget limitations in developed countries, these new and innovative investment solutions are required to close the financing gap that stands in the way of better management of conservation areas. 23 Acronyms and abbreviations DFI Development Finance Institution FSC Forest Stewardship Council GIIN Global Impact Investing Network IISD International Institute for Sustainable Development IUCN International Union for the Conservation of Nature MPA Marine Protected Area NGO Non-governmental organization PES Payments for Ecosystem Services (U)HNWI (Ultra-) High Net Worth Individual USAID United States Agency for International Development USD United States Dollar 24 Authors Report Steering Committee Acknowledgements Fabian Huwyler, Credit Suisse J\u00fcrg K\u00e4ppeli, McKinsey & Company John Tobin, Credit Suisse Lorenzo Bernasconi, The Rockefeller Foundation Gerard Bos, International Union for Conservation of Nature Ren\u00e9 Buholzer, Credit Suisse Aileen Lee, The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Martin Stuchtey, McKinsey Center for Business and Environment The authors and the report steering committee would like to thank several individuals and organizations for the support and expertise they offered during the writing of this report: Maria Ana Borges (IUCN), Bikram Chaudhury (Credit Suisse), Dave Chen (Equilibrium Capital), Wilson Ervin (Credit Suisse), Gustavo Fonseca (Global Environmental Facility), Vincent Gradt (AXA IM), James Hardcastle (IUCN), Frank Hawkins (IUCN), Stefan Meili (Credit Suisse), Daniel Schuster (Credit Suisse).

They play an important role in the food chain and are crucial for the maintenance of the global ecological equilibrium. Human beings also depend on oceans and coasts for their well-being and economic development. Healthy marine and coastal ecosystems are highly productive, providing a multitude of valu- able goods and services. These include food, medicine, climate regulation, coastal protection, recreational opportunities and spiritual benefits. However, marine and coastal ecosystems face a wide array of threats, mainly from humankind. Habitat loss and degra dation, overfishing, destructive fishing methods, eutrophication and pollution all deteriorate the state of oceans and coasts. In addition, these unique ecosystems are heavily impacted by climate change. A lack of regulation and enforce- ment, insufficient management and governance and limited awareness has limited effective responses to these pressures. The Blue Solutions Initiative was established by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) in 2013 and is implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), GRID-Arendal, IUCN and UNEP. Blue Solutions provides a global knowledge network and capacity development platform that brings together innovative marine and coastal management approaches and policy advice, focusing on holistic solutions for the sustainable use of these resources. SOLUTIONS \u2013 APPROACHES THAT WORK Inspiring solutions from across the globe provide multiple examples of how we can successfully overcome challenges to both sustainable marine and coastal development and human well-being. Blue Solutions exist at all levels, be it local or global, technical or managerial, and share certain features. Blue Solutions are successful approaches that\u2026 \u2026address marine and coastal challenges: They contribute to the maintenance or improvement of ecosystem health. \u2026are effective: They are applied solutions with demonstrated impact \u2026are scalable: Elements of each solution have the potential to be up-scaled and/or replicated in other contexts. 7 introduction We believe that every solution is composed of essential elements which determine success \u2013 we call them building blocks. These building blocks may be adapted and recombined to address new challenges in other socio-cultural and ecological contexts, sectors or geographies. The Blue Solutions Initiative has established building block categories according to their means of action. A glossary of all building blocks, sorted by category, can be found at the back of this publication. The Blue Solutions approach (adapted from the Resilience Exchange) The Blue Solutions Initiative identifies, distils and promotes successful solutions and their building blocks for practi- tioners, decision makers and policy makers. This supports inter-sectoral knowledge transfer and enables mutual learning across borders. Our focus lies on holistic solutions for the sustainable use of marine and coastal ecosystems, because only healthy and productive biodiversity can continue to promote human well-being for generations to come. submit solutions submit solutions filter solutions curated solutions building blocks within solution put into solution database solution database innovator adapts building blocks to create new solutions innovator shares solution connect community of practice scaled innovatios \uf084 \uf083 \uf084 \uf082 \uf082 \uf082 \uf082 \uf082 \uf083 8 9 8 SOLUTIONS EXCHANGE One of our focal areas is the provision of a global knowledge network to collate, share and generate solutions which inspire action towards effective management and equitable governance of our planet\u2019s marine and coastal living spaces. Blue Solutions uses different formats to facilitate the exchange of successful approaches. Solutions exchange can take place in face-to-face meetings or through an online platform. face-to-face solutions exchange The Blue Solutions Initiative held its first Regional Forum for Oceans, Coasts and Human Well-Being in Cebu, Philippines in 2014. The second Regional Forum took place in Canc\u00fan, Mexico in April 2015.

First sighted in Belize in 2008, the invader is known to significantly reduce native fish biomass, threat- ening the ecological integrity of Belize\u2019s world heritage-listed barrier reef. The lionfish invasion thereby undermines fishing and marine tourism industries alike, which support 15,400 livelihoods and contribute 25 per cent to Belize\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). Blue Ventures is initiating efforts to build Belize\u2019s lionfish fishery as an economic alterna- tive for fishers and tasty option for consumers. This creates economic incentives to sys- tematically remove the predator, whilst diversifying fisheries and local livelihoods within coastal communities, ultimately reducing pressure on traditionally-targeted native species. Targeted lionfish fishing is now evolving in Belize, offering ecological and economic benefits. New sources of income for fishing households, e.g. women manufacturing jewellery from discards or new dishes appearing on restaurant menus, further develop the emerging market and help suppress the lionfish population. Pablito and Aracely own the restaurant Estrella del Mar solution building a market for lionfish removal Pablito\u2019s and Aracely\u2019s restaurant \u00bbEstrella del Mar\u00ab has become a pillar in the lionfish market in Sarteneja. As a direct result of Blue Ventures\u2019 regular workshops and taster events in \u00bbEstrella del Mar\u00ab, in 2013 the keen entrepreneurial couple began serving lionfish prepared in diverse ways. Lionfish is now Pablito\u2019s most popular dish, proudly standing at the top of his menu, with the name hand-painted on his small restaurant\u2019s display. Since 2014, lionfish has been their bestselling dish.They buy 30kg of fillet per week, which is roughly 190 lionfish. Since this February, they process 45 kg of fillet \u2013 300 lionfish \u2013 per week! Fishermen have benefitted immensely from the couple\u2019s ability to consistently buy lion- fish and market it to Belizeans and tourists alike. Their reliability as a sales point is key to entrenching the lionfish fishery at the community level. A modest online presence attracts new customers: \u00bbWith tourists coming, and their growing appetite for lionfish,we may be able to send our daughter all the way through college and university,\u00ab Pablito cheers.

Emergent lionfish fishery To build a new market for the fishery, all actors across the supply chain are supported, incentiv- ising fishers to consistently target lionfish. Fishers are trained in lionfish safe-handling and first aid for stings. Buyers are linked to fishers and receive marketing support through posters and menu inserts. A social marketing campaign informs consumers and increases demand and willing- ness to pay. Value-added lionfish products Training women in coastal communities to manufacture jewellery using lion- fish spines and fins can add up to 40 per cent of value to catches, and resulting products may access international markets. Other locally processed goods (e.g. lionfish burgers, frozen fillets and animal feed) can generate new skills and alternative employment for community members.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b24da92d-a0c8-4450-a041-6c9f2a9f324f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b24da92d-a0c8-4450-a041-6c9f2a9f324f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue solutions from Latin America and the wider Caribbean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "baea6d7dfee21ebdf244d31a5e2c4e62ba4196441353e50bc4e6066cd6f7c0fa"}, "2": {"node_id": "eef8afd9-d037-43fe-b5e0-dc06022d1543", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f24138091b65106699bae1ba5aa649019993af6054a33f86e5dcf14d8897a177"}}, "hash": "17cc67534e4050f99027a157c9c790df5c229552f21a12da204e69277b847f20", "text": "Lionfish catch targets Extensive stock assessments enable development of site-specific threshold densities for lionfish con- trol activities.

Early and frequent contact with knowledgeable partners is crucial to de- sign the study, identify policy applications, collect data and communicate results to decision makers. Targeted communication Study results are strategically packaged into various mediums, e. g. pamphlets, videos, or user manuals to reach key audiences. These materials are highlighted at public events and technical or policy meetings. Participating stakeholders lead dissemination efforts, effectively communicate to decision makers and use results to negotiate new regulations. belize Training in valuation MPA stakeholders are offered multiple training opportunities for application and replication of valuation methods in their MPAs. By developing templates, compiling relevant data (e.g., on MPA uses) and revising monitoring efforts, they are able to produce economic estimates. Coastline resource use Data collection on coastline resource use involves a variety of informants, including tourism, fisheries, and forestry sec- tors; as well as spatial data. The process pulls together the best available ecological and socioeconomic data for the valuation. Valuation of reefs and mangroves Valuation focuses on those ecosystem ser- vices particularly relevant to local econo- mies that are relatively easy to measure, using largely existing information. 14 15 In Belize, coral reefs, mangroves and beaches are the cornerstone of the tourism industry. In addition, coastal commu- nities rely on mangrove and reef-based fisheries for food security and income. Tourism industry growth is viewed as inherent to economic development in Belize, but is often accompanied by habitat degradation. Land and mangrove clearance, sedimentation and pollution directly threaten the resources upon which the industry depends. The challenge faced by decision-makers is how best to move forward with tourism development whilst maintaining healthy, functional ecosystems that support the tourism industry, sustain livelihoods and provide resilience to climate change. To illuminate the trade-offs between different climate adaptation strategies, an ecosystem ser- vice and cost-benefit analysis was conducted on Placencia, an emerald peninsula that is now a major Belizean tourist destination, and its adjacent lagoon system. This analysis acknowledges coastal-marine ecosystem services, like protection from storms and sea level rise, to make better informed decisions. The analysis helped to provide strong social and economic justification for communities and stakeholders to place more emphasis on conserving and restoring the natural ecosystems. Efforts to preserve mangrove stands along the lagoon\u2019s banks came alongside endeavours to replant mangroves in cleared areas experiencing notable erosion. Some land de- velopers and shrimp farmers have also requested to donate mangrove-covered areas on their property to the proposed Placencia Lagoon protected areas system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc6843fa-27a0-4c6d-9613-fc3dbf06f7cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc6843fa-27a0-4c6d-9613-fc3dbf06f7cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue solutions from Latin America and the wider Caribbean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "50c0c66d05e809e338d00f4aa12ca993840683f08de85fba96f8d7ab983888e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8f8cc5f-6570-49d8-9ea4-3b7621a4efae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5cd090b5feb86752482204dcb4569a19f616237c4bd6d843d98fed842e9c18d4"}}, "hash": "586e16fd054fb797993f41c3366e13a3e370d407dcc3cfed445633ba4b22a6bf", "text": "In addition, increased attention was paid to the use of green vs grey infrastruc- ture to stabilise private property shorelines (particularly on the lagoon side), despite land development continuing to alter the face of the peninsula.

Coastal population density, broad-range fisheries activities and a flourishing tourism industry are driving construction of new coastal development, urban areas and ports. Despite the importance of Belize\u2019s coastal zone to the national economy and health of its citizens, an integrated plan\u2014 to ensure that existing resource uses and expanding human activities do not trigger conflicts among stakeholders or put their wellbeing at risk \u2014 has not yet been implemented. Until 2011, relevant information and tools were too widely dispersed across various institutions and ministries, hindering comprehensive coastal management planning. WWF and the Natural Capital Project supported the Belizean Coastal Zone Management Authority and Institute (CZMAI) to develop an ecosystem-based, scientifically and economically sound management plan. The result balances conserva- tion, sustainable resource use and development needs by integrating available information.This solution maps and values ecosystem services using a stakeholder participation process and elaborating alternative future scenarios. In so doing, the plan predicts and clearly visualises how, under each scenario, changes in ecosystem function will affect returns from ecosystem services. The resulting maps and conclusions are crucial decision-making tools used to inform national man- agement planning. solution valuing ecosystem services for integrated management As an expert in GIS mapping, I expect my maps to work behind the scenes,\u00ab says Gregg Verutes, WWF geographic information system analyst. \u00bbThe multi- layered depictions I construct \u2014 to illustrate the ways we use and value nature\u2014 usually inform scientists, practitioners and policy makers. They rarely feature prominently in televised efforts to secure sustainable national energy policy. But exactly that happened in Belize. A local tour guide urged me to project the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill onto Belize\u2018s map, illustrating the potential impacts of a similar disaster there. The resulting image showed how an oil spill of this magnitude would devastate the entire country. My map was then used for signs and television advocacy against offshore oil exploration, prompting over 90% of Belizeans to vote \u203ano\u2039 in a move to protect the ecosystem they depend on. So a simple map I made helped defeat a proposal to intensify offshore oil drilling. What more could a humble mapmaker ask for?\u00ab Visualising ecosystem information helps to inform management decisions \u00bb \u00a9 Natural Capital Project This solution is being implemented by the Belize Coastal Zone Management Authority and Institute (CZMAI) in collaboration with the Natural Capital Project (NatCap) and WWF Belize.

Caribbean island inhabitants have always lived in balance with nature. However, developmental pressures challenge the physical and economic security of these islands. In the current era of financial insecurity and environmental degradation it becomes clear that classical investments in a strong economy are not always contributing to a healthy environment. It is therefore key to understand how nature contributes to a small island economy and human wellbeing. Placing economic value on ecosystem services can justify funding for nature conservation and mobilise political support. Recent research on the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity (TEEB) in Bonaire drew attention to the economic benefits of biodiversity. It also highlighted the growing cost of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation by assigning economic values to Bonaire\u2019s main ecosystem services. Over 1,500 persons, including tourists, fishermen, local residents and citizens of the Netherlands, were interviewed. This data was used to estimate individual\u2019s willing- ness to pay to protect Bonaire\u2019s natural resources, as well as mechanisms (e.g. user fees) through which such payments would be transferred. A scenario analysis was conducted and used to inform decision makers about which strategies to protect the ecosystems of Bonaire would be most effective. The current total economic value (TEV) of Bonaire\u2019s ecosystem services is US$ 105 million per annum. As long as present threats are unmanaged, the TEV of Bonairean nature can decrease in just ten years to around US$ 60 million and to less than US$ 40 million in 30 years. These results are being used to raise awareness, support decision-making, develop sustainable financing mechanisms and serve as input for integrated spatial planning. Intuitively, many people were already aware of the fact that nature plays an important role,\u00ab says Pieter van Beukering, Associate Professor at VU University Amsterdam. But now that they see the real number, and they see the real importance, the urgency of doing something \u2013 more than we currently do\u2013 has increased and people have become more aware of the importance to protect our nature and improve its quality as soon as possible.\u00ab solution nature\u2019s contribution to the economy Tourists spend around US$ 125 million annu- ally on Bonaire \u00a9 Jonray 2006 On Bonaire, marine ecosystems are found to be more economically significant than terres- trial ones \u00a9 Pedro Paulo Cunha 2014 \u00bb \u00bb This solution is being implemented by Wolfs Company in collaboration with VU University Amsterdam and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of The Netherlands. building blocks Solution components for replication Communication about ecosystem service values Policy briefs, newspaper and magazine articles, radio broadcasts and documentary films can be targeted to diverse audiences.

It is also home to the biggest and most biologically diverse coral reefs in the southern Atlantic. Nearly 500,000 people are supported by these two ecosystems, yet overfishing, deforestation (for cattle farming), agriculture and human settlement make them vulnerable to climate change. Regional reefs and forests are highly sensitive in this regard. Forest fragmentation, in conjunction with increased tem- peratures, impacts already compromised water supplies. Overfishing of herbivorous species is causing macro-algae overgrowth in the Abrolhos reefs, leading to a decrease of reef resilience to climate change and a reduction in fishery productivity. This has negatively impacted both food security and marine biodiversity. To restore the Porto Seguro area, an Eco- system-based Adaptation (EbA) approach and coastal-reef connectivity strategies were developed through a participatory process. These will also reduce the vulner- ability of coastal communities and the ecosystems they use. The development of the restoration plan was based on the results of a participatory vulnerability assessment process involving stakeholders from the public and private sectors, including academia, national and state governments, NGOs, private companies, protected area management and local communities.

These alien carnivores pose a serious threat to native coral reef-associated marine life, and contribute to the decline of many commercially and ecologically important species. In addition, the invasive lionfish population could have a significant negative impact on economically important activities such as fisheries and tourism. Both industries are impaired by the loss of biodiversity, as it ultimately reduces fisheries catch and the desirability of diving sites. Further- more, the lionfish\u2019s venomous spines are a safety risk to both fishermen and recreational divers. In 2010, a strategic plan for the control of lionfish in the Wider Caribbean was developed in recognition of the se- verity of the lionfish invasion, its impact on coral reefs and effect on the local population. The plan provides a frame- work to address the invasion with a concerted approach across political and geographical boundaries. To minimise the negative impacts of lionfish, cooperation is promoted among governments, reef-reliant industries, civil society and academia.

Over the past few decades, development, pollution, overfishing and climate change have caused dramatic declines in the condition of regional marine and coastal ecosystems. Limited financial resources for conservation and a lack of long-term sustainable finance mechanisms exacerbate the problem, particularly in Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The Caribbean Biodiversity Fund (CBF) was established to assist Caribbean SIDS in achieving their conservation goals under the CBD, the Caribbean Challenge Initiative and national conservation priorities. This regional en- dowment will support multiple National Protected Area Trust Funds (NPATFs). The solution responds to the countries\u2018 pledge to create effective finance mechanisms that provide reliable funding to sustainably manage marine and coastal resources over the long term. The aim is to conserve at least twenty per cent of the Caribbean\u2019s marine and coastal environment by 2020. With an initial endowment of US$ 42 million, the CBF provides funding to Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for addressing environmental challenges while raising the conservation profile in the region. Efforts are underway to establish national level trust funds which would be eligible to receive and disperse CBF funding to local projects. Once fully operational, the CBF is expected to generate US$ 2\u20134 million per year in funding and attract additional resources from sectors like finance, tourism and public- private partnerships. solution regional biodiversity fund In Caribbean SIDS, livelihoods directly depend upon healthy marine and coastal resources \u00a9 Tim Calver for TNC Organisational structure of the Caribbean Biodiversity Fund and flow of funds \u00a9 TNC This solution is being implemented by the Caribbean Biodiversity Fund (CBF) in collaboration with the Caribbean Challenge Initiative (CCI), funded by the German Federal Government (KfW/BMZ), the Global Environment Facility, World Bank, UNDP, UNEP and The Nature Conservancy. building blocks Solution components for replication Government commit- ment Governments are key in regional and national trust fund design.

Small- scale fisheries are vital to local economies, and ensure food security and good nutrition. Today, fishers are facing various challenges: marginalisation, diminishing access to fish, ocean grabbing by powerful interests and climate change. Further- more, they are often excluded from active participation in the management of the very marine resources their livelihoods depend on. To address these issues, the Caribbean Network of Fisherfolk Organisations (CNFO) was founded in 2007. It aims to improve fishers\u2019 quality of life and develop a sustainable and profitable fishing industry through networking, representa- tion and capacity building. The CNFO developed an integrated fisheries governance approach that involves small-scale fishers in the region, promotes their participation in fisheries management processes and allows for the inclusion of fishers\u2019 knowledge, experience and interest into fisheries policy and law. The CNFO is now active in fisheries governance at local, regional and global levels. solution strengthening caribbean fisherfolk Fishers collaborating on suitable gear and fishing tech- niques \u00a9 CNFO Fishers can enforce, and for themselves achieve, a higher level of compliance than by any other means,\u00ab says Mitchell Lay, artisanal fisherman and coordinator of the CNFO. We are not lawless nor without ethics. In order to fish sustain- ably, we need to know what we are doing. The scientists are trained to collect data and to do assessments and to make recommendations based on trends, etc. They have a particu- lar area, yes, but we are the people who are in a position, who can not only provide information but assist as well in terms of making recommendations based on good sets of information. The fisher is the one in the field. It is impossible or impractical for scientists to cover the area that fishers cover every day. Fishers, even though they may not have the same academic levels, can be just as intelligent as scientists. Once equitable collaboration between researchers and fisherfolk occurs, relevant information can be generated, such as the extent of the resource base, its diversity and how fisherfolk can best access this diversity to benefit their economic welfare in the long-term.\u00ab \u00bb \u00bb This solution is being implemented by the Caribbean Network of Fisherfolk Organisations (CNFO). building blocks Solution components for replication Establishment of fish- erfolk organisations National fisherfolk organisations are established through collaborative effort.

Scenery is a very important component of beach tourism, which drives the economy of coastal areas. However, many coastlines are threatened by anthropogenic impacts such as uncontrolled development and pollu- tion, resulting in landscape degradation and reduced scenic quality. In order to assess the potential for coastal develop- ment in rural and remote areas and improve scenic quality of village and urban areas, an innovative scenic assessment methodology (comprising physical and human para- meters) has been developed. It can be used by managers and planners along any type of coastal area. With its strong emphasis on community participation, the technique opens new perspectives for analysis, focusing on the potential for coastal develop- ment in natural areas and scenic quality improvement of developed areas. The results of the assessment are fed into the development of a scenery-based management plan and help to define management strategies. solution assessing and managing the coastal scenery If you want to relax at the beach, you look for a nice beach\u2013remember: beauty lays in the eye of the beholder, in this case a tourist.

They have limited infrastructure, means and knowledge of the proper production and handling of fish products and, therefore, cannot meet the high quality and sustainability standards required by big markets. This often results in the use of unsustainable fishing practices, high production costs and low incomes for local communities. Since 2009, the EcoGourmet programme has enhanced the technical and administrative capacities of artisanal fisher- men cooperatives and supported their objectives to achieve responsible fishing. EcoGourmet, financed by Fondo Acci\u00f3n and Conservation International (CI) Colombia, facilitates the signing of trade agreements between suppliers, fishing cooperatives and restaurants and sensitises consumers to the ramifications of their purchasing decisions. Today, participating restaurants can offer locally sourced fish caught sustainably by fishers that implement best practices for conservation and fisheries management.

Members deliver high quality fish products for consumption in Bogot\u00e1 less than 48 hours after being caught. The process of joining EcoGourmet has not been effortless. It was a struggle to con- vince the fishermen of the need to use sustainable and selective fishing gear. Other difficulties included installing a cold room in one of the wettest and hottest areas on the planet, legally securing the tenure of the land where it was installed and im- plementing a system to ensure the supply of ice to fishermen at sea. Establishing an accounting system and budget and facilitating tax compliance were also challenging. Responsible fishing practices ensure the purchase of the product by the commercial partner. Failing to implement them would mean fishermen from Red de Fr\u00edo would have to fish 83 more tons to meet their current level of earnings. Today no one in Bahia Solano has not heard of responsible fishing,\u00ab says a member of Red de Frio, Emilio Medina. It\u2018s a good start.

In order to achieve this ambitious objec- tive, the Costa Rican government, through its National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC), has developed a conservation strategy. The conservation goals shall be achieved by creating new marine protected areas, expanding existing terrestrial ones and implementing more effective manage- ment and monitoring systems. Despite the great efforts undertaken towards these aims, the country faces enormous challenges in ensuring the sustain- ability of conservation endeavours. Problems such as the lack of administrative tools, ineffective ecological monitoring, a weak system of control and surveillance and a shortage of sustainable finance continue to exert pressure on protected areas. To address these issues and ensure the long-term funding of the programme, SINAC, together with several philanthrop- ic foundations, created the public-private conservation initiative, Forever Costa Rica. This non-profit association aims to complement state and private efforts to preserve biodiversity whilst guaranteeing a source of long-term funding. In coastal areas, Forever Costa Rica assists in the development of proper- ly funded management plans.

This \u00bbblue\u00ab carbon, found in large quantities in aquatic plants and sediments, is far more effectively stored than in terrestrial forests. The continued loss and degradation of these coastal environments causes the release of carbon back into the atmosphere. Protection and restoration of such coastal ecosystems can provide cost-effective carbon storage relevant for national government policies. These efforts also offer significant benefits to local fisheries and tourism, in addition to other services. However, limited design and implementation guidance is available for blue carbon initiatives that integrate climate mitigation and adaptation actions with improved coastal livelihoods. Working with national and local institutions, this solution addresses these needs through- out the Americas with a cohesive package of scientific research and political advice. A combination of carbon stock inventories, policy dialogue, capacity building and assess- ment of livelihoods, land-use dynamics and historical emissions enables project leaders and practitioners to address local development needs and climate commitments alike. In the Gulf of Nicoya (see also solution on page 48) we successfully integrat- ed our building blocks: local organisations understand the importance of mangrove resources for climate change mitigation and adaptation and are empowered to conserve them.

Showcasing the results in the media has triggered interest in blue carbon elsewhere in Central America. Most countries in the region now recognise the importance of mangrove forests as critical sinks of carbon and explicitly include them in their national forest inventories and climate action plans. It is inspiring to see how what started as a small pilot project has fueled dialogues so far beyond its initial scope.

Rural communities such as T\u00e1rcoles, located at the mouth of the Gulf of Nicoya, are strongly dependent on artisanal fisheries for their livelihood. Yet, over the past several years, rapidly growing real estate development blocked the access of local people to coastal and marine resources. Local fishermen have witnessed declining fish stocks due to pollution, illegal fishing and overfishing. Degraded habitats have reduced important food and revenue sources, increasing local poverty. Coope T\u00e1rcoles, an artisanal fishermen\u2019s cooperative dedicated to sustainable fisheries management, encouraged the community to use local marine resources in a sustainable manner, thus guaranteeing their economic future and cultural way of life. Members of Coope T\u00e1rcoles requested the government to institutionalise a local marine governance conservation scheme, the community-based Responsible Marine Fishing Area of T\u00e1rcoles. The community developed zoning regu- lations and guidelines based on traditional knowledge and the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. The in- volvement of local fishers in the development and implementation of sustainable use strategies helps to facilitate natural resource management and ensures better rule compliance.

Adjacent commu- nities, highly dependent on these ecosystems\u2019 continued productivity, have limited alternatives for development and lack adequate incentive or compensation to shift to alternative and environmentally sound production. Guided by the GIZ Biodiversidad Marino Costera y Adaptaci\u00f3n al Cambio Clim\u00e1tico (BIOMARCC) project, the Costa Rican Pacific coast non-profit FUNDECODES has established an innovative finan- cial mechanism for forest and mangrove conservation in the Tempisque Conservation Area. The Global Conservation Standard (GCS) is targeted to install a private sector financed system of payments for ecosystem services. Companies buy conservation credits which enable sustainable ru- ral development activities including tourism, farming and the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems. The intervention area, approximately 5,000 square kilometres, includes 2,000 square kilometres of private forest and state protected land. This acreage is directly managed and can generate 51 million conservation credit units annually. It is surrounded by a commercial buffer zone where local sustain- able production activities for the rehabilitation of mangroves and their services are promoted. For the next thirty years, the mechanism will empower landowners and rural communities to co-ben- efit from their conservation efforts through the cooperative management of public and private are- as alike. Up to 100 hectares of mangrove and coastal forests are now in the process of rehabilitation. Do\u00f1a Francisca is a mollusc gatherer who lives next to the mangroves in the Global Conservation Standard (GCS) project\u2018s buffer zone. Like her fellow gatherers, she has been harvesting fewer and smaller molluscs every year, be- cause the mangroves that house them are increasingly degraded. She hopes that the GCS will improve her situation: If we replant the forest, take care of mangrove nurseries and re-establish the natural water flow, our mollusc popula- tions may recover.\u00ab An organic certified German shrimp producer recently invested US$ 50,000, buying Conservation Credits to restore 10 hectares of mangroves. As a commercial buffer zone, the mangrove area will receive funding for rehabilitation with local support. Do\u00f1a Francisca and her peers may thus profit from the programme through viable livelihood alterna- tives, including mollusc gathering, and a more sustainable income in the long term. solution financial mechanism for coastal forest restoration Mangroves in the project\u2019s buffer zone \u00bb \u00a9 BIOMARCC-GIZ Zoning of landscapes aids in the implementation of the GCS \u00a9 BIOMARCC-GIZ This solution is being implemented by FUNDECODES Costa Rica in collaboration with the Costa Rican Ministry of Environ- ment and Energy (MINAE), National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC) and GIZ\u2019s project Biodiversidad Marino Costera y Adaptac\u00edon al Cambio Clim\u00e1tico (BIOMARCC), on behalf of the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB). building blocks Solution components for replication costa rica Identification of the appropriate standard International finance standards are reviewed and their potential carefully evaluated.

Conservation International is empowering local communities on the Gulf island of Chira to lead a science-based mangrove restoration project. It addresses both the root causes of mangrove degradation and resulting threats to local communities. The project\u2019s scientific assessments (see also solution on page 38) proved instrumen- tal for national policy making \u2013 all putting the project at the forefront of innovative blue carbon action. To date, villagers have successfully nursed and replanted +8,000 mangroves, with a successful ninety per cent survival rate. Locals received micro- entrepreneurship training in sustainable mangrove use and livelihood diversification, while area schools provided an education programme to 260 students. Community members move mangrove seed- lings into a degraded forest solution mangrove restoration for secure livelihoods and carbon storage Twenty-three female volunteers from Chira started our pilot project on mangrove reforestation. For five months they tirelessly cleaned the mangrove area of rubbish, planted seeds in bags and watered them twice a day \u2013 while still taking care of their family duties\u00ab says Marco Quesada Alp\u00edzar, Director of Conservation International Costa Rica. On an island with few employment opportunities and traditional gender roles, the women recognised the project\u2019s potential to attract external attention and hoped it would eventually provide an alternative source of income. Through- out, the women had to overcome opposition by their husbands and community but held onto their vision of bringing home alternative income from tourism and tree nursing. We had always known our mangroves were very important,\u00ab says Aparicia, their strong and charismatic leader. In just one year, they planted more than 8,000 plants with a survival rate over ninety per cent. The women\u2019s efforts have attracted tourists and government agencies alike. Visitors come to witness their work, understand the community\u2019s dependency on mangrove services and learn about the huge carbon sink mangroves represent. Their project even inspired neighbouring communities to start own replantation projects. \u00a9 Marco Quesada / Conservation International \u00bb \u00bb This solution is being implemented by Conservation International Costa Rica. Science-based design Research methods and field activities are based on the latest science and locally adapted with help of resi- dent scientists. Reforestation areas and specimens are identified using national and international expertise. Carbon estimates by local scientists follow international standards, which facilitates uptake by policy makers. Informing policy processes At the national level, decision makers are in- formed by blue carbon assessments. They are empowered to develop broader climate change mitigation strategies that target multiple ecosystem services. Active stakeholders across levels Local stakeholders are engaged and empowered throughout the project with high investments of time and relationship-build- ing, resulting in strong com- mitment, responsibility and knowledge sharing. costa rica building blocks Solution components for replication Students form a human chain to transport mangrove plants across a dry salt pond \u00a9 Maguil C\u00e9spedes / Conservation International 50 51 On the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, on the Nicoya Peninsula, a consultative multi-stakeholder process built a shared vision for sustainable management of coastal and marine resources. Scientific assessments identified important yet vulnerable sites for conservation. At the same time, multi-sectorial stakeholder dialogues addressed local marine spatial planning. The stakeholders discussed area delimitation, zonation and governance using mediation, collaborative facilitation and alternative dispute resolution. They negotiated a consensus governance model and formulated management rules for future marine protected areas. Although multi-stakeholder processes can be time demanding and costly, they have proven vital to promote good gov- ernance of marine resources in Costa Rica. The dialogues increase clarity, transparency and social cohesion across sectors. A legally-binding resolution legitimises the pro- cess by promoting local empowerment, and confidence and credibility of communities and authorities. In addition, participants strengthen their negotiating, organising and leadership capabilities. Consequently, the resulting agree- ments enable further cooperation for nego- tiation regarding and governance of marine resources. Every day, fisherfolk from Cabuya on the Nicoya Peninsula have been returning home with progressively smaller catches. Compressor divers and shrimp trawlers in nearby fishing areas have increased pressure on local fish stocks. Fishers, wishing to avoid the hardships caused by scarcity, are eager to create rules that protect their marine resources.

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature globally recognises hawksbill turtles as critically endangered with the eastern Pacific population as one of the most at risk. ICAPO\u2019s mission is to protect and recover hawksbills through collaborations with coastal community members, scientists and policy makers throughout the region, including countries such as Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. With several programmes including education, research, policy advice, monito- ring and the development of alternative livelihoods, ICAPO addresses sea turtle conservation in a holistic manner. The findings of ICAPO\u2019s research have been ground-breaking and are being integrated into national and international hawks- bill conservation management efforts. solution hawksbill turtle recovery There are only an estimated 500 nesting female hawksbills along the entire Pacific coast of the Americas. ICAPO works directly with traditional egg poachers to find, collect and protect hawksbill eggs at several sites in El Salvador and Nicaragua. The organisation works to protect the species while supporting poverty stricken local communities through an innovative egg incentive collection programme. This programme pays local residents to monitor the beaches at several sites in El Salvador and Nicaragua. Once a resident finds a turtle nest, they carefully bring the eggs to hatcheries where they are re- buried and monitored until turtles emerge. Participants are paid for every egg brought to the centre and again for those that hatch. This incentive en- courages residents to take special care of the eggs while transporting them. The egg collection programme has allowed coastal residents to earn income for protecting the eggs\u2014 as opposed to selling them on the black market. It is a key source of income in areas with high unemployment and low wages. Our egg incentive approach contrasts that of most turtle conservation programmes which have historically attempted to push out local poachers, leaving them embittered and with limited options to generate incomes,\u00ab says David Melero, ICAPO Alternative Livelihoods Programme Director.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18e9ae1e-a331-42f6-970a-65db48f3b903": {"__data__": {"id_": "18e9ae1e-a331-42f6-970a-65db48f3b903", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue solutions from Latin America and the wider Caribbean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62dd017f23d57f133534d89a4f7880d60c55b0c4c32cc2ca5e012333c89282da"}, "2": {"node_id": "d923525d-7d3c-47c4-a7fb-5fa2293fb879", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d801c5591b866156365c7d484eb18a0eba22cea78e85643fdd9d78c73f18fbfc"}}, "hash": "2925c9d473a76d61872d41176f027f3889d78c13b3d85cf84cfe05e39e05a61c", "text": "\u00bbOur innovative, inclusive approach is largely responsible for our unprecedented conservation successes, which include a reduction in egg poaching from 100 percent to almost zero!\u00ab \u00bb David Melero with a young hawksbill \u00a9 ICAPO Hawksbill turtle hatchlings \u00a9 ICAPO This solution is being implemented by The Eastern Pacific Hawksbill Initiative (ICAPO), fiscally sponsored by The Ocean Foun- dation.

Decades of extensive shrimp farming and weak enforcement of policies, however, have critically depleted mangrove ecosystems, negatively impacting the livelihoods of thousands of subsistence users. Recognizing the problems associated with mangrove degradation, the Ministry of Envi- ronment (MoE) implemented sustainable use agreements as an innovative coastal ma- nagement policy. The rights of \u00bbancestral\u00ab artisanal fishers are recognised by providing associations of mangrove users with a concession for a 10-year mangrove stewardship. This government-granted common property arrangement promotes the conservation and restoration of degraded mangrove areas, sustainable use of marine resources, and empowers local communities to guard their mangroves against further destruction. I do not only consider myself a crab fishermen, but proudly claim to be the \u203aguardian of the mangrove\u2039,\u00ab says Ricardo Carpio, president of the association \u00bb21 de Mayo Puerto Roma\u00ab. \u00bb Like many other crab fishermen of Ecuador, I used to catch crabs with traps. After five years of implementing the activities that are required to obtain a concession, including no longer using traps or chemicals, I see that the state of the resource has improved. We only catch males and respect minimum catch sizes in order to allow the crabs to grow and reproduce. I realise the positive changes that the concession has brought to my community. We have benefitted from participating in other government projects, such as a programme for the installation of solar panels on private houses. We gained a monetary incentive of more than $37,000 issued by the Ministry of Environment for assisting in the control and surveillance of around 2,500 hectares of mangroves. All members of our association jointly take care of the concession, and I am very strict when applying penalties or implementing new standards. Once I even fined my own father for catching crabs in a closed area. In addition, our association cooperates with other communities, guiding them through the process of obtaining a conces- sion and supporting them during the implementation phase.\u00ab solution concessions for mangrove conservation \u00bb21 de Mayo Puerto Roma\u00ab was issued an incentive for preserving the mangroves The crab fishers in the Gulf of Guayaquil consider themselves \u00bbguardians of the mangrove\u00ab \u00bb \u00a9 Daniela Hill Piedra \u00a9 Daniela Hill Piedra This solution is being implemented by the Under-Secretariat for Marine and Coastal Management of the Ministry of Environ- ment in Ecuador. building blocks Solution components for replication Mangrove management plan Based on official fishing and environmental regulations such as periodic closures, bans and minimum sizes, the management plan contains a detailed programme for resource use, control and surveillance and monitoring and evaluation.

After that conflict, we feared for our personal safety and had to stop the project and leave the area for a while,\u00ab said Mar\u00eda Cecilia Ter\u00e1n. \u00bbHowever, we were surprised to see that the fishermen who participated in our programme did not return to fish lobster in the meantime.\u00ab In retrospect, the conflict was a good learning opportunity. More area fishermen became engaged in responsible fishing activities, sharing their experiences and know- ledge to inspire others. This led to increased interest in joining the initiative. Today, even the fishermen who once caused the armed dispute realise that the sustainable use of marine resources is key to guaranteeing long term socio-economic benefits. The Galera-San Francisco Marine Reserve features an outstanding variety of wildlife and is one of the most important zones for biodiversity conservation in coastal Ecuador. Local residents are heavily dependent on natural resources for their subsistence, with artisanal fishing as a core activity. The spiny lobster (Panulirus gracilis) is traditionally harvested in this area. However, the use of non-selective fishing gear, resource overexploitation and lack of enforcement of marine regulations have severely depleted this resource. In cooperation with the fishing association Arte Langosta, the Nazca Institute for Marine Research and Conservation International created a participatory management system which promotes the protection of biodiversity and sustainable local development. In this system, stakeholders and authorities join together to develop a governance model with specific, effective management actions and fair economic alternatives.

Participatory fisheries monitoring A community-based catch- monitoring programme is designed to document the quantities of fish and lobster harvested in the area. This type of data creates (and con- stantly updates) a reference point, meeting the informa- tion requirements of decision- makers and managers of the marine reserve. Low impact fishing activities A conservation agree- ment promotes the application of fisheries and zoning regulations in the marine reserve as well as the implementa- tion of guidelines based on the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Economic incentives Fishermen who desire to engage in activities with low environmental impact are provided non-destructive, selective gear which reduces the catch of non-target species or undersized fish. Training on product handling and eco labelling schemes help fishermen to assure high quality products, access to markets for sustainably harvested resources and thus better prices for their products. building blocks Solution components for replication The use of selective fishing gear helps to conserve the population structure of the spiny lobster. \u00a9 NAZCA 58 59 Grenada is heavily dependent on limited natural resources to support three of their primary sectors: tourism, agriculture and fishing. Like other small island nations in the Eastern Caribbean and beyond, Grenada is on the front lines of climate change. It is already experiencing hotter temperatures, more frequent and intense storms, flooding, rising sea levels and degraded coral reefs, which in turn threaten lives, property, food, fresh water, livelihoods and overall economic stability. Faced with these urgent matters, decision makers must make choices that will save lives today and improve livelihoods into the future. This solution addresses the problem of climate change impacts such as increased coastal erosion threatening coastal communities. The project builds social and ecological resilience with strong community engagement.

A greater understanding of oceanic ecosystems, including the quantity of resources, number of users and patterns of space-use, is critical to planning for their sustainable development and conser- vation. The Grenada Bank (which includes both Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) is the site of the Marine Resource Space-use Information System (MarSIS), a Participatory Geographical Information System (PGIS) adapted for the marine realm. This unique information system integrates a variety of social, economic and environmental information (drawn from both scientific and local knowledge) to provide a more complete information base for coastal marine planning and management. A high level of stakeholder engagement provides useful information and creates a strong sense of ownership in the information produced, increases understanding within and between stakeholder groups and validates the critical role of stakeholder participation in research and governance. MarSIS, alongside the development of a transboundary marine multi-use zoning plan, strengthened conservation efforts and sustainable livelihood initiatives in the two countries. In addition it enabled the application of the Grenadine Islands for designation as a transboundary UNESCO marine mixed (cultural/ ecological) World Heritage Site (WHS).

It is one of the last remaining coastal and marine protected areas in the country. The reserve is highly affected by three main watersheds. Although floods have always been common inside Monterrico Reserve, their frequency and adverse effect on important habitats, agricultural lands and infrastructure have increased during recent years. Often these floods are fueled by activities outside the reserve, including changes in drainage patterns, deforestation of riparian forests and water canalization works. Inhabitants of the reserve therefore asked the Center for Conservation Studies (CECON) of the University of San Carlos, which manages Monterrico Reserve, for new approaches to solve these problems. In order for relevant stakeholders to understand the causes behind the flooding, CECON organised a series of field trips along the watersheds. It became evident that the current scale of actions taking place inside the Reserve was not enough to address flood issues in the area. Therefore, the existing management scheme was revised towards a more integrated approach, taking into account the ecological, social and economic links between the reserve and its surrounding land- scape. During the revision process, new and more stakeholder groups were engaged. The management scope was broad- ened and a Conceptual Ecological Model was developed to set a new scale for action by linking ecosystems, species and conservation values. Proposed actions include inter alia the implementation of an integral watershed monitoring system and the implementation of an early warning system. The example of Monterrico Reserve is now used as a case study in a training course for Guatemalan municipal planning officers. The course aims to strengthen the territorial planning of coastal and marine areas on the Pacific coast. solution connecting a coastal reserve with its surroundings Frequent and severe flooding is a major issue for the inhabitants of Monterrico Reserve \u00a9 Pablo Castellanos This solution is being implemented by the Center for Conservation Studies (CECON) and the School of Biology of the University of San Carlos, Guatemala.

It utilises a participatory approach to understanding and commu- nicating the interactions between the reserve and its surroundings, specifically those spatial and temporal processes that link ecosystems, species and conservation values. New management actions Ecological, social and economic data from the reserve and its surroundings are gathered, updated and further analysed to propose new management actions and strategies to be included in the updated master plan. The master plan is backed up by law and includes elements from Integrated Water and Coastal-Marine Manage- ment and Disaster Risk Reduction Management. Permanent stakeholder engagement During the initial phase of the planning process, a permanent stake- holder engagement process is established which includes representa- tives from inside and outside the reserve.

Turtle reproduction, population status and migration patterns have been continuously monitored since 1997. This long-term data is incredibly valuable for turtle conservation. Environmental education activities in schools inform the local children of the importance of nature protection, while incentives and alternative livelihood options help to ensure long-term sustainable community development. To achieve true success with a conservation programme, we need the support of the local communities and children,\u00ab says Luc\u00eda Garc\u00eda, director of ARCAS\u2019 Hawaii project. Implementing a community development strategy is therefore always the first phase of the project in order to attain the most sustainable, long-term efforts. In 2013 and 2014 one of the most effective and popular educational programmes carried out in the Hawaii and El Rosario hatcheries was the Rally Parlama, named after the targeted species (\u203aParlama\u2039 is the local name for Olive Ridley turtles). This programme encouraged local children to donate Parlama eggs to an ARCAS hatchery. In exchange for eight dozen eggs, we rewarded the children with a four day, all-inclusive cross-country tour to visit other national parks and protected areas. As most residents of the Hawaii region live below the pover- ty line, many of them have never left their home area. The trip was an incredible opportunity for these children to visit some of Guatemala\u2019s most beautiful, natural and iconic sites. The Rally Parlama pro- gramme helped to create a lasting impression, boosted the children\u2019s sensitivity for the importance of nature conservation and created stronger support for ARCAS\u2019 conservation efforts within the local communities.\u00ab solution integrated approach for turtle conservation \u00a9 ARCAS Guatemala \u00bb Children visit Tikal Na- tional Park in Peten, during the Rally Parlama \u00bb Volunteers taking care of the turtle hatchery in Hawaii Park \u00a9 ARCAS Guatemala This solution is being implemented by ARCAS Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Association in Guatemala. Data-based decision making Turtle hatchery data, population data (daily GPS crawl counts) and data on strandings are coll- ected, following strict protocols. This information is used to esti- mate the abundance of turtle populations and their condition and help to create appropriate conservation strategies. Sponsor a Nest \u2013 Ecotourism Tourists sponsor a turtle nest through donations. These funds are used to buy food which is then exchanged for turtle eggs. Many sponsors come to the park with family or friends to release hatchlings on the beach together with local guides. building blocks Solution components for replication guatemala Volunteer engagement Volunteers from all over the world help to implement the conservation activities, inclu- ding protection of detected turtle nests, hatchery mainte- nance, environmental educa- tion support, data collection and rehabilitation of injured turtles. Environmental education A variety of educational activities such as beach clean-ups, hatchling releases, environmental fairs, field trips and pre- sentations in local schools inform the children of the importance of nature protection. Eggs-for-food exchange To promote economic alternatives in rural communities and to minimise the unsustainable consumption of natural resources, food supplements from the government and other donors are ex- changed for turtle eggs. This improves local food security and nutrition and increases the participation of women and children in turtle conservation. Incentives to share local knowledge Local people share their traditional knowledge on preferred nesting sites, help- ing to spot and protect the nests. They are economically compensated for leaving the nests untouched. 66 67 In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch made its first point of landfall at Guanaja Island, Honduras. Mitch, in a movement pattern very unusual for hurricanes, remained over Guanaja for three and a half days. Local people survived by hiding in the hills and crowding into the few structures that remained standing. An estimated 95 per cent of the once abundant mangroves were destroyed. Due to geographic isolation from other mangrove areas, natural recovery was very slow or even impossible. In 2008, The Bay Islands Conservation Association Guanaja (BICA-Guanaja) started its multi-year resto- ration project with the goal of planting 400,000 red, black and white mangroves to restore a self-sustaining healthy forest on Guanaja Island.

Collecting them in an isolated canal where a fewtree re- mained and then trudging through the mud to plant them by the thou- sands. Right after spending months planting many tens of thousands of seeds, hurricane Wilma brushed by Guanaja with enough force to kill the seeds he had planted which were just sprouting their first leaves. Hearing Baldhead\u2019s story I felt a great inspiration to help out. Together with a volunteer biology student, Toby Jacobs, I returned to Guanaja and began helping Baldhead plant Red Mangrove seeds. We had no funding and no real plan; we just got out there in the knee deep mud and got to work. That was in 2008. Toby and I founded the Guanaja Mangrove Reforestation Project, which is now part of The Bay Islands Conservation Association (BICA Guanaja). In 2011, we established three mangrove nurseries growing white, black and red mangroves, to rear the seedlings up to a specific size, increasing the restoration success. Since then, we have planted more than 200,000 mangroves, assisting the recovery of 100 hectares.\u00ab \u00a9 BICA-Guanaja \u00bb This solution is being implemented by BICA-Guanaja in collaboration with The Ocean Foundation.

Con- sidering the right timing, season and location in which the man- groves are planted is crucial for restoration success. Environmental education The project reaches out to stu- dents and local communities in order to teach the importance of mangroves as critical components of the global environment. Volun- teers and students plant thousands of mangroves; even school children are encouraged to start peat pot nurseries for black and white man- groves in their classrooms.

This species is the fourth most valuable marine resource in the area, providing a livelihood to more than 9,000 people. However, unsustainable resource use has led to the overexploitation of this species, including market satu- ration and a critical drop in market prices. Through Catch Shares (Manejo Compartido por Cuotas (MCC) in Spanish), a framework for sustainable fisheries management, it has been possible to reduce overfishing while improving the economic wellbeing of those fishing communities dependent on healthy and resilient marine ecosystems.

They assure fishermen stable fishing over time and exclusive benefits from sustainable management, increasing their stewardship and compliance. Unconventional strategic partnerships To promote sustainable fishing, it is necessary to create partnerships that promote behaviour change, even if they are at opposite ends of the market. A partnership of fishermen and buyers brings mutual benefits such as better prices and higher quality products. This incentivises fisher- men to respect catch limits and no-take zones. Collaborative science Accurate and updated information is crucial for resource management. Forming Technical Groups enables collaborative science for decision making. These groups consist of participants from public and academic institutions who meet regularly to share information relevant to the fishery\u2019s man- agement. 70 71 Rural communities located along the Mexican coast heavily depend on natural resources for their subsistence, with artisa- nal fishing as one of their main activities. The lack of stable organisational frameworks within the fishing sector, however, has led to the overexploitation of marine resources, causing severe conflicts between local stakeholders. To effectively address this problem, COBI (Comunidad y Biodiversidad) has developed a participatory approach to strengthen the overall governance of marine ecosystems that includes measures to restore fisheries and marine ecosystems. Techniques range from capacity building and the intro- duction of international standards for fishing to the establishment of fully protected marine reserves. The method has been implemented in three regions: the Mesoamerican Reef, Baja California and the Gulf of California. solution community-based management for artisanal fisheries The 250 fishermen of Puerto Libertad, a village located on the north coast of the Gulf of California, have traditionally fished commercially important species such as grouper, snapper and squid to sustain their livelihoods. Before COBI started its activities in this village, there was no regulatory framework in place to control fishing activi- ties. This led to the unfettered extraction of marine resources, endangering the long-term supply of these assets and causing severe conflicts between licensed fisheries organisations and unlicensed fishermen. Through the engagement of COBI and the implementation of better regulatory structure and increased stakeholder enga- gement, the fisheries sector in Puerto Libertad is today well organised. Through the concerted effort of all stakeholders, there has been significant progress in meeting the main goal: sustainable use of common marine goods.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Monitoring tracks the effective- ness of efforts to build capac- ities, change behaviour through social marketing and achieve desired conservation outcomes. It is based on pre- and post- campaign surveys and specific protocols validated by experts. building blocks Solution components for replication mexico Pride training programme Local conservation leaders undergo formal two-year uni- versity training, combined with periods of field-based research and analyses. Participants learn how to change attitudes and behaviours, mobilise support for conservation and reduce threats to natural resources. Social marketing (SM) SM uses commercial marketing methods and tools to promote voluntary behaviour change that benefits society as well as the target group. By creating a clear and positive identity or brand around conservation, it can resonate with community per- ceptions, values and traditions. Technical Assistance (TA) TA is directed towards build- ing capacity in coastal commu- nities, removing technical barri- ers and emphasising leadership to improve the management of natural resources. The over- arching goal is to promote community support for con- servation actions. Formative research Both quantitative and qualita- tive data feed into baselines, which enable the assessment of social and conservation impacts following a campaign. Both data sets are used to target audiences and, ultimately, guide campaign objectives, activities and mes- sages. Theory of Change (ToC) The ToC serves to create a common vision of long-term goals, how to reach them and how to measure progress along the way. It is the basis for stra- tegic planning. As such it clearly articulates how shifting behav- iour and social norms will re- duce threats to biodiversity. 74 75 Protected Areas (PAs) are a powerful tool for biodiversity conservation. In Mexico, more than 170 federal PAs are to protect over 25.6 million hectares of important habitats and landscapes. Due to the remote location of many PAs, however, their function as adminis- trative frameworks for local governance is often impaired. Some PAs lack the economic, human and material resources to ensure sufficient and effective surveillance and regulation enforcement. In addition, local communities, e.g. fishing communities in the state of Baja California, observe insufficient pres- ence and low levels of inter-agency coordination which is required to inform users about the current regulations for the area. A conceptual model to support PA enforcement was developed. This model, currently being implemented in marine and coastal protected areas of north-western Mexico, is designed to increase regulation compliance and facilitate fisheries and biodiversity recovery and conservation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d91c3fa4-d912-4373-80d5-17e4bedfbf44": {"__data__": {"id_": "d91c3fa4-d912-4373-80d5-17e4bedfbf44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue solutions from Latin America and the wider Caribbean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a2f410cc93dca40c51a4cc40bd2e108f77d583843c04c06e8e40369fdf974aa4"}, "2": {"node_id": "f860c55d-8d9b-408e-9a5c-ffda4a251c6f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dfaa9d2fb57a707c872ebdb039f7c7097eecfa3f10258ffce9c0e4d58a1e3575"}}, "hash": "dad5e8381b36de7601f497ac30974cf73cf1b134d48c7f0a56d4999103d111da", "text": "The model includes: diagnosing the current status of the PA\u2019s administrative framework; multi-agency coordination; planning and evaluation; personnel, capacity building; financing, equipment/ infra-structure; joint operation; data systematisation; and legal follow-up.

However, its marine ecosystems, and therefore the livelihoods of many coastal communities, are threatened by over-fishing. Coastal development has led to the decline of key habitats which sustain a variety of interlinked species. Since artisanal fishermen were not involved in fisheries management, they took little responsibility for marine conservation. To address these challenges and facilitate collaboration for the management of fishery resources, the Kanan Kay Alliance was founded as a coalition of 41 institutional members and includes governmental agencies, fishing cooperatives, civil society organisations, academia and philanthropic foundations. The Alliance\u2018s most important task is the establishment of a network of so-called fish refuges where fishing is banned. Such shelters are a powerful tool to recover the biomass of overfished species within a short time period. Today, these refuges cover 16,000 hec- tares of the region\u2018s coral reefs, seagrass meadows and coastal wetlands. Recognising the importance of involving local fishermen in responsible fisheries manage- ment, the Alliance aims to further empower these stakeholders. Participatory manage- ment processes help to strengthen their sense of ownership and support the sustainable use of fishery resources in the long-term. solution empowering fishermen through co-management At one General Assembly, Kanan Kay Alliance members discussed which terminology to use when referring to \u00bbfish refuges\u00ab. For some governmental representatives, changing to a different term that was both technically correct and easy to understand made a lot of sense. For the fishermen, however, changing the term would have been synonymous with betraying the overall goal of the Alliance. The discussion reached a point where the fishermen were prepared to exercise their power of veto and leave the assembly if the term were to be changed. In the end, the Alliance decided to keep the term, as it was of great importance to the fishermen. This incident helped increase the fishermen\u2018s confidence in a joint management ap- proach and its successful implementation. The fishermen realised that members were equal partners, all committed to the same mission of developing responsible fisheries.

Eighty per cent of its population lives within six meters of sea level. It is an area characterised by a high vulnerability to sea level rise, erosion, flooding and intensifying weather events. From 2000 to 2010, hurricanes alone caused more than US$ 2 million in losses to the state economy. There is an urgent need to reduce the vulnerability of people and infra- structure to the effects of climate change and extreme weather events. Climate change adaptation plans identify a variety of strategies to minimise vulnerabilities. However, municipalities, communities and resource managers need to identify which specific land use, construc- tion and ecosystem management practices they should implement. Measures such as building on poles, behind the dunes or using tradi- tional construction methods; maintaining healthy coral reefs as natural barriers; and leaving natural flows undisturbed have all been proven to successfully prevent or reduce climate change-related damage to coastal areas. A core team of experts from Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Chetumal, Mesoamerica Reef Tourism Initiative, the Amigos de Sian Ka\u2018an and The Nature Conservancy reviewed and systematised relevant experiences of Mexican Caribbean hotel staff, coastal dwellers, architects and engineers. They identified over 35 climate change adaptation measures, resulting in a comprehensive catalogue of good practices.

Due to its rich biological diversity, in 1980 the island was designated as a National Park. High levels of marine productivity in the surrounding waters have attracted fishermen, who have been using the island as a temporary camp site for almost one hundred years. However, a steadily growing number of fishermen camping on the island and a lack of organisation have tremendously increased the pressure on the island\u2018s natural resources. In 2000, the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) initi- ated a participatory process to improve the management of the fishing camp of Isla Isabel. Local fishermen were involved in a concerted approach to ensure that all activities taking place on the island meet the environmental regulations pro- tecting its natural resources. The project established a regulatory system tackling environmental threats caused by the unregulated construction of fishing huts, waste disposal, uncontrolled clear- ing of vegetation, illegal consumption of turtle and bird eggs, introduction of inva- sive species and lack of proper sanitation facilities. With the new management approach, things have become better regulated,\u00ab says Juan Dovora, fisherman in Isla Isabel. \u00bbThere is no longer such an uncon- trolled arrival of fishermen. This was achieved by the hard work of the staff of the park, of Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM), and of the government, who were engaged in fostering our compliance to the new rules, which turned out to be really beneficial. When the management plan was being discussed, we did not want to miss that opportunity. Now we try to give something back \u2013 to the extent that we supported them, we also support ourselves.

In many cases, however, improper disposal of fisheries waste pollutes the surrounding environment and presents hazards to human health. To address the need for proper management of fisheries waste, members of the fishing community El Caracol in Guasave, Sinaloa state, founded Grupo Crustil, a small-scale processing enterprise, in 2007. Grupo Crustil utilises discards from artisanal fisheries to produce fish meal. The process creates opportunities for alternative income generation, maximises product utilisation and mitigates environmental impacts. To date, approximately 600 metric tons of fisheries waste are processed per month, producing up to 35 metric tons of fish meal for sale in local and regional markets. The commitment of the staff is crucial for the success of this enterprise. The staff dedicates themselves to reducing costs, further improving their products and diversifying the product range. For example, they plan to further reduce waste by converting protein-rich water (a by-product of the production process) to an organic liquid fertiliser which will be marketed to the regional agricultural industry. The small factory thereby contributes to an improved quality of life in the local community, creates jobs and helps to raise awareness on the need for proper management of fisheries waste.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9c26aec-666b-4c2d-8802-59030254eb48": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9c26aec-666b-4c2d-8802-59030254eb48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue solutions from Latin America and the wider Caribbean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d2db5e04af548c374512e7150ec5b9845d26946a76773a434d5f5e573e2a1f0"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f5f67aa-8d2a-4769-8c02-3721e838c35c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf3e004501d74c8d7967553f1608a7e48f5130c16f4730278962ae7b23f6ea84"}}, "hash": "9a5afc3ead8889bca0a635f6c94a09d6351d438961986b05e91190bf1fe7eb4a", "text": "solution making money from scraps Equipment and raw material for the production of fish meal \u00a9 APFF Islas del Golfo de California \u00a9 APFF Islas del Golfo de California Project staff and a representative of the Mexican National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) This solution is being implemented by the Mexican National Commission of Natural Protected", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4b4dbca-56a7-452f-a007-c048192b2b53": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4b4dbca-56a7-452f-a007-c048192b2b53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue solutions from Latin America and the wider Caribbean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59d021515d824ecc9f1c3d1e7059e166d00eb9c39c2c30f9cc9ad9e2ac9f812b"}, "3": {"node_id": "ceed5b55-6260-446e-bb3b-02dc1607c833", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c542b6e80a737490a21c084f50d7616719ec87ec376c7009e5c7e2a383a4a625"}}, "hash": "ab1cd49dd843a88dbdf3930d13857bdd58ee2684cbed374359093c2908fe6ace", "text": "Areas (CONANP).

Such high visitor numbers, however, are placing immense pressure on the natural coral reefs in the area. For instance, they have suffered critical damage from inexperienced divers or people kicking or touching corals and reef formations. In order to alleviate pressure on the reefs and allow them recovery time, an underwater art museum called MUSA (Museo Subacu\u00e1tico de Arte) was es- tablished in 2009. The museum is world-renowned for two reasons: it is one of the largest underwater artificial art attractions in the world and it draws visitors away from the natural reefs while creating new artificial habitats. MUSA current- ly consists of more than 500 life-sized sculptures by various artists. Installed on the sea floor off Isla Mujeres and Punta Nizuc, the museum consists of about 420 square meters of sculptures made from specialised materials which pro- mote the colonization of marine life. The evolving interaction of art and sea creatures helps to increase both the ecological awareness of visitors and the overall biomass of the reef system. The National Park Authorities also run coral nursery and propagation projects. These support regeneration of the natural reefs in the Mexican Caribbean and help increase fish and invertebrate populations find refuge among the reef struc- tures. The nursery consists of coral fragments attached to vertically positioned PVC tubes secured to a concrete base. The upright position keeps the coral colonies safe from predators and prevents smothering. The nurseries are lo- cated in a safe location known only to the park wardens, in shallow, clear water that lets the sunlight reach the coral colonies. When the coral colonies have reached a certain size, they are carefully transplanted onto the original reef structure. The restoration success is regularly monitored.

Strict management plans are necessary to restore these fisheries to sustainable levels. SmartFish International is a for-profit social enterprise based in La Paz, Mexico. It supports fishermen in their efforts to deliver and sell better-quality fish to the docks and in premium markets, respectively. SmartFish establishes relation- ships with and between reputable co-ops, NGOs, fisheries and fishermen who promote sustainable fishing practices. To support and protect the efforts of fishermen, SmartFish connects them with interested markets and assists in the design and implementation of proper fishery management. These efforts promote ecosystem conservation and help end the vicious cycle of overfishing while sustaining livelihoods and ensuring food security. solution rescuing value in the fish market In 2009, we began experimenting with entrepreneurial approaches to incentivising higher sustainability fishing in Mexico,\u00ab says S. Hoyt Peckham, founding director of SmartFish International. \u00bbCertain visionary fishermen wanted to try switching to more selective gear to reduce megafauna bycatch, as long as they could find a way to do so more profitably. We realised that we could probably align fishing with sustainability objectives and thus overcome the cycle of overfishing. In 2010 we conducted a market study and plan with leading fishermen, in partnership with five fishing cooperatives of the Bahia Magdalena region which form the social venture Productos Marinos Sustentables (ProMar). Local fishermen don\u2019t have the capital or the capacity to bring their fish to market, which puts them at the mercy of aggressive buyers. They end up receiving very poor prices for their fish, so every time they fish they have to make up for the low prices with higher quantities. We piloted how we could rescue the value lost in some of their undervalued fisheries. Strong demand for ProMar\u2019s zero bycatch, higher sustainability seafood enabled ProMar to generate impressive social, environmental and economic outcomes. However, that same demand also presented ProMar\u2019s greatest challenge: maintaining catch rates which are high and consistent enough to meet that demand. In 2013 we launched SmartFish to incentivise higher sustainability artisanal fishing by empowering fishermen to rescue value in their undervalued fisheries. To make their sustainable fishing practices more profitable, we have begun build- ing preferential markets for their fish, creating both supply and demand.\u00ab \u00bb SmartFish\u2019s shared vision integrates diverse intelligences \u00a9 SmartFish This solution is being implemented by SmartFish in collaboration with The Ocean Foundation. Economic acumen We rescue value in fisheries in order to make fishing more profitable based on quality rather than volume. Each fisherman has adopted at least one of a range of sustainability measures including selective fishing gear, fisheries reserves, catch quotas and size limits. building blocks Solution components for replication Social intelligence We integrate the stakeholders of each fishery, growing social capital and economic value to improve the wellbeing of fishermen and their livelihoods. It is important to hold stakeholder- driven conversations and attract diverse repre- sentation. Responsible seafood production co-ops We partner with cooperatives and NGOs to em- power fishermen and their families to catch and produce the best quality sustainable seafood. This cultivates demand for exquisite seafood among distinguished customers. Environmental acumen We only establish commercial relationships with co-ops that implement fisheries management poli- cies like closed seasons, fishing quotas and marine protected areas. Building a strong local network with a high degree of peer and regulatory oversight is crucial.

The mangrove trees function as a natural coastal protection barrier, a biological water fil- tration system and a refuge for wildlife. They thereby help buffer natural or human impacts on adjacent ecosystems while sustaining diverse marine and coastal life, supporting subsistence and commer- cial fisheries and providing recreational opportunities. These mangrove stands have been chronically stressed due to deg- radation and pollution associated with coastal development and tourism infrastructure, reducing the resilience of the mangrove ecosystem to disturbances such as hurricanes. The devastating effects became obvious in 2005 when category-five hurricane Wilma hit the area, degrading large areas of mangrove bordering the lagoon and adjacent reef formations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "522adec0-b6e5-4eab-9029-0860edea8728": {"__data__": {"id_": "522adec0-b6e5-4eab-9029-0860edea8728", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue solutions from Latin America and the wider Caribbean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6955f0bfc67c2358cf7c4586bdd3cf7949ecb4368baff3c91ed142e85ea8c69"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac81ca78-d99e-45a2-b303-f458c61bad13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d1a2283c0dc78919cc47f466eeb39efb2f67d62669e4f6c248d3bafbeeb3572"}}, "hash": "03f7fad5e9ad641f36bf871f4bcbab621cd1acc82053e39681e54c1842dcf7b6", "text": "To support the recovery of the mangrove ecosystem, in 2008 the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) began to implement restoration and conservation activities including hydrology, restoration and refor- estation and invasive species elimination projects.

Mangroves act as a buffer, mitigating the effects of climate change. Their absence places local commu- nities at risk. The once extensive stands in the reserve have, however, been severely depleted. Forty years ago a road was constructed across the reserve near El Play\u00f3n. It improved access to the reserve but hindered water flow within the mangrove stands, changing the hydrology and hydrogeo- chemistry of the area and leading to a large scale degradation of mangroves. This solution promotes the restoration of Sian Ka\u2019an mangroves using the framework of an ecosystem-based approach to climate change adaptation. A programme to restore the original state of ecological conditions in mangrove ecosystems is implemented. Appropriate adaptation measures are identified to ultimately strengthen the resilience of the reserve\u2019s coastal ecosystems and reduce the vulnerability of dependent communities to climate change. solution restoration of mangroves in the sian ka\u2018an biosphere reserve The El Play\u00f3n road separates pristine and degraded mangrove stands Sian Ka\u2018an Biosphere Reserve \u00a9 Angel Omar Ortiz Moreno \u00a9 Angel Omar Ortiz Moreno This solution is being implemented by the Biosphere Reserve Sian Ka\u2018an, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional (CINVESTAV-IPN), Instituto Nacional de Ecolog\u00eda y Cambio Clim\u00e1tico (INECC) and Instituto Mexicano de Tecnolog\u00eda del Agua (IMTA), with financial support of the World Bank.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1d71229-c3a1-4f93-a342-f755a1931e24": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1d71229-c3a1-4f93-a342-f755a1931e24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue solutions from Latin America and the wider Caribbean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d3023babc1e6ff25b6f211a66c23fa759eb6f7312f18f20eedf1080463b7b05"}, "2": {"node_id": "121a4dbf-10d0-4be6-8a2c-2258242d7a92", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-latin-america-and-wider-caribbean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2612cc5adeeb4bd45e0f8642d3418dcaabacb52a1f9ea6a94b07b6f8121b7b88"}}, "hash": "426ad61425966d5b8b4605334ab46359a5ef4de19324e21b3de355ffd977d5e9", "text": "building blocks Solution components for replication Monitoring and evaluation A science-based monitoring protocol for hydrological, chemical and biological parameters enables the detec- tion of changes over time, thereby increasing the effec- tiveness of restoration actions.

Mangrove restoration Following the restoration of the hydrological flow, mangroves species able to cope with the altered hydrological conditions are planted. This increases the chances that restoration activities will be successful. 98 99 Over the last two decades, Mexico has made great progress in meeting its Aichi Target commitments by consolidating the country\u2019s national marine protected area (MPA) system. In order to generate the desired conservation outcomes and social benefits, however, this network of MPAs must be adequately staffed and managed. Unfortunately, the budget growth of the National Commission for Protected Areas (CONANP) has not kept pace with the expansion of the protected area system and as a result the MPAs are chronically underfunded. Thus, supplementary funding from private, bilateral and multilateral donors is crucial for their effective operation. In order to address these needs and to ensure long-term and sustained funding, a public-private partnership between CONANP and the Mexican Fund for the Conservation of Nature (FMCN) was created. FMCN, in close collaboration with the Mexican government, has financially strengthened 24 federal protected areas. These funds provide sustainable financing and help to ensure that MPAs have the financial and human resources ne- cessary to guarantee the long-term conservation of the coastal and marine ecosystems network. solution sustainable financing of marine protected areas Bah\u00eda de Los \u00c1ngeles Biosphere Reserve and San Lorenzo Archipielago Nation- al Park are MPAs located in the Midriff Islands region of the Gulf of California. Four foundations donated US$ 2.5 million towards a trust fund for the man- agement of these MPAs. Trust fund revenue has enabled protected area staff to triple the number of marine patrols and reduce illegal fishing. It has also permitted the hiring of a staff member to work with local fishermen, the pri- mary users of the protected area. Without this financial support, CONANP would not have the resources or flexibility to address fisheries management challenges. As the area is very remote and the procedures for obtaining fishing permits onerous, most tradi- tional fishermen in the region operate without permits.Thanks to the support from the newly hired CONANP staff, traditional fishermen are finally obtaining fishing permits \u2013 giving them rights over their resources and more incentive to protect them.

Due to its rich marine biodiversity, the park has become a main tourist destina- tion. Coral damage and loss resulting from inexperienced divers and snorkelers, anchoring boats, tourism coastal development and pollution from recreational craft, however, seriously threaten Cabo Pulmo\u2019s fragile ecosystem. To minimise the impact of unregulated recreational activities on the park and its marine life, a collaborative partnership has united local citizens, conservation groups, tourism service providers and park staff in developing and implementing a Public Use and Recreation Programme (PURP). The first step of this process was to determine the actual level of touristic use and carrying capacity of the environment. Based on the results of this study, the stakeholder group limited water sports in the park.

The waters off the coast of San Fernando are among the most productive marine areas in the Humboldt Current Large Marine Ecosystem, home to Humboldt penguins, sea lions and a multitude of marine and shorebirds. The extensive kelp forests along the rocky shore are of great ecological and economic importance. These huge macroal- gae are harvested by local artisanal fishermen, so-called \u00bbalgueros\u00ab, for the commercial production of alginate. In 2009, when the price for kelp increased, macroalgae harvesting in- tensified and San Fernando was declared a protected area at the same time. Local fishermen were initially against giving the area protected status because they feared restrictions on their use of coastal resources. These artisanal fishermen banded together through Comunidad Pes- quera de Marcona (COPMAR), an umbrella organisation of sixteen area fishermen associations. Using a participatory process, COPMAR and its members were able to be involved in the establishment and zoning of the National Reserve. Both the association and fishermen themselves became active partners in the Reserve\u2019s Management Committee. During the process, the importance of macroalgae harvesting for the fishers\u2019 livelihood security was ac- knowledged. Today, the fishermen help avoid macroalgae overexploitation through control and surveillance of its har- vesting, and the minimising of uncontrolled and illegal activities. The co-management approach brought together different associations of fishermen and other stakeholders. The dia- logues created a formal channel for sharing protected area management information and incorporating different per- spectives. Thanks to this inclusive method, area fishermen started to look at the protected area with new eyes. They now see regulating the use of natural resources as an opportunity to ensure that the coastal zone of San Fernando maintains its productivity. solution sustainable macroalgae harvesting in a reserve Sceneries of San Fernando National Reserve with scenic vistas and sea lions surfing \u00a9 Bruno Monteferri, Conservamospornaturaleza.org \u00a9 Bruno Monteferri, Conservamospornaturaleza.org This solution is being implemented by the National Service for Protected Areas of Peru (SERNANP) and the Comunidad Pesque- ra de Marcona (COPMAR), in collaboration with Conservamos por Naturaleza, Sociedad Peruana de Derecho Ambietal (SPDA) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC). building blocks Solution components for replication Dialogue between fishermen and MPA officials Local fishermen are included in creating resource use areas in the national reserve which acknowledge their existing fishing rights.

The Foundation surveyed St. Maarten\u2019s reefs and identified high priority areas for conservation. An economic valuation analysis of the marine ecosystem, using the Coastal Capital methodology (see also solution page 12),revealed the importance of a healthy marine ecosystem to St. Maarten\u2019s economy. Based on the results of both the ecological assessment and economic valuation, the Man of War Shoal National Marine Park was established. A mooring system for dive boats was designed, preventing further damage from anchoring directly on the reef. Prior to and during the establishment of the marine park, the Foundation conducted wide-scale outreach to explain how anchors damage coral reefs. Small businesses in St. Maarten paid for the construction of a mooring system drilled into the substrate once the park was inaugurated. \u00bb The coral reefs of St. Maarten host diverse invertebrate fauna \u00a9 Nature Foundation St. Maarten This solution is being implemented by the Nature Foundation St. Maarten in collaboration with the Dutch Caribbean Nature Alliance. st. maarten building blocks Solution components for replication Economic valuation study A stakeholder survey, based on the Coastal Capital methodology, collects relevant data for a valuation which determines ecosystems value.

This strategy involves halt range- land\u203as degradation by minimizing its underlying causes through enhancing sustainable range management, improving range vegetation cover quantitatively and qualitatively, enhancing local communities\u203a participation in the natural resources manage- ment, raising their awareness thereof, organizing their institutions and strengthening their capacities. Accordingly, such can be supported by establishing projects and activities and implementing the Hima approach to the range resources management. In spite of the decline in the rangelands over the past decades, however, the natural rangelands in Jordan play an important role in meeting the nutritional needs of the livestock, as they are still considered the main pillar of grazing animals\u203a forage and an essential component of the ecosystems. The Ministry of Agricultural in collaboration with the International Union for conservation of Nature-Regional Office for West Asia has striven for the dissemination of rangeland management practices using the participatory approach by implementing projects in Bani Hashem villages in Zarqa Governorate, then transfer these practices to other environmental areas in the Kingdom due to its economic, social and environmental impacts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4774488a-e26c-4c0e-abc5-8c75f2166e51": {"__data__": {"id_": "4774488a-e26c-4c0e-abc5-8c75f2166e51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05cf9cae368c464d1ef661b1f3e013d97bd9ebd15681cc9dd0dc66e85ceb562e"}, "2": {"node_id": "c561507e-0310-4a7a-9d90-8ca04a6a53f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e1217a2f7e6dd44eadeaad5dda08060027183e50dd442e4327dab67f15a0344"}}, "hash": "109150f1c4b71c5985d2208d9b92e32878aa10905e9f2a7a7cf93fc0f25cc9ff", "text": "Studies regarding the assessment of the economic and environmental effects for applying the Hima approach in Jordanian rangelands through the \u00ab Securing Rights and Restoring Lands for Improved Liveli- hood\u00bb project stated that the total value of the accumulative economic losses arising from rangeland\u203as degradation ( only due to direct use for grazing) is around 740 million Jordanian dinar during 1990-2011 and the total value of Jordan natural rangelands (if recovered as was pre-1990 levels) is around 136 million Jordanian dinar. For healthy and sustainable rangelands in Jordan and ensuring the investment options, three main investment packages has been developed in this report as follows: 1.\u00abHima\u00bb Sustainable Range Management And Ecological Livestock Production 2.\u00abHima\u00bb Sustainable Range Management And Production Of Medicinal And Aromatic Range Plants. 3.\u00abHima\u00bb Sustainable Range Management And Eco-tourism We Hope these packages will provide solutions that conserve this national wealth and advance development further ahead.

km\u00b2 in the Badia. For this total area of 23,470 km\u00b2 the value of estimated forage production increase thanks to sustainable range management (SRM) would be 6.7 Million JD on an annual basis. To this the value of 7.8 Million JD/yr of enhanced ground water recharge can be added because of the same range management measures (Westerberg, 4 (2014. Together this meansthat sustainable range management in the here targeted areas can potentially add around 15 Million JD/ year economic value to the economy. This is a minimum estimate as this amount does not take into account that the same sustainable range management will also add value in terms of increased biodiversity, soil carbon sequestration and reduced siltation of water reservoirs. 1.2 Important questions that require to be answered In order to make informed policy decisions in Jordan, at national and local levels, there are a number of pertinent issues that need to be further researched and given answers to: 1. Why would the Jordanian Government and local rangeland users invest in rangeland ecosystem services? 2. What are technically rational, economically viable, and socially acceptable and ecologically sound SRM measures for investing in the Jordan rangelands? 3. How benefits of ecosystem services can be valued so as to justify the cost of SRM investments 4. What other investments are necessary to create an enabling environment (local governance and management, other) for sustainable range management? 5. What kind of investors can be engaged in range management that will both strengthen a more business oriented approach to range management and comply with concerns of long-term sustainable use? With these questions in mind further study has been made by the Ministry of Agriculture and IUCN ROWA, so as to come to provisional proposals in May 2015. The main objective of this further study is to explore and propose viable options for sustainable investments in the Jordan rangelands that are of interest to Jordan\u2019s government, civil society and its business community, while articulating why such investments are necessary and important for the country and for long-term sustainability of rangeland management. 1.3 Methodology Preparatory work has been undertaken in the past year on a GIS5 based study to select watersheds with productive range- land potential), a detailed study to vegetation recovery and dynamics in selected rangeland sites, within these productive rangeland watersheds6 .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e961b22-92f1-46bc-ac40-9bef049cb5bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e961b22-92f1-46bc-ac40-9bef049cb5bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb8917cc25c305bfc5f9c79cec4888d17b7e23b8f444a2f1a63fa38ba8410dce"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd14e125-716d-4022-a894-96f2aa59a96d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e901b1677eb1348d0e39a64e6b18b2167548bef02b342578bbbb9ab9fe70be9"}}, "hash": "04773fa357f48dd5ca6abc38823eb8b003bec1b2996d976b742436a6f33fe732", "text": "Outcomes of these studies are summarized in section 3.5 of the next chapter on the available rangeland resource base in Jordan.

This workshop took place from 20 to 22 April 2015 in Amman and this report articulates the proposals and rational for tangible investments in the Jordan rangelands as well as for the enabling policy environment that needs to be put in place to make such investments sustainable and effective. The workshop was characterized by a high degree of interactive work in two sub-groups, supported by insights gained from earlier preparatory work done (see section 2.8), Jordan policy documents such as the NAP on combatting desertification (MoEnv, 2015) and the new Rangeland Strategy (MoA, 2013), and the above mentioned Technical brief on sustainably investing in rangelands. The work done identified viable options for government and private investments that are profitable while at the same time preserving in a sustainable the rangeland resource basis (the natural capital of the rangelands).

These investments aim to recover the rich resources of these areas in a long-term sustainable and economically viable way, while at the same time improving the living conditions of Bedouin and other local communities who are living here and are the main land users and custodians of the rangelands. This study on investment options in the Jordan Rangelands builds importantly on the orientations given by the recent Rangeland Strategy of the Ministry of Agriculture (2013) and further elaborates on the Aligned National Action Plan to Combat Desertification (2020-2015) as developed with the Ministry of Environment (2015). An important basis for this study is furthermore given by studies on economic valuation (Jabarin, 2014), a GIS mapping for selecting high potential rangeland watersheds for investment (Al Bakri 2015) and detailed vegetation dynamics studies in 4 selected range sites in the Jordan Badia and Steppe areas (Abu Zanat, 2015). The last two studies as well as this study on investment options have been made possibly by DANIDA funding for the \u201cSustainable Dryland Landscapes\u201d project implemented with the IUCN Global Dryland Initiative and Regional IUCN Offices in Burkina Faso and Kenya as well as \u2013 together with the Ministry of Agriculture - the IUCN Regional Office for West Asia in Jordan.

Investments in these areas until now are however limited and when made, have often contributed to land degradation and exhausting the natural resource basis. Different economic valuation studies have approximated the monetary value of rangelands (restoration), notably by estimating the cost of imported fodder grains that can be saved when replaced by natural forage (as such or as a result of sustainably managed rangelands).

An assessment made over a 24 years period (2013-1990) estimates at 16 million JD/year the average value of total range forage production of all rangelands in 1 to 3 months (depending rainfall) over this period. This value can be used as a proxy for the economic value of the rangelands in terms of a potential national saving when imported fodder is replaced by natural forage production from well managed rangelands. The study on rangeland investment options has used a slightly different valuation approach that is based on the factual and more recent results in four different range sites of the above mentioned ground truthing studies for this project. Also here the increase in available palatable forage dry matter production2 thanks to controlled grazing management is valued against cost of equivalent purchased fodder (barley). A total value of increased forage production in moderate rainfall years3 is then estimated at 4.7 Million JD/yr for the 10,000 km\u00b2 of Steppe areas lands and at 18.5 Million JD/year for the 71,000 km\u00b2 of the Badia. The total for both areas would then be 23.2 Million JD/year which can be used as a value of rangeland restoration and management. As a possibly realistic priority target at the national level the potentially productive areas/watersheds for rangeland management mentioned above are used as a geographic basis for investment strategies: 3,300 km\u00b2 in the Steppe areas 1 Ministry of Environment - Desk study (Jabarin , 2014) for the (UNCCD Jordan NAP 2020 -2015 2 As compared to actual estimations of DM forage production in Steppe and Badia areas in open access situations (100 resp. 40 kg/ha) 3 Production in moderate rainfall years being estimated at 50 % of the production in high rainfall years as experienced in the winter of 2015/2014 8 1 2 11 2.2 Rangeland resources in Jordan The rangelands in Jordan are found in the arid (< 200 mm/yr) and semi-arid (200 \u2013 500 mm/yr) Agro-ecological Zones of Jordan: the steppe areas (200 \u2013 350 mm/year) in the southern and middle highlands in the western parts of the country, as well as in the area between the highlands and the eastern desert; and the Badia, the desert areas in the east and south of the country, occupying about 80% of Jordan and receiving less than 200 mm rainfall/year. The main ecosystem types are native grasslands, shrub lands and woodlands. There is no clearly defined boundary to the rangelands. Boundaries move according to climatic conditions (MoA, updated Rangeland Strategy, 2013). The rangelands are a strong element in the Jordanian culture, historical course, social imagery and history, and have a signifi- cant cultural and heritage value. The land area of Jordan\u2019s rangelands depends largely on the definition adopted. An inclusive definition joins together much of the desert, the steppe region and the highlands, thus identifying some 97% of the land area of Jordan as \u2018rangelands\u2019 (MoA, Rangeland Strategy, 2013). Rangelands are here considered as \u201cthe wide-open, non-fenced lands where fodder grow naturally, that are not suitable for traditional farming due to lack of rain, low fertility, rough terrain and high rockiness or because of a combination of these factors, which makes the lands optimum use restricted to production of fodder for animals\u201d (MoA, Rangeland Strategy, 2013). However, if only the regions unsuitable for rain-fed cropping, with rainfall below 200 mm annually, are defined as range this would give a figure near to 80%of the total land area. The Agriculture Law No. 20 for the year 1973 defined the ranges as \u201call lands registered as such and any other state-owned lands where annual rainfall is below 200 mm and that do not have sus- tainable irrigation, or the lands confined for public use\u201d. Since 1985 there has been an acceleration of all types of agriculture, gradually eating into the area of the rangeland (MoA, Rangeland Strategy, 2013). In the past the range resources in the rangelands used to sustain the flocks of grazing animals most of the year.

This means that the traditional pastoral systems are at risk and about 250,000 of inhabitants (5%of Jordan\u2019s population) engaging directly or indirectly in pastoral activities will be severely affected (MoA, Rangeland Strategy 2013). 2.3 Land use in the Jordan rangelands The most significant economic use of the rangelands is pastoralism. The most common animal herded is sheep, although goats are more numerous in the south. This represents a major change from camel production, which was predominant until the 1940s. Camels are still kept in certain areas, but their numbers are much reduced. This change has almost certainly af- fected the vegetation patterns as the large thorny bushes that camels graze cannot be eaten by sheep or goats. Controlled systems of land use in the rangelands, such as the Hima system (a traditional conservation system used by Bedouins to organize grazing and keep lands protected and conserved) persisted until the early twentieth century. Given the extremely low rainfall, the rangelands are not usually regarded as suitable for agriculture. However, cropping is common all along the western edge of the rangelands. The most common agricultural pattern is rainfed winter barley. Yields are however so poor that it is difficult to consider this production of economic value (MoA Rangeland Strategy, 2013). 10 Rangeland Resource Base in Jordan7 2.1 Rangeland resources in the world Worldwide, in the dry and more humid lands, rangeland cover 51% of the total land area of the world (World Resources Institute, 1986). Rangeland covers between two thirds and three quarters of the world\u2019s dryland area, and make up there roughly 30%of the earth surface. Drylands are tropical and temperate areas with an aridity index of less than 0.65 that collectively cover nearly half of the land mass: 41.3%of the earth surface (Safriel et al, 2005). Drylands are home to a third of all humanity - about 2.5 billion people, with the majority living in developing countries (Middleton et al, 2011). Figure 1. Land uses by dryland category (MEA, 2005) 7 Sections 3.2 through 3.5 of this chapter owe much to the recently updated Rangeland Strategy published by the Ministry of Agriculture (2013); this strategy provides a good overview of the basic facts pertinent to rangeland management in Jordan. This report on rangeland investments considers this information as an important reference for a better understanding of the proposals made for sustainable investments in the Jordan rangelands Sustainably Investing in Rangelands political borders no longer allow them to cross over into other countries and, as a result, Jordan\u2019s limited rangeland resourc- es now have rare opportunities to regenerate. The change to a non-migratory grazing regime has put stress on the land as the Bedouins now keep their livestock year-round in roughly the same place (Al-Tabini et al. 2012). With the elimination of these systems and rights, and the declaration of grazing lands as state-owned land, open for everybody, new land uses be- came prominent such as overgrazing and early grazing of range plants, ploughing of rangelands to establish ownership and property rights, urbanization, uprooting of bushes for use as fuel wood, arbitrary movement of vehicles, quarries and mining activities. Many of these areas were over-used without consideration to their resource requirements or their productivity. The change in land tenure also discouraged pastoralists and Bedouins to maintain and conserve their resources and lands and control their grazing. 2.5 Resource rights in the Jordan rangelands Indeed, according to formal laws, land nowadays can be owned individually or by groups in Jordan, where the state claims ownership over all uncultivated or non-built-up land, including pastoral areas.

Although pastoral land is now claimed as government property, traditionally the land is considered tribal domain with full rights of use by the tribe. This creates land use conflicts and also leads to mismanagement of the natural resources lead- ing to overgrazing and desertification. These changes in resource rights and landownership have indeed led to important degradation of the rangelands; and a review of these resource rights would greatly assist in setting new strategies for their development and improvement (MoA, Rangeland Strategy, 2013). 13 Box 2. Land degradation in the drylands In the drylands, land degradation is often called desertification. Land degradation is defined as a process of \u2018persistent reduction of biological and economic productivity\u2019 of the land itself (Adeel et al, 2005). Many consider land degradation as \u2018the greatest environmental challenge of our time\u201d and \u201ca threat to global well-being\u201d(UNCCD, ).

Technical Brief on Sustainably Investing in Rangelands 12 Livestock, predominantly sheep and goats, contributes about 55% of the agricultural production in Jordan. The animals are generally raised on a crop-residue, planted fodder and barley grain based system with the rangeland contributing about one month (about 8%) of livestock feeding in normal years. The rangeland contribution to animal feed is severely reduced in over- grazed areas and during extended drought years. The maximum potential contribution of improved rangeland is not expected to exceed 30% of the daily feed requirements of one adult sheep or goat (MoA, Rangeland Strategy, 2013). Supplementary feed has been encouraged by the government barley subsidies and reducing forage availability and has as a result led to decreasing profit margins of producers and low competitiveness of their products at national and international markets, due to the increasing world market prices for imported fodder. Twenty years of subsidies and ease of transporta- tion around the desert have encouraged the livestock industry to become dependent on imported barley, which accounted for 63% of feed costs for producers. The government policy for subsidizing prices of imported inputs especially during the dry seasons has also encouraged livestock herders to keep large number of animals exceeding the carrying capacity of the rangeland and hence contributing to rangeland degradation (MoA, Rangeland Strategy, 2013). 2.4 Range management in Jordan Since ancient times Jordan\u2019s grazing lands were characterized by effective traditional land tenure systems and grazing rights which were associated with tribal institutions. Bedouin tribes practiced a traditional land management system expressed by the term \u201cdirah,\u201d the area throughout which a group migrated, including pasture and some cultivated zones. They used a grazing system known as \u201cHima\u201d in which good forage within a tribe\u2019s territories was sought out while heavily grazed land was allowed to lie fallow to recover. Within the dirah, certain good grazing areas, such as wadis and marabs (wadi fluvial outwash zones that are typically well vegetated), traditionally \u201cbelong to\u201d individual families and clans whose property rights are recognised and respected by others. This protected the resources in these lands and organized their use in a way that assisted in their conservation and continued productivity under the prevailing environmental and social conditions. Fifty years ago, nomadic Bedouins raised their live- stock with no regard to political borders, venturing into Jordan, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, as well as locations around the Iraqi borders. They migrated with their livestock to nearby lands in order to let the forage and resources in their original local areas regenerate without the interference of their sheep, using a \u2018Hima-like\u2019 system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c6bfd92-08a1-43bb-b19c-e441f9e3b905": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c6bfd92-08a1-43bb-b19c-e441f9e3b905", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ed792b7ff2d2ca24df25a28aafbef580f9153a5035cb787dee61f0609c8ab83"}, "2": {"node_id": "82e77ed9-3924-4436-8e30-b65c343519fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f915e3a03bea7a07de026d7cd18912675b7d0c3401c02908eff26e8b19c09e00"}}, "hash": "da30b8bd3051a24b2b5e3b39d671360b8229b4f756bb4b17b84c9235270860a2", "text": "In those days, around 74% of livestock owners used to travel to the east of Jordan (Al Hammad region) for grazing purposes, and 55% were also entering into Syria and 30% into Saudi Arabia due to droughts in Jordan (MoA, Rangeland Strategy, 2013).

Technical Brief on Sustainably Investing in Rangelands 2.Rangeland Resource Base in Jordan Sustainably Investing in Rangelands 2.7 Recent studies on rangeland potential Selection of rangeland watersheds A GIS study5 was done for the Jordan Badia, east of the highlands, to identify watersheds with high potential for rangeland development. 16 main rangeland watersheds with 69 sub-watersheds have been identified (Figure 2) to have such potential and are characterized by altitude and topography, rainfall, soil characteristics, vegetation zone and type and type of land ownership11 . These 69 sub-watersheds were selected out of a total of 437 watersheds in the Badia (< 200 mm average rainfall). These watersheds that are considered having productive development potential represent 28.512 % of all the Badia rangelands in Jordan east of the highlands. Box 3 provides insights on the criteria used to come to this selection. The map on the next page indicates where these watersheds are located. After the work done on the GIS study it was decided in a stakeholder meeting that rangelands in the highlands may also be considered as relevant for rangeland development. Hence, to the 16 watersheds in the Badia can be added relevant watersheds in the semi-arid zones of the highlands with rainfall between 200 and 350 mm. Box 3.

Parameter Criteria for selection (inclusion) Vegetation - Selected sites shall include different types of vegetation and wide ranges of NDVI. - Condition of vegetation: high potential for recovery as indicated by field visits and previous work of Ministry of Agriculture. - Areas must be important for local communities (in terms of grazing resources). Ecological importance - Areas that include different bioclimatic gradient or rangeland ecosystems. Land use plans - Areas that show no conflict with other activities (industrial, mining, housing and tourism) in the present or in the near future. Social - Areas with communities that showed interest or previous experience in community-based participation in rangeland protection. On the basis of field visits and subject matter expertise four range sites were selected for ground-truthing and further study, including a range site in the western escarpment of the highlands descending into the Jordan Valley. These are: 1. Hima Bani Hasshim site in Zarqa Watershed (Zarqa Basin) 2. Kharraneh-Fraisheen site in Shaumari Watershed (Azraq Basin) 3. Ayra Reserve site in Ayra Watershed (Jordan Valley Basin) 4. Husseiniyah site in Al Hasa (al Khor) Watershed (Jafir Basin) The map in Figure 3 locates these four range sites, while Table 2 provides an overview of their geo-physical characteristics.

Visual estimation of vegetation cover was fair (10-25%) for Kharraneh-Fraisheen and Al-Husseiniyah sites and good (> 25%) for Hima BaniHashim and Ayra Reserve. Prolonged history of destructive grazing at the four sites has depleted most of the forage species. Biomass production of palatable and non-palatable plants in the period of investigation was high (563 to 1164 kg/ha) due to the very good rainfall the winter of 2014/2015 (see Table 3 below). Even in view of the long history of irrational use, notably overgrazing, the biomass measured this year must be considered as a maximum potential productivity of rangelands", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d40772f7-d109-41e6-aad7-b2feb919ef09": {"__data__": {"id_": "d40772f7-d109-41e6-aad7-b2feb919ef09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa6f867166ed7f778648c4caa886441fe29e72801adf5c1458d3e55c5365fddd"}, "3": {"node_id": "78d337b4-2996-4116-8f19-913835bd5116", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f32569ae10cf0d6c1643ccdabbdbf28bd52f970be4dd42603b5c7be8bfd03edc"}}, "hash": "7ed5d859554db7d7b903ae8dd668ed7d6eef3b9f223671eeb864f1e36485ee4a", "text": "in Jordan (Abu Zanat, 2015). Nevertheless the measurements demonstrate that recovery of vegetation is fast and can be accomplished in a period of two years. It is worth mentioning that there are innovations in pasture management elsewhere that need to be introduced to Jordan, based not on the number of animals but the duration of grazing and recovery periods . Grazing practice could be described as uncontrolled for Kharraneh-Fraisheen and Al-Husseiniyahsites, fairly controlled at some parts of Eyra reserve and controlled at Hima Bani Hashem. Besides grazing, several agricultural activities, especially cultivation of barley, are taking place within sites (Kharraneh-Fraisheen and Al-Husseiniyah) or at the boundaries on private lands (Eyra reserve). The studies done in the four selected rangeland sites have not provided clear-cut evidence under what grazing management vegetation recovery and biomass production is highest. The two sites with higher scores are also situated in areas with better rainfall and possibly better soils. However, in both these sites grazing management was better controlled, either by Hima communal management (Hima Bani Hashim) or as a range reserve by the MoA (Eyra). In the other two sites (Al Fraisheen and Husseinieh) grazing was under a more or less open access modality. Without much doubt, the protection that was provided by the controlled grazing regimes has contributed to the high performance of vegetation recov- ery. To note that the majority of rangelands in Jordan are treasury lands where the right of use is guaranteed or secured for local communities but the ownership of these lands is not granted. In reality, the tribes still claim that these lands are tribal lands and should be solely used by certain tribes. Another lesson learned from the participatory range studies is that herders prefer to graze their flocks on areas without any disputes on land tenure and this issue is one of the entry points to promote the idea of Hima or community-management of grazing lands (see Box 4 below). Box 4. Hima Revival and Biodiversity Conservation The Bani Hashem community in Zarqa watershed presents a successful example of the re-introduction of the Hima system. The reviving of the Hima system at Bani Hashem villages is an attempt for showcasing how strengthening local community capacities (of both women and men) enables them to protect and manage their land resources in proper communal efforts that will be reflected positively on their natural resources as well as socio-economic growth. The community (supported by the Ministry of Agriculture) has identified 1500 hectares of public forest land that they refer to as \u201cthe last green area\u201d in the rapidly industrialising Zarqa river basin area. Negotiations between the Bani Hashem community and the Directorate of Rangelands and Badia Development, involving the prime minister\u2019s office were carried out to grant the community the right to manage the lands as rangelands. Approval was given to the community to start management on 100 Ha, to be scaled up to 1500 Ha if this management attempt proves to be successful. Through the EU funded \u201cSecuring Rights and Restoring Lands for Improved Livelihoods\u201d project, led by IUCN ROWA, the community at Bani Hashem has developed a local tribal law, called \u201cMeathak Sharaf\u201d, to help enforce the new land management system by restricting grazing. Meathak Sharaf has been endorsed by the Zarqa governor who represents the local government and can help enforce the law. The Ministry of Agriculture has established a community based group (Hima Bani Hashem CBO) to follow up and sustain the process. After one year of activities and protecting their Hima area from free-grazing by herders but without using any fencing, biodiversity benefits have already become observed through the increase of biomass and restoration of indigenous floral species such as Artemisia herba-alba. Protecting the pilot area allowed shrubs and grasses to regenerate, restoring the land\u2019s vegetation. A total of 36 native plant species were recorded in the site, mainly in the area that receives the highest rainfall. Source: IUCN- ROWA and MoA (MoA, Rangeland Strategy, 2013) Figure 3.

In 2004 the National Water Master Plan was prepared which provided more of a focus on environmental impact than before. Subsequently, the Jor- dan Water Authority produced a strategic plan for 2008-2012, which focused on operational efficiency. In 2008 a new national water plan, \u2018Water for Life 2008-2022\u2019, incorporated climate change obligations into its strategy and policies, especially the prospect for reduced water resources in future.\u201d n view of the importance for Jordan to make as efficient use of its scarce water resources and the potential of the rangelands to increase ground water recharge The MWI would be an important actor for SRM in Jordan. Ministry of Environment The Aligned National Action Plan to Combat Desertification of 2015 has four Strategic Objectives: 1: To improve the living conditions of affected populations. 2: To improve the condition of affected ecosystems. 3: To generate global benefits through effective implementation of the UNCCD/NAP. 4: To mobilize resources to support implementation of the Convention through building effective partnerships between national and international actors These 4 strategic objectives will be implemented through 5 Operational Objectives: 1: Advocacy, Awareness Raising and Education. 2: Policy Framework. 3: Science, Technology and Knowledge. 4: Capacity Building. 5: Financing and Technology Transfer. The importance of the rangelands for soil carbon sequestration, climate change adaptation and biodiversity will require strong involvement of the MoE in further developments around SRM The Hashemite Fund for Development of Jordan Badia \u201cIts 2008 Master Plan highlighted the socio-economic challenges in the Badia and their integration to natural resources man- agement with a focus on water and rangeland resources. Proposed diversification of sources of income, and exploring al- ternative income earning possibilities in the Badia, to reduce dependence on livestock keeping. This will reduce some pres- sures on the rangelands and help to ease land degradation from overgrazing. It included nine specific themes including one theme on \u2018youth and environment\u2019.\u201d Its strong focus on community development makes the Hashemite Fund for the development of the Badia a key player in any further strategy for SRM. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources An updated Master Strategy of Energy Sector for the period 2007-2020 was prepared in 2007 by The Royal Commission. Whilst not directly linked to climate change obligations, the following proposals were related to GHG mitigations and some adaptation measures: \u2022 Alternatives to crude oil and oil by-products supply; \u2022 Proceed with a renewable energy law to stimulate the private sector to increase its investments in this field; \u2022 Implement wind energy projects for electricity generation; \u2022 Complete necessary studies for thermal solar energy projects; \u2022 Focus studies on biogas fuel for the industrial and transport sector; \u2022 Create a fund to aid renewable energy projects; and \u2022 Implement Energy Consumption Efficiency Programmes. 20 T A B L E 3 Main vegetation characteristics of selected rangeland sites 13 Range site Bani Hasshim Al Fraisheen Husseiniyah Ayra Watershed Zarqa Shaumari Al Hasa Ayra Vegetation type Batha Steppe Chert Hammada Chert Hammada Mediterranean non-forest Vegetation structure 2 layers: shrubs and herbaceous 2 layers: shrubs and herbaceous 2 layers: shrubs and herbaceous 2 layers: shrubs and herbaceous Vegetation coverage Good (59%) Fair (36%) Fair (25%) Good (45%) Nr of reported species 56 34 20 40 Fresh biomass: Non-palatable* Palatable DM palatable Kg/ha 209 955 478 Kg/ha 167 439 220 Kg/ha 200 363 182 Kg/ha 183 691 346 Use Controlled Grazing + medicinal plants Uncontrolled Grazing + Barley Uncontrolled Grazing + Barley Uncontrolled Grazing + Barley + Olives Threats None Land tenure conflicts +barley Land tenure conflicts +barley None Investment potential (size, access) Limited area; moderate access; Sizable area; easy access; Sizable area; easy access Sizable area; moderate access; Investment potential (graz.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc38fbaf-cec2-4ec5-85a4-f72fde332a29": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc38fbaf-cec2-4ec5-85a4-f72fde332a29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca304f3d42a371554101d4c25b07f3836173bd63dff93e8be7ed86633313b63f"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7f77894-d856-4eb2-99c0-9ba3aada7416", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c06fd1d53abd1265a8734fc0c09370c445319db09624e128c5edb4b1794df989"}}, "hash": "14522252895dd994134b3167dd685dbab353ba79570501977d94e7d18803b7c6", "text": "index) good grazability; index: 43 fair grazability; index: 38 fair grazability; index: 36 good grazability; index: 40 \u2022 Non-palatable: poisonous, thorny, hairy 2.8 Key Stakeholders and their interests There is no in-depth substantial stakeholder analysis done yet as relevant to their engagement in activities in the Rangelands.

Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities The National Tourism Strategy set out a mission that \u201cJordan will develop a sustainable tourism economy through a partner- ship of government, the private sector and civil society to expand employment, entrepreneurial opportunity, social benefits, industry profits and state revenue\u201d. The strategy stated that tourism development will be sustainable and characterized by: \u2022 Preserving the environment and adopting ecologically sound policies; \u2022 Respecting the lifestyles and cultures of the people and communities; and, \u2022 Balancing the principles of profits with the need for socially responsible business practices. \u2022 The National Tourism Strategy for 2004-2010 relied on private-sector initiatives to develop tourism into a major income-generating sector. Whilst this Strategy placed an emphasis on ecotourism it did not address the need to monitor or measure the impact of tourism on biodiversity, for example. The strategy did highlight the importance that community-based tourism would play. The important potential to combine SRM with ecotourism will make it important to involve also closely the Ministry of Tourism in further strategizing for SRM. Other important key stakeholders that need to be involved in further strategizing for SRM in the Jordan Rangelands are: Treasury Lands Directorate in the Department of Land and Survey of the Treasury of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. As formal owner of most of the land in the Badia and the Steppe areas, their early involvement in further SRM activities is a must. The Jordan Cooperative Association. As discussed in this report high importance is given to herder cooperatives for the local development and implementation of SRM activities. It is only logical then that an umbrella body at the national level will get closely involved as a spokesman for them at the national level As discussed in section 5.4, it will be important to engage in detailed stakeholder analysis exercises in the areas selected for further work on SRM. 2.Rangeland Resource Base in Jordan 22 3 Range Investment Packages and Their Environmental Impact 3.1 Preamble and principles Through different consultation meetings with rangeland key stakeholders and resource persons to come up with proposals for a number of investment packages feasible to be implemented in the Jordan rangelands. These proposals are formulated with a concern for being realistic and effective, in the interest of local range users as well as Jordanian society at large, while they are intended to contribute both to the national economy of Jordan and to preserve the rich resources of Jordan\u2019s range- lands in a sustainable way. The proposals here developed are informed by the conceptual framework for sustainable investments in rangelands and by the different strategies developed by the Jordanian Ministries discussed in this report, by the recent preparatory work implemented and discussed in section 4.6 and foremost by the knowledge and experience about the Jordan rangelands of the participants to these \u201crangeland investment options\u201d workshops set-up by IUCN-ROWA and Ministry of Agriculture. With \u201cinvestments\u201d we mean here all technical and non-technical options or measures that Government, civil society and private sector could consider to ensure sustainable production of rangelands and consequently improve the livelihoods of pastoral communities.

Value chains in land use related economic activity have to ensure that the resource basis is well managed for productive activities being sustainable. Hence an important emphasis is given to integrated range management and soil and water conservation. The proposed value chains are developed around two land use production systems typical for range ecosystems, ecological livestock production and protection and production of medicinal and aromatic plants. Further value chain development and marketing is necessary to deal with everything from production through processing, trade and marketing to delivery of products to consumers. Eco-tourism can be considered as another form of land use, capitalizing on the scenery and history of the landscape. Evi- dence from other countries indicates that availability and development of renewable energy resources can activate systemic change that in turn, would accelerate further progress towards sustainable land use production and consumption in many other sectors14 . Together with eco-tourism renewable energy provision provides also important leverage to finance and pay for ecosystem services provided by the rangelands and to economically enhance the development of these value chains. The interactions between these different investment components can be depicted as is done in Figure 4. Figure 4. A land use related value chain considering environmental, social and economic aspects (Jennings, 2014).

Much of this is determined by how well social and cultural values are respected and to what extent the land use production systems contribute to livelihoods, food security and health. The production systems themselves form the basis for a complex process of service and inputs provision, processing, packaging, trading, transport, marketing etc. that together will provide the added value that can make the land use production system economically interesting. The proposed investment packages have therefore emphasized the need for investments in further value chain development. Where it is beyond the scope of this study to elaborate in detail what this would entail for the three investment packages proposed, it will require the social organization of the different actors that can play a role in each value chain, their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0bcee2c-395c-48ae-81b8-06ae33f96d6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0bcee2c-395c-48ae-81b8-06ae33f96d6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3ee6607874a9f5d5345ede8a77900008fc2a9f990ddf1f11ec7e62855d1a421"}}, "hash": "a3ee6607874a9f5d5345ede8a77900008fc2a9f990ddf1f11ec7e62855d1a421", "text": "comple- mentary engagement so as to create win-win situations to develop a value chain that is of interest and profit to all actors involved. For development of the here proposed value chains also Investments in the related legal and organizational frame- works need to be assured. Further value chain and actor analysis can best be done for well determined significantly large geographic investment areas in Jordan suitable for the promotion of high value-generation sustainable land use activities compatible with the policies and traditions of the country, such as those as are presented in Chapter 3. Such investment areas could possibly be labelled as \u201cRangeland Ecological Economic Zones\u201d. They need to be prioritized with the key stakeholders to be involved and probably be situated around bigger towns that can serve as a pull factor for produce from the land use production systems; this would apply also to the investment package around eco-tourism activities. An initial selection of such geographic areas could pos- sibly be made on the basis of the 16 watersheds in the Badia as well as other rangeland watersheds in the Jordan highlands not covered by the GIS exercise in the Badia. A value chain analysis with relevant stakeholders could follow the Stakeholder Dialogue and Concerted Action (SDCA) Approach as described in Chapter 5.3. The following sections of this chapter will deal with the economic rationale for investments such as here proposed, and the economic valuation of eco-system services needed to substantiate such rationale. Chapter 5 will elaborate on the crucial role that needs to be played in these investment packages by local community organizations and what is needed for them in terms of local governance measures to be functional and effective. Chapter 6 will close this study by stressing that in order for these investment packages and the related value chains to have impact, important enabling investments have also to be made at the national level so as to \u201cunlock\u201d investments by the private sector and local community organizations. 4.2 Fostering ecosystem service benefits for more sustainable range management Where most services provided by actors in value chains can be rather easily valued in economic terms (cost and benefits largely being dependent on market dynamics), this is more difficult to assess for the many services provided by the range ecosystems. A good number of the benefits of these ecosystem services are mentioned in Chapter 3 detailing the different investment packages. The interventions proposed here aim to impact and strengthen the range ecosystems so as to sustain the land use production systems proposed. This will ensure that local range users are rewarded for the management of these range ecosystems and that the range ecosystems are rewarded for their benefits. Among direct (on-site) impacts are mentioned: reduced soil erosion, increased soil moisture, improved soil fertility, and hence improved vegetation quality and density, higher forage productivity and - with more available drinking water for animals - increased livestock production (quantity and quality), especially if this is done by applying ecological sound land practices. These impacts would lead to higher incomes and improved livelihoods as well as an increase in job opportunities in range areas. The organization and management of specific sites with valuable medicinal, aromatic and other plants could further add to the benefits of well managed rangelands and biodiversity, while in range areas in the vicinity of historic and otherwise cultural interesting places further added value could be brought by investing in eco-tourism activities that would support and strengthen investments in SRM. Many of these positive direct impacts of ecosystem services, if well managed, contribute to important benefits for society as depicted in the diagram below. Figure 5. Multiple benefits of sustainable rangelands management (Mc Gahey et al, 2014) 4.Economic Rationale for Investing in the Jordan Rangelands 31 30 Sustainably Investing in Rangelands rational for making local investments in physical assets and in local range governance by both governments and the private sector. In the case of rangelands, economic valuation in the rangelands needs to take into account sufficient scale and the larger landscape. In many cases valuation tools focus on the value or benefits of provided ecosystem services such as: \u2022 Provision of range forage \u2022 Value wild species/biodiversity; \u2022 Ground water recharge; \u2022 Increased surface water; \u2022 Reduced siltation; \u2022 Soil carbon sequestration. In recent efforts in Jordan to explore the validity of valuation tools the following have been tried out (Westerberg and Myint, 2014): \u2022 Valuing range restoration and subsequent increase of forage through avoided cost of purchase of imported fodder \u2022 Valuing increased ground water recharge or surface water collection due to rangeland restoration", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbfbf292-5a97-4be6-bb37-02d2ef8374b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbfbf292-5a97-4be6-bb37-02d2ef8374b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "100e5af2f911e1b7705c955a53c2ff46c9b7b683cdac7a7fba6be08a38ad4c27"}, "3": {"node_id": "6fd88e21-f56e-41a7-8f11-f060d1b488d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df9c8bb263c5786107cf7a555eba9859b1925558e6f6c96e406361d301656cd4"}}, "hash": "7e708047bec85bd9238c68ed5874daece35ce9614a1cb1143d57874a80e65a1d", "text": "by willingness to pay (WTP) for trucked water. \u2022 Valuing range land restoration, resulting in reduced sedimentation of downstream dams, by avoided cost of extra water storage (reservoir) replacement. \u2022 Valuing additional carbon sequestration due to rangeland restoration by estimating avoided Social Cost of Carbon as a discounted value of damage by climate change in terms of decreased agricultural production, harm to human health and damage from rising sea levels. \u2022 Valuing range land restoration by estimating the implementation, management and opportunity cost associated with restoration and surveyed use. Important questions need still to be answered with regard to complexity, applicability of different valuation tools and the assumptions made. Further work is very much needed, especially on valuing soil carbon sequestration. Box 5. Valuation of rangeland ecosystem services in terms of forage production Valuation Tool Notes Estimated value 1 Monetary value of the rangelands in terms of cost of saved animal fodder purchase by its replacement by natural forage (dry matter, DM) from the rangeland (Westerberg, 2014) Based on complex rotational grazing assumptions and formulas (see reference) 16.8 Million JD/yr 2 Monetary value of the rangelands in terms of cost of saved animal fodder purchase by its replacement by natural forage (dry matter, DM) from the rangeland (Jordan UNCCD NAP /Jabarin, 2014) Based on saved barley/straw/wheat barn consumption per animal (times total nr of animals per year, for each year from 1990 \u2013 2013) and grazing periods between 1 and 3 months dependent on annual rainfall in each year 16 Million JD/yr 3 Monetary value of average lost rangeland productivity (forage DM) in tons of barley equivalents over the 1990 -2013 period (barley 211 JD/ton) - (Jordan UNCCD NAP/ Jabarin, 2014) I kg DM forage = 0.4 kg barley; 50 % grazable area; 1990 - 2013: 200 -100 kg/ha for Steppe and 80 - 40 kg/ha for Badia; Pos- sibly conservative estimate as % of forage/ palatable species is assumed to be only 50% of total biomass produced; 4.8 Million JD/yr 33 What is important to emphasize here for the rangeland ecosystems, and probably for many other ecosystems, is the critical role of hydrological cycles. If well managed, they are in many situations the key for securing other important ecosystem ser- vices as is depicted in the diagram below. Without preserving the water cycles in an ecosystem other ecosystem services, from soil fertility to biodiversity and carbon sequestration will be much less performing. This in turn will impact negatively the benefits ecosystem services can provide to society as a whole. It is for this reason that in the investment packages proposed in chapter 3 important emphasis is given to soil and water conservation interventions. If well taken care of, investments in soil and water conservation will induce higher soil fertility, higher biomass and biodiversity, better ground water recharge and important for the rangelands higher carbon sequestration. Figure 6. The \u201cvalue chain\u201d of ecosystem service benefits In the case of the Jordan rangelands, on the basis of the natural capital vested in its ecosystem services, further investments in livestock services (veterinary and artificial insemination) would lead to reduced mortality and further increases of livestock production. This in turn will lead to increased economic activity in rural range areas with new job opportunities created, and most probably contributing to a reduction of rural \u2013urban migratory flows and social urban tensions. The important question here is how to give value to these ecosystem services, to the cost of their maintenance or if this is not taken care of to the cost of land degradation and the loss of rangeland productivity. The next section will explore what valuation tools can be used or have already been used in Jordan for this purpose. 4.3 Valuation tools for the Jordan rangelands Comprehensive economic valuation is required to demonstrate the economic value and potential, both on-site and off-site (externalities) of above mentioned ecosystem services and their benefits for SRM and society. For instance \u201cdownstream\u201d (in terms of watersheds or value chains) consumers benefit from higher and more regular water supply, hydropower, protection from floods and draughts. They enjoy the benefits of these ecosystem services but have not made the efforts to maintain them; in sort they benefit from the efforts of others made in the \u201cupstream\u201d rangelands.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fd88e21-f56e-41a7-8f11-f060d1b488d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fd88e21-f56e-41a7-8f11-f060d1b488d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "100e5af2f911e1b7705c955a53c2ff46c9b7b683cdac7a7fba6be08a38ad4c27"}, "2": {"node_id": "fbfbf292-5a97-4be6-bb37-02d2ef8374b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e708047bec85bd9238c68ed5874daece35ce9614a1cb1143d57874a80e65a1d"}}, "hash": "df9c8bb263c5786107cf7a555eba9859b1925558e6f6c96e406361d301656cd4", "text": "On-site valuation can provide evi- dence for direct economic benefits to the local range users and positive valuation outcomes should be used as an important 32 4.Economic Rationale for Investing in the Jordan Rangelands 15 The 16 watersheds in the Badia identified by the GIS study (Al Bakri, 2015) have a total surface area of 20,170 km\u00b2, which", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38c2a4c4-e12e-4162-8e07-611ed2024b8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "38c2a4c4-e12e-4162-8e07-611ed2024b8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9bf5303368fba46c6211be82e9a1e25a4f054638050a0b89f3ddfdf9789fb2da"}, "3": {"node_id": "f779580c-027d-4a87-a51d-06c471a4669e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f37dd4eb40fca0654c512044d0df75d4be1b2d02ef67c39b101ea0c981dccde"}}, "hash": "736c929e4097fb63934b888457ab8c5af42248fd1a6d4d3e6a58ab5a1266e57c", "text": "is 28.5 % of the total estimated Badia rangelands (7.1 Million ha or 71,000 km\u00b2) http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/mapping_20rangeland_20in_20jordan_20gis_2015.pdf 16 It is assumed that a similar 30 % of the Steppe land can be added as realistically to be used for productive rangelands (especially knowing that pressure of other land use (agriculture/horticulture, urbanization, industry) will be higher here than in the Badia) http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/mapping_20rangeland_20in_20jordan_20gis_2015.pdf Sustainably Investing in Rangelands 4 Steppe Area (200-350 mm/yr): Monetary value of improved forage (DM) production due to range manage- ment (206 kg/ha as compared to actual productivity in open access grazing (100 kg/ha) in barley tons equivalent (220 JD/ton);

Recent valuation studies in Jordan have notably focused on valuing rangeland restoration through avoided cost of purchase of imported fodder thanks to increased forage production in the range (Jabarin, 2014 and Abu Zanat, 2015). Box 5 provides a summary of the outcomes of these different valuation exercises. From the last calculation (7) in Box 5, taking a rather conservative approach17 , it could be concluded that: (a) the value of forage productivity increase due to good range grazing management can be estimated as 6.7 Million JD/ yr (expressed in the value of barley equivalents), assuming that over time such productivity increase can be realized on around 29% (20,170 km\u00b2 in the Badia) and 30% (3,000 km\u00b2 in the Steppe areas) of the total land area that is classified as rangeland; or reversely that (b) the opportunity cost of not investing in good range management in these areas is 6.7 Million JD/yr, with as a result a lost forage productivity increase.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f779580c-027d-4a87-a51d-06c471a4669e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f779580c-027d-4a87-a51d-06c471a4669e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9bf5303368fba46c6211be82e9a1e25a4f054638050a0b89f3ddfdf9789fb2da"}, "2": {"node_id": "38c2a4c4-e12e-4162-8e07-611ed2024b8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "736c929e4097fb63934b888457ab8c5af42248fd1a6d4d3e6a58ab5a1266e57c"}}, "hash": "1f37dd4eb40fca0654c512044d0df75d4be1b2d02ef67c39b101ea0c981dccde", "text": "If the 6.7 Million /JD forage productivity increase is added to the value of 7.8 Million JD/yr thanks to enhanced ground wa- ter recharge due to good range management (Westerberg et al, 201418 it can be concluded that the opportunity cost of not investing in SRM in Jordan amounts to 14.5 Million JD/year (say 15 Million JD/year), without counting other evident eco- system benefits such as replacement cost of water reservoir volume due to siltation and without counting the value of lost biodiversity and of reduced carbon sequestration. As such values are not yet taken into account; it follows that still more in-depth work needs to be done on economic valuation of rangeland ecosystems, and especially on designing tools that are simple, practical and accessible to many professional staff in the domain of rangeland management. From the recently acquired research data presented in Box 5 above, also a very general estimation \u2013 in a very indicative way - can be made of carrying capacity for small ruminant livestock in the Badia and Steppe Areas (see Annex 1).

Such local investments in the rangelands need to contribute to GDP or to minimize losses to GDP, be sustainable, improve rural livelihoods and ensure sustainable use of rangeland resources on an economically sound basis, while functioning on the basis of a rather straight forward business model without need for subventions. The geographic scope for such direct investment in SRM seems to be quite important; the area suggested in this report to be realistically available for productive range management is in the order of 25,000 km2. At the same time, according to the recent studies carried out (described in section 2.6) forage production and grazing periods can be substantially increased (resp. at least two-fold and from 1 to 3 months) when adequate \u201cHima\u201d kind of rotational grazing management is introduced. Nevertheless further economic analysis, following a value chain analysis, needs to be carried out for each selected specific Rangeland Ecological Economic Zone (REEZ) to determine financial and economic feasibility of these proposals in more detail and to see how profitable these activities indeed are for different actors in the value chain. However, other investments are necessary that may not so easily provide economic returns at a short- or mid-term time span. This relates notably to investments in soil and water conservation locally needed to sustain forage and biomass production. As mentioned in section 4.2 such S&WC investment provide critical ecosystem services that need to be paid for not only by the rangeland direct users but also by other beneficiaries of such services. In order to accommodate for such indirect payments the concept of \u201cPayment for Ecosystem Services (PES)\u201d will be introduced in a subsection below. Valuation of these ecosystems services is a prerequisite for defining levels and modalities of such PES. Enabling investments in SRM As has been mentioned in many if not all of the meetings for this study with stakeholder representatives, resource persons and policy decision makers, the complexity of SRM, the intricate interactions between direct and society benefits and the complex social and institutional settings call for other type of investments in the social and organizational domain at local community and Governorate and possibly national levels. The consultations for this study all emphasize that a much larger role needs to be given to local community organizations as the direct beneficiary of but also the most credible steward for SRM. Chapter 5 will elaborate especially on issues related to local ownership and accountability for SRM, strengthening of local governance, stakeholder dialogue and concerted action and the regulatory and institutional frameworks needed.

How- ever, where such enabling investments are specifically tuned to enhance and support sustainable range management, and where the benefits of large scale SRM also have global dimensions, there is a point in exploring financing modalities that may alleviate the investment burden of the national government. The next sections on \u201cFinancing Investments\u201d and \u201cPayment for Ecosystem Services\u201d will further elaborate on such potential modalities. A particular case however for a PES modality that could be implemented directly in Jordan may be found in the livestock sector and would rest within the competence and financing capacity of the Government. At the moment the Jordan Gov- ernment is heavily subsidizing the livestock sector by important subventions up to 85% of the purchase of dried fodder grains. Where the commercial price of barley is around 210 JD/ton, the subsidized price is 175 JD/ton. The total cost to the Government of this subsidy to herders is substantial and amounts to, according to Jordan NAP/ UNCCD Jabarin (2014), 13,5 Million JD per year. This government subsidy on purchased fodder grains could be converted into a reward to herders for good SRM as a subsidy that not only serves livestock production but also sustained management of the rangelands. Such a subsidy could in fact be considered as a local PES. Depending on number of sustainable grazable days each year the PES could pay herders an amount equal to saved fodder purchase (see section 3.3). \u201cFinancing Investments\u201d in SRM Two critical components of the investment packages proposed in Chapter 4 are local ecotourism and the provision of renewable energies at the local level. They have an important function in creating economic activity in rural range areas, through job creation, demand for services and inputs and the provision of cheap additional electricity. Ecotourism will bring in the area new initiative and resources and income alternatives while involving actively local communities and preserving traditional practices and handicrafts. Installing renewable energy capacity, making use of wind and solar re- sources, can provide cheap electricity to different actors in the livestock or MARP value chains for production, processing (slaughterhouses, milk cooling, dairy production), packaging and transportation (for hybrid cars) and to members of live- stock and MARP cooperatives. At the same time these two types of investments can play an important leverage in financing direct local investments in sustainable range management as mentioned here above. Ecotourism charges and fees can be levied in the form of a PES as a reward to the SRM cooperatives who ensure that the ecological capital that attracts tourists will be maintained. Where this could be done directly between ecotourism organizations and SRM cooperatives, it will require accountability, legal and institutional arrangements in which government agencies need to be involved. Similarly the Jordan Government could levy charges as part of investment and operational licences to local and national companies engaged in renewable energy delivery or to SRM value chain enterprises to install solar/wind energy plants at their premises. The revenues of these charges and licences can then be used to finance SRM investments, either those directly undertaken by SRM cooperatives or enabling investments as discussed above. Also here clear regulation and implementing modalities need to be defined. Renewable energy production and use should in these cases be marketed and labelled as an intrinsic pro- duction element of SRM products, be that ecological livestock, MARPs or ecotourism. Production of renewable energy to the public grid (by renewable energy plants) could be heavier charged than electricity production for directly SRM related activities. 36 4.Economic Rationale for Investing in the Jordan Rangelands 19 author Payment for Ecosystem Services that benefit society In the above sections mainly local/national examples are given for possible PESs.

That would be greatly unfair. Modalities have thus to be implemented to ensure that investments are made and that other \u201cdownstream\u201d beneficiaries are paying a price for the off- site benefits they enjoy, such as better ground water recharge and availability and reduced reservoir siltation and the avoided cost of land restoration20 . Moreover, there is a critical need to \u201cunlock\u201d private sector investments (community and business) by government initiated enabling investments. This will also be important for finding responses to increasing concerns about high rural-urban migra- tory flows and the social consequences this has for urban life (such as in avoided cost of re-location to cities, of social unrest and conflict due to unemployment especially in urban areas). Investments in SRM in rural areas can trigger increased rural economic activity and job and income opportunities, and hence contribute to reduce such rural-urban migration. Government agencies should therefore be constructively engaged in a process that can be justified by economic valuation and analysis and possibly covered by international PESs. An important rationale for mobilizing international funding to trigger PES financial flows to invest in SRM is to be found in the fact that many societal benefits at the country level also contribute to environmental benefits at the global level as illustrated in Figure 7 above: higher biodiversity, conservation of genetic resources, higher soil carbon sequestration due to soil conser- vation21 , and climate change adaptation and mitigation in general. In turn international PES financial flows may provide the leverage for government agencies to engage in and review the regulatory and legal frameworks that are important to create the enabling environment necessary for SRM investments. Another incentive to come to possibly necessary policy changes in favour of SRM is the increasing international pressure to come to Land Degradation Neutrality at the country level (see Box 5). Box 7. Land Degradation Neutrality: current status, challenges and opportunities The notion of a \u2018zero net loss\u2019 goal for action against land degradation was raised in the Rio+20 report The Future We Want, where the international community agreed to aim for \u201ca land-degradation neutral world in the context of sustain- able development\u201d. This has been encapsulated in a global aspiration to halt and reverse land degradation by 2030. The Intergovernmental Working Group\u2019s current working definition of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) is a state whereby the amount and quality of land resources, necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security, remains stable or increases within specified temporal and spatial scales, and ecosystems.\u201d LDN has a dual focus on two complementary approaches, pursuing both sustainable land management practices and the ecological restoration of degraded lands. Because of land\u2019s underpinning support for people and life, LDN is inextricably linked with food and water security, poverty reduction, biodiversity, land rights and justice. Significant economic, legal, political and social barriers to the uptake of better land management exist and need to be addressed in tandem with strong institutional support for LDN approaches. By the same token, LDN-based holistic governance will help to provide these multiple benefits through sus- tainable livelihoods, increased productivity and better protection of the soil-water-food nexus. This calls for synergistic actions to be undertaken between the Rio conventions to address desertification, climate change, and biodiversity loss (UNCCD, UNFCCC, and CBD). Sustainable land management (SLM) is promoted as a core aspect of LDN. Traditional and localised knowledge has much to offer in regards to SLM and SRM, although often major socio-economic changes are also required. SLM improves land value primarily through the empowerment of land managers, using community-based approaches that account for environmental variability. The prevention of land degradation through the implementation of SLM is cost-ef- fective, offering promising investment opportunities.

As a highly conservative estimate this amount of 7.8 Million JD/year could be applied to the 30 % of the rangelands in the designated watersheds suggested in this report. The here mentioned 15 Million JD/year does not yet take into account economic benefits in terms of increased biodiversity, reduced water reservoir siltation, increased soil carbon sequestration and reduced cost as related to rural-urban migration. This minimum amount of 15 Million JD/year could be used at the national level by the Government of Jordan as a rationale for Payments of Ecosystem Services to herder local communities (cooperatives) in charge of SRM in the designated watersheds. This could be in the form of a SRM subsidy for forage production (as a credit for saved imported fodder) and in the form of green water credits for increased ground water recharge with reference to global initiatives taken in this domain (see below). As improved SRM have also global benefits to society, international funding mechanisms could facilitate international Ecosystem Service Payments in reward of Jordan\u2019s contribution to such global benefits. This could for instance be done in a doubling of the amount that the Jordan Government may allocate for SRM in the designated watersheds. This international PES (of at least 15 Million JD/year) could possibly be best used for the investment needed in the SRM enabling environment such as for local range governance, and the necessary policy and institutional frameworks. These enabling investments are critical as they may \u201cunlock\u201d investments by both local range users and private sector in the further value chains. This highly preliminary proposal could mean a substantial investment in Jordan for SRM in the form of Payments for Eco- system Services of roughly 30 mlj JD/year that could possibly be managed by a designated SRM National Fund. Such an investment moreover could be justified as the Jordanian and international commitments to comply to different Rio conventions to address desertification, climate change, and biodiversity loss (UNCCD, UNFCCC, and CBD) and notably to international proposals for country commitments to Land Degradation Neutrality as will be discussed September 2015 in the UNCCD COB in Istanbul. Enhancing international PES flows To enhance international financial flows that could be used as PES there are a number of important funding windows that could cater for this. The Global Mechanism of the UNCCD manages a Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) Fund that has as its goal to neutralize the footprint of land use activities by turning 12 million hectares of degraded land into profitable assets each year, globally. Specifically, the Fund is being structured for blended investments in sustainable business models across all land-use sectors worldwide, with a focus on large-scale land restoration and rehabilitation projects. By financing these activities, the LDN Fund will also contribute to food security, climate change mitigation/adaptation, biodiversity protection and poverty alleviation. The approach is by design one that optimizes natural asset management and maximizes positive impact at landscape level (Global Mechanism, 2015). In short, the LDN Fund could provide important leverage in designing PES financial flows for investments in SRM in Jordan. The new Verified Conservation Approach (VCA), as initiated by the VCA Office at IUCN in Switzerland, establishes a new, international platform for verified sustainable land management which connects to the demands of stakeholders including local communities and public authorities. As further explained in Box 8 below, the VCA Approach provides a mechanism for innovative conservation initiatives and investments beyond legally protected areas to be recognised, celebrated and sup- ported. In many (or important parts) of the Range Ecological Economic Zones that could be assigned in Jordan for SRM, the investment packages here proposed could well form part of Conservation Areas that could be registered with the VCA Alliance, being a platform for facilitating funding for a good part of investments proposed.

As stressed in these meetings, the ownership of involved communities for range management stewardship and associated arrangements has to be maintained and strengthened; this is more important than close cooperation with and any concessions to the private sector. The point of view of the communities (involving their ownership) has to have preference and must be specifically con- sidered during the decision-making process. The private sector might cooperate well and business would therefore have a main interest, but this might also create difficulties in guaranteeing of the sustainability of range management efforts. Where such community-based organizations (CBOs) can have different legal forms, there seems to be high consensus in Jor- dan that such CBOs could be best organized in local cooperatives. There is a strong point in favour of this especially as such CBOs also need to work in a more business-minded way. Cooperatives have in essence a mandate for this. As mentioned by many in Jordan cooperatives could have an effective and useful role in enhancing SRM in well demarcated and large areas of ecological and economic interest. In view of not always positive experience elsewhere with the cooperative movement, it is however important to review and analyse the basic modalities of cooperative organization to ensure they can play the role that is expected. SRM cooperatives probably will be best organized within the herder communities that have traditionally taken care of the rangelands and for who the rangelands form an essential part of their livelihoods. Herder cooperatives need to engage in SRM notably with a business \u2013minded perspective as well as with a perspective that puts stewardship22 for the sustainable management of rangeland resources on the foreground. 22 Stewardship is understood here as the de facto and entrusted management of a resource (for the rangelands this can be seen in analogy to what is meant with stewardship within the Forest Stewardship Council - FSC). 41 given to soil and water conservation it would be interesting to explore what GWC or other similar initiatives could offer for strengthening investment decisions for the rangelands in Jordan. Other funding mechanisms may be explored through GEF and UNDP and several bilateral agencies for development cooperation. Compensating for extractive use of rangelands Efforts to come to Sustainable Rangeland Management have obviously to take into account other interests and land uses that may compete with SRM. This is especially true for exploitation of the rangelands of other natural resources than those delivered by the range, such as by stone and phosphate quarries, oil shale exploitation and over-irrigation from ground water reserves. Many of these natural resources are non-renewable and exploitation is often led by short-term financial interests. Where such exploitation may serve also the national economy (even if this is only short-term), priorities have to be balanced and compromises be made, Nevertheless, it will be important at the national level to come to overall land use planning where these different interests, including sustainable range management are taken into account. Clear decisions on where which kind of resource exploitation are allowed, will help investors to make their investment decisions on the long-term. Such overall land use decisions would preferably take into account future global commitments to Land Degradation Neutrality as discussed in Box 7 above, where extractive land use leading to land degradation is compensated by investments in land restoration and in sustainable management of non-degraded rangeland. Moreover overall land use decisions should be informed by Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) of different land uses and as a consequence by the development of Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for different parts of the country. Box 8. Verified Conservation Areas (VCAs) A new approach to scaling up, investing and financing conservation Under the international Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, governments have committed to conserve 17% of terrestrial areas and 10% of marine areas, and to restore 15% of degraded ecosystems by 2020. There is broad agreement that current conservation efforts are not enough to mitigate the ever increasing ecological footprint of humanity. Even these targets are unlikely to halt the loss of biodiversity. Reliance on legally protected areas is insufficient. With the growing human population and its increasing levels of prosperity, the pressures on biodiversity are great. We need to expand our conservation efforts across all parts of the planet. The area-based VCA approach scales up conservation efforts, allows new stakeholders to engage, channels new financing towards conservation, and provides the assurance that money invested is well spent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8aa0344-f517-432b-a85f-e0574c825d42": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8aa0344-f517-432b-a85f-e0574c825d42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e56d94884dde89788abf70dc0a77285f710a2ee5a4a9d50a4ed379dc1c78d961"}, "3": {"node_id": "68df9854-89a5-44e7-8035-2efcae963044", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0f47cf5e34fe28d8df0971f718467e6e52598a8d91d66aa0af27ec8504b54b0"}}, "hash": "53363f67f12ff32edc0edbfe32c11f909163f13759d29fbac0d6f9bfac5d2e0b", "text": "Some Core elements of the VCA approach 1. A Verified Conservation Area is a geographically-defined area listed on the VCA Registry and managed to conserve nature and use living natural resources sustainably, taking into account human needs for the services nature provides. 2.

From experience in other places with management of natural resources and notably natural resources with unclear ownership arrangements (commu- nity forestry, water resources) it has become clear that a number of preconditions need to be in place for local range users to assume ownership for the implementation and management of the proposed interventions (Laban, 1994; Laban et al, 2009). This is important for the sustainability and future impact of investments in the specific assets of the rangeland (land, water, vegetation and biodiversity). In turn these preconditions will indicate what specific local governance modalities are required and that need to be considered and often invested in. For local communities to engage in SRM investments it is important that they can assume ownership and have a sense of accountability with regard to use and management of the rangelands within their \u201ccommunity\u201cdomain. It needs to be empha- sized here that ownership for management practices is not the same as land ownership that is vested in Jordan and many other countries in the State. In many cases local people will not assume such management ownership because they do not feel that the activity, investment and/or its results are really theirs (ownership). If essential pre-conditions for such ownership and accountability are not fulfilled, this will adversely affect resilience of the social-ecological system and hence sustainability and impact of necessary SRM investments. Important preconditions for local range users and their communities to assume such ownership and accountability are (i) assured benefits, (ii) resource rights, (iii) appropriate knowledge and capacity, and (iv) claim-making power ((Laban, 1994; Laban et al, 2009). Figure 8. Framework for assessing pre-conditions for local people to assume accountability for sustainable range management. Source: Laban and Haddad, 2015. An initial analysis of preconditions that are needed to entrust management, ownership and local accountability for specified rangeland areas is made for the different interventions within the different investment packages proposed by the consulted stakeholders and reported in this document. This initial analysis needs to be further elaborated \u2013 in a transparent and partic- ipatory process - in each specific area where these investment packages are proposed to be implemented. This initial list of preconditions for rangeland cooperatives to assume ownership is mentioned in the following Local Range Governance Ta- bles for each of the Investment Components proposed: Hima Grazing Management, Soil and Water Conservation, Ecological Livestock Production, Protection and Production of Medicinal and Aromatic Range Plants (MARPs) and Ecotourism. Similar preconditions are mentioned for Renewable Energy and Value Chain Development and Marketing; these apply to primary actors responsible for these interventions. On the basis of these preconditions an analysis is made in the consultative workshops of what local governance measures are needed to be taken to ensure that these preconditions are fulfilled. These local governance measures, mentioned in the same table below, form an important part of local range governance arrangements that will be discussed in Section 6.2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68df9854-89a5-44e7-8035-2efcae963044": {"__data__": {"id_": "68df9854-89a5-44e7-8035-2efcae963044", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e56d94884dde89788abf70dc0a77285f710a2ee5a4a9d50a4ed379dc1c78d961"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8aa0344-f517-432b-a85f-e0574c825d42", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53363f67f12ff32edc0edbfe32c11f909163f13759d29fbac0d6f9bfac5d2e0b"}}, "hash": "d0f47cf5e34fe28d8df0971f718467e6e52598a8d91d66aa0af27ec8504b54b0", "text": "T A B L E 7 Investment Component: \u201cHima\u201d Integrated Grazing Management Investments and Local Range Governance (indicative) Local Actors Preconditions for local actors Supporting/ enabling actors Local Governance Measures - Livestock/ range cooperatives - Other livestock/ range user groups - Secure grazing access and use rights and benefit shares of traditional users;

It covers both the manner in which decisions about the allocation and regulation of range- land resources are made, and the formal and informal institutions by which authority is exercised23 . As indicated in the Local Range Governance Tables above, many of such local governance measures have to respond to important issues such as: how to deal with benefits from investments; how to regulate resource rights; and how to develop systems of representation and delegation that give due attention to providing influence and claim-making power at the most adequate level (principle of subsidiarity). It may be obvious that respect for and building on local knowledge and practices, rules and institutions adapted and con- textualized to the reality of today would be important ingredients of such investments in local governance. Indeed, many of the here proposed local governance measures are traditionally known as part of the set of management rules that were prac- ticed in the age-old \u201chima\u201d local governance systems in use in the Middle East for the sustainable management of natural resources. In Jordan the \u201cHima\u201d concept is generally accepted as model to build on for community based management of natural resources. On May 6th, 2014 \u201cThe Amman Declaration on Innovating Hima\u201d was signed by HRH Prince El Hassan Bin Talal. Box 9 below provides an excerpt of this Hima Declaration. However, to revive and adapt to actual contexts such traditional management systems and measures within a larger frame of local range governance, it will be necessary to invest time in the facilitation of a Stakeholder Dialogue and Concerted Action (SDCA) process as discussed in section 6.4. 5.4 Stakeholder Concerted Action, Roles and Responsibilities For local range governance to become institutional sustainable this needs to be embedded within Government institutional settings. As recommended by the rangeland stakeholder and resource persons meeting on May 5th 2015, a successful SRM strategy is only guaranteed if the governance aspects at political level are integrated. Suitable SRM governance has to be developed, and local and political levels have to mutually strengthen themselves for that purpose. A political framework has to be created to get to wider scales then with only a local \u201cpilots\u201d modality. For this needs also support is needed to the development of a national policy for SRM. As a first important step to come to such a SRM political framework, it might be most practical to start at the level of a number of to be selected SRM intervention areas that could maybe be designated as \u201cRange Ecological Economic Zones (REEZs).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b040b92-44c9-43ca-87f2-dbb005489eb6": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b040b92-44c9-43ca-87f2-dbb005489eb6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a0043319ddf1ec5c7bff48957a43345f6c2863f35a1c55ec4318c7209b9580fa"}, "2": {"node_id": "aed451a8-e83c-4946-b6e6-225b5f75ff0c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f2599ebe57fa725a209bb238e0670f796cdbf49ccd0468f03b1f557c016fd39"}}, "hash": "9766d9ed0b1c3839c46da1a81b7ff42eecf0e6eb5e8b7792a04e5c3034066e16", "text": "23 Adapted from Moriarty, Laban et al, 2007: Guidelines for Local water Governance; INWRDAM, EMPOWERS, Amman 46 For each of these to be selected SRM intervention areas it will be necessary to engage in a Stakeholder Dialogue and Con- certed Action process that would first of all identify the key relevant stakeholders in all", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e673edd-5c86-4c6c-a03a-069329c09ac5": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e673edd-5c86-4c6c-a03a-069329c09ac5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bdd026d79c66309ecdb74737a4d9a2f7e40dd52fd078591402cd564fb97ae1b4"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7c244cd-8c4e-4a1e-ab8b-8bdb1fdb103f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63eccc8b4e9058eac3fe319d3fdc8e2a3d176bc0374a6aa319f8637b53ee518d"}}, "hash": "84e984dfaa429bfee26196f0bc10bedf0801eabe03ce22a4377645c2452a72f6", "text": "involved sectors, agree on shared interests and legal frameworks.

Excerpt of the Amman Declaration on Innovating Hima; May 2014 Al Hima (\u0649\u0640\u0640\u0645\u062d\u0644\u0627) is an Islamic tradition that has governed and conserved natural resources in Arabic countries for thou- sands of years. Hima is a broad concept with a diversity of applications, but at its heart is the recognition of nature as a living system and not merely a commodity. Hima is a comprehensive package of governance, conservation, science and markets that builds on and reinforces social, cultural and human capital. Rangeland Himas provide a multitude of overlapping benefits including improvements in livestock production, conser- vation of biodiversity, maintaining habitat and connectivity for fauna and flora, protecting hydrological cycles, capturing atmospheric carbon, and reinforcing local culture. Rangeland Himas can therefore contribute to poverty reduction and economic growth as well as protection of habitat and conservation of endangered species, and they have benefits to people outside their boundaries and to the world as a whole. Revival of Himas has also been used to promote social justice and gender equality. To move from scattered good practices towards more systematic scale up of Hima requires: 1. Strengthen land stewardship and communal tenure; 2. Strengthen scientific and economic evidence and local knowledge to provide systematic monitoring for quality assurance; 3. Create an enabling environment of policy and institutional support and address the cross-sectoral nature of Hima; 4. Develop incentives and rewards for the multiple and diverse benefits of Hima; 5. Build capacity and awareness in public institutions and communities, with particular focus on the skills of participation, empowerment and monitoring; 6. Build partnerships and networks for experience sharing, knowledge and capacity building, and to maximise the transboundary and international benefits of Hima; 7. Initiate appropriate steps for resource mobilisation.

A SDCA process, if well facilitated, will also clarify and create understanding about the different roles and responsibilities different actors have in the different Investment components as is provisionally indicated in the Tables presented in section 6.1. It needs to be stressed that the suggestions made in this report need to be further worked out and applied by prefer- ence in the \u201creal life\u201d situations of each Range Ecological Economic Zone where SRM investments as proposed here can be implemented. As experienced in similar stakeholder processes for water resource management in the Middle East and elsewhere, a good SDCA process is one that provides space for change. To create such space as well as ownership and mutual understanding of each actor\u2019s role and responsibilities a number of principles are mentioned in Box 10 underlying such a SDCA process (Laban, 2015): Box 10.

Social organization around ground water management. IN: SPRING, IUCN Global Water Programme, Gland (in preparation) 48 6 Strengthening an enabling environment for SRM investments 6.1 Main drivers of investment in the rangelands The Jordan rangelands are important for pastoral animal production and, as in other dry countries, contribute importantly to Agricultural GDP (the livestock sector as a whole contributes 55% to agricultural production; MoA Rangeland Strategy, 2013) and hence the national economy. With growing demand for healthy livestock products the rangeland resources are still under-exploited. New investments in this under-used sector could be triggered also by emerging niche markets and an increasing willingness to pay (WTP) for high quality notably ecologically produced livestock (meat and dairy) and other range products and for that matter other ecosystem services. Apart from these economic considerations, there is increased awareness of the need to preserve the country\u2019s ecosystem integrity and the important contribution rangelands can make to preservation of biodiversity, genetic resources and carbon sequestration. World- wide concerns on environmental degradation have led to increasing international pressure (UNCCD, UNCOB, UNFCCC) on national governments to invest in sustainable development and ecosystem services (hydrology, biodi- versity, climate change mitigation/adaptation) and especially in impoverished areas (MDGs, SDGs). Also the increasing cost of natural disasters is calling for investments in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) through investments in Sustainable Range Management. This aligns with the understanding that the incremental benefit/cost ratio (\u2206B/\u2206C) of preventing land degrada- tion is higher than that of land restoration. Important progress has been made already by the Jordan Government in terms of its very serious commitments to comply with the different RIO Conventions (UNCBD, UNFCCC, UNCCD) as reflected by recently revised Strategy Documents on Biodiversity, Combatting Desertification and Rangelands. In short, an increase of investments in the rangelands would serve both socio-economic and environmental development objectives, while aligning well with current government strategies such as the Updated Rangeland Strategy (MoA, 2013) and the National Action Plan for Combatting Desertification (MoE, 2015). Moreover, investing in sustainability of the rangeland/livestock sector will also create job opportunities and income in rural areas and potentially reduce rural \u2013urban migration (an important concern in Jordan\u2019s long-term development plans) and contribute to higher political stability. Increased investments in the Jordan Rangelands would be notably in line with Opera- tional Objective 5 of the Aligned NAP to Combat Desertification on \u201cFinancing and Technology Transfer; increased financial resource mobilization mechanisms and frameworks necessary to fund the NAP\u201d. 6.2 Enabling investments necessary to support SRM It is urgent and critical that important enabling investments are made by the Government of Jordan to \u201cunlock\u201d and incite investments by the private sector, both by local range users (cooperatives) and private enterprise.

Investing time and efforts here would 5.Investments in Local Rangeland Governance also mean reviewing mandates of local authorities, building partnerships with all stakeholders in the location, and ensuring government commitments to allocate necessary resources. Strengthening local governance for sustainable range management need to be accompanied by vocational training pro- grammes (technical, local organizational management, networking), participatory learning and research about adapted graz- ing management through herder field schools and by support systems to local production and marketing such as techni- cal support and input services, processing (meat, dairy, herbal plants), quality control, labelling, marketing; one-stop-shops). Enabling investments may also entail improved infrastructure to increase access to remote locations (agricultural roads and mobile networks) for opening markets and input and service supply, review legal frameworks and administrative support structures. Investing in above aspects would not only serve more sustainable range management but could at the same time contribute to employment and income in the rangeland rural areas, while creating Incentives for local and other investors. 6.3 Potential investors in the rangelands Three rather different categories of investors need to be involved in different parts of the value chains around the investment packages proposed in Chapter 3. A very indicative list of local actors and other actors needed to support investments by local actors is provided in the \u201cLocal Range Governance\u201d tables in section 5.2. In general terms a distinction can be made between different categories of investors as follows: \u2022 Central and local governments for enabling a business and governance environment, education, water infrastructure, participatory stakeholder planning, marketing support, infrastructural access and the necessary enabling legal and policy frameworks. Important Government Agencies are MoA, MOPIC, MWI, MoE, MTA, MEMR, MoF, MoI but also the Hashemite Fund for the Development of the Jordan Badia, the Treasury Lands Directorate in the Department of Land and Survey of the Treasury of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and Municipality Councils. \u2022 Community investors such as local range users and their communities (traditionally having a long-term resilience aim such as creating and preserving social capital relationships), range users associations, cooperatives and other CBOs, supporting NGOs, but also local livestock and other value chain entrepreneurs. Such investments may not always be expressed in money but could very well be also in terms of time for negotiations and implementing activities. \u2022 Private sector (both big business and community investors); for instance in ecological livestock services, processing (slaughterhouses for ecological meat; dairy) and production, marketing of high value ecological rangeland products, provision of renewable energy and eco-tourism, financing and local credit. In-depth value chain actor analysis is needed to identify which actors and investors are best placed for which element of the chain. This will also address specifically gender dimensions and opportunities for women to play a role in each selected value chain. Such value chain analysis should not just look to the different steps in the production towards consumption process, but also look into questions of market demand, consumer preferences, possible new niche markets, quality control and cer- tification, input and service supply, who does what best, win-win arrangements between different actors in the value chain. For instance in the livestock value chain - as came up in the stakeholder consultation meetings - who is best placed to pro- vide which veterinarian services? Can certain veterinarian tasks be delegated to private sector or NGOs. Is there any private sector organization available to do all this? What about quality service provision in remote areas that may not be easy to commercialize. What about risks of narrow commercial-only veterinary packages? Same questions for quality veterinary laboratory analysis. Inspiration may be drawn in this domain from more than 10 year experience in this domain in Palestine. Can slaughterhouses be privatized under government quality and sanitary control? What regulatory modifications would be needed to outsource and allow and incite private sector (commercial enterprises and NGOs) to engage in these activities. What are pro\u2019s and con\u2019s for handing over more task to the private sector. Are in some cases Public-Private-partnerships a solution? What about participatory research? Is this a Government task, a task of Universities or of development NGOs? The stakeholder consultations held for this study quite clearly indicated that it is important to involve more and better the private sector but many questions need still to be addressed. 51 50 6.4 Enabling conditions to engage different investors Different investors being that government, private sector or local range users will engage and invest from different viewpoints.

A government will not consider only short-term benefits but also look to the long-term economic perspectives of the country. Where the well-being of range users and increased economic activity in the rangeland areas is important on the short as well as the long term, other concerns and objectives also need to be taken into account. Sound water resource management, sustainability of land use, overall economic development, contributing to the protection of biodiversity as a natural resource and to climate change mitigation and adaptation are such long-terms objectives. Chapter 5 on economic valuation of on-site but especially off-site externalities of sustainable range management has dealt in more detail with such considerations. Local range users will make other decisions on investing time and possibly money to invest in the resources that are basic to their livelihoods. Where the short-term is important, especially for the poorer amongst them, traditionally Bedouin and other range resource users have kept the long-term in their decision-frame. Nevertheless especially uncertainty about resource rights has often re-frained them from making long-term investments in the range. As discussed in this report it is of utmost importance that such resource rights are secured, not only for the sake of their livelihoods, but also from a long term society objective to conserve the environmental assets embedded in the range ecosystems. Chapter 6 reflects a good number of proposals for securing in practical ways such resource rights, made by those involved in the stakeholder consultations that form an important basis for this report. A nuanced review and possible modifications of actual legal frameworks on such \u201crights to use\u201d, within the context of defined state ownership is of urgency. As mentioned also in chapter 6 modalities to enhance local governance around SRM is another key issues that need to be seriously considered even in the short-term. How to attract investors from the private sector is another question and a distinction needs to be made between large often corporate enterprises and SMEs operating more at the local level. As mentioned in section 5.1, the three investment packag- es are developed from a value chain point of view in which different actors have different roles to play, from local range users and their organizations through cooperatives and other SMEs for processing and packaging to possibly other SMEs and larg- er companies for trading and marketing. In order to ensure equity between local range users and private sector entrepreneurs and to enhance as much as possible local ownership for activities necessary in such value chains a preference for SME activities seems to be preferable. All the same, more detailed value chain analysis for these three investment packages needs to be done to decide what private sector activities can best be taken care of by whom and what barriers would stay in the way for them to engage in SRM investments. It is not impossible that for instance ecological slaughter house activities would be better done by bigger companies. For a start such value chain analysis would probably and practically best focus on areas that will be selected for further investments in SRM. Nevertheless from the discussions in the rangeland investment option workshop it seems that important attention needs to be given to privileged trade agreements, a certain liberalization of marketing processes, economic incentives and tax exemp- tions so as to open-up niche markets for ecologic livestock and other range products. This can incite (small and big) private sector actors to engage in an economic activity that is still underdeveloped and with returns that do not seem yet to be very short-term. Such privileged agreements can be justified by the long-term economic benefits for the country as discussed in Chapter 5. Alleviating bureaucratic red-tape could for instance be enhanced by the set-up of One Stop Shops, where multiple government services can be dealt with in one location creating a more customer-friendly environment for investors. There is apparently also a need to strengthen and review legal and regulatory frameworks to support local investments in SRM. This concerns, among others updating and clarifying rules and regulations related to government partnership with communities especially in decision making processes and local governance arrangements for range management This may result in practical policies, strategies, and national action plans to support range investment opportunities. 6.Strengthening an enabling environment for SRM investments Sustainably Investing in Rangelands 53 6.5 Strengthening the knowledge basis about SRM Where this is beyond the scope of this study, it is observed that more study and review is needed for: - resource tenure/rights regulations and governance (matching the indigenous with the formal); - customary governance,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29cbee62-7540-4154-ba90-96b7713fb323": {"__data__": {"id_": "29cbee62-7540-4154-ba90-96b7713fb323", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36e3b6dbf7ea4f85b7a48d2015b20a3f760d83db0e8cfa4f8d07d46a3cf23661"}, "3": {"node_id": "37326fae-0b16-4110-b2a7-bb7d2fb00ad4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f82a64d0dfb2e2a1f09881a8efdec62428d766df3e7b88901de3868ae4e31a1d"}}, "hash": "0464a513b945c37855672611ca8d6bfddfdf7cfaf8cefad0f2bf3c113439fe65", "text": "indigenous knowledge, local practices and institutions; - understanding rangeland ecology dynamics for land degradation and restoration; - extent and risks of rangeland degradation; - countering short-term gain tendencies of private investors to engage in in extractive use of non-renewable natural resources (such as stone and phosphate quarries, oil shale exploitation, over-irrigation from ground water reserves); - enhancing sustainable rotational grazing management - Review and adapt (if necessary) land use planning (allocating specific areas for rangeland use) at national and governorate levels - Review and adapt (if necessary) fiscal and price regulation to support production and marketing of local products - Effective decentralization of government support and decision-making 52 6.Strengthening an enabling environment for SRM investments 7 Required Policies and Strategies This report will not re-iterate what has already been mentioned in related policy documents. Moreover a comprehensive overview of needed policies is mentioned in Jordan\u2019s Updated Rangeland Strategy (2013) and Jordan\u2019s NAP to Combatting Desertification that substantially deals also with Jordan\u2019s rangelands. Nevertheless, the subjects dealt in this report may call for further elabora- tion or specification of the strategies and policies mentioned in the above documents, so as to further support the policy orien- tations already taken and strive for a contextualized framework for Sustainable Rangeland Management in Jordan. This section, on the basis of the subjects and arguments developed in this report, will attempt to formulate a number of key recommendations and suggestions (i) to enhance the involvement of local communities in SRM; (ii) to enhance SRM investments by the private sector; and (iii) to enhance an enabling SRM policy framework. 7.1 Enhancing involvement of local communities in SRM As is emphasized in this report and well supported by a large group of stakeholders in the range a strong call is made for higher and effective involvement of local herder communities in the investments for SRM. Two important axes are recom- mended to be followed: 1. Strengthen and empower herder and women cooperatives24 and enhance the necessary local range governance systems in which they can play their role. \u2022 Internal organizational strengthening of both herder and women SRM cooperatives is a must; vocational training programmes (technical, local organizational management, finance, /bookkeeping) would be an important compo- nent of this. Apart from such more practical training also training and coaching will be necessary in strategic plan- ning, networking, lobbying and dialogue with other stakeholders, in order to empower them in the political arena around SRM. \u2022 Strengthening local governance through creating local ownership for the interventions proposed for the three invest- ment packages: empowerment, fee systems for grazing and hunting rights, and institutionalizing of local commu- nity organizations (cooperatives, other CBOs) that will lead to resolve resource tenure issues, facilitate sharing of benefits, provide security of investments, regulate grazing and hunting activities and increase rural jobs in locally initiated economic activity; etc. 2. Strengthen the role of such CBOs and in particular cooperatives in the different value chains proposed for SRM. \u2022 Develop the value chain modalities and market support necessary for ecological livestock products (meat, dairy, leather, wool) and for high value MARP products so as to occupy larger shares on the domestic market (and eventu- ally on the export markets) \u2013 this means amongst others: technical production support and input services, veterinary and artificial insemination (local breeds) services, processing (meat, dairy, herbal plants), quality control, labelling, marketing; one-stop-shops. \u2022 Develop with local organizations local rangeland eco-tourism activities near cultural and natural heritage sites; this can include amongst others: eco-range sites for wildlife, eco-lodges, guided eco-walks, ecosystem training activi- ties for schools and others, handicraft and other tourism activities. For both axes there is most probably an important role to play for development NGOs and the Jordan Cooperative Association as an umbrella organization. 24 or when not yet ready or feasible: voluntary or agricultural associations 55 7.2 Enhancing SRM investments by the private sector As mentioned in the meeting with the business community for this study, it is time to \u201cturn an impasse situation into an opportunity\u201d. This means however that the \u201cSRM business case for investors\u201d needs to be made more clearly and convincingly.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37326fae-0b16-4110-b2a7-bb7d2fb00ad4": {"__data__": {"id_": "37326fae-0b16-4110-b2a7-bb7d2fb00ad4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36e3b6dbf7ea4f85b7a48d2015b20a3f760d83db0e8cfa4f8d07d46a3cf23661"}, "2": {"node_id": "29cbee62-7540-4154-ba90-96b7713fb323", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0464a513b945c37855672611ca8d6bfddfdf7cfaf8cefad0f2bf3c113439fe65"}}, "hash": "f82a64d0dfb2e2a1f09881a8efdec62428d766df3e7b88901de3868ae4e31a1d", "text": "This is important for the Jordan economy in general, for developing financing flows for SRM, but also to push government agencies to revisit the regulatory and legal frameworks and to make the institutional investments that should unlock investments from the private sector.

If such an economic rationale is developed and embraced by the business sector itself, this will importantly support the policy rational for the Government of Jordan to invest in its rangelands. Initiative here needs to be taken by the business community and most probably the Jordan Investment Council can play an important role here. Activities that can be undertaken by the business sector itself for scoping of own business opportunities: \u2022 Conduct economic comparative analysis for SRM and other land use (such as extractive mining, irrigation, etc) - How to calculate opportunity cost? \u2022 Undertake assessment of cost of land degradation versus cost of SRM in degraded and non-degraded areas \u2013 what is the business fall-out of further land degradation for the Jordan private sector? \u2022 Take initiative in mitigating risks for the rangelands of extractive investments, through participating if not initiating in Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and the development of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the different designated REEZs 2. Engage in exploring business opportunities within the recommended investment packages as proposed in this report \u2022 Conduct value chain analysis with local cooperatives for each designated SRM location (REEZ) and different investment packages, considering input/output and direct/indirect benefits for the business sector \u2022 Undertake further economic valuation together with the JCA for on-site and off-site positive impact (externalities) of SRM, notably to investigate business opportunities in good use of available ecosystem services (water, biodiversity, SRM), through the investment packages as proposed in this report, and maybe others. It would be interesting to see to what extent the business sector in Jordan could take the pro-active initiative to come with proposals for Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) and Payment for Ecosystem Service (PES). An underlying rationale for this would be that: \u2206B/\u2206C of preventing land degradation is higher than \u2206B/\u2206C of Land Restoration; and that actions would com- ply with Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN). Box 11. Economic valuation of ecosystem services from a business perspective More study and experience is needed to come to a set of practical, easy to use economic valuation tools that can be systematically applied to develop the economic rationale for sustainable range management. An emphasis should be given to the testing and development of such tools that are practical and straightforward without the necessity of using complex formula, while making the right assumptions. To note that guidelines for the assessment and economic vali- dation of ecosystem services will be developed under the GIZ- EKF-ESS project as part of a national policy document, on behalf of the Ministry of Environment. These guidelines will create the political framework to enable and structure the support of the government regarding investments in a SRM and incentives for the private sector. A systematic assess- ment and monetary validation of ecosystem services, provided by rangeland, is urgently needed on the national scale \u2013 to be applied on the local level. Local stakeholders and investors have to be convinced through economic arguments and calculations that investments in the rangelands are more sustainable, attractive and profitable than in other use of land. It is recommended that the business sector (possibly through the Jordan Investment Commission) is actively involved in such an exercise. 54 7.3 Enhancing an enabling policy framework for SRM As discussed in this report SRM has potentially high benefits for the country: Improved livestock production, better ground water recharge, lower siltation of water reservoirs, higher biodiversity, higher soil carbon sequestration and increased economic activity in rural areas. This \u201cwealth\u201d should be tapped. It is critical for the government to design PES financing flows both within the national economy and in conjunction with international funding mechanisms as GEF, UNDP and GM/UNCCD. Also here two axes can be distinguished: 1. Strengthen the policy environment to foster local range governance \u2022 Initiate national land use planning in which substantial areas are assigned to SRM (the watershed areas in the Badia and others in the Steppe areas could form a basis for this) and designate specific rangeland areas as rangeland Ecological Economic Zones (REEZs) as target areas for financing SRM along national and international PES flows. \u2022 Enhance transparent participatory stakeholder planning and decision-making processes at the local and REEZ level \u2022 Put in place the regulatory and institutional frameworks to enable local range governance systems in the above designated REEZs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "447593c5-0891-4cbd-a5d8-343eadbd5ec8": {"__data__": {"id_": "447593c5-0891-4cbd-a5d8-343eadbd5ec8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab3da98459f7a40043fe06d14befc341f87ed34e9fe99075405e7f134dd6c77b"}, "2": {"node_id": "04c18128-8f9b-4e07-8d4d-46a18ddcf8b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e9bb123484255264221bf63ff4a17ad0fae08142fa17e121b7be738c7c258d5f"}}, "hash": "e28381fbe014480a6210f874dfa6752e75cf8a68a8d0471c5b24112c46ffd4fc", "text": "\u2022 Strengthen and review legal and regulatory frameworks for local governance; \u2022 Review and propose innovative matching arrangements between formal landownership and Hima-kind of resource use and access right systems. \u2022 Promote studies and research that will reduce the knowledge gaps between policy", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d6d0035-2cd6-4527-9f98-253760bcf0d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d6d0035-2cd6-4527-9f98-253760bcf0d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sustainably investing in rangelands : Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb7f6128916787979675fd6711c3c6e59be130444da171c4cbd7bd695ea5ff55"}, "3": {"node_id": "4026d511-126c-4b45-b7cc-0c0bdcea7c69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sustainably-investing-rangelands-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef3ccef002b4276a5bd4ee18c61a9f09fd4af7a480d789516eea1b773c47d80b"}}, "hash": "aca545f713bd8052c01fd5a20eda2becfae80624fe5ce7aa8398610cbe41e3da", "text": "and implementation as listed in section 6.5.

The Programme objective is to promote the sustainable and harmonious cooperation process at the Medi- terranean Basin level by dealing with the common challenges and enhanc- ing its endogenous potential. It finances cooperation projects as a contri- bution to the economic, social, environmental and cultural development of the Mediterranean region. Official Programme languages are Arabic, English and French. www.enpicbcmed.eu ec.europa.eu The project in brief According to the World Tourism Organization, ecotourism is a major trend with a growing demand for consumers for packages which offer responsible travel to natural areas, conservation of the environment, and improvement of the well-being of local people. The Mediterranean area is one of the most interesting regions in the world in terms of ecotourism potential. The high diversity of landscapes and ecosystems together with the unique socio-eco- nomic and cultural mosaic provide suitable conditions for the development of ecotourism. In order to foster the diversification of tourism offered and a better seasonal distribution of tourism flows, the Mediterranean Experience of Ecotourism (MEET) project aims to improve the sustainability and the rationalization in distribution of the tourism sector in the Mediterranean region. In the frame- work of cross-border cooperation within the European Neighborhood Policy Instrument (ENPI Med), under the strategic line \u201cPromoting the sustainable tourism for the socio-economic development and enhancement of territo- ries\u201d, this strategic project involves 10 countries of the Mediterranean: Italy, France, Spain, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Cyprus, Greece and Tunisia. Goal Develop an ecotourism model for Mediterranean Protected Areas (PAs) based on the \u201cEuropean Charter for Sustainable Tourism\u201d to promote a better seasonal distribution of tourism flows. Expected Results \u2022 Functional guidelines for ecotourism planning in the Mediterranean region. \u2022 Better international cooperation in the field of ecotourism across the Mediterranean region. \u2022 A MEET ecotourism catalogue with ecotourism packages from about 20 Mediterranean Protected Areas to selected international markets from USA, Canada, Australia and Japan. \u2022 A MEET network of PAs involved in managing the catalogue and capitalizing on project results, supported by a Secretariat located in Malaga (Spain). \u2022 At least six partnerships of local small and medium enterprises that develop ecotourism products. 7 6 *\u201cThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

It shows variable, nomadic movements and is capable of dispersal in search of suitable habitat at any time of year as changing conditions require (Scott and Rose 1996) (Kear 2005, del Hoyo et al. 1992). There is a general ten- dency for a more southerly distribution during the non-breeding season and a more northerly distribution during the breeding season. It is highly gre- garious post-breeding and during the non-breeding season when it occurs in large monospecific flocks (Kear 2005) of up to 2000 individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Green et al. 2002). During the breeding season it is more disper- sive, although paired birds often mix with conspecifics (Kear 2005). Nests are sometimes built in close proximity to one another, although they become increasingly spaced out as population density declines (Kear 2005, Green 2007). Nesting has been recorded from mid April to late June, and broods from mid-April to mid-September (Kear 2005). The species exhibits drastic population fluctuations, partly in response to annual variations in rainfall. Habitat Breeding It is adapted to temporary, unpredictable, Mediterra- nean-type wetlands (Green 2000, 2007) and breeds in fairly dry, steppe-like areas on shallow freshwater, brackish or alkaline ponds with well vegetat- ed shorelines (Green 1993), and rich emergent and submergent vegetation (Kear 2005). It also breeds on delta marshes where receding waters leave behind large areas of shallow water with abundant sedges and bulrushes (Johnsgard 1978). In addition it may use slow rivers and saline coastal la- goons, and man-made wetlands including fish-rearing ponds and small res- ervoirs (Green 1993). Although it favours brackish wetlands, it tends to avoid waters of high salinity. Microhabitat requirements are strongly influenced by diet. Non-breeding It uses similar habitat during the non-breeding season. Diet varies considerably between seasons and sites and additionally with age. Diptera are an important component of the diet , especially before and during the breeding season. Small seeds become increasingly important af- ter the breeding season with faeces of post-breeding birds in Turkey com- posed of 95% dry weight Scirpus seeds (Green and S\u00e1nchez 2003, Fuentes et al. 2004, Green and Selva 2000). Newly hatched chicks are highly dependent on emerging chironomids (Green 2000). Breeding site Nests are usually constructed on the ground at the water\u203as edge, beneath a covering of vegetation (Kear 2005, Green 1993). They may also occur above water in Typha stands (Kear 2005) and are reported to have been found in the roofs of reed huts (Hawkes 1970, Kear 2005).

The migratory movements of the greater spotted eagle are not well understood, but it seems the majority of the birds move from the main breeding areas in northeast Asia between late September and October to wintering grounds in southern China and south and Southeast Asia, returning to the breeding grounds in mid-April ** Habitat and Ecology: It occurs in lowland forests near wetlands, nesting in different types of (gen- erally tall) trees, depending on local conditions. It feeds on un-retrieved quarry, small mammals, waterbirds, frogs and snakes, hunting over swamps, wet meadows and, in Europe, over extensively managed agricultural land (A. L\u00f5hmus in litt. 1999); birds soar to c.100 m high when hunting. It is a mi- gratory species, with birds leaving their breeding grounds in October and November to winter in southern Europe, southern Asia and north-east Af- rica (del Hoyo et al. 1994). They tend to return in February and March. Birds migrate on a broad front, tending to pass in singles, twos and threes with the occasional larger group (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).

They are dis- tinguished from these eagles, however, by the bolder streaks on their un- der-wings and body, the lack of a pale band under the wing-coverts, and their larger and more majestic build. Both the juveniles and adults have noticeably protruding head and long, parallel-edged wings. Like other ea- gles, they have strong legs and feet. Their feet include long, curved talons that they use to seize, kill and carry their prey. They also have large eyes that are located slightly to the side of the head. These eyes provide them with extremely keen eyesight, allowing them to spot prey from high in the air.

It may feed alone, or in cooperative groups, sweeping the bill underwater for eels, mullet, gobies, shrimps, worms, beetles, prawns, catfish and other small fish. Whilst swimming, this pelican plunges its head beneath the surface to check for prey. Famous for the large pouch on the throat under the lower half of the bill, the pelican does not always eat as it fishes, instead filling the pouch for later consumption. Breeding begins in March and April in the western part of the range, but varies geographically. Nest sites are found in areas with plentiful fish and vegetation, and nests are constructed from reeds, grass, and sticks, fastened together with droppings .Between two and four eggs are laid and incubated for 31 days . The young pelicans gather in \u2018pods\u2019 after six weeks, and fledge at 75 to 85 days of age . They are sexually mature at three to four years. ** Habitat and ecology: It occurs mainly at inland, freshwater wetlands but also at coastal lagoons, river deltas and estuaries (Crivelli et al. 1997; Mix and Br\u00e4unlich 2000; Peja et al. 1996; del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding It breeds on small islands in fresh- water lakes (del Hoyo et al. 1992) or in dense aquatic vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1992) such as reedbeds of Typha and Phragmites (Crivelli 1994; Peja et al. 1996; Pyrovetsi 1997; del Hoyo et al. 1992), often in hilly terrain (Nelson 2005). A few breed in Mediterranean coastal lagoons (Peja et al. 1996; Nel- son 2005). The species makes use of habitats surrounding its breeding sites, including nearby islands and wetlands (Nelson 2005).

The species is known to breed in France (662-1,109 pairs), Italy (9,000-20,000 pairs), Malta (1,190 - 1,680 pairs), Algeria (8-10 pairs), Tunisia (176-200 pairs), Croatia (300-500 pairs), Albania (1-10 pairs), Greece (4,000-7,000 pairs) and Bulgaria (0-10 pairs), giving a global estimate of 15,300-30,500 pairs (Derh\u00e9 2012). Breeding is assumed in Turkey on offshore islands or mainland cliffs in the Aegean and Mediterranean, but there is very little data on this. A small population may also breed on the eastern Balearic Islands in Spain, although the existence of the species here is somewhat controversial, given the taxonomic uncertainty of the birds breeding in Menorca (Arcos 2011, Cur\u00e9 et al. 2010). Population trends in Albania, Algeria, Bulgaria, Tur- key and Tunisia are currently unknown, but declines are suspected in Croatia and Greece.

Light pollution from land can confuse the hatch- lings diverting them away from the ocean resulting in desiccation, increased risk of predation and, hence, death. The hatchlings and small juveniles are pelagic, drifting amongst rafts of sargassum (brown algae) and flotsam of the open ocean before migrating to shallower coastal waters. Juveniles have small spikes along the spine of the shell.** Habitat and ecology: Terrestrial nest sites* Loggerhead sea turtles spend most of their lives in the open ocean and in shallow coastal waters.

Adults and juveniles live along the continental shelf, as well as in shallow coastal estuaries. In the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, age plays a factor in habitat preference. Juveniles are more frequently found in shallow estuarine habitats with limited ocean access compared to non-nesting adults. Loggerheads occupy waters with surface temperatures ranging from 13.3-28.0\u00b0C (56-82\u00b0F) during non-nesting sea- son. Temperatures from 27-28\u00b0C are most suitable for nesting females. Juvenile loggerheads share the Sargassum habitat with a variety of other organisms. The mats of Sargassum contain as many as 100 different species of animals on which the juveniles feed. Some of the prey, such as ants, flies, aphids, leafhoppers, and beetles, are carried by the wind to these areas. En- demic prey of the mats include barnacles, small crab larvae, fish eggs, and hydrozoan colonies. Marine mammals and commercial fish, such as tuna, dolphin fish, and amberjacks, also inhabit the mats. Marine Turtle Specialist Group 1996. Caretta caretta. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

It has dark brown eyes, a parrot-like beak and extremely powerful yellow jaws. The flippers are proportionately small, and the body length is up to 1.5 m; 0.3-0.5 m in juveniles. Both the car- apace and flippers are reddish-brown in colour. The underside of the body is yellow. It commonly weighs up to 180 kg.This species is almost entirely car- nivorous using their powerful jaw to crack open crustaceans and shellfish, as Green Turtle Chelonia mydas (EN, Endangered) Description: A large marine turtle, reaching up to 1,200 mm in carapace length; largest Egyptian specimen is 1,190 mm. Carapace depressed, rounded, smooth; scutes juxtaposed; posterior edge without indentations; 4 coastal scutes; first marginal scute in contact with first vertebral scute. Head relatively small with a single pair of prefrontals. C. mydas differs from all other marine turtles in possessing serrations on the lower jaw, which facilitate grazing on marine grasses. Forelimbs and hind limbs have a single claw each. Males smaller, with longer tails and larger claws. Color of carapace light brown with dark streaks radiating out from a point at the posterior margin of each scute. Dor- sal sides of limbs and head brown, each scale edged yellowish. All ventral sides whitish yellow.** Habitat and ecology: Like most sea turtles, green turtles are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (for review see Hirth 1997). Upon leaving the nesting beach, it has been hypoth- esized that hatchlings begin an oceanic phase (Carr 1987), perhaps floating passively in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-ocean devel- opmental grounds (Carr and Meylan 1980, Witham 1991). After a number of years in the oceanic zone, these turtles recruit to neritic developmental areas rich in seagrass and/or marine algae where they forage and grow until maturity (Musick and Limpus 1997). Upon attaining sexual maturity green turtles commence breeding migrations between foraging grounds and nesting areas that are undertaken every few years (Hirth 1997). Migrations are carried out by both males and females and may traverse oceanic zones, often spanning thousands of kilometers (Carr 1986, Mortimer and Portier 1989). During non-breeding periods adults reside at coastal neritic feeding areas that sometimes coincide with juvenile developmental habitats (e.g., Limpus et al. 1994, Seminoff et al. 2003).* Class : REPTILIA Order : TESTUDINES Family : CHELONIIDAE Seminoff, J.A.

Ajloun Forest Reserve was established in 1987 to help conserve the im- portant evergreen Oak forest ecosystem. Its trees account for a signifi- cant part of Jordan\u2019s forested area, which covers only about 1% of the country. After the reserve establishment, RSCN initiated a captive breeding pro- gram aiming to reintroduce the locally extinct Roe Deer in 1988 , RSCN has managed to release a number of Roe Deer into the reserve, where they have continued to grow within their natural habitat. Ajloun Forest Reserve 7042 Jordan (c) RSCN 43 Class : MAMMALIA Order : CETARTIODACTYLA Family : BOVIDAE (c) Mert Gokalp Arabian Oryx, White Oryx Oryx leucoryx (VU, Vulnerable) Description: The Arabian Oryx (Oryx leucoryx) is the only native oryx species outside Af- rica. It is one of two oryx species that went extinct in the wild (the other be- ing the Scimitar-horned Oryx, Oryx dammah). Both sexes have long, slender horns pointed upward and slightly back that are narrower at the base than those of other oryx species. Although this species was extinct in the wild by 1972, since then free-ranging populations have been established in Israel, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. Arabian Oryx were formerly present throughout the Arabian Peninsula, extending north to Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Iraq, Syria, and Sinai. Poaching and overhunting in Oman eliminated the last wild indi- viduals. Fortunately, captive breeding efforts had begun in the 1950s and reintroduction efforts began in the early 1980s and are ongoing. The world captive population is around 6,000 to 7,000, but the re-introduced free-rang- ing populations include only around 250 mature individuals.** Habitat and ecology: Inhabits sandy and stony deserts.* The diets of the Arabian oryx consist mainly of grasses, but they will eat a large variety of vegetation, include trees, buds, herbs, fruit, tubers and roots. Herds of Arabian oryx follow infrequent rains to eat the new plants that grow afterward. They can go several weeks without water. Research in Oman has found grasses of the genus Stipagrostis are primarily taken; flowers from Sti- pagrostis plants appeared highest in crude protein and water, while leaves seemed a better food source with other vegetation. Behavioral ecology. When the oryx is not wandering its habitat or eating, it digs shallow depres- sions in soft ground under shrubs or trees for resting. They are able to detect rainfall from a distance and follow in the direction of fresh plant growth. The number of individuals in herd can vary greatly (up to 100 have been report- ed occasionally), but the average is 10 or fewer individuals. Bachelor herds do not occur, and single territorial males are rare. Herds establish a straight- forward hierarchy that involves all females and males above the age of about seven months. Arabian oryx tend to maintain visual contact with other herd members, subordinate males taking positions between the main body of the herd and the outlying females. If separated, males will search areas where the herd last visited, settling into a solitary existence until the herd\u203as return. Where water and grazing conditions permit, male oryx establish territories. Bachelor males are solitary. A dominance hierarchy is created within the herd by posturing displays which avoid the danger of serious injury their long, sharp horns could potentially inflict. Males and females use their horns to defend the sparse territorial resources against interlopers. IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group 2013. Oryx leucoryx. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Mating occurs during the late summer months, especially October, when the strongest males fight and compete for the right to breed by pushing against each other with their horns. Gestation lasts about five months and the majority of young are born in March. A litter size of one is usual, but twins and, very rarely, triplets occur. Sexual maturity is reached at two to three years, and offspring then leave their natal herd. Individuals can live up to 17 years . This diurnal species is ac- tive during the day and rests by night. The light, shiny coat is thought to help reflect incoming solar radiation, which allows the animal to remain active throughout the day, even during hot summer afternoons. The Nubian ibex is extremely agile, often maneuvering down steep, precipitous terrain to graze on grasses and leaves during the day, and later returning to the cliffs at night. The main predators of the ibex are leopards, eagles and bearded vultures. When threatened, individuals will rise up on their very strong hind legs and point their powerful-looking horns towards their predator. ** Habitat and ecology: Nubian Ibex occur in rocky, desert mountains with steep slopes and hills (which provide vital escape routes), and associated plateaus, canyons and wadis. They consume a wide array of herbaceous and woody plants. Nubian ibexes stand around 65\u201375 cm (2.1-2.6 ft) tall at the shoulder and weigh around 50 kilograms (110 lb). Nubian ibexes are a light tan color, with a white underbelly, in males there is also a dark brown stripe down the back. Nubian ibexes have long thin horns which extend up and then backwards and down. In males these reach around a metre in length while in females they are much smaller (around 30 cm or 12 in). Nubian ibexes live in rough dry mountainous terrain where they eat mainly grasses and leaves and are preyed upon by leopards, eagles and bearded vultures. Nubian ibexes live in herds composed solely of males or females. They are diurnal, meaning they are active during the day and rest during the night. On 16 March 1959, the British established the Yob Wildlife Reserve in northern Eritrea specifically to protect significant populations of Nubian ibex in the area. This species is also found in the Mujib Biosphere Reserve in Jordan African Houbara, African Houbara Bustard Chlamydotis undulata (VU, Vulnerable) Description: A striking bird resembling a turkey in shape, the houbara bustard is at its most magnificent during the courtship display. It is a slender bird, with a tuft of hairs in the centre of the crown, and long plumes of feathers drooping over the neck, the uppermost feathers being black while the lower ones are white with black tips [7]. The body is pale sandy-buff in colour, with dark- er brown lines and mottling, while the underside is white [2]. Large areas of black and brown occur on the flight feathers and the long, square tail is san- dy-chestnut and patterned with four distinct blue-black bars [7]. Male houba- ra bustards are slightly larger than females [2]. Source: Arkive Habitat and ecology: It inhabits sandy and stony semi-desert and is specialised to arid conditions where trees are absent and both shrub cover and herb layer are sparse (Col- lar 1979, Goriup 1997, Snow and Perrins 1998, Mart\u00ed and del Moral 2003). It feeds on invertebrates, small vertebrates and green shoots, and typically lays 2-4 eggs in a scrape on the ground. Eggs and young are susceptible to ground predators. North African populations may be sedentary or partial- ly migratory, moving relatively short distances to find recent plant growth (Snow and Perrins 1998). Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. The display begins with a period of strut- ting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line. The display is often accompanied by a series of subsonic booming calls (Gaucher et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b11bee1-7849-4145-8039-9ca62660b0e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b11bee1-7849-4145-8039-9ca62660b0e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/field-guide-key-species-lebanon-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A field guide : key species in Lebanon & Jordan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/field-guide-key-species-lebanon-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "011a1a0005335731f37ed2fa025ca23fcebd2e56bd06e573584c725ed8ed1de1"}, "2": {"node_id": "657e592c-8e5a-4ddf-8d3c-b33ffd6a9696", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/field-guide-key-species-lebanon-jordan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b44ad24e09841f7e1b0589ace2c923c51569f2bcafb632642646c7f2932a7198"}}, "hash": "74f9e5a42ef7086814979cccc83d258576c37d56249da08388e82909c2990e79", "text": "1996).* Class : AVES Order : OTIDIFORMES Family : OTIDIDAE BirdLife International 2014.

Saker falcons are generally two to three years old before they begin to breed, after which one brood of two to six eggs will be produced annually by the female. Chicks are able to fly after 45 to 50 days, but remain dependant on their parents for food for at least an- other 30 to 45 days, during which time they stay within the nesting territory. The saker falcon can be both highly agile and extremely fast as it hunts close to the ground [6], capable of diving for prey at 200 miles per hour Prey consists largely of mid-sized mammals such as ground squirrels, voles, ger- bils, jerboas, stoats and hares At other times, and particularly near water, ground-dwelling and aerial birds such as pheasants, oriental honey-buz- zards, quail, ducks, owls, thrushes, larks and songbirds form a significant proportion of the diet The saker falcon is a ferocious hunter and frequently attacks prey larger than itself.( source:arkive) Habitat and ecology: It is physically adapted to hunting close to the ground in open terrain, com- bining rapid acceleration with high manoeuvrability, thus specialising on mid-sized diurnal terrestrial rodents (especially ground squirrels Citellus) of open grassy landscapes such as desert edge, semi-desert, steppes and arid montane areas; in some areas, particularly near water, it switches to birds as key prey, and has recently substituted domestic pigeons for rodents in parts of Europe (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998). It uses copses or cliffs for nest sites (sometimes even the ground), occupying the old nests of other birds (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998). Clutch size varies from two to six, with means from 3.2-3.9 in different circumstances (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998). Breeding success varies with year (especially in areas where rodents cycle) (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species usually occurs singly or in pairs (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds are sedentary, part-migratory or fully migratory, largely depending on the extent to which food supply in breeding areas disappears in winter (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998). Migrant birds winter in East Afri- ca, southern Europe and southern Asia, and generally leave their breeding grounds in September and October, returning between February and May (del Hoyo et al. 1994).* Class : AVES Order : FALCONIFORMES Family : FALCONIDAE BirdLife International 2014.

Accessed 15 Jan 2014.\u201d A Field Guide Key Species in Lebanon and Jordan Archaeologists have identified Wadi Mujib as a human habitation site since the Copper Age (4500-3200 BCE). During biblical times, the Mujib River served as a major geographical and political boundary between the kingdoms of Moab and Ammon .Once a busy commercial area for salt and oil, villagers now depend on farming for their livelihoods. Established in 1985 ,the Mujib Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 212 km2 bordering the Dead Sea at lower than 416 meters below sea level, which makes it the lowest reserve on earth. It serves as an internation- ally- organized staging ground for migratory birds such as white storks and Levant Sparrows. At least nine species of birds of prey are known to breed in the reserve, including the little Owl and Long- legged Buzzard. The Mujib Biosphere Reserve is also the national home of the Nubian Ibex, a large mountain goat that was a symbol of the moon god during the reign of the Queen of Sheba. Once on the brink of extinction in the kingdom , the Ibex captive breeding program was initiated by the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature in 1989 and over 90 Ibex live in the Reserve today.

Adults have largely white to pale grey plumage, which contrasts markedly with the black flight-feathers and the bold yellow bare skin on the face (del Hoyo, 1994). The long, narrow bill has a yellow base and terminates with a black tip (del Hoyo, 1994) (Clark, 1999). The tail is short and wedge-shaped. The legs may be greyish-white, pink or pale yellow. Two sub- species of the Egyptian vulture are recognised; Neophron percnopterus ging- inianus is slightly smaller than Neophron percnopterus and has an entirely yellow bill. Juveniles have much darker plumage than the adults (del Hoyo, 1994), and may be grey-brown, brown or blackish-brown (Clark, 1999).** Habitat and ecology: Typically nests on ledges or in caves on cliffs (Sar\u00e0 and Di Vittorio 2003), crags and rocky outcrops, but occasionally also in large trees, buildings (mainly in India), electricity pylons (Naoroji 2006) and exceptionally on the ground (Gangoso and Palacios 2005). Forages in lowland and montane regions over open, often arid, country. Also scavenges at human settlements. Broad diet including carrion, tortoises, organic waste, insects, young vertebrates, eggs and even faeces. Usually solitary, but will congregate at feeding sites, such as rubbish tips, or vulture restaurants (i.e. supplementary feeding stations), and forms roosts of non-breeding birds (Ceballos & Don\u00e1zar 1990).
