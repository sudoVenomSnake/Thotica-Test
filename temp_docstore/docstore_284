In another recent development, in September 2005, the Supreme Administrative Court at Chiang Mai ordered the reinstatement of the names of 1,243 villagers into the citizenship register from Mae Ai after it was arbitrarily ordered to be removed by the Mae Ai district Local Administration Department which had the effect of taking away the citizenship rights of these villagers. 4.2 Participation of Indigenous Hill Peoples in Policy Formulation Participation with regard to natural resource management, as envisaged in the 1997 Constitution, is the involvement of individuals, groups or communities in receiving relevant information, accordingly identifying problems, planning and managing, monitoring and evaluating, and coming up with solutions and answers for the problems that are identified through such processes. However Thailand has long suffered from a top-down approach that failed to involve local people and represented the ideas and viewpoints of only a few people.130 By excluding communities from participatory natural resource management, intensive competition for resources resulted and, in turn, more 123\u201cDefending Thailand from invaders\u201d.24 August 1999.Found at <http://www.geocities.com/changnoi2/hillpeople.htm> (Visited 18.11.05). 124 ACHR. 125 About 100,000 people was estimated to fall within this category. 126 Their children are eligible for full Thai citizenship.

The Tambon Council and Administrative Authority Act of 1994, the Decentralization Act of 1999, the Enhancement and Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act of 1992, the Constitution etc all lay down provisions for involving people at the local level. In spite of criticisms against some of these laws, their potential is immense. Given the participatory and democratic nature of indigenous communities in decision making, it would not be difficult to adapt participatory approaches as envisioned in these enactments to natural resource management. There are already a number of projects and programs undertaken by the government as well as NGOs and community organizations that seek to implement decentralization plans based on these laws. However it also has the danger of displacing the already much threatened indigenous institutions. One of the greatest strength of indigenous institutions and systems are their ability to adjust and the space they allows for maneuvering according to different situations. Rather than adapting indigenous systems to a rigid structure with codified rules and regulations, statutory provisions must be flexible enough to accommodate the malleable nature of indigenous institutions. Further, the failure of many programs and policies of the government formulated without the involvement of communities illustrates the need for the active involvement of target communities as right holders. For one, involving communities from the outset would give a much better insight into the needs and concerns of the communities but more importantly it will give them a sense of ownership which is very vital to the success of any policy. Community Forest Bill Community forestry is not a recent concept but has been traced far back in the history of what now constitutes the Thai state.132 However community forestry as an approach entered the official forest resource management lexicon in 1985 with its appearance in the Thai National Forestry Plan (TNFP). Unfortunately, community forestry was inferred to mean commercial plantations by private concessionaires under the TNFP. The history of the Community Forestry Bill is closely linked to the political, social and economical developments of Thailand.133 Community forestry in Thailand is a highly politicized issue, it involves contesting discourses between centralized, professionally-oriented forest management, and a social movement of marginalized forest communities who advocate social justice and decentralization of resource management.134 It is not only a struggle for control of forest resources but is also increasingly becoming a constitutive struggle for power by the local people to govern themselves.135 131 Ganjanapan, Anan. 2003. pp 207-212 132 Sumarlan. p. 52. 133 For an excellent historical account and analysis of the developments and factors that shaped the Community Forestry Bill debate, see BRENNER et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0c14558-528c-414a-9333-b0ace4d3152c": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0c14558-528c-414a-9333-b0ace4d3152c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0aa046ff4da5c84ff5150cb29f1edb080a574dac809395f25aa21e6fa884ba8d"}, "2": {"node_id": "967e0cba-7a87-446b-bf97-e256fe8bc4df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5e76f9b1900319097ee552237f9b5c45188cd18cffda8b852c977822aec2523"}}, "hash": "2177d2abc42ac663b14afdbfe4a53331886363f34bb1da8b20fad9a36d249a1a", "text": "They divide developments into four phases: emergent phase (1985\u2013 1991), the hot phase (1991\u20131992), the submergent phase (1993\u20131996), and the Bill agenda (1996 until today). 134 Maneekul, Rachnee., et al. p. 171. 135 Wittayapak, Chusak.

Community forestry re-emerged in the political arena in 1992 in the context of national elections that were to be held the year with each political party proposing their own versions. It is no surprise that most of these attempts sputtered out after the election. However academics, researchers and NGOs drafted a version in 1993.137 Another draft known as the \u201cSuanbua Draft\u201d was brought out in 1996 which was approved in principle by the Cabinet, however political developments that toppled the government then again relegated the bill to the background. Using the provision of Article 170 of the Constitution which allows the public to propose new legislation if 50,000 or more signatures can be collected, the Assembly of the Poor proposed a people\u2019s version in 1997. After much discussion and lobbying, in Nov. 2001, the Council of State approved the community forest bill and sent it to the Senate for approval. However the Senate, in March 2002, passed the bill after making substantive changes that diminished the whole point of the bill. A table comparing the draft Community Forestry Bill passed by the Council of State and amendments made by the Senate indicates the changes are shown below:138 Draft Community Forestry Bill Amendments by Senate Section 18. The right to propose an area of community forest was limited to groups of 50 or more persons aged over 18 years and from a traditional community native or indigenous to the area that has been active in forest preservation for at least the previous five years. The number of proponents increased from 50 to 100 and community forests excluded in protected forest areas such as watersheds, wildlife sanctuaries, the time frame for forest conservation activity \u2018to at least five years before the bill takes effect\u2019. Section 29. Permits the community forestry group to request changes to the boundaries of the community forest areas for the improvement of its management plan or for the revocation of the entire or part of a community forest provided valid and clear reasons are detailed to the Community Forestry Committee. The expansion of designated community forest areas to be prohibited Section 31. Prohibits commercial-scale cutting of trees in all types of protected forest areas. Trees to be cut only for subsistence and public utility, which should follow guidelines set by a relevant policy committee. Locals cannot gather any forest products in the community forest except with permission from the Royal Forest Department The changes made to Section 18 have been particularly of concern as it would affect more than 500,000 families living in 5,000 community forests across Thailand. As it now stands, the Council of State will consider the amended bill and if they do not agree to the amendments, a joint committee will be formed to study the bill again. Several groups with different ideologies and political ambition have since then debated and made known their point, sometimes violently and forcefully. The most contentious issues concern the area permitted for establishing community forests, the activities to be allowed on the land and the control of the area, including penalties for contravening the rules.139 The whole debate is shaped by two conflicting stories about people and forests. One is that forests have to be generally protected against people, and the other, that village people, are suited to live in harmony with forests.140 136 Brenner et al. pp. 16 -17. 137 Maneekul et al. p. 172, 138 Adapted from Maneekul, et al. p. 173. 139 Makarabhirom, Pearmsak.

Each has tried to influence natural resource management in different ways. However it is also important to factor in the role of donors within the natural resource discussion as they have a huge say in how resources are managed and allocated. It is important that the specific roles of these institutions are identified within the overall framework of natural resource management, and at the same time, to examine how they interact with each other. 4.3.1 NGOs NGOs in Thailand have been instrumental in shaping policies on natural resource management. Within the environment discourse, two general categories of NGOs can be seen - the \u201cDark Green\u201d141 and the \u201cLight Green\u201d groups.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da857c95-454b-4e27-9a41-5f8e63527246": {"__data__": {"id_": "da857c95-454b-4e27-9a41-5f8e63527246", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d2791af8718408317681f05c6d0f9cc0912cf9797776dd647294fddfbc04bdc"}, "3": {"node_id": "659d4475-4195-42f2-8299-86eb4fb04752", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33c7728d1350057921ad894b1c20c094e1be61f2981b8723b378d9641e7490d5"}}, "hash": "31ae5fb9bccb0f33f9f041021251fb6b41716e2216afddd7db09f0ad34b3840d", "text": "The Dark Green groups are mostly middle class environmental groups who believe in strong conservation methods and the exclusivity of natural spheres and human beings. They argue that protected areas are too fragile for human use and should be completely preserved as \u201cuntouched wilderness\u201d undisturbed by human intervention.142 The Light Green groups on the other hand emphasize community involvement in natural resource management and believe that even within protected areas, human and nature can coexist. Not surprisingly, most indigenous organizations fall within this latter category. The difference in perspective has resulted in fragmentation of NGO opinions which has affected natural resource management gravely.143 For instance, the Community Forest Bill has been a strong site of contest between these two groups, preventing its enactment. As NGOs have the crucial role of synergizing and linking different agencies and organization, most importantly, connecting governments to the community, it is important that the differing approaches and viewpoints toward natural resource management among NGOs themselves are bridged. 141 Organizations such as the Sueb Nakasathien Foundation, Loak See Khiew Foundation, Thammanat Foundation, and the Association of Art and Environmental Conservation fall under this group. 142 See Laungramsri, Pinkaew.

It focuses on developmental work with seven indigenous groups found in the northern provinces of Thailand: Akha, Hmong, Lahu, Lisu, Lua, Karen and Iu Mien. Currently it is implementing the Highland Mapping Development and Biodiversity Management as one of its many projects. The project is an important effort towards involving communities in the decision making process through innovative use of technology. The project operates at two levels.144 Community and land use mapping is done using GIS. This information is then used in enhancing the capacity of communities by facilitating a more critical understanding and analysis of resource use. A number of trainings, consultations and workshops have been organized in which community maps are used as the negotiating basis for resource use. A participatory approach is utilized and emphasized in which everyone within a community is involved in decision making, notably women. Communities have been able to effectively engage with local governments, Forest and Park officials, using the information from this project to demarcate and negotiate resource use, even within national parks and protected areas. One of the limitations pointed out, though, is its inability to influence policy making at the national level. However, IMPECT has actively networked with other organizations to push for policy change. Besides the national network of indigenous groups, it actively engages with national level community and peoples organizations such as the National Federation of Peasants (NFP), Northern Farmers Network (NFN) etc. Organizations such as the NFP and NFN, where many lowland Thais are also actively involved, are potential platforms for fighting the negative stereotypes attributed to highland indigenous peoples. IMPECT also has been instrumental in formation of networks on indigenous health and women. 4.3.2 Community and People\u2019s Organizations Community and people\u2019s organization in Thailand, such as the Northern Farmers\u2019 Network, Assembly of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples etc, have been highly active in negotiating with different players within the natural resource management setting in developing a people-centric approach toward natural resource management.

Over the years, HNCC has taken up many activities of lobbying for positive policy change as well as implementing community activities at the local level.

HNCC was also instrumental in setting up a pre- school child development center among the Pgakenyaw. Inter-generational transfer of traditional knowledge is also an important feature of their activities with recordings of folk-songs, proverbs and poetries. They are presently involved in the implementation of a pilot project in four schools at Khun Tae, Khun Ya, Some Poi and Khun Pae where the curriculum consist elements of traditional knowledge and customs. The positive result of their capacity building activities can be seen from the level of participation of women in decision making which numbers almost as much as men. 4.3.3 Government A recurring criticism of the government\u2019s approach to natural resource management is the overlap between different government agencies and institutions that deal with natural resource management. Closely related to the overlap between government agencies is the overlying characteristic of provisions in key laws governing natural resource management. The recent restructuring attempts to address this problem but further clarification of roles and streamlining is needed. There are still a lot of institutional limitations and reluctance to address issues related to indigenous hill peoples. There is also an inherent problem with the segmented approach that the government takes in addressing natural resource management and indigenous hill peoples\u2019 issues. However there is a growing realization and recognition among government agencies on the need to involve all parties, especially the target groups in program and policy formulation. Participatory Land Use Planning of the RFD As an alternative to infeasible resettlement programmes and in order to address the complexity of environmental problems, a model called \"Participatory Land Use Planning\" was developed jointly by the Royal Forest Department and the University of Chiang Mai. The approach integrates measures of soil and forest conservation whereby emphasis is put on enabling local communities to assess and modify local land use systems according to watershed management objectives. After promising results during a pilot implementation that started in 1987, the model has been adopted by various large projects of international donors and has gained widespread popularity also in other countries. Critics, however, claim it overemphasizes social and psychological aspects such as community organisation and environmental awareness without providing clear guidelines for resource management and proof of its resource effectiveness. 39 4.3.4 Donors At the height of the development push during the 1980s, there were a total of 168 agencies from 31 government departments and 49 international donors active in Thailand.145 Donors have been instrumental in influencing the government to undertake programs and projects for highland development, starting with the controversial opium replacement monoculture cash-crop plantation projects and progressing to a plethora of programs now. Most of the projects now have a strong component focus on a decentralized natural resource management model that seeks to ensure the livelihoods and socio-economic needs of affected groups. However problems are still encountered in implementation of programs. There are criticisms against donors for pushing their self-defined agendas of \u201cdevelopment\u201d that are not sensitive to the needs of indigenous hill peoples or which would not realistically improve their situation. JOMPA Presently one project that touches the core issue of conservation, natural resource management and indigenous issues is the Joint Management of Protected Areas Project (JoMPA). JoMPA is a sub- component of the Thai-Danish Programme for Co-operation in Environment funded by DANIDA. It aims at promoting participatory approaches to protected area management in Thailand securing both biodiversity conservation and improved livelihood of local communities. Key problems addressed by the sub- component are the continued loss of biodiversity, degradation of the ecosystem functions, loss of livelihood opportunities for the rural poor and lack of democratic involvement of a broad range of stakeholders in the protected area management.146 JoMPA, in the long-term, aims to secure", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1c21d65-693b-42bd-9664-d1d5380975ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1c21d65-693b-42bd-9664-d1d5380975ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural Resource Management Country Studies: Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/natural-resource-management-country-studies-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f19c47f74a04cc95618e7682670f61904c89e9639b59e102564f685ec1e904bb"}}, "hash": "f19c47f74a04cc95618e7682670f61904c89e9639b59e102564f685ec1e904bb", "text": "biodiversity conservation with responsibilities and outcomes of sustainable management shared among authorities, local stakeholders and general public..147 It supports the implementation of basic principles of peoples\u2019 participation and decentralisation as stressed in the Constitution of Thailand and policies on decentralisation.

It is taken as an example because of the complexity of issues involved \u2013 the government\u2019s perceived need for creating protected conservation areas, increasing water demands, pressure from lowland agriculturists and conservation groups, criminalization of indigenous hill peoples and their response to such criminalization. Background Chom Thong district is located in Chiang Mai Province in northern Thailand. Karen oral history places their settlement (the village of Ban Klang) along the banks of the Mae Klang 200 years ago. Doi Inthanon National Park which includes Thailand's highest peak, Doi Inthanon, was demarcated in 1972 in the area above the village. The Park included many upper watershed areas and embraced many villages of the Karen, Hmong and other indigenous groups. Water from the Mae Klang, which originates in the upper watersheds of Doi Inthanon, is used to irrigate longan fruit orchards and paddy fields in the lowlands of Chom Thong. In 1985, the National Forestry Policy was adopted which aimed at maintaining 40 percent of Thailand as natural forest. The Policy resulted in more rigid and increased control over reserved forests areas. Communities were strictly prohibited from living or using any resources within protection zones and watershed class 1A areas. Further limited use of resources was allowed only in the buffer zone. The RFD used satellite images to demarcate most of the forest areas. Contrary to ground realities, they also assumed that older secondary forests were uninhabited. Indigenous hill peoples were excluded from any part of the process, the exclusion even extending to receiving any information about the land use planning decisions years after plans were adopted. The demarcations made illegal almost all the settlements in the area. Many communities came to know about their illegal status only when they were arrested. Much later, RFD officials working at the ground level came to realize that collaborative management of resources with the affected indigenous hill peoples was better than their exclusion. However, the idea of segregating \u201cnature\u201d and \u201cpeople\u201d was too deeply entrenched among policy makers. Many communities were relocated and resettled, often coercively, to areas that were infertile or already settled or with negligible agricultural areas. It created a new level of conflict and social, cultural and economical repercussions that were either unanticipated or ignored. In any case, such severe steps did not stop the degradation of natural resources but further aggravated the situation. Meanwhile, longan orchards were eating up huge parts of the lowland area around Chom Thong, which increased by about 50 square kilometers, demanding a steep rise in consumption of water. Unsurprisingly, water resource management became the focal point of resentment among lowland Thai farmers. The Chom Thong Watershed and Environment Conservation Club was formed in 1989 by these farmers to manage water resources for their interest across the whole district. They soon allied with the Dhammanaat Foundation which sought relocation and removal of indigenous highland peoples from their traditional settlements.

Immediately, lowland conservation groups blamed the indigenous highlanders claiming they destroyed the forest through fires to open new areas for agriculture. On the other side, indigenous highlanders pointed out businessmen who wanted to set up resorts as the culprits of the fires. Extreme steps were taken by lowland conservation groups, including blocking access roads to the highlands and barb wiring certain areas. The cement pillars of the barb wire fences were painted in the colours of the Thai flag \u2013 a clear sign that they considered the highland peoples to be foreigners or 'non-Thais'. They also campaigned successfully to overturn the three April 1997 Cabinet Resolutions that gave rights to communities to manage their forests. While the conflict is often characterised as a conflict over resources between lowland Thai farmers and indigenous highlanders, it is much more complex involving conflicting ideologies operating at several levels, most notably, the clash of ideas on conservation between groups such as the Dhammanaat Foundation, who espouse \u201curgent termination of settlements\u201d in conservation areas, and supporters of indigenous hill peoples and their traditional system of sustainable natural resource management. 41 Underlying differences in social, economic, political and cultural groundings amplified the conflict. The conflict was also used by influential lowland farmers to increase their control over resources. Response While the conflict has abated, it still remains largely unresolved. However it has served to underlined proactive steps taken by indigenous hill peoples for sustainable management of resoures. Indigenous communities put into place a more institutionalized set of regulations based on their traditional practices. They reduced their shifting cultivation areas drastically and learned new resource management skills. Community activities for resource management such as making forest fires breakers, checking illegal logging etc were conducted more efficiently. At the same time, efforts to counter negative propaganda against them were also undertaken. As a response, the conflict also saw the creation of the Northern Farmers Network (NFN) which links 107 villages located in 14 sub-watersheds in the upper northern region of Thailand. NFN strives to promote community forestry and local participation in natural resource management and the application of indigenous knowledge to management strategies. Many self-regulatory practices on a number of topics ranging from watershed management to harvesting non-timber forest products are negotiated and discussed among members. They recognize the need for dialogue with government and lowland communities and actively seek to involve them. NFN creates awareness about government policies and laws among their members and has been partly successful since then in encouraging government agencies to involve local communities and people\u2019s organizations in natural resource management. Lessons Learned The case highlights the tense lines drawn over resource use with increasing pressure on it from every quarter. It indicates some useful lessons as well. \u2022 Indigenous communities have taken positive steps to respond to changing resource availability and pressure. \u2022 Community forestry can be strengthened if there is institutional support from the government and a legal framework as its basis. \u2022 Coordination and cooperation between watershed communities facilitated through networks and associations can greatly enhance and stabilize natural resource management. 42 5. Challenges and Drawbacks 5.1 Democratization, Decentralization, Participation and Sustainability It is evident that the conflict over natural resources management in Thailand \u2013 be it land tenure insecurity, dispute over water resources or others \u2013 stems from the myopic process behind policies and laws that seek to govern resource management. Lack of participation from the affected quarters stymied most of the policies and laws before they were even implemented. What is the way out then? It is not so much the substance of a law that is the answer. However good a law is on paper, it would still need to pass the challenges of implementation. For implementation to be successful, it needs to involve the rights holders and stake holders. Involvement cannot be expected if there is no sense of ownership. It is here that democratization and decentralization with emphasis on participation comes in. It is only through such a process that the sustainability of any process, law or policy can be expected. Ultimately good resource management is a question of ensuring social justice. However, seeing the history of top-down administration in Thailand, democratization and decentralization remains a great challenge. 5.2 Implementation of Laws As can be seen, laws that were drafted before the last decade expressly exclude the utilization of resources within national forest reserves and other protected areas. They criminalize activities of indigenous communities which they have traditionally carried out for their sustenance.

Further, current laws and regulations prioritize the private sector. It has been found that strict enforcement of laws have not worked in arresting problems of natural resource management but instead exacerbated it. This can be attributed to two factors: the conflicting and overlapping nature of different laws governing natural resource management in Thailand; and the non- involvement of communities as right holders in natural resource management. The first have led to confusion among various government agencies about their roles which in turn leads to a more haphazard and arbitrary enforcement of laws. The second factor is a consequence of the conservation oriented approach of these laws which do not factor in the sustainable traditional resource use methods of indigenous peoples which alienates them further from government initiated activities as they do not get a fair share of benefits. Rural communities, specifically forest communities, have become important to the success of forest and environmental objectives as their relationship with the forest is rooted in culturally based indigenous knowledge and because of their proximity to the forest which ideally places them to either protect or destroy the forests.148 Fortunately some positive signs are emerging. The adoption of the Constitution of 1997 heralded a significant benchmark toward a more inclusive participatory approach. Along with this, the Tambon Council & Tambon Authority Act and the Decentralization Act, if implemented effectively and sincerely, has the potential to not only overhaul the bureaucratic set up of natural resource management but also the whole administrative structure of Thailand. In Tambons, such as Ban Luang TAO, where there is a strong 148 Makarabhirom, Pearmsak. \u201cForestland Policy Revisited: Opportunities For Policy Reform Of Thailand.\u201d (Mimeo). 43 representation of indigenous communities, there are already signs of the local administration being more receptive to resource management initiative of indigenous hill peoples. Although community forests do not have a legal basis, authorities have informally started recognizing them indicating a more open interpretation of laws. Further, the restructuring, reassignment and revision of responsibilities for natural resource management under Ministry of Natural Resource Management is a welcome initiative toward streamlining that will hopefully make law implementation more sensitive to ground realities and bring in the required changes. 5.3 Bridging Gaps between Different Actors With the decentralization and streamlining initiative, there is increased potential in bridging the gaps in perception of natural resource management among state agencies, NGOs and indigenous communities. However to be effective certain underlying issues need to be addressed. Closely related to the top-down approach of decision making is the negative attitude toward indigenous hill peoples and their use of natural resources. Government officials often assume that indigenous hill people are the culprit of natural resource degradation. They are unable to see resource use based on traditional customs and traditions as sustainable. Government programs usually tell communities what to do rather than try to understand how the forest is used and how that use can be improved to support the objectives and needs of both parties.149 Bridging gaps also need strong commitment and trust from all parties involved. The conflict of ideologies between different NGOs, conflict between stake holders and right holders etc all function at different levels to effect natural resource management adversely. Commitment should also come with the readiness to acquire the required skills necessary for natural resource management. Because of the strong bureaucratic background in which the government operated in the past, state agencies continue to see activities with indigenous hill peoples as a means to control them and not as a means to achieving better management of natural resource management. Therefore skills such as community organization, community liaison, facilitation qualities etc are required from those in a position of decision making. 5.4 Competing Discourses on Natural Resource Management In the analysis of natural resource management laws and their impacts on indigenous hill peoples, one angle that is often not given the importance it deserves is the conflict in ideological discourse between different NGO camps: the Dark Green and Light Green camps. Because of middle class support and elite representation, Dark Green NGOs, whose concept of nature is associated with an idealistic self- contradictory notion of an \u201cundisturbed\u201d nature, have been quite successful in blocking promising initiatives such as the Community Forest Bill that would have changed the whole structure of natural resource management in Thailand. The opposing discourses are not as simple as a disagreement in approach toward natural resource management but also contain a lot of sub-text of power relations, class equations and social structuring.

Often the bargaining power of women is not as strong as men which put them in a more vulnerable situation when natural resources that the community is dependent on are no longer accessible. In addition, there is sometimes an apparent contradiction between policies designed to protect the environment and those intended to improve local living conditions, and these contradictions also affect men and women differently due to their different roles in the collection and use of natural resource.152 Gender roles within indigenous communities are changing continually as a result of state policies. It is necessary that any policy formulation take gender into account. There is a need to acknowledge the specific needs, perspectives, and roles of women in natural resource management in Thailand. Their active participation in decision-making and the equitable sharing of benefits between men and women is crucial for ensuring the long term sustainability of natural resource management.153 In light of the many roles that women play, it is necessary to empower and impute them in natural resource management.

This was certainly the case when the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Regional Office in Thailand and the Special Unit for South- South Cooperation (SU-SSC) in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Regional Centre in Bangkok convened a meeting of United Nations, multilateral and bilateral aid agencies in March 2007. Many questions arose, which led JICA and UNDP to decide on collating Asian experiences on South-South and Triangular Cooperation from different perspectives. The resulting publication, \u2018Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South Cooperation in Asia\u2019, is an effort to document South-South and Triangular Cooperation in case studies that reflect the different policy and operational modalities from new development partners such as China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Thailand. It describes efforts to facilitate Triangular Cooperation by JICA, and other South-South Cooperation in the region, including by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The case studies presented outline the processes and institutions created to provide development assistance, as well as some of the challenges that these countries face as new aid providers. The publication also shows how some United Nations bodies, namely the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) have adopted strategies for using South-South and Triangular Cooperation to contribute to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). I hope that this publication will assist policy makers and development practitioners to scale up South- South and Triangular Cooperation arrangements, as well as help the new development partners to establish stronger institutions to support their growing development cooperation needs. Finally, I wish to express my thanks to the JICA Regional Office for its collaboration on this project. Yiping Zhou Director Special Unit for South-South Cooperation, New York 10 Foreword Since joining the Colombo Plan in 1954, Japan has provided continual support to developing countries, especially those in Asia, making a tremendous contribution to their recovery from the damage caused during World War II. Later in the 1990s, Japan became the world's leading aid donor by volume, and made a great contribution to the economic development and peace building of the world. Through such cooperation, some developing countries shifted from being not only aid-recipient but also aid-providing countries. We directed our attention to such countries from the early stages and entered into partnerships with them. These partnerships enabled us to support their contributions to the socio-economic development of other developing countries or regions by utilizing their own resources and expertise. The partnerships, which are designed to suit the context of recipient countries, are well assimilated and also work in conjunction with what is traditionally called North- South Cooperation. Overall, these experiences have proved the efficiency of SSC to the aid community. Recently, South-South Cooperation or Triangular Cooperation has been attracting considerable attention, especially in the course of regional economic integration \u2013 through the efforts of ASEAN, for example \u2013 where narrowing the development gap among countries is one of the urgent priorities. In this, SSC is playing a vital role. Defining SSC as \u201cmutual cooperation aimed at fostering self-sustaining development, involving deepening relations among developing countries while conducting technical and economic cooperation\u201d, JICA has been supporting SSC vigorously, aiming to spread positive cooperation results through our development partners to neighbouring countries in the most appropriate ways. It is our belief that through supporting SSC, we are also able to share development challenges, create firm relationships with our development partners and strengthen development networks. Consequently, we feel the need to provide examples of our SSC initiatives and to highlight the positive contributions made by pivotal countries in SSC in the Asia Pacific Region, to demonstrate best practices and lessons learned. This publication was completed through the efforts of various agencies and organizations that support us, and I am deeply grateful to all the contributors for sharing valuable practices and lessons.

Yasunori Onishi Chief Representative JICA Thailand Office 11 Introduction In 1999, Bloom, Canning & Malaney of the Harvard Centre for International Development marvelled at the economic growth of East Asian countries. 1 They noted that in the previous 30 years, real per capita income had nearly tripled in this region. They also observed that such sustained, rapid growth for such a large number of countries had never occurred before. The result of this growth was that several economies that had started as low- or middle-income countries had become genuine industrial leaders. By 2009, more Asian countries had joined the ranks of these fast-growing countries and industrial leaders. The inclusion of the world\u2019s two most populous countries, China and India, in this group has seen the number of the world\u2019s poor reduced tremendously on the back of the success of these two countries. Asia has a mix of industry leaders such as the Republic of Korea, Singapore and China (including Taiwan and Hong Kong), a large number of middle-income countries, and some least-developed countries (LDCs). This mix of countries at different levels of development has led to very strong intraregional South-South Cooperation on a bilateral basis and within regional groupings such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). In the past decade, Asian countries have shown greater outreach in SSC to other regions, particularly Africa and the Middle East. An additional impetus for the growth of SSC is Japan\u2019s role in promoting Triangular Cooperation. A meeting convened by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Regional Support Office and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Regional Centre in Bangkok in March 2007 showed that although SSC has been scaled up in the Asian region, there are still many questions to be answered about its advantages and disadvantages. The meeting consisted of bilateral donors, United Nations (UN) agencies and other multilateral donors. Some of the issues discussed included the role of the new development partners, or the emerging donors, and commitment to aid effectiveness under SSC. Some participants wished that all donors subscribed to the Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness. There were questions on what the expanded role of the multilateral agencies could be, whether regional cooperation is also SSC, and a challenge to the usually assumed model of Triangular Cooperation whereby a passive donor provides funds to a third party or country which then delivers a programme of assistance. This publication is an attempt to answer all these questions, through case studies rather than postulation. The document is designed as a knowledge product, to provide information and examples. The publication is divided into in two parts: Part I consists of country case studies describing aid delivery structures, philosophies and the strategies of new development partners as the providers of SSC services. Part II focuses on the programmes and initiatives of SSC and Triangular Cooperation, describing the experiences of such programmes \u2013 which are supported by bilateral, regional and multilateral organizations. Part II also attempts to analyse and extrapolate lessons learned from the experiences accumulated so far, to contribute to the knowledge base for SSC. The JARCOM chapter constitutes a strong critical analysis of SSC and Triangular Cooperation. The UN agency case studies show innovative approaches to using SSC. ASEAN is a rich case, demonstrating intraregional, bilateral and multilateral SSC. In both cases, Triangular Cooperation is implemented in support of the South-South initiatives. The South-South Disaster Project \u2013 in which 10 pilot countries, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and the Regional South-South Unit of the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok are working together \u2013 demonstrates an effort to develop multilateral South-South programmes led by member countries, with UN agencies playing a facilitating rather than a lead role. 1 Bloom DE, Canning D, Maloney PN, Demographic Change and Economic Growth in Asia, CID Working Paper 15, Centre for International Development, Harvard University, 1999. 13 China: Principles for foreign assistance Denis Nkala Chief, Special Unit for South-South Cooperation South-South Regional Unit UNDP Regional Centre, Bangkok2 \u201cAs one of the developing countries, China always attaches great importance to, and support for, South-South Cooperation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc7f9cc4-30e2-4fc8-a359-c0727230ac03": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc7f9cc4-30e2-4fc8-a359-c0727230ac03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74676f8a185366254453fde2c9c709afc169c906f2969542c73d4d27cdb98c29"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6c0cdd3-972f-4469-b72a-670d5429d1a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b13938d57dc5e7ee35de243df63068d051f6ca813926b2b3d6124175213bd942"}}, "hash": "b54769ddcfb85838e589d65ee44f998127db9d69af87ed6c7df027f190850c27", "text": "For decades, China has conducted fruitful activities in economic and technical cooperation with other developing countries, and has offered, within its abilities, economic and technical assistance.\u201d Overview of China\u2019s external assistance Over the past 25 years, the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China has had one of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71cb7c90-579b-4099-95bc-c43eb2325899": {"__data__": {"id_": "71cb7c90-579b-4099-95bc-c43eb2325899", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27eb0e2a2f25aa94b1e95231cab87109a6510beb4c10ab0b2744922ba3f66f9e"}, "3": {"node_id": "376c25f7-803e-43b2-bcd8-f1d02d7c725a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92d56d239e293e6d4992bb1a3cd6c62392da04c0c68e6c2e0640d34973c72da4"}}, "hash": "4482b1d564f350e56f6c279492261886a62195ac3e8b644767c1896fa3af8066", "text": "the fastest-growing economies in the world. Gross domestic product (GDP) average growth for the period exceeded 10 percent per year. Per capita income grew by an average of 8 percent in the last 30 years. 250 million people lived in rural extreme poverty in 1978. Despite the massive reduction of rural extreme poverty, in 2006 there were still 21.48 million rural people classified as extremely poor. In 2008, China\u2019s per capita income was ranked 107 out of 179 countries by the International Monitory Fund (IMF). With this low per capita income, China is considered a developing country and still receives aid from abroad. However, China\u2019s history as a donor dates back over five decades, and strictly speaking, the country is not an emerging donor. In 1953, China began to provide aid to other developing countries, especially to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and subsequently to Viet Nam. Through its own experience as a recipient of foreign assistance, China developed the view that external assistance should support \u201ceconomic self-reliance\u201d (of recipient countries) and promote \u201cequality and mutual benefit\u201d (Kobayashi, 2008). These fundamental principles have had a bearing on how China has implemented its assistance programmes to other developing countries. China\u2019s assistance has grown in terms of its size, modalities and fields of cooperation. China has provided different forms of aid to more than 120 developing countries, and carried out over 2,000 projects covering more than 20 different sectors including industry, agriculture, low-cost housing construction, culture, education, health, transportation and human resources development. China has also provided substantial amounts of physical goods to developing countries. In terms of human capacity development, about 90,000 personnel from developing countries have been trained in different types of applied technology. In addition, since the 1960s, China has continuously sent medical teams to other developing countries. Up to 2009, about 20,000 medical professionals have been sent to 65 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe. China has provided special attention to the interests of LDCs in all parts of the world, with special focus on poor countries in Africa. In order to help them lift their heavy debt burden, China has remitted debts for some heavily indebted countries and granted zero customs tax status for their export goods into China\u2019s market. China assists many low income countries in the development of their infrastructure. This has been welcomed by some poorer countries that have seen assistance for infrastructure reduced over the past few decades. In recent years, China has actively participated in international humanitarian assistance. For example, after the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004, and the Pakistan earthquake of October 2005, China responded promptly, providing emergency humanitarian aid to the disaster-stricken countries. After the tsunami, part of China\u2019s emergency humanitarian aid was provided through UNDP\u2019s Special Unit for South-South Cooperation (SU-SSC). The funds were channelled through the United Nations South-South Trust Fund, to which other southern countries contributed to support recovery efforts in the affected countries. The assistance emphasized the priority needs of these countries. For example, some countries such as Sri Lanka reported that they were receiving substantial financial resources but little support for human resources to coordinate the response and recovery effort. Funds from China and other southern countries helped to close this gap. 2 The writer is indebted to Dr Meixiang Zhou for his contribution to the earlier drafts of this document. 14 Trends in China\u2019s external assistance Figure 1 shows China\u2019s expenditures for external assistance to other countries since 1955. From 1956 to 1978, China provided aid despite its own economically precarious situation (Anshan, 2007). According to Kobayashi (2008), in the 1970s China increased its external assistance above the average for countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC). During the years of economic reform in China, from 1978 to 1985, China faced its own domestic challenges as it moved from a planned to a market economy. Although faced with these challenges, it continued to provide a significant level of external assistance. The country also expanded its aid to include preferential and discounted loans as well as joint ventures. Until 1990, there were fluctuations in year-to-year assistance expenditures. After 1990, assistance steadily increased, perhaps reflecting the stronger Chinese economy and new policy frameworks for external assistance. The frameworks emerged from a number of conferences on foreign aid that China convened.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "376c25f7-803e-43b2-bcd8-f1d02d7c725a": {"__data__": {"id_": "376c25f7-803e-43b2-bcd8-f1d02d7c725a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27eb0e2a2f25aa94b1e95231cab87109a6510beb4c10ab0b2744922ba3f66f9e"}, "2": {"node_id": "71cb7c90-579b-4099-95bc-c43eb2325899", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4482b1d564f350e56f6c279492261886a62195ac3e8b644767c1896fa3af8066"}}, "hash": "92d56d239e293e6d4992bb1a3cd6c62392da04c0c68e6c2e0640d34973c72da4", "text": "The frameworks emerged from a number of conferences on foreign aid that China convened.

Grants entail providing goods, training participants, holding workshops and seminars, as well as sending some volunteers and providing technical assistance to developing countries. Examples are Senegal and Uganda, which have received about $55 million and $100 million respectively for public works in the last five years. The grant element is managed by MOFCOM. Debt relief China has provided debt relief for heavily-indebted countries and the poorest countries in Africa. The amount increased after 2000, and in 2007 the Chinese leadership announced that China would sign debt relief agreements with 33 heavily-indebted or least-developed countries in Africa by the end of that year. Under these agreements, China agreed to cancel all government interest-free loans that had matured by 2005. Some of the countries to benefit include Cameroon, Kenya, Madagascar, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. The total amount of debt relief was about $1.27 billion (Alden, 2008). Tariff concessions China announced that it would open its markets to LDCs, and in particular would increase the number of tariff-free items from Africa from 190 to over 440 before the end of 2009 (Anshan, 2007). Concessional loans Concessional loans are medium- to long-term low-interest credit that China extends to other countries through the Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM). MOFCOM draws up the policies and plans for concessional lending and signs agreements with the recipient country governments. EXIM is the sole organization authorized to appraise projects, disburse funds, manage the loan and collect the principal and interest. The concessional loans offered by China are meant to promote economic development and improve living standards in developing countries. In the longer term, China\u2019s aim is to increase economic cooperation between developing countries and itself. China considers concessional loans to be a major tool for sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s development. 16 The main areas of focus for this scheme are usually the development of economic infrastructure, industries and social services and for procurement of goods and services from China. The criteria for access to concessional loans include the following: 1. The project should be approved by the recipient country\u2019s government and China. 2. The borrowing country should have diplomatic ties with China. 3. The borrowing country should have a stable political and economic situation and debt servicing capacity. 4. The project should be technically and economically feasible. 5. The project will generate social benefits. 6. Chinese companies should be selected as contractors. 7. Equipment, technology and services should preferably be procured from China (no less than 50 percent should be procured from China). 8. Local inputs for the project should be in place in advance of the project approval. Foreign firms in a joint venture project with a Chinese firm are also eligible for concessional loans. In this case, the Foreign Aid Joint Investment and Cooperation Fund, established in 1998, is used to support the joint venture. Non-interest loans Non-interest loans were used to finance plant, social services projects and civic facilities. It seems that they were mostly phased out under the assumption that the non-concessional elements would be moved to grants. In that regard, construction of schools, hospitals and low-cost houses would be taken over by the grant scheme. However, in the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held in 2000, China said that the non-interest loan scheme would still be utilized for Africa.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b18b056-e94b-468f-9fb5-ab5209e32ac8": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b18b056-e94b-468f-9fb5-ab5209e32ac8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25b874dc6b306a39ba484920fe44e7bd3586f500d2e6ba4effa7653863ddfea3"}, "2": {"node_id": "2bc7cf1b-01af-4d31-ab78-1d5197f15228", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b864f514735d82985187746e0a23c2825a030374fcec0561afd50987520635eb"}}, "hash": "518721f96a52a9c9333d9ca4d9b420977dc7f5c8721dda186c5a01c85d4c48de", "text": "South-South Cooperation Chinese officials have indicated that aid should not be seen as a unilateral gift from one country to another but should benefit both countries (Kobayashi, 2008).

The Chinese institutions listed in Table 1 are part of the network and are designated as \u201ccentres of excellence\u201d. The centres are supposed to provide technical support to other developing countries and have developed applied technologies in fields such as mini and micro hydropower, biogas and solar energy. The network aims to enhance China\u2019s SSC with other developing countries through economic and technical exchanges, joint research and the formulation of public\u2013private partnerships to promote SSC. 17 Table 1: South-South network cooperating institutions \ufffd China International Centre for Economic and Technical Exchanges \ufffd Asia-Pacific Edible Mushroom Training Centre \ufffd Beijing Food Biology Centre \ufffd Asia-Pacific Regional Biogas Research and Training Centre \ufffd Beijing Vegetable Research Centre \ufffd China National Bamboo Research Centre \ufffd China Centre of Rural Energy Research and Training \ufffd China International Centre for Agricultural Training \ufffd China Meat Research Centre \ufffd China Northeast Asia Agricultural Research and Training Centre \ufffd Asia-Pacific Research and Training Centre for Solar Energy (Gansu Natural Energy Research Institute) \ufffd Hangzhou Regional (Asia-Pacific) Centre for Small Hydropower \ufffd International Centre for Research and Training on Seabuckthorn \ufffd Asia-Pacific Regional Research and Training Centre for Integrated Fish Farming \ufffd International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation \ufffd World Meteorological Organization Regional Meteorological Training Centre \ufffd Regional Sericulture Training Centre for Asia and the Pacific Source: UNDP China Country Office (2008) Institutional structures of China\u2019s external assistance There are several institutions that play a role in the policy setting and delivery of China\u2019s external assistance. The relationships between these institutions and China\u2019s aid delivery system is illustrated in Figure 3. The roles of these institutions are discussed in the following sections. The Ministry of Finance Individual ministries with external aid budgets submit them to the Ministry of Finance. The ministry compiles an external assistance budget which is authorized by the National People\u2019s Congress. The Ministry of Finance is also responsible for debt relief and China\u2019s contributions to multilateral organizations. The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) The Department of Aid to Foreign Countries is under the Ministry of Commerce. It is also known as the Department of Foreign Aid (DFA). The department is responsible for overall aid policy and oversight on implementation of the policies. The DFA is one of 25 departments under MOFCOM and the only one responsible for external assistance. In its responsibility for external assistance, the DFA undertakes the following functions: 18 \ufffd negotiating and signing agreements, monitoring implementation and handing over completed projects; \ufffd planning overall aid policy including regulations and aid reforms, as well as gathering statistics on aid; \ufffd oversight on concessional lending and the Foreign Aid Joint Investment and Cooperation Fund, to assess the qualification of firms bidding for projects. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is involved in aid policy from the overall foreign policy perspective. In international forums, the ministry has upheld the principles of equal treatment of countries, respect for sovereignty, non-interference, mutual benefit and co-development. Other institutions Other means of assistance to foreign countries outside MOFCOM include medical assistance through the Ministry of Health, technical assistance through the Ministry of Science and Technology, secondment of teachers through the Ministry of Education and relief supplies during disasters provided by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. The Ministry of Culture, the General Sport Administration and the State Administration of Religious Affairs have also provided SSC. Provincial and city governments sometimes provide technical assistance to other countries. Although the aid system seems decentralized between several ministries, departments and agencies, there are coordination measures in place including the following: \ufffd joint working arrangements made between the ministries of Commerce, Foreign Affairs and Finance on external assistance; \ufffd a communication system on external assistance linking all cities and provinces; \ufffd communication arrangements in place among 14 MOFCOM departments; \ufffd a joint overseas project monitoring system relating to finance and personnel set up by the ministries of Finance, Commerce and Foreign Affairs;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e55578aa-ee92-42f0-b93b-d540761ee2d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "e55578aa-ee92-42f0-b93b-d540761ee2d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43189201ee8a0ab9e01369229f77bbaaf6be1feee2f7fb62581cbea057be921e"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d49eb12-8563-413d-a5e4-21165eafaec5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa49ab266f6a09150f38f9761a96894cd28a6eb94de5874d2dfd00e2d667726f"}}, "hash": "1047f0bcd34b9cc10381f338f027bda59202d313bf390a89a861b11c7a8e7450", "text": "\ufffd EXIM Bank, established in 1994 to administer concessional lending.

Its development assistance is based on the principles of equal treatment of all countries, a respect for sovereignty, non-interference, mutual benefit and co-development. Its development assistance for other developing countries is frequently perceived from two perspectives: The first is that its aid is complementing development assistance from northern donors by offering poorer countries alternative sources of funding, especially in infrastructure development. Another view is that with the non-conditionality principles that underlie its assistance (no political strings attached), Chinese aid could be a hindering factor for promoting good governance in recipient countries. It is said that by allowing countries to renege on good governance and reforms, China may be undermining the good practices on development assistance nurtured by OECD donors over the years. This profile of China\u2019s development assistance is intended to provide knowledge on the processes and institutions China has developed for SSC. It does not attempt to appraise these principles. However, it is clear that the principles that China holds and has so far defended \u2013 as a rising global power \u2013 are likely to shake the foundations of traditionally held views on foreign aid in the immediate and foreseeable future.

This inspired us to establish cooperative technical and economic links with a very large number of developing countries. A deliberate and systematic effort has been undertaken to spread the reach of our South-South Cooperation activities to different regions of the globe. The Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation or ITEC, which was launched in 1964, has provided over US$2 billion worth of technical assistance covering 156 developing countries.\u201d Sharma P, Joint Secretary, External Cooperation, UN High-Level Committee on South-South Cooperation, 2007 Overview of India\u2019s technical cooperation and institutional structure India is the seventh-largest country in the world by geographical area. It is the second most populous after China. Its population in April 2007 was estimated at 1.13 billion, about 17 percent of the world\u2019s population. It has one of the world\u2019s six fastest-growing economies. Among the big economies, India has the second fastest-growing economy after China. According to \u2018India: Partner for Development in the South\u2019, published by the Ministry of External Affairs (2005), the Government of India traces its conceptual support for SSC back to 1927 when Nehru said of close relations with other countries, \u201cIt is to the advantage of both of us to know more of each other and to cooperate wherever possible\u201d. The actual cooperation programme of the Government of India was started when the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme (ITEC) was launched in 1964. Today, the Technical Cooperation Division of the Ministry of External Affairs administers the ITEC Programme as well as the Special Commonwealth Assistance for Africa Programme (SCAAP). Cumulatively, with ITEC and SCAAP together, India has assisted 156 countries in Africa, Asia, Central Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, providing over $2 billion worth of technical assistance since 1964. In addition to these programmes, a new Development Partnership Programme (DP) was launched in January 2005 and the Development Partnership Division was created under the Ministry of External Affairs to administer the resources for this new programme.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d49eb12-8563-413d-a5e4-21165eafaec5": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d49eb12-8563-413d-a5e4-21165eafaec5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43189201ee8a0ab9e01369229f77bbaaf6be1feee2f7fb62581cbea057be921e"}, "2": {"node_id": "e55578aa-ee92-42f0-b93b-d540761ee2d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1047f0bcd34b9cc10381f338f027bda59202d313bf390a89a861b11c7a8e7450"}}, "hash": "aa49ab266f6a09150f38f9761a96894cd28a6eb94de5874d2dfd00e2d667726f", "text": "The objectives of the DP are to strengthen delivery by India of project assistance to other developing countries.

It has four subcomponents. These are: (i) training in India, (ii) project assistance and concessional loans, (iii) deployment of Indian experts abroad, and (iv) study tours to India. Figure 6 shows that the bulk of ITEC resources are channelled towards training in India and project-related activities (approximately 40 percent to each subcomponent). The balance goes to Indian experts abroad and study tours. Figure 6: Budgetary share of ITEC subcomponents Source: ITEC (http://itec.nic.in/about.html) ITEC implements its programmes with the assistance of several public-sector institutions. These include the National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC), Hindustan Machine Tools International Limited (HMTI); Water and Power Consultancy Services Limited (WAPCOS), Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) and Central Electronics Limited (CEL). In the field of construction, several institutions such as India\u2019s Building Materials and Technology Promotion Council, the Housing and Urban Development Cooperation and the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion are working closely with UNIDO\u2019s interregional project to use energy- efficient, environment-friendly and local resources-based technologies. Training in India The training subcomponent constitutes about 40 percent of the annual ITEC Programme budget. ITEC is divided into civilian and military training. Under civilian training, over 6,000 participants from ITEC partner countries have been trained in what ITEC calls its most successful component of the cooperation programme (see Table 2 for the list of ITEC countries).

The duration of the training courses ranges from 4 to 15 weeks. The procedure to apply for the courses is laid down as follows: 1. Use a prescribed form to apply through your government, ministry or department or a foreign office, which should recommend the applicant to the Indian Embassy or High Commission. 2. Officials of government, public institutions, universities, chambers of commerce or industry can apply for scholarships both under ITEC and the Special Commonwealth Assistance for Africa Programme. Scholarships are granted by the Ministry of External affairs. 3. The application will probably be sent to the relevant training institution to determine if the nominee qualifies. 4. A successful candidate\u2019s organization will be informed and thereafter the selected trainees briefed by the Indian Embassy or Mission. Project assistance and concessional loans This subcomponent accounts for another 40 percent of the annual ITEC Programme budget, and includes activities related to project consultancies, feasibility studies and concessional loans. Under this subcomponent, India assists other developing countries to establish infrastructure facilities. The major focus of project assistance so far has been in agriculture. Countries that have benefited in this sector are Ghana, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Mali and Suriname. 26 ITEC carries out feasibility studies and consultancy services on request. The results of these studies are handed over to the governments concerned, free of charge, to adopt as they see fit. Although India does not provide grants, it sometimes offers concessional loans that are intended to help countries develop their infrastructure for water supply, power transmission, irrigation, construction of roads and railways, as well as supply of equipment such as tractors. The Indian Government indicates that over the last 40 years, it has signed 76 credit agreements with 24 countries (Government of India, 2005). The repayment period for capital goods is 12 years including a three- year grace period. The country uses lending agencies including the Export-Import Bank of India. The lending agents are allowed to mobilize credits from international markets, which are guaranteed by the Indian Government.

In general, 85 percent of the credit should be used for procurement of goods and services from India. One example of India\u2019s concessional financing is the Team Nine Initiative, in which eight West African countries have embarked on bilateral and regional projects using $500 million provided by India in lines of credit. The initiative encourages public\u2013private partnerships in implementing the projects. Another example is the $200 million in lines of credit made available to the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD). Deployment of Indian experts Indian experts are deployed to countries on request to assist in development activities. They study the problems and suggest solutions that take into account the local socio-economic and cultural environment. The salaries, allowances and international travel expenses for experts are met by the Government of India. The norm is that partner countries are expected to provide accommodation, local transport, an office and reasonable medical facilities. If the receiving country or institution is unable to provide these facilities, the Government of India may also provide for these in the spirit of SSC. The fields of expertise most often provided by Indian experts are listed in Table 5.

Depending on areas of interest, two- to three-week programmes are designed, and during the tour the foreign delegations are taken to relevant institutions and training centres. Cooperation through regional initiatives and partnership Although the ITEC programmes identified above are mostly delivered on a bilateral basis, there are other ways that India provides assistance to other countries. These involve Triangular Cooperation and cooperation through regional initiatives. Some of the partner institutions include the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the Group of 77, the Afro-Asian Rural Reconstruction Organization (AARRO) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). One example of regional collaboration is India\u2019s work with other countries in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to improve infrastructure, reduce poverty, prevent natural disasters and mitigate pandemics. For example, at the 2007 UN High-Level Committee on South-South Cooperation, India indicated that it had offered $100 million for the SAARC Development Fund to be utilized for poverty alleviation through economic, social and infrastructure development programmes. India is a pivotal country 3 recognized as playing a \u201cleading role\u201d in the promotion and application of SSC. It has sought to establish partnerships with other countries to assist less-developed countries. An example of this was the creation of a fund under the India-Brazil-South Africa (IBSA) Dialogue Forum at the Rio de Janeiro Ministerial Meeting of March 2006. The communiqu\u00e9 from that meeting indicates that the ministers reaffirmed that SSC is an essential and fundamental component of international cooperation for development, and stressed their support for mainstreaming SSC and the pursuit of the development of technical cooperation amongst developing countries to its full potential. In this regard, they recommitted themselves to work together for the enhancement of SSC and emphasized the establishment of the IBSA Fund as an example of cooperation among three developing countries for the benefit of the neediest nations of the South. The contributions to the Fund are managed by UNDP and deployed to support projects in poor countries. The projects are identified by the three countries. The Special Commonwealth Assistance for Africa Programme The second-largest programme in India\u2019s technical cooperation is the Special Commonwealth Assistance for Africa Programme. The 18 African members of the Commonwealth (excluding Zimbabwe, which left in 2003) are the beneficiaries. Essentially, the African countries have access to similar programmes as the other ITEC countries. The major distinguishing factor of this programme is that its resources are earmarked for the African Commonwealth members. Aid for Disaster Relief (ADR) India provides aid for disaster relief including food (particularly rice), blankets, medicines and chemicals. In addition, India also provides trained search-and-rescue teams in emergencies, as well as setting up Web-based information systems and training people for disaster risk reduction.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50334553-94d9-4a8b-9a4e-5bc50d473202": {"__data__": {"id_": "50334553-94d9-4a8b-9a4e-5bc50d473202", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e6af86bab89d2a7ad9819b2f7a0a40c4f33b955e0d3791d2c26d92799f34415"}, "3": {"node_id": "35007c6c-ed9f-4120-9231-cebe3aed131f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "627c4667c5c61f5b0ba6cfd37452d3613ed0c93ac68caf93030770420a81ae8e"}}, "hash": "9ae81138699596f8dc540773e27b4d57d443e1e6047bb59e131d59183ae38ff4", "text": "3 The concept of pivotal countries was created in 1995 within the new directions given on TCDC by the High-Level Committee following recommendations of the United Nations General Assembly. 28 Conclusion The Indian cooperation programme does not offer grants but offers its human resources and technological know-how to other developing countries. India has a large assistance programme and a broad range of areas in which it has relevant expertise. The description of the programmes here shows the range of SSC initiatives that India is ready to share with its partners in all parts of the world. The trends show intensive cooperation with South Asian countries and Africa. For more details, the reader is directed to the ITEC Website (http://itec.nic.in/about.html) and the publication, \u2018India: Partner for Development in the South\u2019. India\u2019s SSC programmes are remarkable because the country still faces its own challenges at home, including high levels of poverty. According to the African Development Bank, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the 2007 UNDP publication, \u2018The Millennium Development Goals: Progress in Asia and the Pacific\u2019, India has reduced the proportion of extreme poverty from 41.8 percent to 34.3 percent and is on target to meet Goal 1 to reduce extreme poverty by half in the period to 2015. However, it is clear that the rate of poverty is still high. India also illustrates the fine line between SSC and official development assistance. There is no clear distinction between the two in the various descriptions of Indian assistance.

These are merely expressions of solidarity and cooperation borne out of shared experiences and sympathies, nothing more and nothing less. In this regard, my delegation believes, many others are concerned with the increasing rate at which the term \u2018emerging donors\u2019 is being used in the UN and elsewhere. To the extent that it is used, it should be confined primarily to those members of the OECD who are not yet members of the OECD\u2019s Development Assistance Committee [DAC]. \u201cMalaysia firmly believes that South-South Cooperation extends beyond economic and technical cooperation. It also includes political cooperation, especially in the context of creating an enabling international order based on the principles of justice, equality and mutual respect. It is to this vision that Malaysia will forever be devoted to.\u201d HE Ambassador Hamidon Ali, UN High-Level Committee on South-South Cooperation, 2007 Background Malaysia has a population of about 26 million people. In 2005, the country\u2019s human development index ranked 63 out of 177 countries. The country is thus classified as a \u2018high human development\u2019 country. The only other countries in this category in South-East Asia are Brunei Darussalam and Singapore. Over the years, Malaysia has pursued a development model with strong State leadership and rigorous planning. The country has gradually transformed from a commodity-based economy at independence to one that has set a goal to be a developed and knowledge-based economy by 2020. Between 1965 and 1986, Malaysia grew at an average annual rate of 6.6 percent, making it one of the best economic performers among developing countries. From 1987 to 1997, GDP growth accelerated to 8 percent per year. This growth was interrupted by the Asian financial crisis in 1997. The UNDP Human Development Report (2007\u20132008) indicated that per capita income grew by 3.9 percent per year between 1975 and 2005. GDP per capita growth fell to an annual average of 3.3 percent from 1990 to 2005.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35007c6c-ed9f-4120-9231-cebe3aed131f": {"__data__": {"id_": "35007c6c-ed9f-4120-9231-cebe3aed131f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e6af86bab89d2a7ad9819b2f7a0a40c4f33b955e0d3791d2c26d92799f34415"}, "2": {"node_id": "50334553-94d9-4a8b-9a4e-5bc50d473202", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ae81138699596f8dc540773e27b4d57d443e1e6047bb59e131d59183ae38ff4"}}, "hash": "627c4667c5c61f5b0ba6cfd37452d3613ed0c93ac68caf93030770420a81ae8e", "text": "In the past decade, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are said to have experienced declining inequality while most other countries in the Asia-Pacific region have experienced increasing inequality despite rapid economic growth in the region (ESCAP, ADB and UNDP, 2007).

These \u2018daring\u2019 and \u2018contrarian\u2019 attributes have, for many developing countries, made Malaysia an interesting country to exchange knowledge with. Malaysia has thus over the years established itself as leader in South- South Cooperation. To illustrate this, in May 2007, the Malaysian Government and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) announced the establishment in Kuala Lumpur of a Centre for South-South Cooperation in Science, Technology and Innovation (ISTIC). The centre is run by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. Malaysia contributed an initial $10 million, and is due to contribute a further $1.2 million per year to meet the running costs (http://www.globalenvision.org/library/15/1594/). The centre was formally launched in May 2008, its creation following recommendations by the Second South Summit of the G-77 and China, held in Doha in 2005. The Doha Plan of Action included the recommendation that UNESCO should develop and implement a South-South programme in science and technology. The objectives of the centre evolved to include facilitating science and technology application in development approaches; capacity development in science and technology through policy advice; exchange of best practices; 4 The author wishes to thank Ms. Anita Ahmad of the UNDP Country Office in Malaysia for her advice. 5 The Gini coefficient is a measure of statistical dispersion, commonly used as a measure of inequality of income distribution or inequality of wealth distribution. 30 and creating a network of centres of excellence supporting the exchange of students, researchers, scientists and technologists. Description of programmes The Malaysian Technical Cooperation Programme (MTCP) was launched in 1980, signalling the country\u2019s commitment to SSC through the sharing of its development experiences with other countries. The MTCP was founded on the view that the development of a country depends on the quality of its human resources, and therefore emphasizes capacity development. The MTCP is managed by the Economic Planning Unit (EPU), a department in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. A further description of the MTCP illustrates Malaysia\u2019s approach to SSC: \u201cThe MTCP embodies the spirit of smart partnership practices whereby, through the exchange of experiences \u2013 which is a two- way process \u2013 Malaysia can also learn from the collective wisdom of other developing countries. Such bilateral exchanges are able to spawn win-win situations where the combined efforts of partners can change the face of development and build a better quality of life\u201d (MTCP, 2007). The organizational structure of the Malaysian cooperation programme is illustrated in Figure 7. Figure 7: Structure for Malaysia\u2019s cooperation programme Source: EPU, 2007 The regional cooperation programme focuses on regional integration initiatives, mostly in relation to ASEAN. This cooperation is described in the chapters on JICA and ASEAN. Cooperation with international organizations includes Malaysia\u2019s partnership with UN agencies and other multilateral institutions. The MTCP consists mainly of SSC and therefore is the main focus of this document. The Cooperation with Development Partners Programme is the aid-receiving component of the programme. Malaysia continues to learn from more industrialized countries through this part of the programme.

The courses cover a wide range of topics in which Malaysia has acquired skills and strengths, including public administration and management, productivity, civil aviation, ICT, central banking, agriculture management, veterinary services, fisheries, television production, investment promotion, property valuation, tax administration, cooperative management, palm oil plantation management, fire-fighting and English language teaching. On its Web site, the EPU emphasizes Malaysia\u2019s willingness to share its experiences in knowledge and technology development: \u201cMalaysia is ready to share its knowledge and experience in dealing with the many difficulties of the development process, especially in niche areas in which Malaysia has gained the advantage through many years of research and development, such as in oil palm plantation management, agriculture development and management of veterinary services\u201d (EPU, 2007).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca3b5f15-cb8a-4c0e-8968-de8914a8530d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca3b5f15-cb8a-4c0e-8968-de8914a8530d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c279b527cebca709b9b1b95f9eceba40dcdf21a8bcbe274cab7f0f4d6d223a3"}, "2": {"node_id": "6786efde-5263-4e75-962f-5fa81f500d40", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f223e1419b16eacb02ef08acf16763199332ab1f9152e4b4ab53f75a9bfaae1"}}, "hash": "50c7ae2efa6ed9df1e0a8de514ca73e8b338ecb5f8054751b13f37be7d97a5a7", "text": "Other courses also aim to share Malaysia\u2019s experiences and practices in human resources management, crisis management and planning and management of the urban environment.

By the end of 2002, the MTCP had about 8,000 alumni across the world from the short-term specialized training component. The Malaysian missions abroad disseminate information about the short-term courses, and prospective students apply through the diplomatic missions. The MTCP also publishes an alumni newsletter every four months entitled \u2018Sharing Experience on South-South Cooperation\u2019.

North Africa and the Middle East also provide a significant number of trainees, which reflects Malaysia\u2019s cooperation with Islamic countries in those regions. South Asia and Africa show gradually increasing numbers of trainees. The figure shows an increase in the numbers of students per year in general. Long-term academic training By 2002, about 300 participants had graduated from the long-term academic training programme. Students were awarded scholarships to study in Malaysia, and most of the trainees obtained post- graduate degrees from seven local universities. The universities that offered training are the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), University Malaya (UM), the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), University Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) and Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI). The graduates studied in diverse fields including economics, computer science, social science, accounting, business administration, chemistry, biology, biophysics, pharmacy, education and engineering. Prospective students are required to apply directly to the Malaysian universities. Once admitted, an application should then be submitted to the MTCP through the diplomatic mission. Learning exchanges and attachments Learning exchanges and attachments are arranged on request by partner countries. Apart from training, this group of activities constitutes the second-largest component of the MTCP. The objectives of the learning exchanges and study tours are to enhance the capacity of staff and practitioners through exposure to the Malaysian working environment. The exchanges and attachments entail observation of methods, procedures and techniques for work implementation in related fields; visits to sites and projects; formal training, case studies; and involvement in actual work situations. The learning exchanges are usually for a period of one to two weeks, and attachments may be for a longer period. Between 1981 and 2002, Malaysia received a total of 1,398 of such participants. The areas covered included poverty eradication, development planning, privatization, public administration, investment promotion and project planning (MTCP, 2007). Countries that are interested in learning more about exchanges or study tours should contact the Economic Planning Unit directly. Third-country technical cooperation As with other third-country programmes, Malaysia has collaborated with the United Nations, JICA and the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation (CFTC). In this programme, international organizations utilize the skills of Malaysian experts to train participants from other developing countries. A number of organizations in Malaysia have participated in this programme, including the National Institute of Public Administration (INTAN), the Institute of Diplomacy and Foreign Relations (IDFR), the Japan-Malaysia Training Institute (JMTI) and the Centre for Instructor Advanced Skills Training (CIAST). The areas of training include computer networking technology, welding, electrical and electronic system servicing, diplomacy, small-scale industries development, health and the environment. Advisory services Advisory services by Malaysian experts and other assistance such as funding for socio-economic projects \u2013 mostly with limited supplies and equipment on a selective basis \u2013 make up the other programmes offered by Malaysia under the MTCP. The Malaysian cooperation programme is delivered via partnerships that draw upon the increased participation of the private sector as well as specialized institutions.

Conclusion According to the MTCP, the cooperation programme in Malaysia is \u201cconstantly reviewed with the addition of new courses, especially in information communications technology, in an effort to bridge the widening digital divide between countries. Programmes are expanded and new activities designed to meet the needs and priorities of participating countries while continuing the emphasis on human resource development\u201d (EPU, 2007). The Malaysian cooperation programme emphasizes the spirit of reciprocity. For example, the MTCP indicated that \u201ca reciprocation of technical expertise by participating countries will also be promoted, especially in areas that are better-developed in partner countries. The modes of cooperation will also be tailored to encourage more third-party cooperation as well as greater involvement of the private sector. Closer cooperation will also be encouraged between the MTCP and the private sector in order to provide training in areas where the private sector has the expertise.\u201d Malaysia has pursued an independent course in development that has made it a leader in SSC for those countries interested in alternative development models. In the area of SSC, the country pushes for a distinct demarcation between official development assistance and SSC. This was the stance that the country took at the UN High-Level Committee on South-South Cooperation in 2007. The EPU funds the MTCP, and in that regard, prospective partners and trainees should contact the EPU or the MTCP directly. 34 How to contact the Malaysia Technical Cooperation Programme MTCP, External Assistance Section, Level 2, Blok B5, EPU, Prime Minister\u2019s Dept. 62502, Putrajaya, Malaysia.

It is one of the few city-states in the world and the smallest country in South- East Asia. By ethnicity the population is approximately 75.2 percent Chinese, 13.6 percent Malay, 8.8 percent Indian and 2.4 percent of other descent. Singapore has four official languages: English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. English is widely spoken and understood. Singapore became an independent nation on 9 August 1965. At that time the GDP per capita was only US$520, unemployment was high, and public services including education and infrastructure were poorly developed. The Government of Singapore overcame all odds to develop the new State from a poor country with no natural resources to its present affluence and status. Key to this success was strong support and assistance from France, Germany, Japan and other donor agencies in the area of human resource capacity-building. The GDP per capita for 2006 was estimated at US$30,900. According to the 2005 UN Human Development Report, Singapore ranked 25th on the Human Development Index, and in 2006 was rated as the \u201cmost business-friendly economy in the world\u201d by the World Bank. Singapore has accumulated vast experience in various fields and has transformed from a developing country to a highly developed nation. Singapore believes that capacity-building is vital for economic and social progress, and thus initiated Technical Cooperation for Human Resource Development, through which it hopes to share its development experiences and expertise with developing countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ecb6344b-17a1-40f9-8f0f-903707231381": {"__data__": {"id_": "ecb6344b-17a1-40f9-8f0f-903707231381", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0de5fd382a110116283ca67adaa2abdc7c79cd7d8c2045fa87b3e16f0a156ce2"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b65162b-370f-47b5-96e8-425bb851fd2b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1757bcf0a683cd5b76ecf733a8b2f7eb96b28544ba230b3a13a45b1449993e94"}}, "hash": "39a19c2dc7019be5a971508b5a863aec85985e18b0e32e007b90ebadc01f4b9a", "text": "Structure of Singapore\u2019s technical cooperation Institutional arrangements In 1992 the Government of Singapore created the Technical Cooperation Directorate within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (TCD-MFA) in order to consolidate various technical assistance programmes under one framework.

The TCD-MFA comprises two branches: the Programme Policy Branch and the Programme Operations Branch. The TCD-MFA is involved not only in programme policy-making but also serves as an agent for programme implementation. The activities conducted by the TCD-MFA focus on enhancing diplomatic relations with the beneficiary developing countries.

This is one of the characteristics of Singapore\u2019s ODA. Currently, 60 institutions are listed as implementing agencies for the SCP (figure for 2007/2008). These institutions, once entrusted with running SCP courses, are given the autonomy to conduct professional training courses including selection of course topics, material, methodologies and lecturers. Budget and programme size When the SCP was set up in 1992, the annual budget was just US$17 million. 7 Although the Government of Singapore has not released the breakdown of the annual SCP budget in recent years, we can infer that a greater budget has been set aside for the programme. For example, of 400 million Singapore dollars (SG$) allocated to the MFA in 2007, SG$119 million was apportioned for the SCP, contributions to regional and international forums and other outreach activities. 8 While only 41 training courses were conducted under the SCP in 1993, the number of courses has grown to more than 300 in recent years. The number of partner countries and organizations is also expected to increase. The Singapore Cooperation Programme As mentioned above, the SCP was launched in 1992 as the main technical cooperation arm of the Government of Singapore. The main purpose of the SCP is to carry out an international training programme that is implemented in various forms and through various partnerships. Other SCP activities include site visits and the Singapore Scholarship for ASEAN Countries. International Training Programme The International Training Programme is the largest scheme under the SCP. Training courses are implemented bilaterally or in partnership with other donor/aid agencies or regional initiatives. In this section, the SCP training programme is explained under three categories: (i) bilateral training programmes, (ii) joint training programmes (third-country training programmes [TCTP]) and (iii) the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI). (i) Bilateral training programmes The bilateral training programmes are organized through an independent initiative by the Government of Singapore and are implemented by the TCD-MFA. Such programmes include the Small Island Developing States Technical Cooperation Programme (SIDSTEC). SIDSTEC is an initiative of the Government of Singapore that was announced and launched at the UN General Assembly\u2019s 22nd Special Session in 1999. The programme demonstrates Singapore\u2019s commitment to sustain the development of small island developing states (SIDS). Initially started as a five-year programme in 1999, Singapore\u2019s Minister for the Environment and Water Resources subsequently announced the indefinite extension of SIDSTEC II at the International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States held in January 2005 at Port Louis, Mauritius. Under SIDSTEC II a number of technical cooperation areas are offered, as shown in Table 6. Eligible small island developing states can benefit from Singapore\u2019s own experiences, and under the SIDSTEC framework, more than 150 training courses have been implemented for 700 participants from 41 SIDS to date.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "223d6c11-c9e8-4f3f-a4d2-ca5af583e831": {"__data__": {"id_": "223d6c11-c9e8-4f3f-a4d2-ca5af583e831", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b2f81d4c230e1d4dbb5a48a11e2de9795bbe98ba1fb320da21c9ca741906ef5"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e6a89a0-e94f-441a-9bd2-d8d102009a09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b440c34b6701a35be57fba594e5c3b9db0a1c66f134fb90e8cd11545e85acb2"}}, "hash": "177491cbccefe52bb0dac906035e1dec10a8dc69c3798b1d13241a151c8c8d98", "text": "7 Statement by Permanent Representative, HE Kishopre Mahbubani at the 11th Session of the UN High-Level Committee on South- South Cooperation, 1999. 8 Singapore Budget 2007, http://www.mof.gov.sg/budget_2007/expenditure_overview/mfa.html. 38 Table 6: Technical cooperation areas covered under SIDSTEC II \ufffd Tourism management and development \ufffd Developing and managing a garden city \ufffd Environmental protection and health management \ufffd Sustainable development and environmental management \ufffd Water and wastewater management \ufffd Humanitarian emergencies and disaster", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0272d656-5449-44c9-b45e-f1b04d5e7cb0": {"__data__": {"id_": "0272d656-5449-44c9-b45e-f1b04d5e7cb0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03ae7c4e9703c7da39a5d9f81ab92cc576a342ff3668a9d657db904d32658c06"}, "3": {"node_id": "d57efff6-c22f-4f12-9dab-2209f7ae6f5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75cc2b5baa0a97146b399b9be7d995ef81245865d26933ed056c638eb186aa8d"}}, "hash": "132b5c131821d8cbf85df749fdd1e0a2a7834d948e0ca1656a1c7789db618024", "text": "management \ufffd Information technology management \ufffd Internet security and cyber laws \ufffd e-government \ufffd Forensic medicine \ufffd Aeronautical, maritime and urban search and rescue courses. (ii) Joint training programme (Third-Country Training Programmes [TCTP]) The joint training programme comprises courses for less-developed countries, implemented by Singapore and other bilateral/multilateral aid agencies under various partnership agreements. In this sense, the programme can be categorized as Triangular Cooperation. The programme accounts for the largest part of the entire SCP training programme. As of 2006, Singapore had partnership agreements with 13 bilateral donor agencies and 17 international organizations (see tables 7 and 8). 9 By March 2007, 200 joint training courses had been organized with these partners. Cumulatively, 48,000 participants from 166 countries received training in these courses.

The IAI is a policy framework that encompasses a variety of human resource development activities and aims to assist the integration of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam (CLMV) into ASEAN. In 2001, Singapore set up four IAI training centres in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam. Initially, Singapore committed SG$59.54 million for a five-year IAI programme for CLMV. Subsequently, at the 10 th ASEAN Summit, held in Lao PDR in 2004, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that Singapore would extend its commitment to IAI for a further three years until 2008 with an injection of SG$28.89 million. This amount would be used primarily for the establishment of IAI training centres, each equipped with computer rooms (15\u201320 terminals), lecture rooms (2\u20133 rooms) and an overall coordinator in-charge. 12 Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced during the 13 th ASEAN Summit in November 2007 that Singapore had pledged an additional SG$30 million for technical assistance programmes for the three-year period from 2009 to 2011. In each IAI training centre, courses based on priority needs identified by each CLMV country are organized by Singaporean training institutions. Since 2001, more than 330 courses for 6,233 government officials have been conducted in various fields. Courses include English language, trade and economic development, tourism, productivity, ICT and curriculum planning. Singapore has also implemented training courses in note-taking, negotiation and writing skills for diplomats. Focus areas of the SCP International Training Programme Under the SCP, the TCD-MFA annually conducts more than 300 international training courses. Based on the officially published list of SCP training courses (the SCP Calendar), training areas covered by the SCP from 2005 to 2007 were analysed 13 (see Figure 11). According to the analysis, the transportation sector constituted the largest area of training at 46 percent of the total. In this area, civil aviation was one of the major courses offered by Singapore. Curricula included aircraft accidents, safety management and fire management. Port management courses are also conducted regularly. As a small island state, Singapore considers that such areas are crucial for safeguarding national security, and has accumulated advanced experience and knowledge to be shared with other countries. Singapore has leading institutions to offer training courses in these areas. 12 Number of rooms and staff arrangement varies depending on the requirement of the respective IAI training centres. 13 Note: the courses listed in the SCP Calendar do not constitute a complete list of SCP training programmes. Some Joint Training Programmes are not listed in the calendar due to the gap between agreement and printing timing. 42 Figure 11: Ratio of training areas (all SCP international training programmes) 4% 4% 4% 4% 6% 13% 49% 7% 9% Transportation Governance Private sector development ICT Urban development Health Education Economic policy Environment In contrast to the overall focus areas of the SCP, priority areas for courses under the programme differ by partner country and international organization, reflecting each partners\u2019 cooperation policy and mandate. For example, under the JSPP21 Programme (a joint training programme with the Government of Japan), governance (at 27 percent), private-sector development (18 percent) and information technology (14 percent) were the three main areas implemented in 2006. Eligible countries for SCP international training programmes Currently, 166 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean participate in various programmes under the SCP. The groups of eligible countries are different for each programme, depending on their overall goals and strategies. The IAI programme, for example, is targeted towards the new members of ASEAN (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam), while 37 small island developing states (many from the Pacific and Caribbean) are eligible for SIDSTEC programmes. As for the joint training programmes implemented in partnership with various technical cooperation agencies, target countries depend on the nature and policy, and the subscriber, of the partner institutions (for example, Commonwealth countries are targeted under the Singapore Commonwealth of Learning as part of the TCTP).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "998cd7dc-7668-47d6-b3a1-1f5d893b0e5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "998cd7dc-7668-47d6-b3a1-1f5d893b0e5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c171cfe78a38e9cad7cba37ac4e96ebdc3923253f5ad0cf38f853badd6380e1c"}, "2": {"node_id": "8adeb0ca-022f-4029-bc85-28592984fea8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a8ddf1a568d2845e7fcfdba4dbe68a88f3624b2eb264197121afacf99cb26d2"}}, "hash": "c2dbc318c9722e675b2672852b4a5da982247cb0536789097ed77bd6b93000eb", "text": "Other SCP activities (site visits and the Singapore Scholarship for ASEAN Countries) The purpose of site visits are to give SCP participants the opportunity to visit Singapore to gain firsthand experience of the multiracial, multicultural and multilingual aspects of the country.

Only a few decades ago, Korea moved from being a major recipient of international aid to being an emerging donor country. The total volume of Korea\u2019s ODA has rapidly increased in recent years. The Korean Government is committed to expanding our ODA still further to a level of 0.25 percent of GNI by 2015.\u201d Hyun, C, Deputy Permanent Representative, High Level Committee for the Review of South-South Cooperation, 29 May 2007 The Republic of Korea had an estimated population of 48.3 million people in 2006. With a human development index of 921, it ranked 26th out of 177 countries in 2005 and was recognized as a \u2018high human development\u2019 country. From 1975 to 2005, the country\u2019s economy grew at an average annual rate of 6 percent and from 1990 to 2005 at a rate of 4.5 percent. The Republic of Korea has had one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies since the 1960s, and by 2006 its economy was ranked the 12th-largest in the world (Korea National Statistical Office, 2007).

Therefore, both the bilateral and multilateral ODA increased. The EDCF loan component has remained quite constant over the years. The figure shows that total ODA increased more than threefold between 2000 and 2007.

In 2006, the main partners under this programme were Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam. In the health sector, KOICA aims to respond to the MDGs relating to reduction of infant mortality, promotion of maternal health and reduction of HIV and other diseases. This is done by improving health infrastructure and medical facilities. The support also provides for the training of medical staff and the dispatch of workers from the Republic of Korea to developing countries. In 2006, the main beneficiaries were Cambodia, Iraq, Jordan, Peru and Tanzania. In order for developing countries to build more accountable and transparent institutions, KOICA supports governance programmes that include accountability, legal and judiciary strengthening, peaceful conflict-resolution and protection of human rights and property rights. The rural development component of KOICA ODA focuses on a broad range of infrastructure including roads, water supplies, primary schools, community centres, agricultural infrastructure and the sharing of technology for mechanized farming. Experts from the Republic of Korea are sent to provide practical training, policy advice, and to set up research centres and train researchers. In supporting industry and energy, the Republic of Korea seconds experts and provides project aid and energy transportation infrastructure. ICT is another component of KOICA ODA. In this area, the Republic of Korea supports the expansion of ICT education, infrastructure and use of the Internet, and the compilation of ICT plans. The biggest partners include Bangladesh, Iraq, Lao PDR, Morocco and Viet Nam. Environment and gender are major considerations under the MDGs. The Republic of Korea assists developing countries in controlling pollution and strengthening environmental protection, with major partners including Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Iraq and Viet Nam. According to KOICA, before the 2004 tsunami, the disaster relief and reconstruction component of ODA was conducted on an ad hoc basis. Since then KOICA has consolidated this programme to provide emergency relief, recovery and reconstruction assistance, and refugee relief. KOICA has also ensured that the programme can respond quickly to provide relief in emergency situations. These then are the current programmes implemented under KOICA in addition to the loan and multilateral components of ODA. Conclusion According to the Asian Productivity Organization (2001), \u201cIn the 1960s Korea had almost no science and technology base to support industrial and economic policy except for a \u2018can do\u2019 or \u2018hard-working\u2019 spirit. Just forty years on, the country is one of the leaders in science and technology. It is now a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and is one of the pivotal countries for SSC. The Republic of Korea attributes its success to investment in its people and the encouragement of research and development through favourable policies and institutions. Its development lessons are fresh and relevant to other developing countries.\u201d The Republic of Korea is due to join the DAC in 2010 and is a signatory to the Paris Declaration, and therefore will have to conform to DAC rules. The country sees its recent and rapid transformation from poverty to becoming an OECD member as both an important experience to share with developing countries and as a comparative advantage as it becomes a bigger donor. In April 2008, Japan and the Republic of Korea convened a meeting to expand dialogue with \u2018emerging donors\u2019 and partner countries on development cooperation and SSC. The workshop, which 51 took place in Bangkok, concluded that SSC is complementary to other cooperation. Furthermore, the objectives of enhancing ownership and the effectiveness of development cooperation are shared across the board (through traditional ODA and SSC). The partnership with Japan \u2013 a DAC member that has always supported SSC \u2013 means that the Republic of Korea will remain a pivotal country for SSC.

With increasing challenges and demands, countries in the South have to manage resources and expertise so that win-win situations are within reach. Thailand believes that South-South Cooperation as well as Triangular Cooperation can serve as important platforms for reaching those goals and targets, especially the MDGs.\u201d HE Ambassador Don Pramudwinai, UN High-Level Committee on South-South Cooperation, 2007 Overview of Thailand\u2019s external assistance In 2005, the Kingdom of Thailand was ranked 78th out of 177 countries on the human development index, and was categorized as a \u2018medium human development\u2019 country in the same category (but above) countries such as China, the Philippines, Tunisia and Turkey. In the region, only Singapore, the Republic of Korea, Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia were ranked as \u2018high human development\u2019 countries. According to the UNDP \u2018Human Development Report (2007\u20132008)\u2019, GDP per capita for Thailand grew by an annual average of 4.9 percent between 1975 and 2005. For the period 1990 to 2005, GDP per capita grew by only 2.7 percent. The figures reflect the interruption in progress caused by the Asian financial crisis of 1997. From 1986 to 1991, Thailand had one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies, with an annual GDP growth average of 10.7 percent, but this fell to 5.5 percent between 1991 and 1996. In 1997, GDP growth was negative at minus 4 percent. Since then, the country has gradually recovered from the crisis. Until about a decade ago, Thailand\u2019s focus on development cooperation related mostly to what the country received from donors. The Department of Technical and Economic Cooperation (DTEC), created in 1950 under the Office of the Prime Minister, had been the main channel for receiving donor funds and support. However, even as far back as 1955, Thailand had started to assist other countries as well. During this period, financial support was provided by international agencies. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) used Thailand\u2019s expertise in public health by providing financial support for training courses led by Thais. In the 1990s Thailand stepped up assistance to other countries from its own financial and human resources. While Thailand\u2019s aid strategy has prioritized neighbouring countries (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam), within the last decade cooperation has been extended to countries in South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean as well as to transition economies in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In 2003, Thailand formally acknowledged its status as an \u201cemerging donor\u201d. The change from recipient country to emerging donor saw the creation of the Thailand Technical Cooperation Agency (TICA) in 2004, under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as a replacement for DTEC. 53 Current areas of cooperation According to the UN Country Team in Thailand and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (2005), \u201cThai development cooperation programmes are based on common principles and goals\u201d. These principles include SSC and partnerships for development. Cooperation is also based on the principle of achieving mutual benefits and prosperity for Thailand and other developing countries. According to TICA, there are two main types of assistance under the Thailand cooperation programme. The first is project cooperation, which is broken down into several components including dispatching Thai experts to other countries, providing technical equipment, conducting short-term training courses and sending young Thais to work in neighbouring countries as \u2018Friends from Thailand\u2019. The UN Country Team and TICA indicate that 90 percent of Thai ODA is in support of infrastructure projects in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and the Maldives, including roads, bridges, dams and power stations. These are funded from the concessional lending component of the cooperation programme. The other 10 percent of ODA supports training in the areas of agriculture, banking, economics, education, finance, public health, transport and science and technology. The other type of assistance is trilateral cooperation with international development agencies such as JICA and UN agencies including UNIDO, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UNICEF.

Most of this was directed towards Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam (CLMV countries). In 2005, in addition to the 70 percent of aid in concessional loans, the total assistance by Thailand to her neighbours was 83 percent of ODA. Other countries have also benefited from Thailand\u2019s bilateral assistance in agriculture, health and education. Description of bilateral cooperation programmes The main programmes of Thailand\u2019s external assistance are shown in Figure 16. A more detailed explanation of what each consists of is provided in the following sections. Figure 16: Thailand\u2019s aid schemes Training courses Experts & equipment Friends from Thailand Technical Cooperation Programme Bilateral Multilateral Projects Concessional 55 Concessional loans The Government of Thailand and UNDP (2005) indicated that research by the UN Millennium Development Project and ADB had concluded that investments in infrastructure \u2013 roads, energy and ICT \u2013 could play an important role in attainment of the MDGs. It is with these findings in mind that Thailand supports infrastructure investments in neighbouring countries. Initially these investments were provided through the Neighbouring Countries Economic Development Cooperation Fund, established in 1999. In 2005, the Neighbouring Countries Economic Development Cooperation Agency (NEDA) was established and replaced the fund. Thai loans are coordinated with ADB. Experts and equipment Thailand recognizes one component of its development cooperation as SSC. The Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries Programme (TCDC), also known as the South-South Cooperation Programme, is ongoing. The projects under the TCDC include provisions for Thai expertise and equipment, in which Thailand identifies and designs projects with partner countries to meet these countries\u2019 specific requirements. Some of the activities that fall under this programme include development and training projects, secondment of Thai experts to other countries, and the provision of equipment. Under this programme, Thailand shares development knowledge through learning exchanges. According to TICA, study tours, seminars and training are the primary activities of the programme, but other activities such as research projects are also encouraged. In the global sense, many other activities undertaken by Thailand would be included under the SSC umbrella. In addition to programmes already identified under the TCDC and concessional funding for LDCs, Thailand has also reduced tariffs for its least-developed neighbours. This apparently has encouraged the LDC recipients to export to Thailand. For example, LDC exports to Thailand constituted 3.1 percent of its imports in 2003. According to UNDP and the Government of Thailand, no other country had such a high percentage of LDC imports among developed and developing countries. China had the second highest level of exports from LDCs at 1.5 percent. Through its development experience, Thailand now shares its knowledge with other countries. The Thai \u2018sufficiency economy\u2019 philosophy has also raised interest as an alternative approach to sustainable development. In rural development, Thailand adopted the One-Tambon-One-Product (OTOP) model, which is generally accepted as a successful development strategy. A number of countries are now interested in having Thai experts help them design rural development programmes. The recently introduced Friends from Thailand Programme (FFT) deploys young Thais aged 21 to 35 to work as volunteers in neighbouring countries. So far, volunteers have been deployed to Cambodia and Lao PDR. The Thai Government is also in discussion with Bhutanese authorities, who have requested Thai volunteers in several areas of development. Training The Thai International Postgraduate Programme was conceptualized in 1999 and commenced in 2000. The Government of Thailand funds this programme in full, offering a range of postgraduate degree courses in Thailand. Third-Country Training Programme The Third-Country Training Programme consists of Triangular Cooperation under which trainees from developing countries are funded by Thailand\u2019s development partners and are trained in Thailand. The programme provides participants from other developing countries with firsthand experience of Thai development activities. The Trilateral and Regional Cooperation Programme is funded by the Thai Government and its partners and emphasizes human resources development, particularly through group training courses, study programmes and subregional cooperation programmes. 56 Institutional structure of Thailand\u2019s external assistance There are several institutions that play a role in providing Thailand\u2019s external assistance.

It is aware that, as a new donor, Thailand has to develop rules and regulations, as well as procedures and strategies, for development cooperation. TICA recently completed a draft strategy document for technical cooperation. More will be said later about this draft. A priority for strengthening the role of Thailand as a donor is data collection. TICA aspires to collect data on all assistance provided through government programmes and institutions including universities and other academic institutions. TICA is also interested in partnerships with the private sector to support SSC. Some of the activities envisaged would include secondment of staff from other countries to the Thai private sector and vice versa. Some private sector organizations have expressed a willingness to implement a corporate social responsibility programme in support of SSC. Projects, experts & equipment Technical cooperation among developing countries Friends from Thailand Training Ministry of Commerce Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ministry of Finance Thailand International Cooperation Agency Neighbouring Countries Economic Development Cooperation Agency Import-Export Bank of Thailand Concessional loans 57 Others Local governments, particularly those close to neighbouring countries are involved in cooperation projects. Other government departments and academic institutions are also involved in SSC. For example, at a meeting attended by the UNDP and TICA on 5 September 2008 in Chiang Mai, participants from higher education institutions provided information on their development cooperation activities implemented with neighbouring countries, which were mostly in the form of studies, fellowships and student and lecturer exchanges. Many higher education institutions have facilitated international and regional workshops in their respective areas of specialization, including primary health care, child health care, HIV, agriculture, education, the environment (global warming), animal husbandry, engineering, food safety and food security. Some universities have initiated joint research programmes through signed MOUs with counterpart universities in neighbouring countries. The role of the UNDP Country Office The UNDP Country Office in Thailand is playing a critical role in the development of South-South and other cooperation. The office funded the Thailand International Partnership for Development Programme (TIPD) from 2004 to 2007. Under this programme, with the active participation of the Country Office, Thailand aimed to strengthen its ODA coordination. The project has facilitated Thailand\u2019s outreach to development partners to exchange knowledge. For example, Thailand has linked up with African countries to share experiences in small to medium enterprise development and HIV prevention. As an emerging donor, Thailand, with UNDP facilitation, has reached out to other middle-income countries to share experiences in development cooperation. The UNDP office facilitated Thailand\u2019s participation in a meeting of emerging donors in Tunisia in 2006, at which other middle-income countries such as the Republic of Korea, South Africa and Turkey were also present. In 2007, Thai officials participated in an emerging-donors initiative in which most of the emerging donors from Eastern Europe, including Russia were present. The purposes of these meetings were to strengthen ties among emerging donors and to share lessons in strengthening institutions to deliver ODA. The UNDP Country Office has also supported TICA\u2019s consultative processes for SSC by co- organizing meetings with the private sector, academic institutions and other national stakeholders. The UNDP Country Office and the Country Team have also spearheaded the mainstreaming of SSC in documents such as the \u2018United Nations Partnership Framework\u2019 (UNPAF 2007\u20132011), the \u2018Country Programme\u2019 and the \u2018Country Programme Action Plan\u2019. 58 The way forward: Thailand\u2019s draft strategic framework for official development assistance. Thailand has developed a draft strategic framework for development assistance covering the five years from 2007 to 2011. The framework indicates how Thailand intends to proceed with its ODA and SSC. The strategy emphasizes the promotion of good practices in technical cooperation, human resource and capacity development, the use of knowledge management, and the promotion of development cooperation as a tool for stimulating growth and sustainable development in the region and subregion. In return for cooperation with other countries, Thailand hopes for good relationships and strengthened ties, reciprocal support for Thai trade and investment, and people-to-people exchanges. The strategy consists of seven components which are summarized in the following sections. One of the components of the strategy is to make Thailand a centre for human resource development. The country has strengths in tropical medicine, public health and agriculture and could thus attract many students from across Asia. In terms of training, Thailand would offer specialist training and student fellowships. Areas of consideration include malaria and HIV prevention and management. TICA would also offer its identified experts (2,300 so far) to development cooperation partners. If the draft strategy were adopted, Thailand would", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6392de0b-72cb-4b90-96d1-4bc875a4e2ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "6392de0b-72cb-4b90-96d1-4bc875a4e2ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e491a43d8345fba39fc4b6d999592011b0513f68cca5f9d65f713883d7a0f4b"}, "3": {"node_id": "6f0be2fc-e2de-4a6d-9409-225311e54b3a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f7160410190d4383848da71b2abb9e8caeefcc1f9e4d640fcd37f5a4716de4e"}}, "hash": "9ed3986a0e72b93cf0a413c127063a7388c11348a977eebc6955e81e9a2f0fe4", "text": "support the deployment of Thai experts, volunteers and institutions based on funding provided by TICA and other partners. The country would also scale up its Friends from Thailand volunteer programme to serve more countries. Thailand aims to promote its \u2018sufficiency economy\u2019 theory among countries that are interested in this as an optional approach for sustainable development. TICA would also change Thailand\u2019s technical assistance from a passive programme based on requests and demand to one that emphasizes negotiations and identifying areas of mutual need. Another part of the strategy is to promote regional and subregional cooperation with Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam. Outside of the priority neighbours, Thailand would forge relationships with other middle-income countries for mutual learning. Although further streamlined to a few strategic countries, Thailand would continue to work with some of the African countries, in particular where it has diplomatic representation. Lastly, the government would promote public, private sector and civil society partnerships to support development cooperation. Conclusion Thailand perceives its SSC to be a narrow band of activities based around short-term training, fellowships and secondment of staff. However, in a global sense, Thailand\u2019s SSC spans a wider range of activities including customs tariff relief, concessional lending and training. Compared to other middle-income countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, Thailand is more willing to progress towards being a mainstream donor. In this regard, it is forging collaborative relationships with the new Eastern European donors. Its demarcation of SSC and ODA could be an interesting area of observation as the country balances belonging to the South-South grouping and at the same inches towards traditional donor practices. Its experience could help harmonize practices in the two respective groups.

Historically, Japan began extending technical assistance to other developing countries in 1954, while it was still receiving aid. Being a provider and a recipient at the same time, Japan was implementing SSC before the concept was widely recognized. Such an experience is unique among today\u2019s OECD DAC member countries. Believing in the importance and effectiveness of SSC in human capacity development, Japan has repeated its active support for SSC both at the practice and policy levels (JICA, 2005a). 17 JICA started its SSC programme as early as 1975 by supporting the TCTP implemented by developing countries. An arrangement like the TCTP is now often called Triangular Cooperation, involving three parties \u2013 service providers and recipients in the South, and donors in the North. The first TCTP supported by JICA was in Thailand, with trainees coming from Lao PDR. Since then, JICA has constantly expanded its SSC programmes and diversified the cooperation modalities (see Box 3). Today, JICA\u2019s TCTP has grown in terms of the number of courses, trainees and partner countries. In 2007, 138 training courses were carried out by 33 partner countries for a total of 3,240 trainees. Among these courses, 42 (approximately 30 percent) were conducted in South-East Asia (see Figure 18). 16 The author was, from 2004 to 2007, a regional project formulation advisor and coordinator at the JICA-ASEAN Regional Cooperation Meeting (JARCOM) Secretariat in the JICA Regional Support Office for Asia.

Although Malaysia does not have such an agreement, it implements the TCTP with JICA, with equal cost sharing. Box 3: Modalities of Japan\u2019s support to South-South-Cooperation Third Country Training Programme (TCTP) This programme was introduced in 1975. Since then, JICA has supported relatively advanced developing countries in conducting training courses for other developing countries. At an earlier stage, JICA focused its support mainly on institutions that had received assistance from Japan in the past. Thus, Japanese knowledge and expertise were further extended to other developing countries. Third-Country Expert Programme (TCE) Started in 1995, the TCE helps developing countries to send their national experts to other developing countries. In 2007, 65 \u2018third-country experts\u2019 were sent to other developing countries. The majority of TCEs are from Central and South America. Partnership Programme for South-South Cooperation This is a comprehensive framework agreed by the governments of Japan and developing countries to jointly support other developing countries. Within this framework and annual consultation, JICA and its counterpart organizations in partner countries implement the TCTP, TCE and other technical cooperation projects. So far, Japan has signed partnership programmes with 12 countries including four 18 in South-East Asia. Under this partnership agreement, each partner country not only offers human and institutional resources, but also shares the costs of the TCTP with JICA (at varying degrees from 15 percent to 50 percent). Host Countries Courses Participants Numbers TCTP implementation status 62 Objectives of JICA\u2019s South-South Cooperation in the early stages In 2003, JICA set up an internal South-South Cooperation Task Force and analysed previous SSC projects, classifying them into five types of SSC based on their functions. According to the \u2018Thematic Guidelines on South-South Cooperation\u2019 (JICA, 2005) prepared by the Task Force, JICA\u2019s SSC projects fall into at least one of the following categories: 1. effective use of the resources of developing countries; 2. dissemination of the outcomes of Japan\u2019s technical cooperation; 3. collaboration between Japan and other donors; 4. support for TCDC; 5. support for developing countries to become donors (support for \u2018donorization\u2019). Of these, \u201cdissemination of the outcomes of Japan\u2019s technical cooperation\u201d used to be considered one of the most important criterion, often a condition, when JICA designed and considered approval of SSC projects. This meant that a cooperating country should have received technical assistance from Japan in the past. By requiring this condition, JICA tried to streamline its SSC, which is partly considered as an expansion phase of its previous technical cooperation. In addition, \u201csupport for developing countries to become donors\u201d has also been considered important in building the capacity of middle-income countries as they prepare to become full-capacity donors. Emphasis on these categories reflected JICA\u2019s view on SSC, which tends to focus more on the needs of service suppliers than of recipients. Third-party evaluation of JICA\u2019s South-South Cooperation programme Through its relatively long history of supporting SSC, JICA has accumulated significant experiences and lessons. To document such lessons and to improve the programme, JICA has conducted evaluations of its SSC programme several times in the past. The most recent was in 2005, with a third-party evaluation team. The study covered JICA\u2019s SSC globally and included field surveys in selected countries in South-East Asia, Latin America and Africa. A questionnaire survey was conducted for 80 JICA country offices and 80 government counterpart agencies, with valid responses of 53 percent and 42 percent respectively. Table 13 shows an extract from the questionnaire results, which indicate the level of interest and involvement in SSC activities among various stakeholders. Here, stakeholders are divided into two categories (government technical cooperation agencies and JICA country offices), with one of each in the two main groups of suppliers (cooperating countries) and recipients (beneficiary countries).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8701fa2-7a89-4228-9b94-f568baadcdce": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8701fa2-7a89-4228-9b94-f568baadcdce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "890650b118558276ec1c349cc9658ae759d0912531f82375fbede9c34064cfea"}, "2": {"node_id": "30776fe6-58b8-4b11-b31a-29223cf13253", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5d41bd4530d0accecafc5464cce410b8ad7542ed653c1b561d150f09bd069f8"}}, "hash": "dbe1543099b1bd1135cc5a4b2cff4fc634dbd38a909f70c2c785db1168a7794c", "text": "63 Table 13: Summary of the questionnaire survey Existence of SSC policy/ strategy at country level Involved in TCTP planning / formulation stages Involved in TCTP implementing stage Perception of SSC projects (remarks by respondents in Asian countries) SSC cooperating countries Government technical cooperation agencies 83% 83% 83% Government SSC policy/strategy is part of diplomatic means.

Low expectation for impacts of SSC. Source: Prepared by the author, based on JICA 2006. The results show sharp differences in the level of interest in SSC. While 83 percent and 100 percent of government agencies and JICA offices in cooperating countries were involved in TCTP formulation and implementation respectively, less than 8 percent of JICA offices in beneficiary countries answered positively (none from recipient governments). From the remarks by the respondents, one can say that TCTPs were mostly considered to be projects of the cooperating countries, while both the governments and JICA officials of beneficiary countries do not perceive TCTPs as an effective means to address development issues. The survey confirmed the tendency toward a supply-driven approach and revealed the perceptions of different actors in SSC. It is worth noting that the ultimate beneficiaries of SSC had low expectations regarding its impact. However, this is not a new issue, and being aware of it, JICA has sought ways to introduce a more demand-driven approach. This eventually led to the establishment of a Triangular Cooperation arrangement though the JICA-ASEAN Regional Cooperation Meeting (JARCOM), which is discussed in detail below. 64 Experiences of JARCOM in South-East Asia South-East Asian context South-East Asia is a dynamic region where culturally diverse countries at varying stages of socio- economic development are seeking to form one community under ASEAN 19 and where some middle- income countries are in transition from being recipients of aid to being donors. This is the region where JICA first started its TCTP and where 30 percent to 40 percent of its TCTP courses are still being implemented. Improving TCTP in South-East Asia will have a significant impact on improving the entire programme. Since JICA\u2019s SSC used to focus on \u2018re-disseminating\u2019 the results of Japan\u2019s previous assistance, and the capacity building of service-providing countries, many TCTPs were designed by JICA and the providers without the active involvement of beneficiary countries. As a result, it was often reported that recipient countries were not necessarily satisfied with the training courses they were offered. They claimed that the courses did not meet their priorities and that not enough attention was paid to sometimes sensitive relationships with neighbouring countries (historically and socio-culturally). Against such a background, JICA has hosted a series of separate meetings since 1999 \u2013 one for TCTP implementing countries and the other for beneficiary countries 20 \u2013 in order to discuss the TCTP- related issues from different perspectives. These meetings were the precursors of JARCOM. Characteristics of JARCOM JARCOM was first convened in 2002 by merging the above-mentioned two meetings. Its original objective was to discuss how to improve the TCTPs supported by JICA, with the participation of both implementing and beneficiary countries. Since then, annual meetings have been held among the delegations of government officials and JICA country offices in ASEAN member countries. 21 JARCOM, however, is not just the name of the meeting: It is a participatory process of Triangular Cooperation and capacity building for all SSC participants. Unlike the previous processes of SSC, JARCOM assists in the identification of priority needs by recipient countries and offers a platform for face-to-face negotiation between providers and recipients. JICA, as a donor, acts as a facilitator, offering coordination services and, when necessary, technical and financial support for project formulation. The characteristics of the JARCOM process are summarized in the following: 1. Participatory and transparent process Originally, JARCOM tried to reverse the supply-driven approach to a more demand-driven one, and encouraged potential beneficiary countries to identify their priority needs and name cooperating countries they wished to support. At a later stage, it began encouraging cooperating countries to share their aid policies and their priority fields of cooperation. Some countries began offering courses that they considered to have a comparative advantage. In this way, JARCOM tries to balance the needs and priorities of both parties, and to seek a \u2018better match\u2019 if not the \u2018best\u2019 match. Matching and negotiation processes are jointly monitored and shared by all participants. Quarterly monitoring reports are submitted by all countries and compiled and re-circulated by the JARCOM Secretariat at the JICA office in Thailand. In the case of a problem in the process, the secretariat advises member countries to take necessary action.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bb7a859-bfbf-49ee-8281-7fa87d504e0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3bb7a859-bfbf-49ee-8281-7fa87d504e0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80a9646c451004303f9d30e570ac3ef8b9ff2292fa89f035484a07ef14edb1e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "99acd645-8136-4d01-9673-9a9acca5ff1b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "91a404088730ae19ea334c8dacdb2ed1dd2c7ec3ebe92f4ab8caa65802bcdf60"}}, "hash": "5eb25e2f02d9a091d797cb5e79f870b3a4cf234203d2147cbfd4448ef6fa8909", "text": "This joint monitoring system enables timely follow-up and ensures the transparency of the process.

Delegations from line ministries are sometimes invited according to agenda items. 65 system has created a good level of competition among members and has worked as an incentive for the identification of quality SSC projects. 2. Strong network of local staff in the region The roles of local staff are crucial, especially in facilitating smooth communications between expatriate officials and government counterparts. Needless to say, local staff members are in a better position to develop longer-term relationships with government officials and to deal with delicate protocol between neighbouring countries in the region. In addition, the existence of a stable coordination mechanism is a key to the success of South-South/Triangular Cooperation arrangements in which multilateral negotiations among geographically dispersed stakeholders take place. The network of a donor organization\u2019s local staff could be the core of such a mechanism due to their relatively stable positions (no repatriation as with expatriates, and fewer relocations and lower turnover than government officials). To ensure the sustainability and consistency of the negotiation process, the JARCOM Secretariat supported the establishment of the JARCOM National Staff Network, a loosely structured, informal network consisting of locally recruited staff in JICA country offices in South-East Asia. Since its establishment, responsibilities to carry out related activities have been progressively delegated to the network. For this purpose JARCOM also supported the capacity building of local staff in charge of SSC. Such support includes the establishment of a mailing list; convening of the National Staff Meeting, held back-to-back with JARCOM annual meetings; active involvement, as main coordinators, in project formulation and management; and special staff training on TCTP management. Strengthening the National Staff Network has contributed to better coordination with government counterparts in project negotiation and formulation processes. The network, established with initial support from the secretariat, has become more self-sustaining, with self-help efforts complementing minor staff turnovers. Today, the National Staff Network plays a catalytic role in promoting regional networking for SSC. 3. Alignment with existing regional initiatives In South-East Asia, a number of regional and sub-regional initiatives are active, either supported by international organizations/donors or national governments of the region. In order to avoid duplication, to ensure better coordination and be more responsive to regional priorities, JARCOM has sought alignment with existing regional initiatives. Among the various initiatives, the IAI is very similar to JARCOM in terms of its overall goal, participating countries and cooperation modalities (see Chapter on ASEAN). The IAI is a cooperation framework that addresses the issue of narrowing development gaps among ASEAN member countries. The IAI focuses on human capacity development and facilitates training and policy research projects. JARCOM, at its third annual meeting in 2004, adopted a mission statement similar to the IAI\u2019s, which aims to narrow the socio-economic development gaps among ASEAN countries through JICA\u2019s technical cooperation activities. Sharing the same objective, the JARCOM and ASEAN secretariats, after a series of discussions, agreed to cooperate whenever possible. The secretariats of JARCOM and the IAI are invited to major meetings, share information (especially on project ideas proposed in each initiative) and seek ways to strengthen reciprocal cooperation. The most tangible results of such cooperation are the mutual endorsements of projects that meet criteria for both the IAI and JARCOM initiatives. To date, 17 JARCOM projects are officially endorsed as IAI projects by the ASEAN Secretariat.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57bf16f9-a873-4f49-8103-025ec44a5745": {"__data__": {"id_": "57bf16f9-a873-4f49-8103-025ec44a5745", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8d58c47426259ff43fb2fe06e4c243f9e2ba2df0043fb675535525fe1069aaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "18172b7f-6192-49d6-9333-d32644c863a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6582b377f1fe297b020323700aaf76d1986cfb156d3224a8eb54ff90a8b53cd6"}}, "hash": "84b602548aea3b6544a88edee777f2cb25671e3af3db4b83615f351edbf198fa", "text": "Such cooperation contributes to the achievement of the shared objective, and gives regional legitimacy to SSC supported by JICA. 4.

Beneficiary countries often request such information in order to identify institutions within the region that could deliver appropriate services. In response to such requests, JARCOM has established a Web-based information system (www.jarcom.net) that gives information on the regional training courses it supports. Information is updated locally by the JARCOM National Staff Network and is accessible by anyone. Information is linked to the Web sites of each training institution and can be used as a reference to locate potential resources. 66 This Web site is also used to share information on relevant regional events and to disseminate the quarterly monitoring report on JARCOM project formulation status. The Web site ensures the transparency of the process and is a practical tool for information sharing. Main achievements of JARCOM JARCOM is an evolving forum and has broadened its functions and output over the years. In order to assess the outcomes of JARCOM-related activities since 2002, an internal review was conducted and presented at the sixth JARCOM in 2007. 1. Formulation of good quality South-South Cooperation projects This is the most important objective of JARCOM. Thus the most tangible indicator of JARCOM achievements is the number of good quality SSC projects formulated and the efficiency of needs\u2013 resource matching. Records have been available since 2004 when a quarterly monitoring system was introduced (see Table 14). The rate of matching has steadily increased while the number of projects formulated or realized in any form 22 has also increased (though a drop is observed in 2007). The decrease in the number of total project proposals is considered to be the result of the pre-screening process in which premature proposals are withdrawn before they are submitted to the JARCOM plenary meeting. The enhanced skills of participants in selective project identification and negotiation are thought to have contributed to increased matching efficiency as well. Table 14: Results of project identification and formulation through JARCOM Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 Number of project ideas proposed 36 51 43 23 Number of projects realized in any form (percentage of successful matches) 10 (28%) 31 (61%) 27 (63%) 18 (78%) Although qualitative data is not available, it is assumed that the \u2018quality\u2019 of these projects has also improved significantly through needs identification by beneficiaries themselves, direct negotiations and joint project formulation and enhanced ownership. In addition, peer group pressure among ASEAN members seems to have worked positively to improve the quality of cooperation. It is also reported that the attendance of high-level officials at JARCOM annual meetings ensures a commitment to projects they offer, resulting in \u2018extra\u2019 effort and care for the projects and trainees. 2. Capacity development through the participatory learning process Once JARCOM was established, its activities and functions were broadened because of the multiple stakeholder dynamics. 23 Eventually JARCOM\u2019s participatory process itself became a venue of mutual learning and capacity building. Enhanced overall capacity of SSC participants not only contributes to the improvement of project quality but also, more importantly, will have longer-term effects on sustainable regional cooperation. The opportunity of face-to-face discussions at the annual meeting has certainly fostered mutual understanding and solidarity among participants and fed into the momentum for their commitment to ASEAN integration. 22 This number includes training needs incorporated in other ongoing TCTP, thus, not necessarily a brand-new course is formulated. 23 For example, JARCOM once tried to tackle regional and trans-boundary issues that would benefit the region as a whole and contribute to the ASEAN integration process. This went beyond the conventional SSC framework, in which the roles of providers and beneficiaries are relatively clear. 67 Beneficiaries In JARCOM, beneficiaries are not simply passive recipients, but take initial action to identify project needs. In doing so, they are requested to strictly prioritize needs and articulate their proposals to potential cooperating countries. To prepare for this, JARCOM member organizations (the technical cooperation window organizations of beneficiary countries) sometimes hold in-country JARCOM seminars with the support of the JARCOM National Staff Network. 24 In this way, the JARCOM process not only starts at its annual meeting, but also with this pre-JARCOM in-country consultation with wider domestic stakeholders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02a9fe53-0e0b-4dd3-b868-9fda9a6f761a": {"__data__": {"id_": "02a9fe53-0e0b-4dd3-b868-9fda9a6f761a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65b46b30ce676caee7504ed8b84656c8e6b166b33f1249e727fc0d69e63e6572"}, "2": {"node_id": "3da5d7a8-bc6c-4e82-abc1-25ad3d1a4084", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d14d78a595473f0b4adc6654e1fd6785a0976dcf8cfdb301787c9d3f773483bf"}}, "hash": "4dfb0e73f9651d4c30005b11d2c1457091cfaaac3cea999becd8addecd30ffaf", "text": "The entire process thus facilitates broader stakeholder participation and provides an opportunity for technical cooperation agencies in recipient countries to build capacity in strategic planning, coordination and management of external assistance \u2013 capacities that are often said to be weak in aid-recipient countries.

This should at least partly solve the issues revealed in the SSC evaluation, in which neither recipient governments nor JICA offices considered SSC as a means to address their development process. Providers From the providers\u2019 point of view (service providers and JICA, the sponsor), it is easier and faster to design SSC projects alone. It would seem that they may be concerned that JARCOM would involve a more complicated process. However, JICA supports TCTPs by middle-income countries in order to build their capacity in training management and implementation. In addition, JARCOM supports their learning through participation in project formulation and the management of multilateral processes. In addition, joint project formulation events have been a useful tool for practical training in their transition to becoming donors. In some cases, government officials of resource countries have had a chance to visit less-developed countries with JICA experts, directly observe conditions on the ground and discuss issues with recipient-country officials. In the author\u2019s informal communications with officials, they reported that, through the joint mission, they were able to learn from the difficulties of coordinating and responding to the different needs of each beneficiary country. Donors In a Triangular Cooperation arrangement, a donor like JICA is expected to take a different approach to that of \u2018conventional\u2019 bilateral technical cooperation. Firstly, in the JARCOM process, JICA is not the sole provider of aid or the sole decision maker. 25 Secondly, the hierarchical relationship between \u2018giver\u2019 and \u2018receiver\u2019 in the Triangular approach is not as clear as in the North-South approach. In the JARCOM process, JICA needs to facilitate the complex multilateral process without imposing its own aid policy. In this way, JARCOM offers a unique learning opportunity for bilateral donor staff to reconsider the approach to clients and to build their skills to be more responsive to the diverse needs of partners at different levels of development. It offers good, on-the-job training for young JICA staff in managing the multilateral process. On the whole, JARCOM offers new development approaches and multilateral networking for all participants involved. 3. Mobilization of \u2018new\u2019 resources: The evolving roles of SSC participants South-East Asia is a dynamic region and the roles of ASEAN member countries are never static. Before JARCOM, there was a clear role division between providers and recipients in intra-ASEAN cooperation: Original members of ASEAN 26 were the service providers and the new members (CLMV) 27 were the recipients. There were very few exceptions to these roles. However, JARCOM has 24 The first seminar was held in Myanmar. Since then, the know-how from the in-country seminar has been shared and maintained among the JICA national staff network. Thus when the second seminar of this kind was planned, JICA\u2019s local staff were able to support their national counterparts through the assistance of the network. 25 JICA is still the only major sponsor and decision maker, but in a process like JARCOM, it does not make any unilateral decision. 26 The so-called \u2018ASEAN 6\u2019 including Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. 27 Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam. 68 stimulated regional self-help efforts and led to the emergence of a \u2018second generation\u2019 of SSC service providers. One of the merits of SSC is that virtually all countries have good development experiences and lessons to share with other countries. In fact, the similar experiences of developing countries are often more relevant to less-developed countries at similar stages of socio-economic development. Through the JARCOM process, member countries that used to be considered as recipient groups, such as Lao PDR and Viet Nam, have started offering training and workshops in which they can share their successful experiences. Such training includes aid coordination and avian influenza control, where these countries can share recent or even ongoing experiences. In fact, neither Japan nor middle- income countries in the region have firsthand experience in tackling such recent challenges and sharing them with less-developed countries. Such trends are good signs of promoting solidarity among developing countries and, more importantly, broadening the base of regional aid resources and accessible solutions to new challenges.

Growing costs for complex coordination One of the biggest challenges for JARCOM is the growing costs required for complex processes. As JARCOM\u2019s functions gradually broadened, the number of stakeholders kept growing. 28 This has resulted in a substantial cost increase for network operations, including the financial cost of meetings and human and institutional costs for coordination. It has now become difficult for a single donor to justify and bear all costs. The ownership factor for southern partners has been enhanced, but not to the extent that they can make significant financial contributions. This is one of the limitations of a single-donor regional framework. Considering the collective merit of such a framework, however, it may be an idea to have a multi-donor framework coordinated by international organizations. Intangible and longer-term benefits of capacity development and mutual learning It is an inherent issue of a participatory approach that the benefits of capacity building tend to be considered as external to the development process despite the relatively high immediate cost. It is difficult to verify the intangible benefits of capacity development, which also take time to be realized. Yet, capacity development is central to SSC, especially when it is aimed at supporting new development partners in accumulating know-how as aid providers and creating an environment in which regional neighbours are willing to share and make optimal use of available recourses. Such benefits of SSC should not be undervalued. Multifaceted nature of SSC When evaluating the effectiveness of Triangular Cooperation initiatives like JARCOM, we should be aware of its multifunctional aspects and understand that the costs and benefits of such cooperation are not equally distributed among different stakeholders at the same time. As we have seen earlier, SSC has multiple functions and aspects; some are results-oriented and more beneficial to recipient countries, while some are process-oriented and more beneficial to service providers (and partially to donors). In addition, the realization of such benefits comes in different time spans \u2013 effects on individual trainees are rather immediate, while the effects of institutional capacity development for provider institutions take some time to be seen. The costs are even more partially distributed to donors (see below). As a result, the perceived benefits of SSC projects differ greatly among stakeholder groups. This makes strategic decisions on Triangular Cooperation very difficult 28 The size of the meeting itself grew substantially from 49 in 2002 to 74 in 2007. 69 and consensus hard to reach. For sound evaluation of SSC, these aspects require due consideration, and the entire costs and benefits need to be assessed vis-\u00e0-vis each function of SSC, the stakeholders and the time scale. Conclusion: Balancing the needs of all stakeholders Balancing the needs of all stakeholders is critical to ensure the sustainability of SSC. Needless to say, the benefits to end-recipient countries should not be neglected, and this was the initial objective behind JARCOM\u2019s establishment. However, it should also be noted that a supply-oriented approach was pre-postulated in the SSC initiative, which was originally started by asking: \u201cWhat resources and experiences are available among countries in the South?\u201d Yet, as the issue of aid effectiveness has become central to the global development agenda, \u2018demand-driven\u2019 and \u2018results-oriented\u2019 approaches became a \u2018blind faith\u2019 among \u2018responsible\u2019 donors. Should all these approaches be applied to all SSC? We may need to revisit the original sprit of SSC. The capacity and resources of middle-income countries are still limited, and these countries are not able to fully respond to the diverse challenges that least-developed recipient countries face. It is not realistic or fair to require these new development partners to comply with all the norms and conditions that northern donors require themselves. In the long run, it is important (and mutually beneficial) to nurture the capacity of new partners as aid suppliers in order to broaden global aid resources as a whole. The author believes that this is where the northern donors could play an important role in a Triangular Cooperation arrangement \u2013 coordinating and balancing the priorities of suppliers and recipients, thus reducing transaction costs for their southern partners, and ensuring that the needs of both parties are met. There has been an argument about whether resources from the South are supplemental to North-South Cooperation. But looking at SSC from a different perspective, northern resources can be supplemental to South-South initiatives. When we succeed in creating a win-win-win solution for all participants in Triangular Cooperation, the overall benefits of SSC will exceed the costs in the long run.

This is evidenced by the high level of attendance at the Second World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR), held in January 2005, and attended by 168 countries, 78 regional and international organizations and 161 NGOs. The conference endorsed the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 2005\u20132015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters, to reduce the impact of disasters triggered by natural causes. The HFA promotes disaster risk reduction (DRR) and its mainstreaming into socio-economic development planning and activities (ISDR, 2006). Disasters have grave consequences on the survival, dignity and livelihood of communities, particularly among the poor. Disasters can set back development gains, destroy the environment and negatively affect the attainment of the MDGs. The recorded number of people affected and the property losses caused by disasters have risen dramatically for each decade since reliable records began to be compiled fifty years ago (DFID, 2004). Disasters do not respect socio-economic boundaries or culture or gender. Nevertheless, the worst affected are usually the poor in poor countries. Such countries tend to suffer greater economic losses relative to their GDP than richer countries. Their capacity to recover and reduce risk is also more limited. Thus, DRR is a concern that cuts across all sectors in any country. It is increasingly becoming everybody\u2019s business. With the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, subsequent earthquakes in China, Indonesia, and Pakistan, flooding in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, the Philippines and Viet Nam, resulting in huge losses of life and socio-economic and environmental damage, DRR has become one of the top priorities in the Asia-Pacific region. While a wealth of experience and capacity on DRR exists in the region, such knowledge is not readily available to countries that may benefit from tapping into such expertise. Against this backdrop, two complementary projects on SSC in DRR have emerged. The first project, conceptualized and implemented since 2005 by the SU-SSC at the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok is the Global Facility for Community-Based Disaster Risk Management (GFDRM). The second, initiated by ESCAP, is focused on SSC on tsunamis and other disaster risks. Ten countries in the Asia- Pacific region participated in the pilot phase of this project Global Facility for Community-Based Disaster Risk Management (GFDRM) The SU-SSC was mandated to embark on DRR during the first regular session of the UNDP and UNFPA Executive Board in January 2005. The SU-SSC sees DRR as a crucial factor in the SSC agenda in the economic, social, cultural and technical spheres. Recognizing the huge consequences of the tsunami disaster and the enormous requirements for reconstruction, the SU-SSC\u2019s team at the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok responded by fielding southern experts to these countries to assist in damage and needs assessment and early recovery project development. To continue its platform on DRR beyond tsunami relief, the SU-SSC expanded its outreach by developing the Global Facility for Community-Based Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (GFDRM). The GFDRM is an avenue to widen the scope of SSC involvement in capacity building, project development, monitoring and evaluation, public awareness and advocacy in DRR. It is envisaged that it will contribute to the current innovative approaches and projects designed to help reduce present and future disaster risks. It provides a forum for sharing good practices for possible replication in other vulnerable communities and is a venue to assist networking and partnerships amongst people involved in making communities safer. The overarching goal of GFDRM is to contribute to vulnerability reduction and capacity development.

Other countries sent financial and human resource assistance directly to the affected countries (see Figure 19). Figure 19: Developing countries\u2019 assistance to tsunami-affected nations Source: SU-SSC, 2005 The contributions shown are only those contributed through the United Nations Trust Fund for South- South Cooperation. The SU-SSC carried out the objectives of the GFDRM by utilizing resources provided by countries from the South to assist those affected by the tsunami. For example, the SU-SSC in partnership with UNDP country offices organized capacity development activities for government, NGOs and the private sector on community-based DRR; supported community-based preparedness planning and early warning; and provided seed funding for further DRR activities. The GFDRM contributed to the SU-SSC\u2019s main platform of promoting the exchange and transfer of southern development knowledge and solutions. In the initial phase of the tsunami response, the GFDRM augmented the UNDP country offices in areas where there was no sufficient funding and where experts were needed in order to realize the early recovery efforts. Both the local professionals working in devastated areas and the southern experts benefited from this exercise. Training and cross-learning events were organized in the form of workshops in the tsunami-affected countries. 72 Networking and partnership on DRR knowledge and solutions The GFDRM is the SU-SSC\u2019s vehicle to link with UN agencies, governments and international and local NGOs engaged in DRR work. Through networking and collaboration, the GFDRM has helped facilitate the development, exchange and transfer of knowledge and solutions on DRR through capacity development activities such as training, sharing of good DRR practices and discourse, as well as the publication of practical knowledge. For example, in partnership with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the capacity of local Red Cross Societies was improved on community-based DRR. Collaboration with the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) resulted in the publication of a \u2018Handbook on Good Building Design and Construction\u2019. As a result of this first publication, which was promoted globally, GTZ replicated the guide using the Philippines experience. The GTZ, UNDP and the United Nations International Decade Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) co-published the second series of the guide. Two other publications \u2013 \u2018Building Resilient Communities: Good Practices and Lessons Learned\u2019 and \u2018Linking Disaster Risk Reduction with Poverty Reduction\u2019 \u2013 are compilations of selected projects implemented by NGOs throughout the world. The publications, which were facilitated by the partnership between UNISDR and the SU-SSC are focused on helping communities reduce risks in their localities. These products have been distributed globally for South-South sharing and learning. The cooperation with UNISDR also facilitated the formation of alliances such as the Global Network of Civil Society Organizations on Disaster Risk Reduction. This cooperation is now developing towards organizing the Global Alliance of Local Government Authorities for DRR. The Harbin Alliance was organised with UNISDR, Oxfam Hong Kong, the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre (ADPC), the Asian Disaster Reduction Centre (ADRC), the International Disaster Reduction Conference, the Climate Action Network in South-East and South Asia, CARE International and ProVention Consortium, in order to promote cooperation on climate change and DRR. A partnership with the World Bank has helped improve the implementation of community-based DRR in Viet Nam and enhanced the development of the World Bank\u2019s Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction, South-South Cooperation Fund. The SU-SSC\u2019s collaboration with Capacity Development for Risk Reduction Initiatives (CADRI), formerly the UN Disaster Management Training Programme (UNDMTP), started during its inception stage and continues to date. CADRI is supporting one SU-SSC project under the GFDRM. South-South training and learning The SU-SSC, in consultation with partners interested in South-South learning, organized a Training and Learning Circle (TLC) to increase the level of cooperation among partners and to promote a common agenda on DRR. With the ProVention Consortium, the ADPC, the Centre for Disaster Preparedness and the All-India Disaster Management Institute, it developed the concept of the TLC with the belief that DRR needs to be embedded in the culture of communities, where hazards become disasters due to lack of sufficient capacity and collective understanding of how to manage risks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a3bdc62-6aae-4d47-9349-c664accb313e": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a3bdc62-6aae-4d47-9349-c664accb313e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "002b14bec4ad74811f611621376a0c3c043424fc1458ca5d91456a023d99162c"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2a01658-2c30-4216-a8f4-5310eb3dfa71", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e26de851c9e8e80855fe1108c5fef7787a997451f20bc03915acbe2d51d761fa"}}, "hash": "6fbf44983af06262bfbcf5c6926742f45c881053186849c19d68a716930fc09a", "text": "The TLC was conceptualized to generate, enhance and share useful tools and information on training and learning to help facilitate capacity development at all levels.

This project is being funded by the ProVention Consortium. South-South Cooperation on the tsunami and other disaster risk management This project was conceived by ESCAP in consultation and partnership with the SU-SSC, with funding by the Government of Germany. On the occasion of the 14th Session of the High-level Committee on South-South Cooperation in 2005, ESCAP and the SU-SSC organized an informal consultation with Asia-Pacific delegates on the areas of focus for ESCAP\u2019s efforts in SSC. The delegates recommended focusing on high-impact areas, including emerging areas for SSC such as DRR, in support of the MDGs. The pilot project included the following 10 countries: China, Bangladesh, Fiji, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Maldives, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The main goal was to develop a strategic institutional and operational results-based framework for SSC on the theme of DRR. The project represented a transformational phase of ESCAP\u2019s SSC activities, which went through a shift from the traditional training courses and study visits hosted by \u2018capacity\u2019 or pivotal countries to more strategic interventions, focusing on priority development issues identified by its member States. The project was guided by the following key principles: ensuring results-based approaches; clear prioritization of SSC activities on specific \u2018high-impact\u2019 areas such as DRR; promoting national ownership of the programme among both the \u2018capacity\u2019 countries and beneficiary countries; undertaking systematic collection, analysis and dissemination of good practices in DRR to learn from past experiences; and promoting greater coordination and synergies with other UN organizations, including the SU-SSC. A study on the development of strategic options for South-South Cooperation on disaster risk management Consultations with the 10 countries prompted a thorough study to determine the DRM capacities and needs of each. This study revealed a wide range of efforts on SSC in DRM. For example, a variety of regional and national efforts on DRM are already underway. On the regional side, the ASEAN Committee on Disaster Management, the South Asia Centre for Disaster Management of SAARC, ADPC, ADRC, the Asian Disaster Reduction and Response Network (ADRRN) and Duryog Nivaran undertake an array of training, research and information-sharing programmes. Similarly, a variety of efforts are being carried out in Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, the Maldives, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand amongst others. SSC on DRM in the region remains a challenge. The main problems are a lack of familiarity among stakeholders, barriers to information sharing, a perceived lower priority of SSC mechanisms in DRM relative to relief activities, a lack of confidence in developing-country expertise, and a lack of designated focal points for SSC. In light of the above, several criteria for effective SSC on DRM have been determined. Proposed initiatives have to be sustainable, feature immediate start-up, be inclusive and of acceptable cost, rely primarily on resources provided by developing countries, be in response to sufficient demand, and avoid duplicating existing efforts. The study put forward a broad range of possible strategic options for SSC on DRM.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "301449ac-1761-4339-8cb3-a4b86fd1c2d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "301449ac-1761-4339-8cb3-a4b86fd1c2d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf2094f6097ee046766aaf3114de808086487ef77aa374b2cc051563c3143e41"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd652229-8107-42a1-afe3-f6fbb4ac5ff2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71533b76b88aab36af3d2e32b239ad0b22655598408aba0e37228ff7871b6664"}}, "hash": "6e5f46baf65f17439ce3874c5c86dffcd02fdc28fd8f97a4d62b4380d9027518", "text": "The study put forward a broad range of possible strategic options for SSC on DRM.

In December 2007, the 10 pilot countries agreed to establish a regional SSC mechanism for DRR, for which the Government of Indonesia acts as the interim secretariat. The regional mechanism aims to: \ufffd promote the sharing of existing information and knowledge at national and regional levels, including expertise, skills, training opportunities, statistical data and other information on DRR; \ufffd assist in the identification and assessment of DRR activities, where SSC could be employed as a useful approach; \ufffd provide solutions anchored in SSC to address challenges and barriers in DRR. At a recent meeting of the participating countries and four additional countries, 29 the link between DRR and climate change adaptation was highlighted and the countries agreed to incorporate this dimension in the work of the mechanism. 29 Additional countries are Lao PDR, Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste and Viet Nam. 75 Conclusion The two projects have sown the seed for an active and dynamic SSC in DRM. The participating countries and partners have begun analysing and evaluating models from other countries in the region, which may be adopted to strengthen their own DRR. A strategic institutional and operational, results- based framework for SSC in DRM, which is envisioned to contribute towards improving DRR in the region, is already high on the agenda of the participating countries. With the finalized and approved SSC mechanism in DRM, the expertise, experiences and good practices among participating countries will be soon be accessible to other nations in need of such information. Overall, SSC in the area of DRR holds great promise. Matching of resources and expertise, where one is abundant and the other is lacking, is an effective arrangement. Mutual benefit and learning using a South-South modality is a win-win deal.

At the World Food Summit (WFS), convened at FAO headquarters in Rome in November 1996, the 186 heads of delegations adopted the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action, which set the goal of reducing the number of undernourished people to half of the 1996 level no later than 2015. 32 At the same meeting, the SPFS concept was endorsed to fight hunger in low income food deficit countries (LIFDCs) 33 and to meet this goal by boosting food production. The SPFS focused on showing how production could be increased through sustainable intensification of production systems, diversification, and water and irrigation management, while studying the socio- economic constraints to attaining national and household food security. During the 10 years between 1995 and 2005, over 105 member countries piloted SPFS activities, which resulted in most countries developing larger national efforts to achieve food security. To maximize the impact of its work, the FAO strongly encourages national ownership of food security activities, and local empowerment in the countries in which it operates.

The list has been updated annually since then (see: http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/lifdc.asp). 34 The World Food Summit: \u2018Five Years Later\u2019 took place in June 2002 and called for an international alliance to accelerate action to reduce world hunger in the form of: an intergovernmental working group to develop voluntary guidelines to achieve the progressive realization of the right to food; reversing the overall decline of agriculture and rural development in the national budgets of developing countries, in assistance provided by industrialized countries, and in lending by international financing institutions; and considering voluntary contributions to the FAO Trust Fund on Food Safety and Food Security. 77 This scale-up strategy is in line with achieving both World Food Summit goals and the MDGs. These large-scale National Programmes for Food Security (NPFS) combine access to food through production or income generation with social protection measures, work policies and infrastructure investments. NPFS often operate under Poverty Reduction Strategies. At present, the FAO has been asked by about 50 member countries to help establish and implement NPFS through formulation support, fund-raising and technical input including SSC. In addition, Regional Programmes for Food Security (RPFS) are being implemented under Regional Economic Organizations to support national level and inter-country programmes including trade and trans-boundary issues. RPFS are currently under implementation in four regions. Among those, one operates with the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) and another with the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) in Central Asia. Characteristics of FAO\u2019s South-South Cooperation programme To support the implementation of SPFS, FAO established its own SSC initiative in 1996. This initiative, launched under the SPFS, provides the opportunity for strengthening cooperation among developing countries in the field of agriculture. The mechanism is designed so that it matches the longer-term nature of crop and livestock production cycles. Unlike the TCDC, 35 through which expertise is provided during relatively short periods by a small number of experts, FAO\u2019s SSC programme supports experts and technicians working for two to four years in teams in a given country. These teams often number more than 20 people at a time. This is based on the idea that a \u2018critical mass\u2019 of experts can introduce a significant improvement in food production that can be sustained by local farmers after the termination of SSC activities. The level of compensation for SSC experts and technicians is set significantly lower than for the typical TCDC expert. Such an arrangement can be carried out because of the cooperating countries\u2019 willingness to show solidarity with other developing countries. The SSC programme continues to provide technical support to emerging NPFS and RPFS in much the same way as under the SPFS. Under FAO\u2019s SSC initiative, experts and field technicians work directly with farmers in rural communities involved in food security programmes. It has been found that SSC experts and technicians from more advanced developing countries can undertake field activities in ways that are well suited for longer-term food security programmes. Several reasons can be identified for this. The advantages of SSC experts and technicians include: (i) familiarity with the conditions and situation of developing countries; (ii) a willingness to work for long periods in rural communities; and (iii) the ability to adapt local solutions from one country to local conditions in another country. The strong local nature of FAO\u2019s SSC creates a unique opportunity for host communities to develop close relationships with experts and technicians, and allows for longer-term local sustainable development. Not only do the experts share experiences, they also transfer new techniques and knowledge from their home countries and encourage the better use of local resources in the host countries. In many respects, FAO\u2019s SSC is similar to volunteer programmes. The close association and dedication of the participants on both sides provides a strong basis for mutual understanding between cultures and countries. Operational modalities of FAO\u2019s SSC FAO\u2019s SSC programmes are established through tripartite agreements among the cooperating country, the host country and the FAO. These agreements set forth the roles and responsibilities of parties concerned, including cost-sharing arrangements, and establish the frameworks under which experts and technicians are fielded. Overall, 39 SSC tripartite agreements had been signed by June 2008, in which cooperating countries committed themselves to provide up to 3,000 SSC specialists.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99027ffd-a39c-40d2-a784-8f3c4b82c907": {"__data__": {"id_": "99027ffd-a39c-40d2-a784-8f3c4b82c907", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e488af173a6083a5f3366340073b6b71dc62ce160ca00f27641077dd38ed053"}, "2": {"node_id": "17ce0640-2b98-4d7f-ba75-a7f7d3f2d543", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ac2e79bfcee4bfec4349dddcea1ba1f1b8c41f290b17319e2550d0406a1924d"}}, "hash": "dc948aea1d63d966b3fd44b2a7568f0acf7fdca94d9a06a603776655efb67e34", "text": "Such framework agreements allow flexibility when fielding experts and technicians, depending on resource availability at a given time, and allow adaptation to changes at field level during the implementation of food security programmes.

It was the first formal step towards promoting such cooperation, as a complement to the North-South technological transfer previously favoured by the developed world. 78 The cooperating government The cooperating government selects its experts and technicians according to the terms of reference prepared by the tripartite formulation. They will provide simple but appropriate technology in order to maximize the impacts of technical cooperation in the various fields in question (water control, plant production, small animal husbandry, fisheries and aquaculture). Clearance and technical approval for each candidate is given by FAO and the host government. The cooperating government pays the salaries, social insurance and all other remuneration to which selected candidates have a right in their own country. In-country travel costs upon departure and return, as well as a re-integration grant, are also paid by the cooperating government. The host government The host government pays a monthly allowance in local currency, equivalent to $300 for each expert and technician (including 2.5 days per month time off). It is also responsible for providing entry/exit visas and other administrative formalities required, and granting duty free import of equipment within the first six month of the assignment, as well as duty free export of locally purchased goods. Accommodation and utilities, public administrative support services, insurance for vehicles and the costs for local and regional travel are also paid by the host government. FAO FAO\u2019s main role is that of catalyst and negotiator at the government level. FAO, upon receiving requests from governments, contacts partner governments and assists in the negotiation process and the establishment of the tripartite agreement. In addition, FAO usually offers a platform to implement SSC in the framework of the various types of food security programmes. It provides technical assistance in designing the SSC field activities and assists in mobilizing additional resources from other donors or financial institutions. FAO, through donor funding, is responsible for paying international travel expenses, installation grants ($450) and subsistence allowances ($1,200 per month per expert and $600 per month per field technician). It also provides medical insurance under the organization\u2019s medical scheme and covers office operating costs (including office supplies that cannot be provided by the host government) and the costs of consumables (fuel, printing of reports, etc). Transport facilities, such as motorcycles needed for official work, are made available to the experts and field technicians by the FAO. 79 FAO\u2019s South-South Cooperation in Asia Asian countries have been the main providers of experts and technicians. Out of the 39 tripartite agreements signed so far, Asian countries are providing technicians and experts in 23 cases. This is 59 percent of all agreements. Cooperating countries include Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, the Philippines and Viet Nam. Technicians and experts have been working in the Caribbean, Pacific islands, Africa and Asia, as shown in Table 15. On the other hand, out of 62 recipient countries of SSC, only three Asian countries received SSC assistance through Special or National Programmes for Food Security, namely Bangladesh, Lao PDR and Papua New Guinea. Twelve countries in the Pacific received assistance through an RPFS from the Philippines and China.

Information materials were also developed and distributed to disseminate the demonstrated technologies. Viet Nam\u2019s cooperation with Africa and Lao PDR Viet Nam has been very active in the implementation of the SPFS by providing experts and field technicians to several countries under the SSC initiative. It has so far assigned a total of 50 experts and 326 technicians to six countries \u2013 Benin, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lao PDR, Madagascar, Mali and Senegal. From September 2001 to February 2005 Viet Nam sent 29 experts and 239 technicians to Senegal to assist in the implementation of the SPFS. They contributed both to programme management and field-level activities, and supported the set-up of a monitoring and evaluation system for programme implementation and achievements. They were also directly involved in the demonstration of improved or new technologies. Demonstrations included: production of improved maize varieties; multiplication of improved and local seed varieties; innovations for rain-fed agriculture, small livestock (pigs and poultry), beekeeping, fish farming and horticulture; and processing and post-harvest management of fruits and vegetables. In addition, the experts and technicians brought along and disseminated simple Vietnamese tools, which were easily reproduced by Senegalese farmers using local materials. Such tools included an improved animal-drawn plough, a six-toothed rake for rice, a wooden rake for land-levelling, sacks for spreading insecticide, and improved beehives. Viet Nam signed a tripartite agreement with Lao PDR in 2001. The main objective of the Lao programme was to increase farmers\u2019 incomes and access to healthy and nutritious food. This was achieved through the reduction of post harvest losses, improved agro-processing and the marketing of farm products in four provinces. Agronomy and livestock aspects were added later on. To introduce these technologies to the Lao farmers, Farmer Field School (FFS) classes were organized throughout 2003 and 2004. FFS is a group-based adult learning method based on field observation and hands-on experiments. In Lao PDR, farmers carried out experimental learning with the assistance of Vietnamese experts and technicians. The affects of the programme were remarkable. Both the rice planting areas and yields were increased substantially. As a result, it was reported that per capita production in programme areas increased by between 20 percent and 90 Percent (,2004). 36 36 GCSP/LAO/011/JPN, \u2018Final Report of the Activities of Vietnamese Experts and Technicians\u2019, 2004, Page 10. 81 China: Most active cooperating country China has been the most active supporter of SSC under the various FAO food security programmes. Since 1996, China has provided experts and technicians for Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria and Caribbean and Pacific island countries. Among these, the largest SSC programme is carried out with Nigeria, where the entire programme is unilaterally financed by the Government of Nigeria. The SSC work carried out by the 500 Chinese experts and technicians there has been documented in detail in the report of the National Special Programme for Food Security (NSPFS) Nigeria in 2007. The report describes over 230 technologies that have been demonstrated to Nigerian partners at various levels. The beneficiaries include farming communities, small commercial farmers, government institutions such as state laboratories, extension workers and other governmental or non- governmental service providers. The techniques introduced were mainly in four areas: water management, agriculture, livestock and aquaculture. \ufffd In water management, dam construction, pond development, rain water harvesting techniques, water saving irrigation, and well development were demonstrated. \ufffd Various agricultural techniques were demonstrated by Chinese experts, including crop husbandry, plant protection, processing, machinery and tools, and rural energy. \ufffd Livestock techniques covered included poultry, pigs, small ruminants, rabbits, egg production, forage production and disease control. \ufffd Aquaculture demonstrations included pond engineering, reproduction and hatching, pond and cage culture, seed rearing, rice-fish farming, disease control, and processing and equipment. Rice-fish farming The SSC technicians disseminated the technique of rice-fish farming in all states by distributing technical materials, making scale models for exhibition or establishing demonstration sites for teaching.

The maximum number of SSC \u2018cooperants\u2019 in the country was four experts and 25 technicians in 2000. The last cooperants left in 2004. A tripartite agreement for SSC between India and Mozambique was signed on 1 March 2001. A total of five cooperants (two experts and three technicians) were fielded in 2002 for a period of three years. The initial SSC started in Zambezia province with funding from the African Development Bank (AfDB). A joint FAO/Government of India SSC formulation mission visited Lesotho in May 2000. The SSC agreement was signed on 3 October 2001 and four experts and one field technician were provided by India in the following year until 2005. 82 A survey on SSC in the Pacific A brief questionnaire survey was carried out in 2006 among the 12 National Project Coordinators of the Pacific Island Regional Programme for Food Security. To the overall satisfaction of the SSC programme, 58 percent of the respondents rated the programme as \u201cvery good\u201d while one quarter was \u201cmore than satisfied\u201d and only 10 percent \u201cless satisfied.\u201d In terms of areas of assistance, the respondents were generally content with the four broad areas of the programme, namely water management, crop production, livestock and fisheries, and aquaculture. The area most often mentioned as additionally useful was agro-processing. Other areas included fruit tree growing, coconut timber usage, organic crop production, marketing, farm management and plant protection and propagation. The most appreciated feature of the SSC contribution was the direct technical assistance to, and training of, farmers and fisher folk. Training of government staff and assistance in planning and general organization were ranked of lower importance. Regarding areas of improvement in SSC, the most prominent proposals concerned the language performance of the SSC cooperants, as it was considered the most important condition for success. Secondly, it was suggested that the host country should be given more responsibility in developing the terms of reference for the assignment in accordance with its needs; 50 percent of the interviewees shared this opinion. Nevertheless, the commitment of the assigned staff was judged as \u201cvery high\u201d by 67 percent of respondents. Seventy-five percent of those interviewed recognized that the costs of the programme to their country were reasonable when compared to the obtained benefits. When they were asked if their country would be able to pay the salaries of the SSC staff, one quarter of the answers were positive, one third could not answer the question and 42 percent did not think so. Most argued that their governments could not afford additional staff, rather they were trying to reduce public service employees. Other respondents thought that their government would consider the possibility, particularly for certain technical areas. Conclusion FAO\u2019s SSC programme has contributed, in a cost-effective manner, a large number of specialists to food security programmes globally. For the most part, the SSC is well appreciated by the host countries. SSC experts and technicians make new technologies available to communities that are well adapted to their particular environment. They support communities in setting priorities. They often bring tools and input from their home country, assist in setting up relevant equipment, and train the farmers in operating tools, equipment and small machinery. SSC cooperants mostly live at the community level and keep in close contact with the people they are assisting. They often work with great enthusiasm and engagement. Areas that are being improved include: (i) better matching of cooperants\u2019 language skills, and support for their education in the official and local languages in order to improve communication; (ii) better selection criteria to match field positions with experts and technicians; (iii) better pre-departure training for cooperants to adjust their expectations to the realities of the specialist experience under the SSC programme; and (iv) improving administrative support procedures for experts and technicians, including health and life insurance, better contact with their families at home, and facilitating appropriate mobility and adequate operational support.

Viet Nam joined ASEAN in 1995, Lao PDR and Myanmar in 1997 and Cambodia in 1999. Almost immediately, concerns about a \u2018two-tier\u2019 ASEAN were raised. The gap between the older, more-advanced members and the newer, less-developed nations became a concern in ASEAN for the first time. At the ASEAN Summit held in November 2000 in Singapore, the group\u2019s leaders adopted a special programme aimed at narrowing the development gap. They called it the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI). IAI gave an additional dimension to the concept of ASEAN integration, which now not only denoted the integration of the regional market but also the integration of newer member countries into the ASEAN economic mainstream. Towards this end, in November 2001, ASEAN members, with the assistance of dialogue partners and international agencies, drew up a six-year (2002\u20132008) work plan for the IAI with 48 projects. ASEAN presented the projects to the IAI Development Cooperation Forum, organized by the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta, in August 2002. The work plan was due to conclude in June 2008, at a time when initiatives in the larger ASEAN framework were rapidly coming to grips with the acceleration of integration towards the target date of 2015. At the 12th ASEAN Summit in January 2007 in Bali, the ASEAN leaders affirmed their strong commitment to accelerate the establishment of an ASEAN Community by 2015, as envisioned in the ASEAN Vision 2020 and the ASEAN Concord II, and signed the Cebu Declaration on the Acceleration of the Establishment of an ASEAN Community by 2015. In particular, the leaders agreed to transform ASEAN into a region with free movement of goods, services, investment and skilled labour, and a freer flow of capital. Thus, as ASEAN agreed on the need for clear and precise blueprints to chart the way towards achieving the 2015 goals, the IAI Task Force was also asked to produce an IAI Blueprint. The IAI Blueprint would identify the characteristics and elements necessary for the achievement of the 2015 goals, consistent with the Bali Concord II, and including clear targets and timelines for the implementation of various measures while accommodating the interests of all ASEAN member countries. The objective of narrowing the development gap is an integral component of ASEAN integration because economic disparities distort and prevent equitable economic distribution. As ASEAN embraces a single free market, the challenge will be to ensure that all ASEAN members are able to take advantage of the many opportunities this will bring. 37 Edited by Denis Nkala. 84 The IAI programme Since its inception, the number of IAI projects has expanded to over 130. Although most of the projects have achieved results, shortcomings were identified during the mid-term review (MTR) of the IAI. The shortcomings include project selection criteria, inter-agency coordination, coordination with other Mekong basin programmes, and follow-through and implementation. Special and differential treatment When the ASEAN Leaders affirmed the IAI as the main instrument for narrowing the development gap, they declared that the programme would include specific regional cooperation activities aimed at assisting the less developed members in removing tariffs and physical barriers to the free flow of goods and services. This would also include activities to supplement national efforts directly aimed at poverty reduction and the promotion of equitable and inclusive development. In order to provide a buffer during this period of adjustment, the new members \u2013 Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam (CLMV) \u2013 were accorded special and differential treatment in ASEAN agreements. The most obvious consequence of this was the longer grace period in the implementation timelines. In practical terms, this resulted in an additional 2\u20133 years to enable them to meet liberalization targets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19288373-59be-4a17-8c7c-a8c0d027f749": {"__data__": {"id_": "19288373-59be-4a17-8c7c-a8c0d027f749", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1339ec3ca5143dbc2610d135f9cfc1829a6b750a70ce2a8aaf4c1ee8927b58ee"}, "2": {"node_id": "b31974be-8299-412f-9219-eb0fbfcfefca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02201a631cf7641d34df3b16be855abfac52e538212e3a141bb6019c033905ed"}}, "hash": "6fbb1dec3dace092dbe3051b70e1c5c0005a73ecc71cc309dea82ef66c3a8078", "text": "For example, when the older ASEAN members \u2013 ASEAN-6 \u2013 were given a deadline of 2010 to implement certain liberalization measures, CLMV were given a deadline of 2013 to implement those same measures.

Initiatives under the IAI are the result of a combination of several simultaneous mutual assistance lines, both from within ASEAN and by working with others. From within, ASEAN-6 have played a role in: (i) the IAI programme itself; (ii) bilateral assistance direct to CLMV; and (iii) ASEAN subregional initiatives, namely the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) and the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT). Working with ASEAN friends and partners, assistance takes on various forms, from financial to technical assistance, often on a joint-venture basis, and predominantly comes from contributions from dialogue partners and development agencies or non-ASEAN subregional frameworks. Table 17 shows the projects by source, as above. Table 17: Contributors to the IAI Work Plan 2002\u20132008 IAI Work Plan (Feb 2008) Projects Millions of dollars ASEAN 6 87 28.3 With development partners / agencies assistance, including Joint Venture basis 61 18.3 Total 46.6 Bilateral basis ASEAN 6 221 159.5 86 ASEAN Of the $46.6 million worth of initiatives under the IAI, ASEAN-6 contributed approximately $28.3 million or 61 percent. On a direct bilateral basis, assistance from ASEAN-6 amounted to $159.5 million. Some deductions can be made from this. \u2018Prosper the neighbour\u2019 is a living doctrine being subscribed to. The IAI is a mechanism that facilitates \u2013 and importantly does not prevent ASEAN-6 providing \u2013 additional assistance to CLMV over and above the IAI framework. Thus, ASEAN members readily accept the IAI as the heart and soul of the ASEAN mutual assistance strategy. Table 18 shows the ASEAN-6 contribution to the IAI Work Plan.

For example, in a continuous drive to find modalities for effective ODA, ASEAN, under the IAI programme, set up the co-shepherds system. Under each of the seven areas of cooperation, CLMV were teamed up with mentors from ASEAN-6. Thus, Myanmar was teamed up with Malaysia for ICT projects, Viet Nam with the Philippines for regional economic integration projects, Cambodia with Thailand for transport and with Indonesia for energy, and Lao PDR with Brunei Darussalam and Singapore for human resources development. However, ASEAN is cognizant that more needs to be done as new challenges arise and as the current IAI Work Plan comes to a conclusion. The subsequent IAI Work Plan should take into consideration any shortcomings and incorporate new strategies.

The IAI provides the mandate for all stakeholders to engage CLMV as a unified entity that is sanctioned by ASEAN, and facilitates a framework for consultations and cooperation. In this regard, the development of the ASEAN Charter has been a key measure for engagement as it establishes a common set of values for ASEAN, evolving it from a loosely based regional body to that of a rules-based organization. It strengthens the ASEAN Secretariat, and with it provides cover for the various entities within its structure such as the IAI Unit. This in turn allows the IAI Unit to act as a coordinating entity among the various stakeholders and ODA players. Conclusion The IAI, being an internal mechanism, is in the best position to synergize with other ASEAN initiatives. However, to be truly effective, it needs to broaden its funding base and in the long term, adequately address the inadequate resource mobilization situation. Adequate funding would also address another detracting feature of most IAI projects to date, that is, projects often lack continuity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3354b257-8f2e-4c4c-815a-0248264d3be2": {"__data__": {"id_": "3354b257-8f2e-4c4c-815a-0248264d3be2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f130189a1b1d04ed8f6c8cae19ca39f0630507fb3be8f243d6b2d77622ca922d"}, "2": {"node_id": "518454c2-d881-4551-9520-462c59b9258f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "440a57b4bcffe8f96d6ac8b8890f1764179c0f53975d4e3d823132a8d2a374e2"}}, "hash": "927931a8b2a7681ff7578762af58d68991e4e438a4a0be7e4b9af02b62bb8218", "text": "Nevertheless, the IAI\u2019s existence creates a sense of regional solidarity and of equitable and inclusive development, offering a counter balance to the costs, sacrifices and loss of national autonomy as the planned economies of CLMV rapidly merge into a larger, single ASEAN market. 90 UNIDO programme for South-South Cooperation: An emerging intersection for new partnerships UNIDO Regional Office in Bangkok \u201cSouth-South Cooperation is increasingly seen as an important element of international cooperation.

The emergence of the South as a major global economic player has been largely due to its significant growth in industry and trade. This, in effect, has resulted in a new pattern of global interdependence, both from a North-South and a South-South perspective. In this process, SSC has attracted widespread attention and remained an important common platform for developing countries to engage each other in development dialogue. The global industrial setting has become ever more complex due to globalization and fundamental changes in technologies, industrial capacity, global value chains and stricter global norms and standards for industry. This more complex industrial setting has increased the risk of marginalization, especially for countries with weak productive capacities. As a result, increasing concern for reducing poverty within the framework of the United Nations MDGs has added new perspectives to SSC and overall industrial development policies and strategies. Developing countries are now investing in each other\u2019s economies, with foreign direct investments (FDI) rising from $14 billion in 1995 to $47 billion in 2003. These investments accounted for 37 percent of the total FDI in all developing countries in 2003. Trade within the South has also risen significantly from $222 billion in 1995 to $562 billion in 2004, representing 26 percent of their global trade. In Asia alone, South-East Asian countries accounted for 70 percent of the total manufacturing value added in developing countries in 2005, an increase from around 50 percent in 1990. During the period 2002 to 2004, average annual intra-Asian investment flows amounted to $48 billion, more than four fifths of all intra-South FDI in the period. On the other hand, a recent UNIDO study (2005) on SSC for industrial development found that although there has been a high concentration of growth in Asia, it has been accompanied by the further marginalization of sub-Saharan Africa and other LDCs. This is mainly in terms of manufacturing trade but also in industries in which sub-Saharan Africa is perceived to possess comparative advantages such as in agro-industries. Although the overall trends in SSC have been quite encouraging and a lot of progress is clearly being made, the potential of maximizing gains through leveraging of capacities, networking of institutions and making timely technological interventions still remains largely untapped. Against such a background, UNIDO, a specialized UN agency mandated to promote industrial development and international industrial cooperation, plays a pivotal role in fostering and stimulating growth in order to enhance SSC. 91 UNIDO\u2019s role in support of South-South Cooperation in industrial development In the industrial sector, there is growing consensus that the emphasis of SSC should lie in strengthening the following: \ufffd developing a common position on global trade norms and a vibrant consultative mechanism; \ufffd developing, promoting and sustaining productive capacities; \ufffd continuous shaping of approaches to poverty reduction based on collective wisdom and shared experience; \ufffd exchanges of experiences and institutional and knowledge networking. UNIDO\u2019s role and contribution, particularly in building productive and trade capacities of developing countries, is quite well known and is naturally expanding. As a result, UNIDO is now uniquely positioned to give stimulus to SSC by bringing its expertise and time-tested experience in support of developing countries, particularly LDCs. Additionally, at UNIDO\u2019s LDC Industrial Ministerial Conference in Vienna in November 2007, the ministers unanimously signed a declaration calling for UNIDO, inter alia, to play a pioneering role in developing industrial productive capacity and to promote mutually beneficial SSC initiatives in the areas within its mandate. UNIDO\u2019s strengthened relationship with the G-77, and improved interaction and coordination with other UN agencies such as UNDP\u2019s SU-SSC and UNHRLLS 38 implementing the Brussels Programme of Action, 39 is creating high returns.

The establishment of South-South Industrial Cooperation Centres in India and China serves as a primary point to explore UNIDO\u2019s experiences in SSC in Asia. These centres have been set up in order to further stimulate and catalyze the development of mutually beneficial partnerships between the industrially more advanced developing countries and LDCs. The status and activities of these two centres are described in the following sections. 43 Similar centres are planned in Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Morocco, South Africa and Brazil. These South-South Industrial Cooperation Centres will primarily focus on: \u2022 exchanges of experiences within the South; \u2022 institutional and enterprise networking within the South; \u2022 replicating best practices for poverty reduction within the South; and \u2022 strengthening national and local innovation systems within the South.

The programmes have been successful in increasing industrial competitiveness. \ufffd The UNIDO Technology Foresight Programme seeks to promote the use and application of technology foresight (TF) as an instrument for strategic decision-making and policy definition, with a special focus on industrial sectors. TF tries to identify possible future development scenarios on future market opportunities and threats. As such, it is a decision- support tool to facilitate anticipation and pro-active policy planning. The TF programme operates at sectoral, national and regional level. The most recent Technology Foresight Regional Conference/Expert Group Meeting was held for the South-East Asia region in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in October 2007. The meeting identified the need to use TF for strategic decision-making for science, technology and innovation, as well as in a broader sense, foresight for economic development in the South-East Asia region. The meeting was also important in demonstrating the experience that UNIDO has gained from its regional foresight approach in Latin America and Europe, and creating a synergy for UNIDO\u2019s technical assistance in foresight activities at the national and regional level of those regions. 43 For further information on UNIDO\u2019s South-South Industrial Cooperation Centres, please see the following link: http://www.unido.org/index.php?id=o84303. 94 Country-by-country experiences China China\u2019s explosive growth, primarily in the industrial and manufacturing sectors over the past few years, has made it recognize the importance and necessity of cooperation with UNIDO in promoting China\u2019s industrial development. UNIDO considers that China\u2019s successful development experience and its achievements in advanced industrial technologies may serve as a model for other developing countries, thereby contributing to their national industrial development. China and UNIDO have had a sound cooperative partnership over the past thirty years and are interested in further consolidating and enhancing their partnership, especially in the field of SSC. In this section, two model experiences in the UNIDO-China partnership initiatives, namely the UNIDO Centre for South-South Industrial Cooperation, in Beijing, and the Rural Small Hydropower Project in Africa, are described. The Centre for South-South Industrial Cooperation: Promoting investment and technology transfer Originally created to support industrial development in China, the UNIDO-managed Industrial Development Fund (IDF) has provided the basis for continued and stronger cooperation between UNIDO and China within the SSC framework. Both parties agreed, wherever possible, to take into consideration the objective of SSC when designing new IDF projects in the future. In addition to strengthening their cooperation, both parties are actively exploring innovative and pragmatic cooperation within the SSC framework, for which they have agreed to make Africa and LDCs the priority areas. One of the key tangible outcomes from this unique cooperation was the utilization of $2 million from China\u2019s contribution to the IDF, to establish the UNIDO Centre for South-South Industrial Cooperation. This is the second UNIDO establishment of this kind, and it is established in collaboration with the China International Centre for Economic and Technical Exchange (CICETE), 44 which is affiliated to the Ministry of Commerce of China. The focus of the centre will be to foster SSC in the areas of renewable energy, technology and investment promotion. The centre is also mandated to carry out comparative policy research, experience sharing, investment and technology promotion, fund-raising, capacity building and personnel training. Lighting Up Rural Africa: Sharing China\u2019s expertise in small-scale rural electrification China\u2019s experiences in rural small hydropower (SHP) electrification proved that the decentralized development of SHP could be effective for rural energy supply and integrated, sustainable social, environmental and economic development. At present, 97 percent of renewable energy generation in China is from SHP. The electrification rate of townships, villages and households in 653 Primary SHP Rural Electrification counties is 99.9 percent, 99.5 percent and 97.9 percent respectively. SHP is a well-developed technology and usually the most cost-effective solution compared with other energy supply schemes. Such practical technologies and know-how accumulated in China have great potential to be transferred to countries in Africa.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61474587-1051-438e-8bbf-6dfa9b61e9e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "61474587-1051-438e-8bbf-6dfa9b61e9e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1aa20e356797028a03a3034b78fd07f82f28931c6770193d258bac32bc59f353"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc754df6-97a1-4234-b8b5-51125a0f5aa3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0363db765da9d4e20d8d7570ae3436a850e1f35e4fff557c094571d9c272e54c"}}, "hash": "2d178b4698b35d7bbbc20be0db087bb26e14a7f47d27633e54ff4f426e462d49", "text": "Although Africa still faces many critical challenges in the energy sector, especially lack of access in rural areas, low purchasing power and the over-dependence on traditional biomass to meet basic energy needs, most remote rural areas possess abundant SHP resources that can be conducive for replication of successful experiences drawn from pilot projects on a larger scale. 44 CICETE\u2019s main mandate, delegated by the Ministry of Commerce of China, is to coordinate the cooperation between China and the UNDP, UNIDO and United Nations Volunteers", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4acc7415-630a-40aa-8b9d-b1140389c328": {"__data__": {"id_": "4acc7415-630a-40aa-8b9d-b1140389c328", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b669f6e2d80a00720993f9b3958bd932de72917444a0591ce89fdb82cc8fd8b"}, "3": {"node_id": "72fe87ad-b3b2-48a2-b9c1-db10fd112cfb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3e2c3b4fd2f8349d6dd164f8b7a35d574154dbef4d65476dddba9d91c503d63"}}, "hash": "e9ac8af84949904bb1db1410cd203f218699e8bd10e982f9473684cf46324a27", "text": "(UNV), and to undertake the execution of the assisted programmes. Further information can be found at: http://www.cicete.org/ . For further information on China\u2019s aid delivery structure, please refer to Part I, Chapter 1. 95 Against such a background, UNIDO and China have launched the Lighting Up Rural Africa Project, implemented through close collaboration between UNIDO and the Government of China, with the International Centre on Small Hydro Power (IC-SHP) based in Hangzhou, China as the implementing agency. The project aims at combating energy poverty through the setting-up of 100 mini/micro/pico hydropower projects in selected countries in Africa, the strengthening and expansion of the capacities of national institutions for technology transfer, project financing and investment promotion, and information dissemination to a greater number of recipients. As a result of China\u2019s comparative advantage in rural SHP electrification technologies, Lighting Up Rural Africa is becoming one of the key projects within the framework of renewable energy and technology promotion supported by UNIDO. To launch the project, UNIDO conducted the initial formulation for cooperation and the identification of possible recipient countries on the basis of a thorough assessment of their needs, along with a feasibility and environmental impact study. China then tailored its strategy, on a case by case basis, to providing active support to the countries identified within its existing programme of bilateral assistance, using the expertise and capacity of the IC-SHP. Both parties are also making efforts to raise additional funds from various donors for the implementation of SHP projects in Africa. On 23 September 2007, the IC-SHP organized a technical mission led by Professor Tong Jiangdong, the Director-General of the IC-SHP, to three countries in Africa identified by UNIDO, namely Kenya, Madagascar and Namibia. Meetings were held between the IC-SHP delegation and relevant high- ranking government officials from each country to develop an appropriate plan of action to promote SHP development and the productive use of renewable energy in rural areas. In addition, several sites that were visited and evaluated by the IC-SHP team were earmarked for pilot (demonstration) sites of the project. With other relevant value-added services provided by UNIDO\u2019s SSC framework, the SHP field has become an important platform in fostering Chinese-African cooperation on renewable energy and technology, and investment promotion. India First UNIDO Centre for South-South Industrial Cooperation Like its neighbour China, India is one of the rapidly growing economies in Asia, and there is huge potential to promote its achievements in sustainable industrial development to other developing countries. As proof of its commitment to strengthening its cooperation with UNIDO, and to further stimulate SSC, India became the first country to host a UNIDO Centre for South-South Industrial Cooperation. The UNIDO South-South Industrial Cooperation Centre, based in New Delhi, has been in operation since January 2007 45 and has already accumulated a wealth of experience in terms of conceptualizing and developing project proposals that target the developing countries of the South, especially LDCs. The centre strives to create programmes that have clear synergies with India\u2019s comparative advantages. To enhance interaction between developing countries, the centre will: \ufffd exchange expertise and experience; \ufffd facilitate networking with institutions and enterprises; \ufffd replicate best practices to reduce poverty; \ufffd strengthen national and local innovation systems. 45 Refer to Page 58 of the \u2018UNIDO Annual Report 2006\u2019. 96 For these purposes, the Centre will carry out the following activities: \ufffd Design practical and innovative projects to exploit new areas of technical competence and economic opportunity. The emphasis will be on launching projects \u2013 in both established fields and new ones \u2013 with social and economic development potential for LDCs. \ufffd Provide a platform to encourage closer cooperation in policy formulation among developing countries. The aim is to ensure that the LDCs can benefit from the experience of successful strategies in the more-developed ones. Benchmarking will be encouraged between the more developed economies of the South \u2013 China, Brazil, India, and South Africa \u2013 so that through increased productivity, their pace of development can be maintained and strengthened, enabling them to become engines of growth in their respective regions. For this, the centre will network with the UNIDO International Technology Promotion Centres, the Investment and Technology Promotion Offices (ITPOs) and the Africa Investment Promotion Agency Network (AFRIPA-NET).

The objective of this project is to promote the production, processing and use of neem-based products to create eco- friendly or bio-degradable pesticides for farmers, thereby aiding in the development of wasteland and the generation of rural employment, particularly for women. This also reduces farmers\u2019 dependence on expensive chemical pesticides that leave harmful residues in food items. Equivalent projects that were initially tested in India yielded impressive results and warranted the shift to focus on utilizing similar technologies in Africa. The SSC framework facilitated by UNIDO through its Industrial Cooperation Centres has provided India with a unique platform to share its industrial development experiences with other countries of the South. This has resulted in win-win opportunities for both India and the beneficiary countries through the creation of new partnerships and the promotion of technology transfer and investment. China and India South-South Initiative on Cotton The SSC framework can also provide an opportunity for these two pivotal countries to collaborate in sharing their experiences and expertise with other developing countries of the South, especially LDCs. UNIDO\u2019s Director-General launched the South-South Initiative on Cotton as a follow-up to his participation in the High-Level Session on Cotton, organized by the WTO, 15\u201316 March 2007 in Geneva. The meeting took place with ministers from 36 participating African cotton-growing countries. During the meeting, the Group of 20 developing countries (G-20) declared support to the cotton sector in Africa, under Paragraph 12 of the Hong Kong Declaration, 47 in particular to support mechanisms or programmes linked to strengthening the productivity and efficiency of the cotton sector in Africa. 46 Neem oil is a vegetable oil pressed from the fruits and seeds of Neem (Azadirachta indica). 47 The Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration treats cotton specifically under the three pillars of the agriculture negotiations: market access, export subsidies and domestic support: (i) \u201cAll forms of export subsidies for cotton will be eliminated by industrialized countries in 2006.\u201d (Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration, 18 December 2005, WTO document symbol WT/MIN(05)/DEC); (ii) \u201cOn market access, developed countries will give duty and quota free access for cotton exports from LDCs from the commencement of the implementation period.\u201d; (iii) For domestic support (by the far the highest concern for the C-4 countries), the Hong Kong Declaration adds that the reduction for cotton should be more ambitious than for agriculture, and implemented over a shorter period. Also, priority in the negotiations has to be given to cotton. Further information can be found at: http://www.ideascentre.ch/trade-cotton.html. 97 Cotton plays an important role in the economies of many developing countries. Of the 89 countries producing cotton, 83 are developing countries and 30 are classified as LDCs. However, the global cotton industry is complex and not favourable for small farmers in LDCs. It is highly distorted due to government support and subsidies to cotton farmers, which in industrialized countries amounted to $4.7 billion in 2004. Such subsidies encourage subsidized farmers to produce more, and this has the effect of depressing world market prices. Two major issues have had, and will continue to have, profound implications for the future of the cotton industry in developing countries: The abolition of the Multi-Fibre Agreement at the end of 2004 and the growing importance of the global value chain for cotton. The abolition of the Multi-Fibre Agreement will gradually open up new markets, ultimately leading to the intensification of competition among world garment exporters. The growing importance of the global value chain for cotton represents an important strategic option for the cotton industry worldwide and for LDCs, for overcoming the problems associated with commodity dependence through value addition and diversification. Against such a background, UNIDO launched its South-South Initiative on Cotton in 2007. The immediate objective of the initiative is to assist African cotton-producing countries in improving their productive capacities in cotton processing through SSC with China and India.

Indonesia and the Islamic Republic of Iran: New and emerging SSC partners 98 Indonesia: Partnership through the Non-Aligned Movement Centre With a burgeoning economy and one of the biggest populations in South-East Asia, Indonesia recognizes the importance of implementing and promoting sustainable industrial development. It recognizes that growth cannot be maintained unless it promotes a more sustainable form of industrial development that provides productive employment opportunities for poverty alleviation while protecting the environment at the same time. In addition, it recognizes the opportunities that lie within the SSC framework in promoting intra-South sharing of experiences, expertise, technologies and investments. In close partnership with the Indonesian Ministry of Industry and Trade, UNIDO is actively exploring innovative approaches to enhance activities within the SSC framework, with particular focus on LDCs. In December 2007, an MOU strengthening promotion of SSC in the fields of research, technology transfer and investments was signed by the Minister for Industry and Trade and UNIDO. Both the ministry and UNIDO are working together with the Non-Aligned Movement Centre, 48 in cooperation with various stakeholders, to support the South-specific systems of managing and sharing development knowledge, best practices and solutions. The Government of Indonesia and UNIDO have identified work in the following areas, among others: \ufffd exchanging experience in the orientation, formulation and implementation of industrial policy; \ufffd institutional and enterprise networking to enhance productive capacities, and the flow of trade, technology promotion and investments; \ufffd replicating best practices for the reduction of poverty through industrial development and through grassroots innovations that serve as impulses for rural growth; \ufffd strengthening national and local innovation systems; \ufffd enhancing the entrepreneurial and productive capacities of SMEs; and promoting the use of sustainable energy and technologies in industry. The Islamic Republic of Iran: A new partner for South-South industrial cooperation The SSC partnership between the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and UNIDO is a fairly recent development. Due to its strong economic growth, the Islamic Republic of Iran recognizes the need to promote sustainable industrial development both within its national development strategy and across the region. The establishment of closer economic and industrial ties with countries in the South has always been a long-term objective for the Islamic Republic of Iran. As a result, UNIDO\u2019s SSC framework is in synergy to provide the country with a platform to share its experiences and technical expertise, and to collaborate with other countries in the South. Working in close partnership with the Ministry of Industry and Mines, UNIDO hopes to establish a South-South Industrial Cooperation Centre in the near future. To begin with, such a centre would advance the following existing programmes of cooperation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and countries in the South: 1) Expansion of technical cooperation with regional organizations such as the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) for technology transfer, technical capacity building for the 10 member states and development of further trade between the member states; 2) the establishment of a development link between Chengdu in China and Shiraz in the Islamic Republic of Iran; 48 The Non-Aligned Movement Centre aims to contribute to the acceleration and enhancement of national development by strengthening and expanding South-South technical cooperation in the context of international development cooperation.

This is a new development product that combines Japan\u2019s One-Village-One- Product (OVOP) approach and UNIDO\u2019s Cluster and Business Linkages (CBL). One-Village-One-Product is a community-centred, market-driven regional economic development initiative started in Japan in 1979. The underlying concept is that a village promotes a distinctive industry or product in order to attain national or even global market access. This has been very successful in Japan, and through the country\u2019s technical cooperation schemes, it has been adapted and replicated in developing countries in Asia. One of the most successful adaptations has been in Thailand through the One-Tambon-One-Product (OTOP) 49 approach. The UNIDO CBL approach has similar characteristics to OVOP in the sense that it also fosters the local competitive advantage of selected clusters (agglomerations of enterprises producing similar or related goods, where external economies exist and collective productivity gains can be created through joint action) and provides technical assistance in improving production, organization, institutional support and networking within the cluster and along the value chain. While OVOP primarily focuses on marketing the products, especially in the export market, the UNIDO cluster approach focuses on enterprise and networking promotion, participatory community development and building local institutional capabilities of public- and private-sector institutions, especially local governments. The two approaches are therefore complementary and provide a promising opportunity for further developing and scaling up the OVOP concept through the CBL methodologies, which are based on concrete, multi-country experiences over the past 10 years. UNIDO can add value to the OVOP concept by offering its operational tools and training instruments to develop the skills of local policy makers and cluster/OVOP managers. The combination of OVOP and CBL resulted in the One Village Industrial Clusters, which is a new development product being introduced initially to two countries in Africa, namely Uganda and Ethiopia. It is expected that this combined approach will become a powerful strategy to improve the productive capacities and market performance of SMEs in the selected beneficiary countries and those where this will eventually be replicated. The target beneficiaries are artisans and micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs in the selected countries in Africa. The sustained growth of the beneficiaries will help to increase local jobs and bring income and poverty alleviation benefits to their communities. Local and national government officers, public- and private-sector institutions and entrepreneurs will be directly involved in the application or support of the tools that will be used to establish and enhance productive capacities at the local/sub- national level. They will also facilitate market access and generate incomes in local communities. In addition to the UNIDO-Japan partnership, the SSC framework facilitates adding value to the One Village Industrial Clusters by, for instance, tapping into Thailand\u2019s experience and expertise in adapting OVOP into OTOP. This experience with adaptation can help meet the local needs of countries in Africa. It also helps facilitate the involvement of CBL project teams in Africa, Latin America and Asia in the establishment of the combined approach and its application to new countries. 49 \u2018Tambon\u2019 means \u2019sub-district\u2019 in the Thai language. 100 experts from South-East Asia are able to acquire an understanding on how to transfer their lessons learned and adapt their methodologies to countries in Africa. Special emphasis is being given to Thai expertise gained from the application of OTOP in Thailand. The project is helping the selected African countries meet their MDGs in relation to poverty alleviation and sustainable development. Results of the pilot projects\u2019 implementation are being monitored, reviewed and conceptualized with a view to replication in other countries in Africa. The project objectives are in line with UNIDO\u2019s strategic priorities in relation to poverty reduction through productive activities and SSC. Conclusion In an increasingly complex and fast-changing world, elements of globalization are seeping into every corner of society. The issue of social, environmental and economic sustainability is growing in importance in every realm. The need to identify the delicate balance between growth and sustainable development is becoming more urgent everywhere, but especially for the developing countries of the South.

The question as to whether all activities between developing countries constitute SSC or whether all regional cooperation is SSC is relevant. If the answer is yes, that would render SSC such a broad concept that it would be unworkable. The uncertainty about what programmes constitute SSC manifests itself in tentative descriptions of programmes by various countries in the case studies. The definitions are not the same from country to country, and the lack of clarity provides room for alternative definitions, one of which is that SSC is donor assistance from one developing country to another. In this regard, this publication suggests a definition based on the objectives of SSC. If a country designs a programme or dialogue or provides assistance \u2013 be it in trade, the environment, concessional lending, capacity development or grant provision \u2013 and if the target is other developing countries, then that should be regarded as SSC. In other words, the normal trade among developing countries without concessions is southern trade but not necessarily SSC. Such a clarification could be made by the UN Conference on South-South Cooperation proposed to take place in 2009 in Nairobi. The case studies of the country and regional South-South strategies and delivery mechanisms, the multilateral agency programmes and Triangular Cooperation show that SSC and Triangular Cooperation are multifaceted. In the literature on SSC there is a tendency to superficially enumerate the benefits without analyzing the challenges. The benefits accrue to different levels of society, and expectations differ. Some of the evaluations of SSC programmes have resulted in unfavourable or controversial conclusions. The question arises as to whether the same methods of evaluation should be used for South-South and Triangular Cooperation as any other programme. Since the objectives and expectations for SSC differ from other programmes, success indicators should be designed to accommodate these different objectives and goals. Each situation is different, and a one-size-fits-all approach will not work for SSC. Modalities such as Triangular Cooperation have to be flexible and negotiated between the various potential stakeholders. In this regard, there should be an attempt to provide evaluation guidelines for SSC that take into account the objectives of the specific programme. Only a few large countries such as China and India are able to provide assistance in infrastructure, South-South tariff preference schemes and debt relief. For most countries the modality of SSC is technical exchanges for capacity development. It is difficult to assess the tangible benefits of capacity development, and yet this is the core of SSC. For this reason, SSC may be underrated in LDCs, whereas experiences from fast-growth Asian countries show the need to strengthen capacity development through education, training and firsthand experience that includes learning exchanges.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12fd36d6-9fae-4f18-871f-f223e62b3eab": {"__data__": {"id_": "12fd36d6-9fae-4f18-871f-f223e62b3eab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Networking and Learning Together: Experiences in South-South and Triangular Cooperation in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c39c5b115c9e091e27b5b4c8ca6c8d8d52eaa722d982db708bab1217c4528d6"}, "2": {"node_id": "26f412d0-8188-4e26-837a-23333010a698", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/networking-and-learning-together-experiences-south-south-and-triangular-cooperation-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e30e9abb48406d70f963d42b126dee84f8339c9bcf58c298e4ef05acb220254"}}, "hash": "1a55480624abead98a54668b40ba12e4fa5c6248dbcaef35aaf07d393bbb48f1", "text": "Stronger leadership by developing countries and participation by senior officials in programme implementation and monitoring, as in the JARCOM experience, will facilitate the achievement of tangible results.

This would spread the coordination costs among a number of partners and reduce the cost of delivering the programmes. Herein lies a possible greater role for multilateral agencies to facilitate the multi-donor framework. As in JARCOM, such facilitation could be bringing together the demand and supply for SSC services. The SU-SSC or other multilateral agencies would put a programme together, such as the United Nations Development Assistance Framework. This could be done for a group of countries at the regional level. The countries intent on providing assistance would then contribute. For example, a multi-donor framework for countries that want to strengthen their customs management could be supported by other developing countries and by industrialized countries through Triangular 103 Cooperation. Most SSC will remain bilateral. If the facilitation is based at regional level, then the concern will be intra- and inter-regional SSC. Triangular Cooperation offers scope for industrialized countries to harness the more recent and relevant experiences of developing countries. Analysis shows that Triangular Cooperation cannot simply be understood as a developed country handing over financial resources to a third party to deliver technical assistance. The developed country, concerned about the achievement of results, may realize that both the third party and the beneficiary are not putting in resources that will enable the achievement of results. A framework has to be negotiated between the various potential stakeholders, and agreements signed, including the split of costs between the stakeholders. The aid-delivery institutions for the new development partners all need strengthening, particularly in terms of data gathering for the assistance provided, as well as skills and modes for transferring the technology and skills they have. They can benefit from the accumulated experiences, know-how and lessons learned from the nearly 60 years\u2019 experience of northern donors. There is a role for northern donors to play in the institutional capacity development of new development partners. It should be noted however, that northern donors should resist the temptation to demand compliance to the existing norms and guidelines for development assistance. A number of countries have development cooperation agencies and strategic frameworks to strengthen their development cooperation. They have also established some informal forums for exchanging experiences. Such efforts could also be supported by a multi-donor framework. It is worth noting that developing countries have supported the South-South Global Assets and Technology Exchange (SS GATE) spearheaded by the SU-SSC as a mechanism for the transfer of technology among developing countries. 50 On the broader question of donor practices, the JARCOM chapter shows that in working with new development partners, Japan has gained the patience to allow them to develop their own systems. Arguing that they should simply follow the DAC guidelines that have evolved over the last 40 years in fact shows the strengths and weaknesses that the new development donors need to address. On the one hand, these guidelines are well established and easy to follow. On the other hand, there are still questions as to why the aid has not been effective. Therefore, the emerging donors may be effective in their own approaches. An eventual complementary approach, rather than strict compliance to DAC principles, should be encouraged through a formalized dialogue. Some programmes within the regional cooperation groups aim to benefit less developed members of the groups. An example is the IAI. In fact, this is an example of a multi-donor framework involving the more developed ASEAN members as well as industrialized countries. This case study suggests that strengthening existing mechanisms at the regional level is a helpful strategy to deepen SSC. The ESCAP South-South Disaster Project in particular shows an effort by a donor (GTZ) and UN institutions to pull back and let countries take ownership through Indonesia\u2019 coordination. In this way, the major stakeholders that countries consider important for the project\u2019s success are included, and the project has a chance of being sustained beyond the support of the donor and the UN. The SU- SSC would therefore do well to cultivate stronger facilitation for multi-donor-supported SSC within the regional institutions and, conversely, the regional institutions should be open to the facilitation. This publication has focused a great deal on the supply side of SSC activities. It is suggested that a sequel to this should focus on the users and recipients of SSC. Although technically, under SSC, any country can be a user or recipient in one area and a supplier in an area of competency, this publication shows the clear emergence of \u2018pivotal countries\u2019 and that new countries eventually emerge as suppliers. 50 See South-South Gate at: http://ssc.undp.org/SS-GATE.8.0.html.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8aa7459-9012-4f94-aa40-ac6438df6f68": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8aa7459-9012-4f94-aa40-ac6438df6f68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting: Operationalising Regional and National HDRs in Policies and Programmes", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90272c27d51d5399446f0e237367ba47254e20f77a2d40eabe6010ea9048390f"}, "3": {"node_id": "dc2a3096-21b3-410f-83d1-6925af4f6eaf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "866f6c49cc172262c0309ae44b7b57c51662bc2d3355a667228a7535a1dba104"}}, "hash": "68952b935f847cbbaec3d8709002d216d28b2a58a14cb0d9b65c0ea69fd00fe4", "text": "24-26 September 2003 Colombo, Sri Lanka Report of the UNDP Training Workshop Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting Operationalising Regional and National HDRs in Policies and Programmes APRI ASIA PACIFIC Regional Human Development Reports Initiative REGIONAL BUREAU FOR ASIA AND PACIFIC Operationalising Regional and National HDRs in Policies and Programmes 24-26 September 2003 Colombo, Sri Lanka APRI ASIA PACIFIC Regional Human Development Reports Initiative REGIONAL BUREAU FOR ASIA AND PACIFIC Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting Report of the UNDP Training Workshop Contents Abbreviations iv 1.

This was an initiative under UNDP\u2019s Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific (RBAP). Workshop Objectives The workshop was conceived as a platform for cross- country sharing and collective exploration of critical concepts and issues of human development (HD). The workshop was intended to provide participants an opportunity to strengthen their perspectives on the human development approach, share experiences and learn from regional best practices, and collectively evolve strategies for translating messages of Human Development Reports (HDRs) into programmes and policy directions. The workshop was to primarily focus on two key areas: exploring connections and developing strategies between human development reporting and policy interventions in key practice areas; strengthening synergies on human development reporting and progress on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The workshop\u2019s objectives were to: \ufffd Clarify basic concepts and methodology of human development reporting. \ufffd Explore the limitations/difficulties of conceptualising and measuring the quantitative and qualitative aspects of human development. \ufffd Take stock of the utility of HDRs as tools for development, and also as ends in themselves. \ufffd Explore ways to help translate human development concepts into policy commitments and programme interventions, using tools such as the Strategic Results Framework (SRF). \ufffd Identify possible points of convergence and synergy between the process of human development reporting and progress on MDGs. \ufffd Facilitate experience sharing and identification of successful strategies on use of HDRs for advocacy and policy inputs. Participants Two participants consisting of National Human Development Report (NHDR) focal point and Programme Officers from the 24 Asia Pacific UNDP Country Offices were invited to the training workshop. However the final decision on participants was taken by the Country Offices and based on a demand from the COs, some national government representatives and research institutes involved in NHDR preparation were also invited to the workshop. The workshop was finally attended by 30 participants from 15 UNDP COs in Asia and the Pacific \u2014 Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, East Timor, Republic of Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, 1 UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 2 Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Samoa, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Government representatives from three countries \u2014 Bhutan, Cambodia and Sri Lanka \u2014 also participated. In addition, participants included representatives of research institutions involved in the production of HDRs from Samoa, Republic of Korea and Sri Lanka. A multi-disciplinary team of resource persons from the RBAP, Human Development Report Office (HDRO), New York, Sub-Regional Resource Facility (SURF), Kathmandu, UNDP\u2019s Oslo Governance Centre (OGC), UNDP Colombia, and other experts facilitated the workshop (see Annexure 1 for complete list of participants). The workshop was inaugurated by Mr. R. M. K. Ratnayake, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Sri Lanka. The inaugural was also addressed by Mr. Miguel Bermeo-Estella, Resident Representative, UNDP Sri Lanka. The concluding session was chaired by Ms.Christine Spoerel, Deputy Resident Representative (Programme), UNDP, Sri Lanka CO. Workshop Evaluation At the end of the workshop an evaluation form (see Annexure 2) was circulated among all the participants to seek their views on the overall structure and content of the workshop and on ways in which it could be improved further. The overall feedback from the participants can be listed as follows: What participants liked : \ufffd Good interactivity and participatory methods; \ufffd Excellent facilitation, good flow and dynamics; \ufffd Flexibility in accommodating concerns and priorities of the participants; \ufffd Good balance between experts and experience; \ufffd Good distribution of guidelines for different sessions; \ufffd Integration of HD with cross-cutting issues, i.e., gender and trade; \ufffd Clarifying distinction between HDRs and MDGRs; \ufffd Experience sharing across countries (challenges and solutions) and time to reflect and debate on HD; \ufffd Comments of government participants; \ufffd Understanding the complications regarding the methodology, data and indexing; \ufffd Advocacy potential of HDRs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34604f56-cd16-4013-b3b3-158e75b5108f": {"__data__": {"id_": "34604f56-cd16-4013-b3b3-158e75b5108f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting: Operationalising Regional and National HDRs in Policies and Programmes", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "122d503e9b6b5dc03c9aef71220254f64f6465bad794d001bc73716361928c7c"}, "2": {"node_id": "dce1186e-83dd-4aeb-b368-96f1ed77adda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d35e75a63d5b87b90527ca5cdffa551c9896410d5caa9bcf9e9f68c63205ce0"}}, "hash": "ee2f02685ea75767cdaaab1623a9107e958f150c64b93df90c136fd39e8188f6", "text": "Suggestions by participants for improvement : \ufffd Encourage all speakers to provide copies of presentations; \ufffd Include group exercise using a real HDR; \ufffd Distribute all training material in hard copies (CDs were provided); \ufffd Provide copies of HDRs from participating countries and good examples; \ufffd Would like to have time to hear from all countries; \ufffd More specific \u2018How to do\u2019 sessions; \ufffd More time needed for measurement and data issues; \ufffd Longer duration for more interactive sessions, meeting colleagues, sightseeing, etc.; \ufffd Checklist for mainstreaming HD could be developed; \ufffd Schedule was too tight; \ufffd More time needed for breaks; \ufffd Mixed reaction to philosophical/conceptual aspects of discussion.

UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 3 Day 1 24 September 2003 Inauguration Human Development in Sri Lanka The workshop was inaugurated by Mr. R. M. K. Ratnayake, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Sri Lanka. In his inaugural address Mr. Ratnayake welcomed participants to the training workshop which, he said, provided an important opportunity for governments and institutions to share experiences and address challenges in human development reporting. Sri Lanka was an ideal location as it has established an excellent social development record since the 1950s and has reached developed country standards in Human Development Indicators (HDIs). International comparisons of HD have shown that Sri Lanka has achieved a level of HD well above its per capita income level. Mr. Ratnayake recalled that Sri Lanka ranked 83rd among 130 countries in 1990. However, civil strife destroyed the HD infrastructure and services, bringing the country down to the 99th position among 175 countries in 2003. He added that Sri Lanka has achieved an impressive record in health and education as the result of a combination of strong and proactive health, education and social policies that were implemented early in the country\u2019s process. At the same time, regional patterns of HD in Sri Lanka show substantial variation in all indicators and such disparities are more intense in rural and remote parts of the country. The government in Sri Lanka is fully committed to overcoming HD challenges and providing social and economic opportunities to all citizens. He wished every success to the training workshop over the next three days. 2 UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 4 The Development of HDRs In his special address, Mr. Miguel Bermeo-Estrella, Resident Representative, UNDP, Sri Lanka, welcomed the participants and was pleased that UNDP colleagues from 15 COs of Asia and the Pacific were present. He also welcomed development partners from ministries, universities, and other organisations who play an important role in driving the HD agenda forward. He thanked the APRI, HDRC, New Delhi for their efforts in preparing for the workshop and congratulated them on having put together an interesting and important agenda. During the 1990s, the HDR developed into UNDP\u2019s signature product, and gained global recognition as an independent tool for advocating human development. The NHDRs and Regional Human Development Reports (RHDRs) are tools that extend and deepen analysis to examine more local concerns. RHDRs can effectively address issues \u2014 such as HIV/ AIDS or Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) \u2014 that concern several countries, generating regional debate and cross-country collaboration. The first Sri Lankan HDR was prepared in 1998 and highlighted some of the regional disparities within the country. But due to the then active conflict, large areas of the country were not covered in the report. Five years have passed and, in terms of preparing a second HDR, timing and political sensitivity are critical. In this context he felt that it was particularly relevant and timely to learn and discuss how HD can be studied, presented and advocated. A Tool for Accountability and Advocacy Mr. B. Murali, Programme Specialist, Regional Programme Division, RBAP, New York, explained that the workshop was meant to share best practices and explore critical HD concepts and issues. This was a key initiative of the RBAP, using regional programme resources to support capacity building in COs. He added that the concept of indices and measurement and, particularly, ranking of countries has converted the HDR into a tool for accountability and advocacy for HD and formulation of pro-poor policies and development planning. There is an immense need for training and capacity building to realise the full potential of the HDR as a powerful policy tool. Emphasising the importance of RHDRs, Mr. Murali said they bridge the gap between global and national HDRs. They highlight regional perspectives and help exchange knowledge and experiences between countries. MDGs and MDG Reports (MDGRs) are now the new focus in the Asia-Pacific region which is very much on track to achieve the target of producing one MDGR for each country before the deadline of 2004. He concluded by saying that emerging trends clearly indicate that the Asia-Pacific, particularly South Asia, will not achieve the human poverty reduction targets; therefore HDRs have a major role to play in evolving policies that are people-centred and pro-poor.

UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 5 Introduction to Workshop Design Facilitator \u2014 Kalyani Menon-Sen, UNDP, India The workshop was designed to include learning in three different areas: 1. Working together to advance our conceptual understanding and approach, particularly in the context of global and national development goals. 2. Sharing experiences and discussing practical challenges in developing HDRs and operationalising them. 3. Moving ahead to evolve strategies for building synergies between HD reporting and other UNDP work. The facilitator said that the presence of practitioners among the participants would help in learning and bringing about a consensus on HD understanding. The participants then introduced themselves and described their areas of work. HDRs: History, Concepts and Principles Chair: Marcia de Castro, HDRO, New York Speakers: Omar Noman, RBAP, New York A. K. Shiva Kumar, UNICEF, India The Chair, Ms. Marcia de Castro, introduced Mr. Omar Noman and Mr. A.K. Shiva Kumar. The former was with the HDRO and has now joined the RBAP. He has been deeply involved in the production of global HDRs. The latter is an adviser to UNICEF and has worked with UNDP in different capacities. He has evaluated a number of MDGRs and has edited the book, Readings in Human Development. Origin and Operational Aspects Starting the session, Mr. Omar Noman traced the origin of HDRs to the efforts of Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen. In countries like Afghanistan there was growing awareness of the NHDR\u2019s use as an instrument to ensure governmental accountability. He pointed out that both the UN General Assembly and the recent Cancun meeting had raised some very important HD issues and highlighted the following seven operational problems of HDRs: 1. There is no distinct set of economic policies related to achieving human development. 2. There is a lot that still needs to be done to turn HDRs into programming instruments. 3. HDR 2002, in particular, presents conceptual issues that are difficult to implement. 4. When HDRs advocate against those in power, the sense of operationalisation is not concrete. He argued that the HDRs should be allowed the freedom to raise non-operational issues as well. 5. At the global level, there is a growing interest in HDRs for strengthening democracy without advocating regime change. 6. There is tension between HDI and HD since the HDI has become a powerful political tool. However, it misses the political and human rights issues, which are an integral part of the HD concept. 7. National, regional and global HDRs have consistently identified and opposed discrimination of all kinds \u2013 such as discrimination based on gender or poverty or regional inequities. This has been a major contribution of the HDRs and has affected policy. Concept and Impact Mr. A.K. Shiva Kumar, in his presentation, listed seven aspects related to the HD concept: 1.

It was interpreted not merely as security of territories but as security of people. The real challenge is to retain simplicity of communication in HDRs. 3. The HD concept has changed the way we look at policies. It helps us see how policies affect the quality of life of people. It goes beyond provision of commodities. For example, education does not mean just the number of schools that exist, but is about the actual process used and the benefits that actually reach the people. 4. The HDI has often been criticised; but the importance of data in making a point cannot be ignored. At the same time, data does not reveal everything and there is a need to use enough description about what lies behind the numbers. 5. Discussion of human rights in the HD discourse is important. The human rights perspective reinforces the fact that one needs to give priority to the worst off. These are the people who generally get left out. The human rights perspective helps in addressing the question: \u2018How are we to reach the worst off and deprived sections?\u2019 6. HDRs have argued that civil and political rights are as important as economic and social rights. Now the consensus is that one has to include all sections of society for the sustainability and quality of interventions. Prof. Sen says that unfair exclusion is as serious as unjust inclusion. There is a need to make the development process participatory through genuine inclusion. 7. Regarding the question of development effectiveness, when one judges institutions through the HD perspective, the question that arises would be: \u201cAre their interventions sustainable, participatory and how are the benefits being distributed?\u201d HDRs are one way of starting to adopt the HD perspective that can further trickle down into other initiatives. In the discussion following the two presentations, some participants said that certain topics could not be taken up in HDRs since government involvement was high. To address this problem it was suggested that the language could be modified or the issues could be taken up in a regional, rather than national, HDR. Mapping and Measuring Human Development: Concepts, Indicators and Data Issues K. Seeta Prabhu, HDRC, UNDP, India Ms. K. Seeta Prabhu, Head, HDRC, UNDP, India, made a presentation on mapping and measuring HD. She said that human development is a broad concept and operationalising HD is a challenge. Some of the indices developed by UNDP and used in the global report are the HDI which measures attainments, the Gender Development Index (GDI) which highlights existing inequalities between men and women, the Human Poverty Index (HPI) which addresses deprivation and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) which highlights empowerment. Ms. Prabhu spoke of the often-debated differences between the NHDRs and the MDGRs. She said that despite successful attempts at indexing HD, there are crucial aspects \u2013 such as political, economic and social freedoms, opportunities for being creative and productive, enjoying personal self respect and guaranteed human rights \u2014 that have been excluded from the HDI. Some national and regional HDRs, however, have attempted to index these as well; examples are the Human Governance Index (HGI) by the South Asia RHDR 1999 and the Health Risk Index (HRI) by the China HDR 2002. She identified the conventional sources of data such as the census, the National Sample Surveys (NSSs), civil registration systems, and the constraints related to each of the sources. Some of the major data-related challenges faced by HDRs are: \ufffd Unplanned demands for data on a wide range of indicators. \ufffd Rising tendency towards global reporting. UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 7 \ufffd Increasing demands for sub-national data. \ufffd Need for monitoring progress on HD indicators. \ufffd The changing profile of data users such as Non- Governmental Organisations (NGOs), citizens\u2019 groups and people\u2019s organisations. Some important data-related issues are: \ufffd What indicators and whose indicators are we talking about? \ufffd Which definition should one follow \u2014 global, national or people\u2019s definition? \ufffd Who collects, who owns and who reports data? \ufffd Should HD approach extend to data collection, reporting and dissemination?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49d0a0eb-ed1c-4597-8cb7-12f80238ea75": {"__data__": {"id_": "49d0a0eb-ed1c-4597-8cb7-12f80238ea75", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting: Operationalising Regional and National HDRs in Policies and Programmes", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b6b4eabbc7b834a8bafd70facfba210e68a5d2a12bc7a2bcd2a8e87a189f006"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1abe701-edc6-451a-a0a8-ca245773a768", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18e9825552adaf1e9ea138dd6e7fb4c5061f77bf12c6dd3ffcf23c6cb9812043"}}, "hash": "1ed79d7aeb8f135cc6afd4e17413494d70f55c5294dad5d354e031425aeacb99", "text": "\ufffd Should HD approach extend to data collection, reporting and dissemination?

He said that an armed conflict is the first obstacle to human security and development, and emphasised the problems faced in collecting data in conflict zones. Citing his experience with the preparation of the Colombia NHDR, he said there is a complex relation between HD and armed conflict which raises measurement problems. HDI at present does not capture conflict-related dimensions and hence there is a need to modify it. To measure the impact of conflict there is a need to go beyond the HDI. In Colombia, the HDI was adjusted with violence (homicide rates) to incorporate the conflict aspect. The HDI for 61 countries was recalculated after including the aspect of violence. A conflict degradation index to assess the impact on different vulnerable groups was also calculated. This analysis helped in understanding conflict through the HD lens. Based on this multi-dimensional analysis policy, recommendations in 14 different areas were made in the Colombia NHDR. b) Data Collection and Indexing Ms. Anuradha Rajivan complemented Ms. Prabhu\u2019s presentation by highlighting the fact that national data systems focus on economic data, which are monitorable and quantifiable and are collected at regular and timely intervals. She said that the currently fashionable data, such as mortality, are not collected and are sometimes not feasible for collection due to various technical problems. There is a need to strengthen statistical systems. She pointed out a tendency to measure what is easy to measure; aspects like human rights and governance are not easily quantified. More and more HDRs are getting to be thematic. On issues such as ICT, assumptions of effectiveness are sometimes made. For example, there is no clear evidence that ICT has actually had an impact on HD since the applications part of data collection has never been part of the statistical machinery. In ICT, the content of data available is more important than simply its availability. In terms of HDI and its methodology, there have been debates on the combination of stock and flow indicators in one index, and the problem of multicollinearity within variables in an index. At the same time, the HD concept is much wider than the index. The nature of any indexing, whether it be the HDI or the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is enormous simplification but the uniqueness of the HDI lies in the challenge it poses to economics inherent in the traditional GDP. c) Discussion of Presentations Mr. Gamini de Silva, Director, Department of Census and Statistics, Sri Lanka, said that statistical systems face a problem of coordination among agencies collecting data. Data should largely be used to substantiate one\u2019s arguments. Mr. R. Sudarshan, Advisor-Justice, OGC, Oslo, said that apart from substantiating certain arguments, data are also important in helping policy makers make policy decisions. At the same time, not every detail of human UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 8 life can be measured by quantifying it; hence one should not overemphasise the need for data. Ms. Ana Gaby Guerrero, Programme Analyst, UNDP, Laos, raised the issue of low statistical capacity in the country and constraints on resources available for this purpose. Because of lack of data some definitions, such as the level of poverty, have been localised to simplify compilation of data. In the Philippines, NHDR preparation is being used to build the capacity of data collectors and local people in collecting and analysing data. Ms. Rajivan concluded that there is a need to involve the statistical systems before making high demands for non-conventional data. At the end of this session, participants indicated that they had several data-related questions. There was a general demand for a separate session to address these issues. NHDR Process: Country Experiences This session consisted of an exercise in small groups and discussion in plenary. The participants were divided into four groups. Ms. Kalyani Menon-Sen, Consultant, UNDP, India, explained that the break out groups would discuss NHDR experiences according to specific guidelines. Country teams were to share their national experiences of the HD reporting process. Based on the presentations, the group should discuss the following questions: \ufffd What are the benefits of national HD reporting for UNDP as a whole? \ufffd How can the impacts of HD reporting be measured at the national level? \ufffd What are the challenges in HD reporting at the national level?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc2dd8b8-6765-4c48-aac6-1408c3551118": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc2dd8b8-6765-4c48-aac6-1408c3551118", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting: Operationalising Regional and National HDRs in Policies and Programmes", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "132ef89fb576f1da89ccf723de602d293a5728a8593edfe9f67d697d70219fe4"}, "2": {"node_id": "f55b715f-dabe-43fa-929b-e3be8965f44a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c1e1b54b3a456a12613819b575721ea5b46e453094424f759c855c9d78fad60"}}, "hash": "38c82e200b466ed464d43df98f979c406e42968439f674a753d3e9b43768d2ad", "text": "\ufffd What are the challenges in HD reporting at the national level?

The Cambodian experiences with NHDRs can be classified into two types: one, from 1997 to 1999, when an international expert worked with the Ministry of Planning to prepare the report; and the second, from 2001 onwards, when the focus was on core national teams of ten persons including an international expert. The reports were written in the local language as well as English. Afghanistan is in the process of launching its first NHDR and has set up an advisory panel composed of only national staff, selected according to specific criteria; an international expert has been involved to support the national team. The issue of independent analysis vs. national ownership was discussed in detail in the group. The group also said that dissemination was a big problem. Once the NHDR was published there was hardly any dissemination or follow up and the process came to an end. Without UNDP\u2019s support there was no mechanism to continue the process or make it sustainable. Afghanistan, for example, has established a human resource centre in the UNDP office but the question was whether it could sustain itself without UNDP\u2019s support. The participants suggested that UNDP should establish a network to support the COs in getting good consultants and developing in-house capacity as well, rather than completely rely on international experts. b) China, Maldives, Nepal and Laos The group discussed the fact that management arrangements are different for different countries. Some important challenges faced by COs are balancing independence with ownership and involving other stakeholders such as NGOs and civil society. The group also voiced concern over the fact that the report is largely UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 9 seen as a UNDP product and in some cases as the government\u2019s. In Maldives, for example, there was need to seek government approval. It was difficult to assess how NHDRs, and other office documents such as UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) and Common Country Assessment (CCA), were linked to each other. Discussing the impact of NHDRs the group indicated that in Nepal HD was used as the basis for measuring progress and in China the third NHDR had an important impact on public administration reforms. c) Bhutan, East Timor, Myanmar and Samoa The group thought there was a danger of report fatigue, as there were too many reports being produced. There was agreement that it was useful to have an NHDR but it should not be seen as just a UNDP product; it should have policy implications as well. Among the group members, Bhutan has produced one NHDR, Samoa is about to start the process, Myanmar has one internal report and East Timor also has one report. The nature of government is also different from country to country, and there may be pushes and pulls within government ministries. In East Timor, the concept of HD is mainstreamed into the thinking of the new government and high budgetary allocations are made for education and health. However, data is a major challenge and in this respect there may be something to be learnt from Samoa where statisticians are involved in the team. d) Sri Lanka, Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines Sri Lanka has had one report in 1998, which concentrated on overall HD aspects and gave the regional profile. The University of Colombo team was largely responsible for its preparation and for inclusion of some of the conflict-affected areas. The attempt was to provide indices at the district level. MDG has now taken off the ground and gathered momentum. Thailand has produced the report in 1999 and 2002. Media coverage of the reports has been good. In South Korea, the NHDR was prepared through the Institute of Health and Sociology and helped in promoting women\u2019s participation in parliament. This report was on gender and was published in the local language; however, there was no advocacy or follow up. The Philippines has produced three NHDRs: in 1997 on gender, in 2000 on education, and in 2002 on unemployment. The country also has a Human Development Network which is primarily responsible for producing the reports. The respect enjoyed by the report is encouraging and the CO is looking forward to coverage of issues such as human population, human security and environment in the upcoming NHDRs. All the countries in the group raised common issues such as participation vs. quality of report, autonomy vs. ownership of HDRs and problem of data gaps in statistical systems.

There were a number of suggestions on measuring and monitoring impact, and for a data clinic in small groups as there had been many queries about data. Participants asked for more time to share country experiences. Relevance of HDRs in a Changing World R. Sudarshan, OGC, Oslo Marcia de Castro, HDRO, New York Philosophy of HD Mr. R. Sudarshan discussed the philosophical basis of the HD concept through the ideas of Aristotle and Emanuel Kant, as used and defined in the HDRs. The two philosophers differ in the way they define the human self. Aristotle defines the human being as a member of a community and his or her identity would depend on the relationship with others. In Kantian theory the individual self is autonomous and is considered his/her own legislator. Thus there is a basic tension about how to view the human self. The concept of HD cannot come purely from economics and has also to draw on anthropology, sociology and political science. It would not be fair to compartmentalise it into a single discipline. The input of intellectual nourishment into the HD concept has to continue. The national and other HDRs need not simply conform to the pattern of the global HDRs. Mr. Sudarshan further pointed out that the HDRs have addressed different issues such as social inclusion and also more fashionable issues such as technologies. The record of HDRs has however been somewhat mixed. Some have been received very well and have covered all aspects of a subject while some have been very sketchy. Nonetheless, the enterprise is a challenging one and the more challenging the world becomes the more seriously we have to engage in this enterprise. Focus and Relevance Ms. Marcia de Castro, Policy Advisor, HDRO, New York, on the subject of \u2018Relevance of HDRs in a changing world\u2019, said that there is currently a very unfavourable international scenario. Issues such as terrorism, security and uneven economic status, have made the task of development agencies highly challenging. Development practitioners need to plan the use of resources and the way in which public policy will be influenced. A very important contribution of the HDRs has been the focus on deprivation and exclusion, which is closely related to the phenomenon of globalisation. There is a need to follow the idea of thinking global and acting local. There is a need to share visions and find locally relevant solutions and actors. There is a greater linkage now with the private sector which is being included in development work to a larger extent. The role of the state is very important; it has to be a democratic state and a more inclusive one. Public sector reforms need to be taken up in order to improve the role of the state. Regional issues need to be focused upon for more even development across a country. There is a need for more socially responsible private and public institutions. 3 UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 11 Responses by Representatives of the Governments of Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Cambodia Moderator: Christine Spoerel, UNDP, Sri Lanka Guidelines for country presentations were circulated by e-mail prior to the workshop (See Annexure 4) Bhutan Mr. Jigme Nidup from the Royal Government of Bhutan listed the main policy documents produced in the country as: \ufffd Vision 2020. \ufffd National Plan documents every five years. \ufffd MDG reports. \ufffd Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs). The B-HDR serves as a basis for other documents and formulation of plan documents is based on HDRs. The HDR, produced with the help of UNDP, is owned completely by the government. The HD approach is accepted to a certain extent in Bhutan. The main users of the HDR are government agencies, international agencies and researchers. To some extent the HDR has an impact on national policies and serves as their basis. In public discourse, the HDR is itself a topic of discussion. Bhutan is taking HDI as the basis to analyse happiness. So far, the HDR has had no unforeseen negative impact. Cambodia Main policy documents: \ufffd The Socio-economic Development Plan (SEDP) II 2001-2005, consisting of the 41st vision: Poverty Reduction, and the 44 Development Objectives to be achieved. \ufffd The three-year rolling Public Investment Programme (PIP) to assist line ministries in implementing the national plan. \ufffd The National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) 2003-2005, as required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4cc4078-4527-4df0-ac3d-171382459d85": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4cc4078-4527-4df0-ac3d-171382459d85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting: Operationalising Regional and National HDRs in Policies and Programmes", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32357db3bdbff98a578a40b797e03f0cf4942803df13fa0050b73003416b6451"}}, "hash": "32357db3bdbff98a578a40b797e03f0cf4942803df13fa0050b73003416b6451", "text": "World Bank (WB). \ufffd The Cambodia MDGR 2003, supported by UNDP, to be approved by the government early next month (October 2003). \ufffd The National Perspective Plan (NPP) approved by government last month (August 2003). UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 12 \ufffd Other sectoral strategy plans. Cambodia perceives the role of HDR as describing the state of HD in the country, not as making policy recommendations. HDR is similar to other policy documents in that they all describe/analyse the situation of HD in the country. The difference lies in the fact that HDR does not make policy recommendations; this is the preserve of policy documents. The ownership of government in HDR is still limited because of lack of analytical skill among government staff, financial constraints and the need for guidance from international consultants as well as technical and financial support from UNDP. Regarding the HD perspective in policy documents, HDR provides complementary information for national policy making. The HD approach is widely accepted in the country and HDR receives support from line ministries, provincial authorities, donors, NGOs, and civil society through participation in the Advisory Committee (AC). The main users of HDR are government ministries, donor agencies, NGOs, researchers and media. The different kinds of use include policymaking, planning of activities, training of field staff and community workers at grass roots level. HDR has had no negative impact on national policy and information from HDR is a signal for policy makers to consider and address problems. In terms of public discourse, there is technical discussion of HDR in the AC and wide dissemination through national workshops, especially during the International Day for Poverty Eradication. Sri Lanka The country representative, responding to the discussion in his personal capacity, said that the HDR at the global level is much talked about but when it comes to the local level only the ranking claims attention and ranks are over emphasised. The national reports are important at the local level; but in Sri Lanka the HDR just replicated the HDI attempt and did not get much attention. There has to be an annual progress review document. The national bank of Sri Lanka produces one for the national economy. We need such a document for HD as well, covering both quantitative and qualitative aspects. This would help in monitoring development progress at regular intervals. Discussion Responding to the presentations all participants agreed that the HDRs did prove to be an important tool for providing policy recommendations. Even in the new global and local scenarios, HDRs have an important role to play. At the same time, participants expressed concern that too much emphasis on preparation of HDRs may lead to \u2018report fatigue\u2019. The issue of the quality of NHDRs was also discussed. If the report is prepared with a focus and provides clear policy guidelines, governments would definitely take the HDRs seriously. Enhancing the Policy Impact of HDRs Participants were divided into four break-out groups and provided with a brief for discussion. This was followed by presentations from each group based on the points listed in the brief for break out groups (see Annexure 5). Points Made during Group Presentations a) Theme Selection \ufffd Different countries have different issues and contexts and so it is difficult to follow one consistent process to prepare an HDR. \ufffd Themes are based on the national agenda, but include global issues relevant to the national scenario. \ufffd One has to be careful while picking sensitive topics such as conflict and HIV/AIDS. Sri Lanka is currently entering the peace process and there is a need to link the HDR with that as well as with MDGs. Cambodia\u2019s next theme is \u2018HIV/AIDS: current reality, availability of data and impact on policy\u2019. b) Development of Content and Consultative Processes \ufffd The need is to first formulate HDRs and prepare the ground. \ufffd There is also a need to check the relevance of the HDR in the local context. Cultural differences and the political context should be taken into account. \ufffd In some cases the process is participatory, while in others it is decided internally. Ideally, participation should be widespread, but this raises the crucial question of who owns the report. UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 13 \ufffd What should the report do? The HDR should not be pushing certain policy options but should highlight issues and facts to advocate certain positions that can be taken. c) Selection of Authors \ufffd In some countries the work is done by national or international consultants. India and Nepal have national consultants.

Now the project is closed and there is a funding problem. \ufffd Sri Lanka outsourced to the University of Colombo; East Timor had a steering committee with participation from the Planning Ministry and UNDP; Cambodia worked through the Ministry of Planning. The AC in Cambodia included the government. \ufffd Local capacity building through UNDP is needed for long-term sustainability. However, funding and financing of such capacity building is a critical issue. \ufffd There is a need to build up the capacity of the NSOs. d) Problems Relating to Sourcing and Using Data \ufffd Myanmar suffers from lack of independent data. \ufffd East Timor had good data but much of it was destroyed in 1999. \ufffd Sri Lanka finds data gathering a problem due to conflict in some areas. e) Quality Control \ufffd Peer review is critical both for quantitative and qualitative analysis. But the internal capacity of the state has to be kept in mind before making any important policy recommendations. (f) Engaging the Media \ufffd Media strategies vary. Sometimes media are not interested. \ufffd Photographs and rankings should be included to raise interest. \ufffd Some countries have very high-ranking government officials launching the HDR. \ufffd Afghanistan would like to launch the HDR at an international event to raise international attention. g) Dissemination \ufffd There is a need to think of appropriate dissemination strategies right from the beginning, as was done in Colombia. Work on the report does not end with its release, there must be planned follow up. \ufffd One method of follow up in Colombia was to use radio soap operas to spread key messages of the report. \ufffd In Bhutan a song on MDGs has been composed. This is an example of creative dissemination. h) Other Points Raised \ufffd The process of translation leads to loss of some important messages. \ufffd There is inconsistency between the global and national HDRs because of a time lag in global HDRs. Perhaps national HDRs can feed into the global HDR to remove this time lag. \ufffd After producing three or four reports, what next? Do we stop, or do we further produce thematic and other kinds of reports? Assessing the Impact of HDRs A.K. Shiva Kumar, UNICEF, India Marc Andre Franche, UNDP, Colombia The Role of Government Mr. Shiva Kumar pointed out that while there has to be diversity in the country context, there can be much in common between countries in approach strategies: UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 14 \ufffd There has been no focus on follow-up action in the group presentations. \ufffd During interaction with government, there is a need to be aware of sensitivities on both sides since UNDP is an intergovernmental agency. \ufffd Issue of objectivity has to be considered when the government is involved. \ufffd Other issues to be considered are the government\u2019s role in advocating HD and the realistic understanding of the capacities of both UNDP and government. Learning from Colombia Mr. Marc Andre Franche drew on his experience in working on the Bolivia and Colombia HDRs to list some points that should be kept in mind to ensure maximum impact: \ufffd The focus should be on one central problem. \ufffd Inclusiveness of the process, while maintaining national ownership is the key to legitimacy. \ufffd Participation without veto is essential. \ufffd Having a team dedicated solely to the HDR will help retain its independence. \ufffd Quality is maintained by generating concrete and detailed proposals which provoke debate. \ufffd While remaining within the country\u2019s politics, use a strategic outreach process. The objective is to widen the constituency in favour of the HD paradigm through a specific theme and proposals. \ufffd Maintain the HDR process in the spotlight from beginning to end. \ufffd Speak their language. Appeal to various types of audiences through different types of products and events. Project the NHDR as a cultural event, using music, theatre and painting to pass on basic messages, especially among the youth. \ufffd The HDR process must be an ongoing exchange of ideas. Organise debates instead of presentations. \ufffd Put your money where your mouth is. Help to operationalise what you are proposing, especially through UNDP. \ufffd Promote your proposals within UNDP through the Country Cooperation Framework (CCF), CCA, UNDAF and PRSPs. Further, Mr. Franche listed as examples of HD impact in Colombia: \ufffd UNDP overhaul of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c55e7c85-bb29-42dc-8ccb-1d6498bc70dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "c55e7c85-bb29-42dc-8ccb-1d6498bc70dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting: Operationalising Regional and National HDRs in Policies and Programmes", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2f373f49960d6b1f3ac280da0bc96b6ea4a973b6e8bfd1712153edb3edb76ed"}, "3": {"node_id": "0dd41c73-ec5e-4c7b-b3cf-3009bbb30d75", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-reporting-operationalising-regional-and-national-hdrs-policies-and-programmes", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa3c908d3e046f029e19a4bab3b704fa9c82b7e028fa1cdfcdcfc61c254dbea4"}}, "hash": "93af080794526040996cc246954dab0d110334e4eac71cff914870845a02fd87", "text": "CCF. \ufffd Over five million US dollars assigned in agreements with bilaterals and UNDP\u2019s Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (BCPR) for action to implement proposals. \ufffd Specific role for NHDR team: training, monitoring and dissemination. \ufffd Government involvement: \ufffd Policy formulated for internally displaced populations (IDPs). \ufffd Debate sparked off by President\u2019s comments. \ufffd Ministers in national and regional launches. \ufffd Invitation to train the military. Data Clinic This need was brought up again during the Open Forum at the beginning of Day 2. In response, a Data Clinic session was incorporated into the day\u2019s schedule and took place that afternoon. For the Data Clinic, participants were divided in two groups and they discussed individual data related problems with Ms. Anuradha Rajivan and Ms. K. Seeta Prabhu in the two groups respectively. Some of the important data related issues raised in the discussions were: \ufffd Lack of availability of HD data. UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 15 \ufffd Need for better indexing as the present methodology combines stock and flow variables. \ufffd If NHDRs could use a different methodology for calculating HDI in place of the global methodology. \ufffd Need for experience sharing at national, regional and global level. \ufffd Need for involving National Statistics Offices (NSOs) for preparation of NHDRs. \ufffd Need to improve collection of social statistics by the NSOs. \ufffd Need to orient NSO staff in HD data and related issues. \ufffd Need to promote use of proxies in case of absence of required data. Taking Stock of the HDR Experience Anuradha Rajivan, APRI, UNDP, India Discussing global HDRs, Ms. Rajivan pointed out that 14 reports have been produced since 1990. There was a need to take stock of both their potential and their limitations. Potential \ufffd Powerful tools for exploring alternative viewpoints on critical development issues. \ufffd Cross country analysis is of interest to individual nations and donor agencies. \ufffd Independence. Limitations \ufffd Near absence of national ownership. \ufffd Limited follow up at country level and lower potential for influencing national policies. RHDRs, NHDRs and MDGRs There have been 22 RHDRs published so far, with the Pacific HDR of 1994 being the first. South Asia has produced the largest number of RHDRs (seven) followed by Eastern Europe with six. Ms. Rajivan emphasised the positive aspects of RDHRs: \ufffd They can address sensitive issues that are difficult to take up at national levels, such as human rights, HIV/AIDS, corruption and governance. \ufffd With globalisation, RHDRs help to break out of national boundaries on development issues and deal UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 16 with issues of regional concern such as trade, transnational corporations, migration. \ufffd They can help in setting standards, consolidating knowledge and creating wider consensus around issues of cross-border interest. Discussing sub-national and national HDRs she pointed out that: \ufffd Both promote strong ownership. \ufffd They greatly influence policy and strategy and have the potential for official budgeting. Ms. Rajivan further highlighted the distinctions between NHDRs and MDGRs: \ufffd MDGRs are relatively limited in scope, reporting as they do on an agreed list of 8 goals, 18 targets, and 48 development indicators; the scope of issues for HDRs is virtually unlimited. \ufffd Unlike an HDR, an MDGR can be a useful result- oriented management and monitoring tool. She concluded by underlining the need to assess impact during all three phases of an HDR, the preparation process, the publication of the product, and its dissemination, in order to learn from past experiences and improve their impact. Sub-National HDRs K. Seeta Prabhu, HDRC, UNDP, India There is a need for sub-national reports, especially in large and diverse countries such as India and China.

Murali, RBAP, New York Mr. Murali said that the RBAP would like to introduce the regional MDG initiative and support capacity building in the region for MDGR preparations at country level. MDGRs and NHDRs are distinct from each other. The first series of MDGRs began by looking like HDRs. Now certain guidelines are being designed for the preparation of MDGRs. \ufffd The HDR is an in-depth analysis leading to a policy advocacy document that triggers policy debate at the country level. It is a nationally-owned document, prepared through a participatory process with support from UNDP. The MDGR, on the other hand, is a monitoring and reporting document created to indicate progress in MDGs at country level. \ufffd HDRs provide a platform for debate and discussions on evolving policy and should use the findings of MDGRs for discussing policy guidelines. NHDRs are tools for public advocacy and MDGRs are tools for policy advocacy. Discussion Participants and resource persons contested this distinction and said that the MDGR was not an advocacy document but only a scorecard. At the same time, there was agreement that the two tools were different, NHDRs being more elaborate in analysis and in providing policy guidelines. UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 17 Day 3 26 September 2003 Mainstreaming Human Development into UNDP Programmes Moderator and lead speaker: Marcia de Castro, HDRO, New York, Responses by Programme Officers from East Timor, Nepal, Laos, the Philippines Ms. Marcia de Castro defined HD as not a goal but an evolving paradigm. The challenge was to make this paradigm integral to UNDP\u2019s work and maintain synergies and linkages between programmes in the six UNDP practice areas of democratic governance, poverty reduction, crisis prevention and recovery, energy and environment, ICT. NHDRs provide tools to build synergies. Ms. de Castro discussed the various planning tools in UNDP, such as the Multi-Year Funding Framework and the Strategic Resource Framework (SRF), as well as the work done by the NHDR Policy, NHDR Toolkit, HDR Network, thematic clusters, and other training activities. She listed the six basic principles of NHDRs: 1. National ownership. 2. Independence of the editorial team. 3. Participatory and inclusive process. 4. Quality of analysis. 5. Flexible and creative presentation. 6. Sustained follow up. Country Presentations: Mainstreaming the HD Approach in National Programming Presentation guidelines (see Annexure 6) were circulated to the Country Offices based on which the following presentations were made at the workshop. a) East Timor Rui Gomes, UNDP, East Timor The mainstreaming of the HD approach needs to be seen in the context of the current situation in East Timor, which became the world\u2019s newest sovereign state on 20 May, 2002. It is only one year and four months old. Despite this the HD approach has been mainstreamed in East Timor through UNDP\u2019s support to the nationwide poverty assessment in 2001. This was the cornerstone of the CO\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. The assessment results were fed into the National Development Plan (NDP) which was completed and adopted by Parliament in mid-2002. The NDP incorporates the people\u2019s vision and priorities. The major goals of the UNDP are to: \ufffd Reduce poverty. \ufffd Promote rapid economic growth that is also equitable. The Plan contains a poverty reduction strategy, built upon four major elements: 1. Expanding opportunities for the poor. 4 UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 18 2. Improving their access to basic social services. 3. Enhancing security, reducing vulnerability to shocks, and improving food security. 4. Empowering the poor. These objectives are closely aligned with the HD paradigm.

UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 19 \ufffd Work and Well-being (2002). The production of HDRs has resulted in demand for and use of statistics in HD and poverty monitoring, in terms of frequency and sub-national disaggregations. In 1999, HDI was designated as official statistics by the government. In linking HD to programmes there is a need to enhance in-house capacity and develop appropriate Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) processes. d) Laos Ana Gaby Guerrero, UNDP, Laos The country\u2019s second CCF (2002-2006) assesses the development situation from a sustainable HD perspective. \u2018Advancing Rural Development\u2019 was chosen as the focus of NHDR 2002 on the basis of CO programme experiences in a number of rural development and governance projects. This NHDR has been used for developing three programmes on: 1. Environment (ongoing). 2. Poverty governance (planned). 3. HD advocacy (ongoing). The HD advocacy approach includes production of NHDRs and establishment of advocacy tools for their dissemination. These tools include video and radio productions, articles, workshops, a development journal and a children\u2019s magazine. Research projects which help in knowledge management, policy papers based on in- house discussion and participation in PRSP and MDGR processes also form part of this approach. Current problems in Laos include: \ufffd Low capacity at national level resulting in confusion between HRD and HD. \ufffd Rotation of international staff. \ufffd Staff uses HDR data and information regularly in project formulation and sometimes in evaluation but hardly ever in project monitoring. Disaggregation of data in NHDR would be useful for monitoring at provincial and district levels. The CO faces challenges at two levels. At staff level, there is a need to strengthen the role of programme staff in HD advocacy, to enable them to play an active part in the dissemination of key messages. At the programme/ project level problems consist of: \ufffd No clear or few direct linkages between programme indicators and HD indicators \u2014 for example, SRF and Result Oriented Assessment Report (ROAR) have outputs and outcomes but lack a set of indicators. \ufffd Difficulties in establishing direct linkages to projects \u2014 this points to a need to introduce HDI and gender indicators at provincial and district levels. \ufffd Relevance of data provided in NHDRs to particular programme/project not established. \ufffd Confusion in definition; there is a need to realise that government definition of, and policy on, HRD is not to be identified with the HD approach.

Mr. Franche pointed out that media play a very important role in creating public debate and attracting the attention of policy makers. In discussion, participants wanted to know if the NHDRs should have broad policy prescriptions or specific ones. Mr. Franche suggested that it was difficult to have an impact on wide policy prescriptions and hence it would be better to have specific concrete proposals. Media advocacy helps in creating an intense and rich debate. At the same time, one has to look at country contexts with reference to the level of media autonomy and provide clear messages. Not all journalists understand HD messages; there is a need to train the media in order to pass on clear messages to the people. There is also a need to simplify the language used in the NHDRs so that it is easy to comprehend. Press kits for foreign and domestic media should be separately customised as interests will be different at these two levels. UNDP\u2019s message to the media should clearly include: \ufffd The centrality of the HD concept. \ufffd Support for debate on the issues involved. UNDP need not take a certain position but need only facilitate public debate. Integration of Cross-Cutting Issues into HDRs Chair: K. Seeta Prabhu, HDRC, UNDP, India Speakers: Savitri Wijesekera, Women-in-Need, Sri Lanka Mumtaz Keklik, SURF Kathmandu R. Sudarshan, OGC, Oslo Gender Issues Savitri Wijesekera, Women-In-Need Ms. Wijesekera has been working for an NGO concerned with women and violence for about a decade. She emphasised that gender is an integral part of development. In Sri Lanka, women are major income earners both as migrant workers in tea and rubber plantations, and as employees of other industries and government. But they are a neglected lot. Civil society organisations (CSOs) play a crucial role in supporting development-related government initiatives and multilateral bodies should come forward to support such organisations. There is a need to mainstream gender into the school system in order to raise women\u2019s issues right from the beginning. NGOs can help by providing training-related support. The school dropout rate among girls is very high and one important reason is the prevalence of migration. The incidence of incest, rape and abuse among migrants UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 21 is also very high. Sensitivity to these problems is low among government agencies. In the legal system, process and implementation are not robust enough and action is often long delayed. The police and the judiciary are not sensitised enough. There are no support services for abused women and there is no mechanism to expand these services. Gender and Trade Mumtaz Keklik, SURF, Kathmandu Mr. Keklik shared his experience of preparing the book, Making Global Trade Work for People (UNDP, 2003). The process was fully participatory. The team writing the book had extensive consultations with governments of developing countries and civil society organisations, adding up to nine consultations in all. The book covered issues such as gender equality, food security and environment. Some of the messages it contained were controversial and generated a lot of debate on publication. The authors looked at trade not as a purely economic issue, but as an HD issue. There is a direct relationship between trade policies and gender issues. The book argued that any policy affects men and women differently. This difference in impact is more easily visible in labour-related policies.

Women are mostly small farmers and were eliminated by import competition in sub-Saharan Africa. This led to a high level of food insecurity. In general, women enter the private sector labour market under very disadvantageous conditions. On the wages front there is a mixed report; in some cases women\u2019s wages increased as compared to men, but in other cases they decreased. In countries like Taiwan, companies used this decrease to boost exports and this produced an indirect impact on macro economic policies. In Nepal, reduction in tariffs led to decrease in customs revenue which, in turn, led to reduction in funding the development project in the country. Rapid liberalisation leads to change in the dynamics of poverty and inequality. It would, for example, lead to reduction in agricultural subsidies and reduce tariffs on luxury tax. This widens the already existing inequality between the rural poor and the urban rich. It leads to a need for the government to reallocate expenditures for the benefit of the rural poor and on other development projects. What needs to be done is to slow the process of trade reforms. A country\u2019s development priorities need to be integrated into its trade policies. Development budgets should be made immune to changes in trade policies. There should be regular impact assessments of trade policies on HD variables such as development financing, gender equality and environment. Access to Justice R. Sudarshan, OGC, Oslo The 2002 global report highlighted democracy as it exists and its deficiencies. Different countries understand the term, \u2018democracy\u2019, differently yet the common thread is that of accountability. In some, accountability is limited to seeking a mandate once in four or five years and then forgetting about the people. In others, there is deliberative democracy, where each and every issue is first discussed with the public and then action is decided upon. For democratic accountability, having institutions like elections is not enough. There is a need to be conscious of the means to improve the accountability of government. The rule of law means that every public action should have legality. The rule of law, however, does not specify what the laws should be. At times the law is itself unjust. Hence the focus needs to be on justice and human rights rather than the rule of law. The right to development is an important human right and is directly linked to the concept of accountability of the rulers to the ruled. Data and indicators are inadequate to understand governance and related issues. The OGC is grappling UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 22 with the need to compare countries at the level of governance and identify underlying deficiencies. There is a need to list one set of core indicators which is general in nature and another set which is attuned to the country context. Discussion Commenting on the presentations, Mr. Noman and Ms. Prabhu pointed out that attempts to quantify freedom, such as the Freedom House Index and the Human Freedom Index, have a large element of subjectivity and are considered highly debatable. (Since 1972, Freedom House, a non-profit international organisation based in Washington D.C., prepares an annual assessment of the state of freedom using the Freedom House Index, assigning each country and territory the status of \u2018Free\u2019, \u2018Partly Free\u2019, or \u2018Not Free\u2019, by averaging their political rights and civil liberties ratings. The Political Freedom Index was prepared by UNDP in its HDR of 1992. Both indices are related to quantifying governance related issues.) Replying to queries, Mr. Keklik said that there is much discrimination at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) between norms for developing countries and those for developed countries. These issues cannot be solved at a regional level; they must be tackled at the global level through multilateral agreements. Process, Impact and Follow Up Three break-out groups discussed follow-up actions and made presentations on the following subjects: \ufffd Regional HDRs \u2013 possible themes and processes. \ufffd Capacity building of CO and national teams. \ufffd Impact assessment of HDRs. Themes and Processes of RHDRs The RHDR has certain advantages. It can address sensitive issues like globalisation, environment, water and energy, small and medium enterprises, access to justice and human rights, vulnerable and excluded groups. The group felt that: \ufffd COs in the region can play a role in using NHDRs as focal points and thematic units for organising workshops and helping to launch RHDRs. \ufffd Advanced planning for the process is essential. \ufffd It is also important to have a steering committee and to establish a regional network for RHDRs.

How is the process of capacity building for production of HDRs to be started and continued? \ufffd Develop a regional capacity building NHDR network. \ufffd Different countries could have workshops and invite experts as resource persons. Other centres, such as HDRO and APRI, could also provide support for capacity building. \ufffd Provide training on statistical issues related to MDGs and indices with expertise from the Statistical Institute for Asia Pacific (SIAP). Conduct refresher training once or twice a year. \ufffd There should be a time line for capacity building in COs, private sector, media, government, etc. Impact Assessment What is the impact under discussion? \ufffd Policy impact \u2014 are recommendations taken up for policy implementation? \ufffd In crediting the HDR, distinguish between the kind of impact that is purely a result of the NHDR, and the kind of impact that may be caused by other factors. \ufffd Public advocacy is a clear impact, which is easy to identify. \ufffd In some cases there is no way one can assess the impact \u2013 for example, in education the impact on the development process is evident only in the long term. UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 23 \ufffd It is important to come up with specific recommendations, since this helps in assessing the impact. \ufffd For maximum impact, the process must be emphasised from the beginning \u2013 for example, with a consultative process, the impact is in the process. \ufffd The objective of the HDR defines the expected impact and also determines the impact assessment methodology. \ufffd Not all HDRs are good; but the quality of the HDR need not necessarily determine its impact. \ufffd The global scenario as well as political conditions and agendas will have a bearing on the impact. Discussion On the need for funds for these tasks, Ms. de Castro said HDRO does support capacity building through e-networks and initiatives such as the Innovation Fund. HDRO is planning to introduce a three-month distance education course, for UNDP staff, on HD concepts and HDR preparation. She expressed her agreement with participants who pointed out that there were constraints both with regard to funds and in terms of time. Since preparation of the HDR involves a number of stakeholders, the process needs time; however, time available is limited to one year. It was mentioned that Chile has drawn up some indicators to assess the impact of HDRs. Vote of Thanks Ms. Rajivan said the regional programme would be holding another training workshop in 2004. She thanked everyone for their enthusiasm and full participation in the workshop which ensured its success. In particular, she thanked the Sri Lanka CO for the support provided. Mr. Noman appreciated the efforts of APRI and HDRC in organising the workshop. Ms. Spoerel said it was an honour to host the workshop, particularly when Sri Lanka is about to launch the next NHDR and MDGR. She expressed herself eager to participate in the next workshop and thanked the organisers from APRI and HDRC. She also thanked the staff at Sri Lanka CO for facilitating this workshop. Participants appreciated the continued effort of the whole team, despite having to postpone the workshop once. Summing Up The workshop started with the conceptual background and then moved on to basic issues such as data. The organisers responded to demand and set up a data clinic. There were some interesting government responses. There was much interest expressed in the impact of HDRs and there was some very good experience sharing. Other topics that were found useful included: taking stock of global, regional and national HDRs, the complementary yet distinct nature of MDGRs and NHDRs, integration of cross cutting issues, trade and gender. Specific action points were listed in the last session. UNDP Training Workshop - Potential and Challenges in Human Development Reporting 24 Annexures Annexure 1 List of Participants Sl.

Building upon the rich experience gained and valu- able feedback received in the first APRI training SECTION I Potential and Challenges in Human Development: Analysis, Process and Reporting Potential and Challenges in Human Development: Analysis, Process and Reporting 2 workshop, \u201cPotentials and Challenges in Human Devel- opment Reporting: Operationalizing Regional and National HDRs in Policies and Programmes\u201d (Colombo, Sri Lanka, 24-26 September 2003), the training work- shop was conceived as a platform for cross-coun- try sharing and collective exploration of critical concepts and issues of human development. The challenges faced by different stakeholders in human development analysis, process and reporting had been kept in mind while designing this training. In fact, preparatory work was conducted to ascertain the needs of all participants and the areas of strength of each team. Participants had an opportunity to strengthen their perspectives on the human development approach, share experiences and learn from regional best practices, understand the importance and role of national and regional HDRs and collectively evolve strategies for translating messages of regional and national HDRs into programmes and policies. The- matic break-out group discussions (on trade, hu- man security and governance) and exercises were introduced to facilitate the application of concepts and tools considered. By combining concepts and practical tools, the workshop sought to clarify the distinctions between: \ufffd The HD concept and its differences with other development paradigms \ufffd Human Development Reports at the global, re- gional and national levels \ufffd Human Development Index and other indices measuring HD \ufffd The relationship between reporting on HD and monitoring progress on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3PPPPParticipants articipants articipants articipants articipants The workshop brought together 30 representatives from 12 countries of UNDP Country Offices, NHDR Team members/coordinators, government officials and statisticians from Cambodia, China, East Timor, Fiji, Indonesia, Iran, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and Thai- land.

Political freedom and participation are part of human development, both as development goals in their own right and as means for advancing human development. In fact, political freedom empowers people to claim their economic and social rights, while education increases their ability to demand economic and social policies that respond to their priorities (Figure 2.1). 5 The HD Concept and its Application in the Asia-Pacific Region The HD Concept and its Application in the Asia-Pacific Region By according due priority to economic growth along- side issues of equity, sustainability and participation, the human development paradigm presents a com- prehensive and integrated perspective of development.

Discussions covered extensively the Human Development Index (HDI) and Human Poverty Index (HPI), but also the Gender-Related Development Index (GDI), Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) and a new thematic index, the In- formation and Communication Technology for Human Development (ICT4HD) Index. To famil- iarize participants with the actual calculations of composite indices, an exercise on the HDI and HPI was undertaken. The purpose was also to shed the mystery of its complexities and to build skills that would minimize reliance on external experts. 3.1 3.1 3.1 3.1 3.1Indicators and Composite Indices Indicators and Composite Indices Indicators and Composite Indices Indicators and Composite Indices Indicators and Composite Indices Human development cannot be directly measured. Thus, a range of specific indicators is considered. Key dimensions of human development have started to be systematically measured thanks to the Human Development Reports (HDRs).

Is there a bias in favour of what is inherently measurable? Even the best data system cannot capture important aspects of human choices that are hard to measure (e.g. cultural freedoms, environment, security, peace, etc.). Data constraints: availability, compa- rability and quality. Definitions and tools for data collection need to be better harmonized to promote comparability (across time and space). The need for comparability does not mean neglecting regional and cul- tural diversities. Reporting time and dissemination time need to be reduced to avoid using outdated information. Conceptual Issues Measurement, indexing in particular, narrows down an inherently broad concept. But this is true of all meas- ures in social science. Choice of dimensions: Does the aggregation of the three dimensions cap- ture the concept ad- equately? Relevance of add- ing new dimensions, thematic indices, local specificity. Aggregation Issues When variables measured in different units are aggregated, it is necessary to make the variables unit free. In the case of the HDI the Range Equalisation (RE) method is used \u2013 each indicator is divided by the range so that scale- free values vary between 0 and 1. The HDI aggregates stock variables (Adult Literacy Rate and Life Expectancy at Birth) and flow variables (GDP per capita and Gross Enrollment Ratio). As GDP is a flow variable, the HDI and GDP ranks are strictly not com- parable (yet it is done). Redundancy/double counting issues \u2013 in the case of HDI there is a high positive correlation between its components. The composite indices that global HDRs have in- troduced since 1990 are: \ufffd Human Development Index (HDI): it meas- ures a country\u2019s achievement in longevity, knowl- edge and a decent standard of living \ufffd Human Poverty Index (HPI-1): it measures the extent of deprivation in longevity, knowledge and a decent standard of living \ufffd Gender-Related Development Index (GDI): it measures the achievement in longevity, knowl- edge and a decent standard of living but it ad- justs their values according to the inequality ex- isting between men and women \ufffd Gender Empowerment Measure: it focuses on women\u2019s opportunities and assesses women\u2019s par- ticipation in economic and political life 11 Measuring Human Development Measuring Human Development \ufffd Technology Achievement Index (TAI): it aims to capture how well a country is creating and dif- fusing technology and building a human skill base. The discussion focused mainly on the HDI and HPI-1 as an exercise was proposed on these two in- dices. The outcome of the exercise highlighted the need to get familiar with the formulas, what indica- tors to use to measure various dimensions of HDI, and the cut off value to define high/medium/low human development countries. 3.2 3.2 3.2 3.2 3.2 Human Development Index Human Development Index Human Development Index Human Development Index Human Development Index The Human Development Index (HDI) is a sum- mary measure for human development, which was developed as an alternative to Gross National Prod- uct (GNP) per capita to monitor the progress of nations.

Thus it is discounted \ufffd Income above a cut-off point (world average per capita income) used to be drastically discounted; but from 1999 a more gradual discounting is done throughout by using the logarithm of income. For the calculation of the HDI, the Range Equali- sation (RE) method is used. Each indicator is in fact divided by the range (after subtraction of the lowest value) so that scale-free values vary between 0 and 1. The range is a fixed one as it is computed on the basis of the predetermined goal posts. Thus, this method, which has the advantage of being popular and well understood: Dimension Component Index actual indicator - min goalpost max goalpost - min goalpost ( ( = Potential and Challenges in Human Development: Analysis, Process and Reporting Potential and Challenges in Human Development: Analysis, Process and Reporting 12 \ufffd Discriminates against indicators with greater dis- parity (fixed range) \ufffd Implies losing the unique property of the range being a constant of unity as it uses a fixed range (goalposts). According to the value of the HDI, every year coun- tries are ranked and aggregated in different clusters according to their achievements in human develop- ment. Thus, countries will belong to the high human development category if their HDI is equal to or above 0.800, to the medium development category if their HDI is between 0.500 and 0.799 and to the low hu- man development category if their HDI is below 0.500. As a single-figure development indicator, the HDI is easy to understand and use. It has in fact been called \u201cmore comprehensible than many other com- posite indicators\u201d (Ivanova, 1994). Thanks to its high advocacy potential, the HDI has been able to challenge the other crude but widely used aggre- gate, namely the GDP per capita. Yet, it does not provide the complete picture of the status of hu- man development. 3.3 3.3 3.3 3.3 3.3 Human P Human P Human P Human P Human Poverty Index overty Index overty Index overty Index overty Index The Human Poverty Index (HPI) measures depri- vations in the basic dimensions of human devel- opment. The formula used for developing coun- tries (HPI-1) and selected OECD countries (HPI- 2) differs. The Human Poverty Index for developing countries (HPI-1) measures deprivations in the three dimen- sions that are captured in the HDI: \ufffd A long and healthy life - vulnerability to death at a relatively early age, as measured by the probabil- ity at birth of not surviving age 40 \ufffd Knowledge - exclusion from the world of reading and communications, as measured by adult il- literacy rate \ufffd A decent standard of living - lack of access to over- all economic provisioning, as measured by the unweighted average of two indicators: the per- centage of population without sustainable access to an improved water source and the percentage of children underweight for age. The calculation of the HPI-1 is simpler than that of HDI as all the units are already unit free and therefore are directly comparable.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ae96e48-b4fc-43f1-b00c-9ee988655ff4": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ae96e48-b4fc-43f1-b00c-9ee988655ff4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-analysis-process-and-reporting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Potential and Challenges in Human Development: Analysis, Process and Reporting", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-analysis-process-and-reporting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39338fc14ca9d696404694b530bfdd7462ad0b263653ac1c5bc27b7dd37c4d0a"}, "2": {"node_id": "b8059a9c-670d-4f9f-8f95-893a443bd98e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-analysis-process-and-reporting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb8d251a5a11ad61e1e7f4307f69f8c10d481c778af6ac736baa543c5f7df20d"}}, "hash": "29a8846b61c295f7d3413b506a73cce57c32865bd323a11f6a406bac9bb31afe", "text": "As a result, there is no need to separate component index for each dimension as indicators to measure deprivation are already normalized between 0 and 100, and there is no need for the goal posts.

For example, Bhutan has produced the Gross National Happiness Index to measure people\u2019s well being in non-economic areas, Nepal has looked at how em- powerment detracts or adds to the HDI, and Ma- laysia has produced a Quality of Life Index. As part of the preparation of the regional HDR on ICT for development, APRI calculated an ICT for Human Development (ICT4HD) Index, posing the query whether ICT promotes or detracts from HD.

In fact, a survey of data sources, na- tional and international, revealed that: \ufffd The use-specific data was limited \ufffd There were issues of comparability across countries \ufffd There was no possibility of collecting primary data because of cost and time constraints. Indicators reflecting the degree of availability of ICT have been classified in 5 categories: \ufffd Availability \u2013 or supply linked - skill independ- ent (e.g., telephone connections, cellular subscrib- ers, TV sets, radio all per 1000 population) \ufffd Availability \u2013 or supply linked -skill depend- ent (e.g., internet users, PC users, ICT expendi- ture per capita) \ufffd Efficiency and speed indicators (e.g., charges for ISP use, cost of peak rate local calls from land lines, internet speed and access, IT training and education) \ufffd Indicators that reflect targeting social sectors (e.g., internet access in schools, computers in edu- cational institutions, prioritisation of ICT by gov- ernments, government online service availability) \ufffd Indicators that reflect targeting of vulnerable groups (e.g. proxy for female workers in the ICT sectors \u2013 percentage of women among technical and professional workers; public access to internet, for greater diffusion of technology; competition in providing internet services, lower costs \u2013 provid- ing access to the worse off; pro-poor laws in ICT). In view of the familiarity and popularity of the Range Equalisation method among practitioners and policy makers, this method was used for construct- ing the ICT4HD index. However, another method, the Division by Mean (DM) method, was also used to better retain differences across countries. The results obtained showed that: \ufffd The top 3 and the bottom 2 countries retained their ranks across methods: Malaysia very clearly ranked (1), China (2), Thailand (3) while at the bottom end, Indonesia (7) and Vietnam (9) re- tained their ranking \ufffd Rank reversals were recorded in between: India (4 to 5) and Pakistan (5 to 8) worsened, while Sri Lanka (6 to 4) and Mongolia (8 to 6) improved using the DM method. The component indices also revealed interesting in- formation regarding the areas in which various coun- tries are relatively weak. For example: \ufffd China ranks high (1) in social sector targeting but is low in efficiency and speed (6) \ufffd Malaysia ranks very high on all supply side indi- cators as well as efficiency and speed (1) but falls in rank for social sector targeting under both methods (3,4) \ufffd India is high on vulnerable groups targeting (1,2) \ufffd India (8, 8) and Pakistan (9,9) are low on availability.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ab9cab4-448c-4d40-839a-e6634064a764": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ab9cab4-448c-4d40-839a-e6634064a764", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-analysis-process-and-reporting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Potential and Challenges in Human Development: Analysis, Process and Reporting", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-analysis-process-and-reporting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e8ba16eaaa07998a51e5768b32ffb2328b48eeb1f77b2d5cd94001b78b1e8d6"}, "2": {"node_id": "c510b783-e539-4230-8f57-d634904dfa95", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-analysis-process-and-reporting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3c2998b34ea4ccdcd2aadae2e933f24fa8eecd537c88d5bfd2f4da66c895a774"}}, "hash": "2df3859e687f07b764871dc6605bbe51739eaf73688edaa79dd331270a7420f5", "text": "ICT indicators have shown a strong positive rela- tionship with per capita income and HDI across the countries of the world in 1991, which strength- ened in 2001.

To ensure that steps are undertaken for filling the data gaps and timely collection of reliable data, it is crucial to sensitize officials on the importance of having updated and reliable data. Data is, in fact, crucial to inform any decision, help to assess pri- orities and evaluate progress. This effort could also help in promoting a better alignment of national and international data. Statis- tical Offices need to better relay their information to international organizations, including regional UN organizations, such as ESCAP, WB, UNICEF, ILO, etc. UNDP is not a data producing organiza- tion but a data user.

Potential and Challenges in Human Development: Analysis, Process and Reporting Potential and Challenges in Human Development: Analysis, Process and Reporting 16 HDRs must also negotiate the inclusion of a true picture of disparities in the country. Data needs fur- ther disaggregation by differently defined population groups (age, sex, education, levels of incomes, ethnicity, employment status, religious affiliation etc.) and by territory (sub-national territorial and administrative entities, rural/urban division, territories identified by socioeconomic criteria). Beyond technical hurdles, disaggregation by these sub-groups are political is- sues that need to be addressed courageously. NHDR teams need to convince authorities that recognition of disparities is the first step towards social cohe- sion. NHDRs should therefore: \ufffd Critically examine official data and use other sources as comparisons \ufffd Commissioning additional surveys when possible Use a variety of existing qualitative and quantita- tive data produced by non-government institutions (other donors, NGOs, researchers, etc.). Issue There is a lot of data generated by the Statistical Office: A census every 10 years, proxies for literacy, knowledge based economy, annual labor force survey, disaggregated GDP by ethnicity, district, state and gender since the 1990s. The problem is the concepts and definitions behind them. Malaysia has a Quality of Life Index and wants to know how it differs from the HDI. Concepts and defini- tions matter. Malaysia has not produced an NHDR yet, but once its preparation is approved, the statistical system is ready to provide the inputs for those still not available data. Important role for the NSO in calculating HDI, GDI and GEM by gender, prov- ince and urban-rural for the first time in 2003. HPI should be estimated in the next NHDR. The NHDR used data generated by a July-August 2001 survey in provinces, on consumption and expenditure for HPI. GDP however is still used as the measure- ment of development. The Federal Bureau of Statistics has adequate and fairly accurate information and can provide information for the NHDR to a large extent. PRSP 2005 and MDG 2015 monitoring can enhance data supply. The problem is the availability of reliable and compatible data, with ministries giving different values for the same indicators. Hence there is a need for capacity building for data. The capacity of the National Statistical Office is limited due to the lack of provin- cial-level data, which only becomes available during the national census exercise (held once a decade).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02d7b2d7-ad44-46ed-8e89-ac03e103ad92": {"__data__": {"id_": "02d7b2d7-ad44-46ed-8e89-ac03e103ad92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-analysis-process-and-reporting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Potential and Challenges in Human Development: Analysis, Process and Reporting", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-analysis-process-and-reporting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33ea81ab8d940852311fce4225afc90fe666d1a5c6b0cd977fdf8ebef945292c"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae8f2b8f-eb45-4008-93a9-0015f9930321", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-and-challenges-human-development-analysis-process-and-reporting", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fae82370cefbf02e18fb9cc66628ae20fec769f89b7f4d08e78a5456aaf74822"}}, "hash": "04a833df1ae5bff638511b99f706fa1dfa20563da35369bb0e4fe61618dd95b5", "text": "Most of the data is taken from the National Statistical Office.

Since 1990 UNDP has published 15 HDRs. In addition to the annual update on the set of human development indicators and composite indices, each year the re- port analyzes a theme in depth (Box 4.1). In recent years, the analysis has considered a wide range of intangibles in examining the performance and the potential of various countries in promoting human development. Since the preparation of the first HDR at the glo- bal level, several regional, national and sub-national HDRs have been prepared. In the Asia-Pacific re- gion, many NHDRs, Regional HDRs and MDGRs have been prepared. Among the countries repre- sented at the workshop, Cambodia has prepared the highest number of NHDRs (Table 4.1). The NHDRs prepared in the region have come a long way in terms of introducing the concept of HD into mainstream development strategies, analyzing sectoral and theme areas using the approach, and mobilizing action. Yet, they have some limitations (Box 4.2). These NHDRs are often used as a one-stop reference for data, information and analysis. 4.2 4.2 4.2 4.2 4.2UNDP Corporate P UNDP Corporate P UNDP Corporate P UNDP Corporate P UNDP Corporate Policy on Na- olicy on Na- olicy on Na- olicy on Na- olicy on Na- tional HDRs tional HDRs tional HDRs tional HDRs tional HDRs The main challenge of an HDR is to be technical, analytical and practical at the same time.

HDRs, while they represent a process of dialogue and consensus, are not a \u201cconsensus document\u201d. They are independent reports in which the authors take ultimate respon- sibility for the point of view presented. \ufffd Quality of Analysis (product): Quality human de- velopment policy analysis centers on people and makes global, regional and local connections.

The NHDR must be a document that has objective analy- sis and realistic recommendations. The Report must explicitly say that the views expressed are only those of the authors. Diversified national partners aid independence. These could be, in addition to government and UNDP, think tanks, civil society organizations, re- search centers, private sector representatives, etc. Although many, if not most, NHDR projects in the region have NEX modalities, government ministries have to be encouraged to broaden stakeholders in- volved in the production. In fact, National Owner- ship is Collective Ownership. Participation is an ingredient to success and needs to happen at all levels and stages: choice of theme, research, decisions on findings, dissemination, etc. NHDRs should include the information about the 21 HDRs: Products, Process and Dissemination HDRs: Products, Process and Dissemination capacity processes. The role of consultant is often vital at the initial stage, but once the direction of HDR is recognized and accepted, it is the responsi- bility of the focal group to continue the task. As the preparation of the report would then become regular, it should not be dependent on consultants. Thus, UNDP Country Offices should be involved in carrying out research and analysis, which would result in saving time and resources, as well as main- tain the expertise within the organization. Selected country examples were provided to give a flavor of how/if the principles of national owner- ship, participatory and inclusive preparation, as well as independence of analysis have been applied. The Iran HDRs are joint UN/Government docu- ments. The Government was involved in all stages of preparation as well as in the endorsement of the findings. This exercise is supported by a NEX modality through a joint project with the Planning Organization. The first Iran NHDR benefited much from the review by UN agencies and independent international experts. The challenge for the sec- ond report is to convince the Government to do a Peer Review, as the corporate policy on this was produced after the signature of the project with the Government. The Planning Commission, Government of India has owned the preparation of HDRs at the na- tional level. UNDP is supporting State Govern- ments in the preparation of State HDRs. The proc- ess of preparing State HDRs has been inclusive and to ensure credibility of the findings, the analy- sis has often been undertaken by an independent team of experts at the behest of the State Gov- ernments that, however, have been part of the process at each step of the preparation. China had a long-term strategy for partnership build- ing to involve and educate key stakeholders from both the private and public sectors.

To ensure consist- ency in style, the role of the editor is also essential. On the one hand, involving new people allows for new ideas, but on the other hand, ignoring the in- stitutional memory diminishes the quality and means reinventing the wheel. A good compromise could be to rotate teams and involve authors of past re- ports as key people, trainers, etc. Thus, team mem- bers could go through intensive training, which can be carried out by experienced members of past NHDRs with a knowledge of HD. Mongolia\u2019s last HDR was prepared by an NGO, Mongolia Development and Population Agency, which was supported by international editors. There was an important process of consultative meetings to approve drafts, as well as trainings for researchers and UNDP staff. As a result, the Economic Depart- ment of the University of Mongolia is preparing a curriculum on Human Development. The challenge is to strike a good balance between UNDP\u2019s requirements on the corporate policy and the national ownership aspect of the report. UNDP should play a catalytic, not a controlling, role. It can support a) objective choice in teams, b) pro- vide information and theories, d) ensure quality control c) launch and disseminate the Report, e) assure follow-up, etc. UNDP should use its vast network around the world to provide information, peer review, dissemination, etc. for the NHDRs. Potential and Challenges in Human Development: Analysis, Process and Reporting Potential and Challenges in Human Development: Analysis, Process and Reporting 22 UNDP staff should be substantively involved in the Report as well, by providing feedback etc. and ensuring the relationship between independent rec- ommendations and action through implementation. 4.4 4.4 4.4 4.4 4.4Quality of Analysis Quality of Analysis Quality of Analysis Quality of Analysis Quality of Analysis The NHDR should be first and foremost about the concept of HD, applied to the situation of the coun- try and to the themes at hand. In fact, the main pur- pose of the first NHDR should be to deepen un- derstanding of HD and to provide tools for analyzing the HD situation, using data and policy analysis. As people are at the center of the human development concept, their voices should also be reflected in the analysis of the report. The Thai- land HDR was exemplary in portraying the voices of people in its analysis. When thematic HDRs are prepared, human devel- opment should be in any case the framework of sectoral technical analysis. In fact, any HDR should be able to help to address issues through an HD approach, and not turn out to be a theme report on different topics. National themes should not echo that of the global HDR necessarily, but COs are encouraged to use that analysis if the theme is relevant to their country. The choice of the theme should build on timing as well as on previous reports. Hence it is important to have a systematic approach to planning cycles of NHDRs. A good theme is built on previous HDR work (Indo- nesia), forward-looking, timely, compelling, linked to major events or processes (East Timor). In Pakistan, for example, the theme chosen for the second NHDR is water, as it has been identified as a key priority for 2005 in the country. The human development prism should also be kept in mind while considering comments received through peer reviews. Not all reviewers may be fa- miliar with the concept and may make theme rec- ommendations that may sometimes be contradic- tory to the conceptual approach. Training, on-go- ing discussions, and readings of other Global, Re- gional and National HDRs are recommended for all team members from the beginning. Beyond what the NHDR Unit, RBAP or APRI can offer, all ef- forts must be made by past authors of NHDRs to use their knowledge systematically at the national level. For example, very often, teams are not famil- iar with the HDRs. Training for all members of the team and all writers of the report should be organ- ized systematically.

Once the purpose is clear, the audience to which the analysis is targeted to should also be clarified. The audience targeted could include, for example, ad- ministrations, civil society, private sector, UN agen- cies, other development agencies, donors, etc. For example, the Lao PDR 3rd NHDR on Trade has as its purpose policy debates for a diverse audience and has concentrated on a few messages. NHDRs can often be more descriptive than analyti- cal, although to lead policy recommendations they should be analytical. Good description of facts and data should lead to good analysis of causes and con- sequences and hence to well-argued policy recom- mendations. This problem is related to two factors: lack of knowledge on how to analyze from the HD point of view, or lack of political will to give a criti- cal analysis of facts and figures. The issue of editorial independence also needs to be stressed for the NHDRs. Although many of the NHDRs are government owned, the teams prepar- ing the NHDRs must still have editorial independ- 23 HDRs: Products, Process and Dissemination HDRs: Products, Process and Dissemination ence. Objectivity should be the main characteristic of a sound analysis. Involving a wide array of writ- ers and rotating the teams can provide more oppor- tunities for objective analysis. Involving peer groups to review the NHDR at various stages provides in- put for analysis. Recommendations should be concrete on what to do and how to do it, and not be a wish list. Only then would NHDRs be useful as both ref- erence documents and policy documents. Suc- cessful reports also include critical discussions of costs and benefits of policy choices and high- light the tradeoff of policy choices from an HD perspective, including identifying potential win- ners and losers. Policy recommendations should be specific, do-able, targeted and bold. For example, the Indonesia HDR was able to persuade local governors to raise the level of HD expenditures, and provided recommendations to the Govern- ment from independent researchers. The Cambo- dia HDR did a cost benefit of the National Strat- egy Plan and various national policies to come up with concrete and brief messages. 4.5 P 4.5 P 4.5 P 4.5 P 4.5 Prrrrresentation esentation esentation esentation esentation NHDRs can follow the format of the Global HDR but should not be limited by them. The organiza- tion of NHDRs should provide readers with an ef- fective grasp of main messages. A good order for presentation of the NHDR can be: \ufffd Foreword \ufffd Overview/Executive summary \ufffd Main chapters \ufffd Appendices \ufffd Notes and references \ufffd Data sources \ufffd Glossary An effective NHDR is one that is short and written in simple non-technical languages in order to at- tract and reach a wide audience. Chapters should have good summaries of main points and all policy recommendations should be summarized. Presentational techniques that encourage grasping of the data and messages include the use of pull quotes, tables, graphs, boxes, maps and photographs. Photographs have proved to enhance the attractive- ness of the Report. Annexures of effective NHDRs include glossary of terms, technical notes on indi- ces, bibliography etc. The full name and affiliations of the authors, peer reviewers, experts etc. should appear in the text of the NHDR (i.e., introduction, preface, special sec- tion etc.) A note on how and why the authors were chosen and how the process was carried forth gives the information necessary to contextualize the find- ings of the NHDR and assess its participatory value and editorial independence.

Potential and Challenges in Human Development: Analysis, Process and Reporting Potential and Challenges in Human Development: Analysis, Process and Reporting 24 Often reports are written in English and only then translated into local languages (or vice versa), leav- ing much behind. Good quality translation and participative methods should address this issue. All efforts should be made to streamline the editing/trans- lation process and not to have discrepancies between the various language editions. Training materials need to be prepared in local languages to prepare future authors as well as disseminate the concept. For Cambodia, translating the concept into the Khmer language is not easy. The Iran UNDP Coun- try Office has a translator who has worked for years on the translation of the Global HDR, and hence knows concepts very well. The NHDR in Iran used simple, readable and not too academic language but did not have much work on visuals. It was printed in Farsi and English. Timor-Leste has 3 official lan- guages, which the NHDR tried to target. The cover of the report is also important, and should be both attractive and meaningful. The choice of the cover should be a participatory process, involv- ing a consensus between authors, \u201cowners\u201d and sponsors. The year in which the Report was launched (and not prepared) should be on the cover. The Timor-Leste Report has a picture of a sunrise and a traditional fighter to show the birth of the nation. The Mongolia HDR has photographs on the front, back and in chapter headings that portray the ur- ban-rural divide in interesting ways. A comparison between the Lao PDR HDRs prepared in 1998 and 2001 helped to highlight the scope for improving the presentation of the report. (Table 4.2). 4.6 4.6 4.6 4.6 4.6Advocacy and Dissemination Advocacy and Dissemination Advocacy and Dissemination Advocacy and Dissemination Advocacy and Dissemination A well-developed communication and outreach strategy must start long before the completion of the Report and last long after the launch. In fact launching is not the same thing as dissemination. Hence, a professional but in-house communication team is a must. The team could help to: \ufffd Ensure that the NHDR comes up with strong message(s), interesting factoids or startling statistics \ufffd Identify and assess users\u2019 information needs \ufffd Identify potential target audiences before the launch of the report \ufffd Carefully plan the timing of dissemination of NHDR to maximise its impact \ufffd Include intended methods of monitoring/meas- uring impact in the dissemination plan \ufffd Involve the civil society (this is absolutely nec- essary). In DEX modalities, UNDP is in charge of the dis- semination and follow-up. UNDP can do this effec- tively, especially if it has a well-developed commu- nication section and it engages itself. In many NEX projects, the government does not have the infra- structure or money to do a large dissemination cam- paign, in which case UNDP should take over that responsibility. Dissemination and advocacy takes effort, time and money. UNDP should invest in it. A success story with regard to dissemination is the NHDR for Bosnia on youth (2003), for the prepa- ration of which 40 NGOs were involved. The re- port had an opening sentence that said it all: \u201c Ac- cording to a survey conducted by the Prism Re- search, 62% of youth in Bosnia would leave the country if given the opportunity. This is a catastro- phe.\u201d Its slogan was: \u201cWhere will I be in 2015?\u201d. The launch was designed by the authors in an in- novative manner, with politicians sitting in the first rows, video clips done by young artists, great me- dia coverage, free space for the clips and ads. The report had a national campaign, which started a month before the launch through street banners, leaflets, billboards, sugar bags, etc. There was a children\u2019s drawing competition- the best works were published in UNDP calendar for 2004.

Press kits as well as materials developed for dissemination among different target groups are needed. Bosnia found that advance leaks to some newspa- pers increased interest and prepared for a widely covered launch. Pakistan had produced excellent press kits to disseminate the 10 messages of the NHDR. On the basis of these experiences, some recommendations were made to improve advocacy and dissemination (Box 4.3). But the greatest limitation is in the area of follow- up. There is no guarantee that the recommendations made in the NHDR will be adopted by the policy and decision makers of the country. However, UNDP alone cannot follow-up on the recommen- dations, which are often beyond its mandate. This is where partnership with other agencies comes in, so that they can also conduct the advocacy. Greater feedback has to be solicited, not only to improve future NHDRs but also to keep the mes- sages of the current report in circulation. This can be done through: \ufffd Follow up discussions on the themes and mes- sages (seminars, online, media, etc.). Discussion Groups can be started at the national and global level on the findings (SURF networks can be used for this) \ufffd Making alliances with academic institutions and preparing courses \ufffd Organizing special programs for journalists \ufffd Making strategic alliances with NHDR teams from other countries, regions, etc. through the Global Network and bilaterally \ufffd Using discussion channels such as radio forums, talk shows, etc. Technologies could also be better used both for dis- semination and feedback.

In order to ensure an integrated and systematic pro- duction of NHDRs in Iran, the UNDP and the Government of Iran want to create a HDR Center, build the capacity in the Center and equip the Center with professionals and specialists. This resource Center could be linked to the Regional HDR Center and other COs to facilitate the exchange of experi- ences and best practices, etc. NHDRs are marketable products that can be sold.

Participants recounted the many positive examples of impact, although they have had more impact in raising specific advocacy issues than forging real political changes, especially in terms of socio-economic programming on pov- erty issues and human rights. Most agreed, however, that one of the most visible impacts has been the improvement of statistical databases in the region. Impact assessment should be carried out both in the short and the long terms. Impact assessment has to do with: \ufffd The immediate results of the launch of the NHDR (which can be assessed quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of numbers of press arti- cles, dissemination and references, etc.) \ufffd More medium term advocacy issues \ufffd Long term policy changes. Impact can be assessed on: \ufffd Government policies and programmes \ufffd Legislative changes, and budgets approved by parliaments \ufffd Statistical offices, in terms of efforts to collect and disaggregate a larger pool of HD indicators \ufffd Programmatic changes within UNDP, evaluated through the SRF framework and reflected in in- struments such as the CCF, etc. \ufffd Changes in priorities of donors, reflected in such documents as the CCA, UNDAF, etc. \ufffd Actions of the civil society, in terms of specific advocacy, etc. \ufffd Actions of the private sector, in terms of pursu- ing a specific issue, linking projects, etc. \ufffd Universities and academic institutions that teach alternative economic theories, and whether they include HD or design new courses on the subject. Furthermore, it is necessary to keep in mind the impact from the NHDR product itself, as well as, and often more important, the NHDR process. The process can have long-term impact in terms of ca- pacity, ownership, team building etc. As part of taking stock, assessing the impact of HDRs is obviously important. It can help in address- ing and minimizing limitations thereby enhancing potential to promote human development. For this it is necessary to be able to answer questions about the different ways in which a protagonist of the HDRs could expect impact (Box 4.4). One might reasonably expect impact during all three phases of an HDR \u2013 the preparation process, the publication of the product, and its dissemination. However, the expected impacts are quite different for regional and national (and even sub national) re- ports arising out of the distinct objectives they aim to serve. Further, short-term impacts are likely to be different from long term ones. With regard to the impact of NHDRs in mainstreaming HD into National Planning in Asia Pacific, participants attempted to make an assessment for their respective countries (Table 4.3). But HDRs have also an impact on UNDP. Mini- mum standards set that should be met by any HDR, with regard to the process, product and advocacy also have implications for UNDP (Box 4.5).

The HD concept has now gradually been integrated into national socio-economic development planning and UNDP has been a catalyst in making this happen. Previ- ous HDRs received support and substantial contribution from China\u2019s National Development and Reform commission. Ideas and policy recommendation of these reports have been partially adopted. HD Indices have been used as tools for planning and progress monitoring at na- tional and sub-national levels. The concept of human development as means and end of development has been articulated in the past two state guidelines. The NHDRs are little used other than for information, rather than integrating them into national planning. There is capacity limitation of national staff and contributors. A new project will deal with the limitations of previous processes: capacity building, report preparation and dissemination. In Malaysia, health, education and economic programs and progress including women development are monitored by the respective central agencies and documented regu- larly in the official plan documents. How best does HD complement the programs already laid down by those agencies. Some might think that HD is a duplicating effort or a mere academic process. It has been only six months since the publication of the first NHDR and the recom- mendations are still being actively followed up with the government. The process of preparation of NHDRs is relatively new in Pakistan and it would take some time to mainstream it in the National Planning Process. However, one can foresee short term and long-term impact, follow-up policies with civil society. This can be done through a conference every few years, organized by civil society, to evaluate and measure where we are.

BOX 4.5 NHDRs and UNDP NHDRs and UNDP NHDRs and UNDP NHDRs and UNDP NHDRs and UNDP Visibility, communication and outreach \ufffd NHDR is the flagship product of UNDP productions and normally helps attract attention to UNDP \ufffd By partnership building and involving researchers etc. into the process, NHDR helps enhance the visibility of UNDP both nationally and internationally \ufffd The launch activity is usually a great visibility, communication and outreach event, involving all aspects of the society \ufffd Distribution helps UNDP disseminate HD messages to all parts of the country. Institutional and Operational arrangement \ufffd The complex NHDR process is a great challenge to UNDP management skills, particularly its institutional and operational arrangement. In the process, best prac- tices emerge and experiences are accumulated. This helps improve the management and operational skills of UNDP in general, particularly its staff \ufffd Ideally, there needs to be sense of priority in the office to NHDR in terms of institutional and operational arrange- ment. An HRD network should be established within the office, composed of key policy officers. Capacity building and training \ufffd Training to NHDR focal points and staffs involved in the exercise \ufffd Training to the drafting team \ufffd Snowball effect. Skills of UNDP Focal Points which can be tapped into: \ufffd Knowledge of UNDP\u2019s work in the areas of Poverty, Envi- ronment, Governance and Crisis Prevention and Recovery \ufffd Knowledge of UNDP\u2019s strategic objectives and strategies \ufffd Experience in disseminating NHDR messages by means of report publishing, conferences, etc. \ufffd Analytical skills and ability to organize the processes once the HDR concepts are internalised. 31 MDGs and Human Development At the request of participants, this module was de- voted to addressing the concern of overlapping be- tween HDRs and Millennium Development Goals Reports (MDGRs) and MDG costing. It attempted to clarify complementarity/overlap between HDRs and MDGRs and other national processes such as Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs). 5.1 5.1 5.1 5.1 5.1 MDGs: Their Rationale and Costing MDGs: Their Rationale and Costing MDGs: Their Rationale and Costing MDGs: Their Rationale and Costing MDGs: Their Rationale and Costing The MDGs contribute to human development as they share a common motivation.

In particular: \ufffd Pro-poor polices/national strategies have to be in place (including infrastructure in poor areas, e.g. rural areas) \ufffd Public expenditure profile has to be focused on investing on human development \ufffd Governance, including combating corruption (with implications on the issue of efficient spend- ing), has to be promoted \ufffd Issues of assets and property rights have to be addressed \ufffd Costs and benefits with regard to the world trad- ing system and trade liberalisation have to be considered. With regard to financial resources, domestic resources are the most important source. Primary sources are tax revenues and domestic savings, and incentives could be given for domestic resource mobilization. With re- gard to foreign direct investment (FDI), countries need to attract more FDI. A necessary condition for this is consistency in policy and sound economic governance. The official development assistance (ODA) has also to increase and issues related to debt relief for the poorest countries, new borrowings and the problems of re- payments for sustainability (particularly where export revenues are poor) have to be addressed. Despite the fact that no single price tag can be at- tached to meeting the goals, various attempts have been made to quantify the costs. Those estimates provide an order of magnitude. Behind difference in costing there are key differences, e.g. absolute vs. relative cost, marginal vs. average unit cost, unit cost variations by countries, regional vs. national average cost, efficiency gains vs. quality costs, sav- ings from synergies across goals, etc. There are also methodological complications, which resulted in heated debates and multiplicity of estimates. However, no methodology is superior from a techni- cal ground.

UNDP has supported the preparation of a study to estimate the cost of attaining the MDGs in 6 coun- tries (Tanzania, Cameroon, Malawi, Uganda and the Philippines).2 The MDG targets considered under this study are: income poverty (Goal 1), primary education (Goal 2), health (comprising under five mortality rate and maternal mortality rate \u2013 Goals 4 and 5), HIV/AIDS (Goal 6) and water (Goal 7). This study has highlighted that more growth does not automatically translate into less poverty. There- fore growth, pro-poor policies, domestic resources, policy consistency by donors, foreign direct invest- ment, debt reduction/sustainability and increase ODA are needed. For the current income distribu- tion, significant acceleration of GDP growth would be required in almost all cases: \ufffd Tanzania (low HDI): minimum of 5% (3.1% in the 1990s) \ufffd Cameroon (low HDI): 7% (1.7% in the 1990s) \ufffd Malawi (low HDI): 6% (4.2% in the 1990s) \ufffd Philippines (medium HDI): 5-6% (3.2% in the 1990s) \ufffd Uganda (low HDI): on track (present, which is 5-8%, is above 5% requirement). According to the findings of this study, the additional resources required (2002-2015) to meet the targets related to social services in the Philippines are: \ufffd Primary education: US$ 464 million in 2002 fall- ing to zero in 2007 \ufffd Health: US$ 131 million in 2002, falling to zero in 2008 \ufffd Water: US$ 22 million in 2002, falling to zero in 2014 The need to assess and document where we stand with regard to the MDGs has resulted in the prepa- ration of MDGRs at the country level.

Devolution of powers to local governments is the most sweeping reform in governance worldwide, particularly over the past two decades. Yet, compared to reforms in liberalization of markets and removal of trade barriers, it is rarely in the public eye. Local government design presents a host of unique challenges to policy makers. The building blocks of good local governance are many, not least an effective approach to ensure that women and marginalized groups are true partners. These systems ought to go beyond merely providing an opportunity for the voices of poor and marginalized to be heard, but must pro-actively encourage them to do so. Enabling large numbers of ordinary people to compete in elections ought to irreversibly strengthen the foundations of democracy and constitutes the best antidote to the increasing tendency to show disinterest in government. The design of an electoral system is the cornerstone of democracy, with many long-term consequences for democratic governance. Sensitive structuring of formal electoral processes at the local level can strengthen local democracy immeasurably, by enabling wider representation and strengthening accountability. Bad design of election and administrative systems could throw open the doors to elite capture, lack of accountability and inability of local body members to ensure that the body effectively assumes the responsibility for matters devolved upon it. However, elections alone are not synonymous with democracy. Good system design must also ensure that local bodies, once elected, can effectively respond to a myriad of local governance challenges. While most efforts to strengthen participation in local governance focus on direct participation, for example, the involvement of citizens and community-based organizations in planning and implementation, considerably less attention is given to the design of fiscal devolution and fund transfer mechanisms, accounting processes, technical support provision, the periodic reporting of performance and monitoring and evaluation. The urgency to examine and learn how to devise fair, inclusive and representative systems and administrative structures for ensuring the vigour of practice of democracy on a day-to-day basis is particularly relevant to Asia-Pacific because too many of the region\u2019s countries continue to be deeply divided along fundamental political cleavages of ethnicity, region, caste, class. This Guide has been produced by UNDP\u2019s Regional Initiative on Local Democracy in Asia to address the need for more knowledge on the state of local representative systems in Asia-Pacific, and to explore what is necessary to improve them and ensure more inclusive involvement in decisions affecting peoples\u2019 lives. The Guide gives an overview of the institutional arrangements at the local level in 22 countries and contains a systematic accumulation of evidence and offers practical examples from across the region to illustrate its themes. iii iv I do hope that this Guide will contribute to an understanding of the issues and add to the experience in designing inclusive and accountable local representative institutions, not only among those directly involved in government reform but also among those who contribute to broader national and regional debates on addressing these common challenges. In the process, I am sure that they will contribute to building stronger communities and accelerate human development, to which UNDP is ultimately committed.

Acknowledgements This Guide has three basic objectives: \u25cf To summarize findings about local government (LG) electoral processes and representation arrangements in a range of countries in Asia and the Pacific \u25cf To highlight, on a thematic basis, key issues related to representation and electoral processes at the local level, in terms of tradeoffs, incentives and implications \u25cf To put forward hypotheses on ways forward in further developing electoral representation at sub-national levels To this end, the Guide comprises two parts. The first part provides an overview and analysis of the key concepts and issues related to representation and electoral processes at the local level, illustrated by a variety of practical cases. The second part includes a detailed review of the representational systems in nine countries in South and West Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka), seven countries in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Timor-Leste, Thailand and Viet Nam), three countries in East Asia (China, Mongolia and Republic of Korea), and three Pacific countries (Fiji, Papua New Guinea [PNG] and Solomon Islands). This Guide is to be used in conjunction with the study on Local Democratic Institutions in Asia: Lessons Learned on Inclusiveness and Accountability (UNDP 2008), which closely examines links between representation and accountability \u2013 both the ways that electoral modalities can improve representation, and the types of accountability mechanisms that can secure adequate representation. The study is based on comparative analysis of five Asian countries\u2019 mechanisms that can affect the degree of accountability in local governance, and with respect to local governments in particular, asking what works to secure better representation where, when and how.

ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS In Asia and the Pacific, local representative institutions constitute for many citizens one of the most important avenues for participation in governance and influence over decision-making directly relevant to their livelihoods. However, the question of fair representation often has received insufficient attention. Whether political parties formally constitute the basis for local politics or not, local-level \u201cdemocracy\u201d is frequently an arena where political parties and powerful individuals have ample opportunities to use their money and influence to marginalize competitors. Across Asia and the Pacific, it has proven easy for the strong candidates in local politics to win, leaving behind candidates who represent minorities/ethnic groups or who have less muscle and money. In particular, in societies that are deeply divided along ethnic, religious, caste and class bases, it is essential to devise a system that is fair and representative, and that contributes to the future of a stable democracy. To date, the collective evidence from the design of systems for representation and elections in divided societies suggests that an appropriately crafted framework can help nurture the accountability and commitment of political parties, while an inappropriate system can severely harm the process of democratization. The framework for representation is among the most important mechanisms that shape local democracy. Decisions on the modalities for representative participation1 and the choice of electoral system \u2013 the rules and procedures through which votes cast in an election are translated into representation \u2013 determine the extent to which local decision-making bodies are genuinely democratic, inclusive and gender-sensitive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b734cdf5-9fef-42ba-88a1-b92ed5f8545a": {"__data__": {"id_": "b734cdf5-9fef-42ba-88a1-b92ed5f8545a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fab5502e97b174b97a2d2c79130ba70e55687d5a0f85fb63b32b69ec7e6fb41"}, "2": {"node_id": "b839d7b0-2680-4a27-a842-43e78999e680", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db17da9a74c328a1f8be82c6e635086b20a3b9dafa1c036dd3466be28716207d"}}, "hash": "586c9732da2d2814fe596fb1f267856b29b621bd285984606ebcf1a806dedc96", "text": "They can influence other aspects of the political system, including the development of political parties, and are important to issues such as linking citizens and their leaders for more political accountability, representation and responsiveness.

The first step of the initiative, launched in 2004, was to analyze various approaches applied in countries in the region and develop an overview of the issues and principles. The first draft of this Guide was the end result, and provided the documentary basis for a two-day workshop2 (22-23 June 2005) on Representation in Decentralized Local Governance held at Hua Hin, Thailand. At the workshop, the country evidence that laid the basis for the Guide was taken up and discussed in greater detail. The Guide has been revised and refined to reflect the workshop discussions, as well as expanded to cover additional countries and updated in light of numerous recent developments. The Hua Hin workshop further pointed to the need for more systematic collection and appraisal of the evidence in order to study the links between representation and accountability \u2013 both the ways that electoral modalities can improve representation and the types of accountability mechanisms that can secure adequate representation. In line with these discussions, the second phase of the initiative focused on the important role that improved representation can have on the accountability of LG bodies to those traditionally denied influence, on the one hand, and on the ways that accountability might facilitate and secure improved influence over representatives, on the other. For example, the presence of a set of different types of accountability mechanisms, designed to support the objective of securing more inclusive and representative local governance, was seen to be necessary for more effective, responsive and equitable LG. Building on the work undertaken for this Guide, the second phase of the initiative required studying the ways in which representation has been made more accountable through electoral reforms and affirmative action in different countries, as well as analyzing the types of accountability mechanisms in place and asking what works to secure better representation where, when and how. 2 See http://regionalcentrebangkok.undp.or.th/practices/governance/documents/ Report_Decentralized_Gov_Regional_RetreatJune2005.pdf 3 See http://regionalcentrebangkok.undp.or.th/practices/governance/decentralization/Representation.html Accordingly, the study Local Democratic Institutions in Asia: Lessons Learned on Inclusiveness and Accountability (UNDP 2008), based on the work carried out in the second phase of the initiative, includes an important research component. The objective of the research is to explore different types of mechanisms that can affect the degree of accountability in local governance, and with respect to LG in particular. Country studies in India, Iran, Pakistan, Philippines and Thailand provide the basis for a comparative analysis of the ways in which different systems of representation in LG affect its accountability, along with how accountability instruments might be used to achieve a more effective, equitable system of decentralized local governance. In addition to this Guide and the study on Local Democratic Institutions in Asia, a number of other UNDP knowledge products have been developed, including \u201cPresidentialism in Decentralized Governance: More Local Leadership, But at What Cost?\u201d and \u201cInclusive Local Governance: Representation and Affirmative Action.\u201d3 6 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS 8 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS The LG electoral systems summarily presented and described at the end of this Guide show how bewilderingly variable representational procedures can be.

In Bangladesh, this is simply because the constitutional provisions have not been implemented (aside from the brief Upazila Parishad experiment in the 1980s); for the other three countries, indirect elections take the form of either (i) lower-level leaders (usually directly elected by their constituencies) automatically becoming members of higher-level units, or (ii) a combination of (i) with an electoral college system, with lower-level council members constituting the electoral college, as in the cases of Pakistan and Nepal. Indirect systems are in many countries regarded as an extension of the traditional interface between village leaders and government at higher levels. In Southeast Asia, upper-level LG councils are generally made up of directly elected members; this is the case for both Indonesia and Viet Nam. In Philippines, however, upper-level LG councils comprise both directly and indirectly elected members, the latter usually being the representatives of lower-level councils. In the cases of Cambodia and Timor-Leste, there are as yet no upper LG levels. and electoral systems 2 Representational arrangements 9 Representational arrangements and electoral systems Wolesi Jirga and Provincial Councils election day, Afghanistan 2005 A number of issues arise here. Firstly, are directly elected officials more accountable to their constituents than indirectly elected officials? For example, in India, where all councillors at all levels are directly elected, can it be said that they are more accountable then their Nepali counterparts on District Councils, who are largely drawn from Village Councils? There is no hard and fast evidence on this \u2013 but common sense would tend to indicate that directly elected officials in upper-level LGs would be more accountable to their constituents for overseeing activities/functions specific to that level. Where councillors are indirectly elected from lower-level LGs, they clearly also owe some allegiance to their \u201cbase\u201d constituency, rather than to the larger constituency. However, direct elections for all levels of the LG system may have a down side in the greater likelihood of potential conflicts between different levels. Where upper-tier LG Councils are not drawn from members of lower-level LG Councils but are instead directly elected, political differences between levels may emerge. How far this can be problematic depends, of course, on what the organic linkages are between upper and lower tiers. In Indonesia, for example, each level of regional government is legally autonomous \u2013 thus, any political differences between the directly elected DPRDs and regional heads of provinces and regencies/cities should not, in principle, be a problem given their functional autonomy and differing responsibilities. However, where there are organic links between different levels of LG, as in India (where upper levels of the panchayat system coordinate or monitor with regard to lower tiers), or in Sri Lanka, then political differences between directly elected bodies at different levels may be more of a problem. In addition, much depends on the nature of fiscal relations between LG levels, or on how far upper levels (rather than central Government) are responsible for transfers to lower levels \u2013 but this is clearly beyond the scope of this Guide. On the other hand, in an LG system where elections to upper tiers are indirect, and most of the members of higher-level councils are drawn from the ranks of lower-tier councils, there may \u2013 for obvious reasons \u2013 be less potential for conflict. But this may be problematic in other ways, especially if upper tiers are expected to play a supervisory role with respect to lower-level LGs. In Nepal, for example, it is the district\u2019s internal audit section that is expected to audit the accounts of constituent VDCs \u2013 but given that VDCs are represented at district level by their chairpersons and vice chairpersons, how effective can one expect such internal audits to be?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

A potential virtue of indirect electoral systems for upper-tier councils may well be that they cost less than direct elections for all levels of LG, and that they may also be less complex (for voters). This is by no means unimportant given that many countries are fiscally strapped and may not be able to afford the luxury of direct elections for all levels of LG. Needless to say, however, the tradeoff for greater economy may well be weaker electoral accountability in higher-level LG councils. 17 Representational arrangements and electoral systems Direct and indirect elections for council chairpersons How chairpersons/mayors and vice chairpersons/deputy mayors are elected also varies from country to country, as well as in many cases between the different levels of LG within each country. In the case of India, the mode of election of panchayat and municipal leaders can also vary from state to state, depending on state legislation. In most (but not all) countries, the heads of the lowest level of LG are directly elected in one way or another. In the majority of cases, council heads are elected as such \u2013 a VDC chairperson in Nepal, for example, stands for that position in direct elections. In Sri Lanka and Cambodia, however, where elections are carried out on the basis of proportional representation/PR (see Section 2.2), councils are headed by the leaders of the parties with the most votes/seats \u2013 they are not, in that sense, directly chosen by the electorate. In the three Pacific countries (Fiji, PNG and Solomon Islands) lower-tier council heads are indirectly elected by their fellow councillors. In Pakistan and Indonesia, the heads and deputy heads of lower-level LG Councils are directly elected, but on the basis of a joint ticket \u2013 in Pakistan (at UC level) on a non-party basis, and in Indonesia on a party basis. At higher levels of LG, council heads often are elected by the members of that LG from amongst themselves or by members of subsidiary levels. In Bhutan, for example, the DYT chairperson is selected by DYT members from amongst themselves. In Nepal, on the other hand, DDC chairpersons and vice chairpersons are elected by the members of the Village and Municipal Councils that make up the district as a whole. Similarly, in Iran the mayors and village managers are indirectly elected. Since 2005, Pakistan has been somewhat different, in that the nazim of any tehsil/town or district/city is elected indirectly by an electoral college consisting of all union councillors in their respective constituencies. They are thus indirectly elected by all union councillors (including the Union Council leaders \u2013 Union nazims and naib nazims) in their respective jurisdictions \u2013 but cannot themselves be union councillors. Naib nazims at the tehsil/district levels, however, are indirectly elected by their respective councils (from amongst themselves), and not by a wider electoral college. Pakistan is clearly a hybrid case of indirect elections for local council leadership. In other cases (Indonesia, Philippines, Viet Nam), higher-level council heads are directly elected by ordinary voters. This appears to be the case only where upper-level councils are themselves directly elected by voters, not by electoral colleges); where upper-level councils are indirectly elected, council chairpersons are generally also indirectly elected.

The indirect election of the district nazim in Pakistan complicates the accountability linkage with voters because the re-election of an incumbent nazim is not decided directly by voters, but rather, by a few hundred union councillors.

Source: Manning et al. 2003 18 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Chairman of a Pradeshya Sabha, Sri Lanka A range of issues can be linked to the ways in which council leaders are elected: \u25cf A system whereby council chairpersons are indirectly elected by their councils does, in principle, offer the singular advantage of a more collegial and consensual form of local governance. Under such systems, mayors/chairpersons need to ensure regular support from their councils \u2013 and this may imply a tendency toward broad-based decision-making. Where councillors represent wards, this in turn implies that decision making may be more likely to take into account the interests of many constituents. \u25cf However, indirectly elected mayors or council chairpersons \u2013 unless they can ensure the allegiance of their councils and councillors \u2013 may become \u201clame ducks\u201d as they fall victim to party politics or to internal disputes within their councils. \u25cf Increasingly, indirect elections for council leaders are seen as problematic in terms of accountability. Indirectly elected council chairpersons may see themselves as more accountable to their immediate constituency (i.e., the individual electoral college that has selected them) than to local citizens. The previous inset hints at some of the accountability issues, and their consequences, related to Pakistan\u2019s indirect electoral system for nazims. \u25cf Conversely, to an increasing extent direct elections of council leaders are seen as more appropriate than indirect elections. A number of advantages are cited in favour of direct elections for mayors or council leaders4, inter alia: 4 See e.g. Human Development Viewpoint: Presidentialism in Decentralized Governance: More Local Leadership, But at What Cost?

A mayor who is directly elected is more clearly the preferred individual choice of local citizens than one indirectly elected by a limited number of councillors. S/he more manifestly expresses local preferences, which in turn contributes to strengthening and legitimating local democratic practice. \u25a0 Clearer separation of powers and functions between the executive and legislative branches at local level. This enables mayors or leaders to operate more independently of partisan interests of their councils and enables the latter to more clearly and unequivocally provide oversight of the directly elected mayor or council leader. \u25a0 Greater accountability, in the sense that a directly elected council chairperson or mayor is more clearly seen as individually responsible for delivering public goods and services and honouring electoral commitments. \u25a0 More effective LG, in that directly elected mayors can \u201cget on with their jobs\u201d more effectively than indirectly elected leaders. A \u201cgood\u201d directly elected mayor is likely to be more effective than a \u201cgood\u201d indirectly elected mayor, all other things being equal. \u25cf That said, the direct election of council chairpersons or mayors, as with all such \u201cpresidential\u201d figures, also may have its down side, inter alia: \u25a0 Excessive power being wielded by the directly elected mayor, in that directly elected leaders may see themselves (and be seen) as much more than a primus inter pares. Council chairpersons who are directly elected may overshadow fellow Council members by virtue of their much stronger electoral mandate and may thus stifle democratic debate in Council. This is one of the initial lessons from Thailand and Pakistan (which shifted to direct election in 2004 and 2005 respectively) and from Bangladesh, where directly elected Union Parishad chairpersons exert a powerful influence over local affairs, leading to apathy amongst other members. \u25a0 The risk of political stalemate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43703daa-06ac-45ef-89e7-c94fb3d473d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "43703daa-06ac-45ef-89e7-c94fb3d473d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0eb6fe406bb0c1567c528ea1e3c655ef80c52c7f0bbf16efffed29281bc07b8"}, "2": {"node_id": "1827faa9-6763-4134-a244-2d33aa3e4038", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e8b5492d5e91ed1ef6a3a03d94d560cfc28b29aaddb2df6bf19d66b006460cf5"}}, "hash": "13930d10e004ca116a39fd4a20b099d0cff6d6e90733458a219bf1072852f6c6", "text": "\u25a0 The risk of political stalemate.

The extent to which all such categories of non-elected council members enjoy full voting powers varies from country to country. Presidentialism in local governance: more leadership, but at what costs? \u201c\u2026 Not unlike their national equivalents, local \u2018presidentialism\u2019 is more dependent on the character of the individual leader than are indirectly elected heads. Overall, it seems, a \u2018good\u2019 directly elected chair is likely to be more effective than a \u2018good\u2019 indirectly elected chair, but a \u2018bad\u2019 directly elected chair is likely to be much \u2018worse\u2019 than their indirectly elected predecessors \u2013 implying that identifying and establishing appropriate new forms of accountability mechanisms and checks and balances will be even more crucial.\u201d From Human Development Viewpoint: Presidentialism in Decentralized Governance: More Leadership, But at What Cost? (Larsen, 2005). 20 In some cases, members of national assemblies are ex officio members of the LGs of their constituencies (e.g., in District Councils and DDCs in Nepal, LSGA 1999, Article 172). This is most evident in PNG\u2019s Provincial Assemblies, which are led by provincial MPs and include all national parliamentarians from the province. In other cases, officials from the local administrations are also represented on councils, although they then often act as observers without voting rights. This is the case in Bhutan and Nepal, where the interim local bodies in place since 2002 have been chaired by the local development officer (the previous secretary to the District Development Committees appointed by the Ministry of Local Development). In addition, representatives of sectoral Ministries at the level of LG are in some cases represented. Several issues concerning such appointments merit attention here: \u25cf Non-elective appointment of interest group representatives. Although this is often for laudable reasons (such as affirmative action), it does raise the issue of how and on what basis such representatives are selected \u2013 and how representative they really are. In Nepal, where Village and District Councils (as well as their corresponding committees) are expected to choose representatives of women, the poor and other disadvantaged groups, it is frequently thought that they are elite members, selected for less than laudable reasons. The same comments apply to the pre-1997 LG representational arrangements in Bangladesh, under which women members of Union Parishads were selected by UP Chairpersons. How far such appointees \u201crepresent\u201d their interest groups is moot. \u25cf Who does the appointing? Where appointments to councils are or can be made by institutions or other local councils, the legitimacy of the appointment may be questioned. The power of state governments in India to appoint council members as \u201cresource persons\u201d is a case in point. \u25cf Parliamentarians as ex officio members of local councils. Evidence shows that the ex officio involvement of national-level MPs in LG bodies almost always is a distorting influence, tending to cater much more to local elite/factional interests or national party concerns than do LG councillors. Moreover, they tend to overwhelm locally elected councillors. The case of PNG\u2019s provincial assemblies is even more revealing of the problems associated with higher-level politicians being included in LG councils. The reformed political structures outlined in the 1995 Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments of PNG were designed to ensure representation of members of Parliament in LLGs. It implies that members of Parliament who represent district electorates in a province are members of the Provincial Assembly. These members also serve as provincial governors and chairs of Provincial Executive councils. In addition, joint district planning and budget priorities committees are chaired by the members of Parliament representing each district electorate, and provincial administrators are nominated by members of Parliament in the Provincial Executive councils.
