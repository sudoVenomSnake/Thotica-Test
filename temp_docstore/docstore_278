Eight years ago he was allotted 1.27 acres of land by the Government of Karnataka for which he paid a bribe of Rs 650 to the VA. But even after that his name was not entered into the land record system. He came to a Bhoomi centre three months ago and applied for a mutation over the counter. To his surprise, within a month he got the mutation order. When he came to consult a doctor in the city he dropped by at the Bhoomi counter where, in only five minutes at a cost of Rs15, he received the corrected copy of the RTC.

It is envisaged to scale up the Simputer (or some more cost-effective hand held device) to all 10,000 VAs of the state to integrate the back-end processing. Recommendations It is important to convert the land records into measurements of hectares and boundaries rather than plots provided in a matrix (in metres). The Bhoomi project still depicts areas in guntas and acres, and boundaries in feet. There is no provision of maps through the Bhoomi kiosks as they are still in the experimental stage of scanning or digitizing village maps. The farmers have to depend on VAs for maps of their land records. There is still a problem in Unicode standardization of Kannada fonts. At present, Bhoomi is providing only land records with entries after 1999 because the records before 1999 have not been updated and validated. For the growth of the project, it is recommended that all land records prior to this year be updated and validated as well. Villagers have to walk 10-35 km to the taluka headquarters to get computerized copies of land records. It is further recommended the project be extended to remote villages, so that the villagers are provided with closer access. The project is over-dependent on proprietary software (Oracle and Microsoft) and it is necessary to shift to open source software like Linux to cut costs. Non-agricultural land data are still not entered into the databases. Citizens in need of records pertaining to non-agricultural land have to depend on the manual system. This should be rectified. Bar coding of land records can also be used to improve their validity.

The project was started on 4 November 1998. Presently, the project covers the whole state of Andhra Pradesh. Goals and Objectives G To simplify the registration procedure. G To enhance the speed, reliability and consistency of the system. G To provide transparency in valuation. G To replace copying/filing systems with imaging. G To preserve documents on CDs. G To automate all back-office functions. G To enable a system that enables setting time and quality standards. G To smoothen the government-citizen interface. Planning After the success of the two pilots, the project was scaled up in two phases. In 2000, the first phase was extended to 181 SROs. In 2001, the second phase was extended to 249 SROs. By the time of the study, all 387 SROs were covered under the CARD project. Services Provided All the services of the Registration Department are provided to citizens for nominal user charges. The most popular services are registration of deeds, issue of encumbrance certificates and market value searches. The prevalent user charges are: Rs 95 for registration of documents (maximum of 10 pages with Rs 5 for every additional page), Rs 10 for motor vehicle search certificates, Rs 20 for encumberancy certificates and Rs 20 for certified copies of the documents. Target Group and Intended Beneficiaries The intended beneficiaries are all the citizens who want to register their deeds, get a valuation of their immovable property, certified copies of documents, encumbrance certificates and to register societies, firms, marriages, etc. Institutional Arrangements The Inspector General of Registration and Stamps heads the project, supported by the Technical Director (NIC), Chief Information Officer and Deputy Inspector General (IGRAS). Each District Registrar is responsible for the Computer-Aided Administration of Registration Department (CARD) Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 55 Empowering the Poor functioning of CARD in the SROs under the district. One official from each District Registrar Office (DRO), at the rank of a senior clerk, takes up the task of the Data Processing Officer for two to five SROs, after intensive training. Each SRO has at least two data entry operators (one clerk and one section writer). All the hardware and maintenance of the LAN is handled by WIPRO, a private IT company, which has been awarded a maintenance contract for five years. All the software upgrades are done by NIC. Technologies The project works on a LAN. On every 387 SRO CARD office centre, there is provision for one server and four computers (three for B category SRO centres, two for C, D, E category SRO centres and one for F category centres). Each centre is provided with a scanner, a laser printer, a dot matrix printer and a UPS. The server uses Linux as the Operating System along with Oracle 8i for databases. The client end uses Developer 2000 whereas the front end is Windows 98/95 as well as Windows 98 for scanning. The uptime of the system is more than 98 percent, owing to an effective maintenance contract. Each district office is linked through a network, through dial-up connectivity to the Inspector General of Registration and Stamps office server. The software takes care of security through a username and password and also maintains an audit for all activities. Automatic How effective is CARD in simplifying and speeding up the registration of deeds and other services Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 56 backup of documents occurs at the client and server ends. Primary Access Points Primary access points for the citizens are the 387 SROs in the state. Capacity Building The project is implemented and managed by in-house staff. There are two clerks in each SRO. In all, 1,400 clerks/section writers have been given two-week training to take up the job of data entry operators; 76 senior clerks have been given 10-week training to take up the job of data processing operator job; 67 Assistant District Registrars have been given three-week training; and 40 District Registrars have been given one-week training. Roughly, 3,811 man weeks (76 man years) of training have been imparted so far. Technical staff has also been given training on the CARD software. User manuals on CARD and the imaging software have also been issued. Constraints and Implementation Challenges Some legislation such as the Registration and Stamps Act, Urban Land Ceiling Act, Surplus Agriculture Land Act, Endowment Property Act, and the Property Act needed a change to accommodate the new procedure.

Properties change names, categories, size and utility over time and there are discrepancies in different departmental documents. The codification of all property types was a huge task. Similarly, guidelines for the costs of land and buildings as well as for the different purposes and areas covered had to be digitized. The guidelines for the market rates for municipal corporations, municipalities, other urban areas, major gram panchayats, minor gram panchayats, and cantonment boards were decided differently for 80 land types (such as residential, commercial, industrial, agriculture, dry land, etc.). The documents and deeds registered since 1983 have already been scanned and stored on CDs. The problem of shifting from the manual system to the new system was solved by computerizing all processes and procedures required at all the steps from acknowledgement of receipt to issue of a registered document. More than 5,000 government staff were trained in the new system. Maintenance of hardware, especially in remote rural areas, was arranged for by signing a maintenance contract with WIPRO. Power cuts of more than 12 hours were mitigated by installing UPSs at all the offices. Project Outcomes The project has increased the speed of registering property and producing related documents. Previously, citizens had to wait for three to seven days to obtain encumbrance certificates. After the CARD system was implemented, they receives such certificates in just 10 minutes. Similarly, certified copies of the documents were issued after seven days, while through CARD, citizens can now get them in only 15 minutes. The time taken to register a deed or a document has been reduced from three to seven days to one day. The CARD project registers 1.18 million documents and serves 5 million citizens in a year. Since the inception of the project, 4 million documents have been registered, 2.16 million encumberance certificates have been issued, 3.73 million registration check slips have been issued and 75,907 certified copies have been provided to the public. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 57 Empowering the Poor Human Interest Stories In a few seconds, please Thirty-six-year-old S.K. Gase works as an Estate Manager in Nagarjuna Consultancy. His employer bought 10.32 acres of land in Datanpally village, and his office sent him to find out the market value of the property, stamp duty and registration fees for the documentation. Gase came to Chevella SRO and submitted his application. Within 30 seconds, he learnt that the value of the property was Rs 29,000 per acre. He also got the information that he had to pay Rs 1,740 as stamp duty, Rs 1,450 as transfer duty tax and Rs 145 as registration fee. \u201cMy job has become so hassle free\u201d Venkateshwar Reddy, a 38-year-old Recovery Executive at Rajdhani Urban Cooperative Bank, has been visiting many SROs every day Key Lessons Learnt The project has been successfully implemented state-wide at a minimum cost. It shows that e-government solutions can be implemented in a span of three to four years, even with innumerable complications and procedures. The project also proves the hypothesis that e-government could be implemented by just training the existing staff, without adding new technical staff. Another lesson is that in the absence of PPP, public finances can be mobilized to get projects implemented. Sustainability The project has improved the government- citizen interface. Around Rs 300 million has been spent on the project, but no impact assessment had been carried out by the time of the study. The increase in revenue collection through CARD has still not been proven, but the project has generated more than it has invested since 1999. Rs 380 million have been generated from the registration of documents, Rs 37 million from the issuance of registration check slips, Rs 43 million from encumberancy certificates and Rs 1 million from certified copies. Up to the time of the study, the project had earned Rs 475 million against a one-time investment of Rs 300 million. The project will become further sustainable if all the services could be successfully made available online. Replication and Scaling Up The project has already been implemented in all the SRO centres in the state. Now, it is planned to network all SRO centres to the DROs through 64 Kbps dedicated leased lines and all DROs with state servers through 128 Kbps dedicated leased lines.

Similarly, the department aims to upload record of documents on the web. The long-term vision is to provide all the services of the Registration Departments through the web. The project has been replicated in the states of Maharashtra and Punjab with a few modifications. In Maharashtra, the entire project is implemented in an innovative PPP, in which government provides data, premises and service operators whereas the private partner takes care of the hardware, software, and network support and management of the facility. Recommendations Presently, besides photocopies, four copies of a CD of the registered documents are stored (two for the SRO, one for the DRO and one for the IGRAS). It is recommended that the triplication of storage and archiving of documents be eliminated. There seems to be an extra computer at each SRO: offices with four computers have three operators, those with three computers have two operators and those with two computers have one operator. The reason for the provision of one extra computer at all 387 SRO centres is not clear. It is recommended that this proportion be rationalized according to the workload. All the hardware provided to 103 SROs in the year 2000 needs to be changed or urgently upgraded. It is also recommended that the software should be upgraded so that scanned/digitized photographs of the people involved in the registration process could be electronically pasted onto the original and stored documents. This will dramatically improve the authenticity of the documents and the procedures. There is no monitoring of MIS in the SRO offices on a daily or weekly basis. The MIS monitoring system needs to be improved at DRO and IGRAS levels. Before spending Rs 50 million on networking SRO and DRO offices with 64 and 128 Kbps lease lines, it is strongly recommended that a feasibility study be carried out. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 59 Empowering the Poor Background The project of setting up Community Information Centres (CICs) in Sikkim was launched by the Government of India in September 2000. Of a total of 487 such centres in the North Eastern Region of India, Sikkim was allotted 40 centres. A CIC is essentially a computer centre, equipped with six computers (server plus five client machines), printers (one laser and one dot matrix), a generator, and a direct satellite link for accessing the Internet. Two computer operators/instructors have been posted at each centre. The CICs have been set up with a view to spread ICT awareness among the people, both at rural and urban levels. The intention is to bridge the gap between the connected elite and the non-connected masses. The 40 CICs have been spread over Sikkim at altitudes as low as almost sea level and as high as 10,000 ft above sea level. The users are also equally diverse \u2013 from yak herders to the urban elite. Goals and Objectives The main objective is to spread the use of computers in various aspects of daily life, to promote the use of the Internet and for rural people to participate equally in the modern world. Through CICs, the rural people can download forms (e.g. birth certificates, employment cards, etc.) and obtain prices of agricultural commodities in different markets which can provide financial benefit to farmers. Planning It is proposed to use the CICs for e-edutainment in the future.

The CICs also provide useful information on educational and employment opportunities. Several application forms for old age pensions, employment cards, driving licenses, ration cards, etc., can also be downloaded from the centres. Target Group and Intended Beneficiaries The primary target groups in Sikkim are the villagers staying in remote and hilly terrain of the North-Eastern area. One kiosk has been created at every block headquarter and it caters to all the villagers in that block. Institutional Arrangements It was decided by the IT Department that the day- to-day running of each CIC would be handed over Community Information Centres Gangtok, Sikkim Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 60 to a committee consisting of the local panchayat president, or school principal or Rural Development Agency Director, as one member plus one CIC operator. However, the physical maintenance of equipment would be done by NIC and the disbursement of salaries by the IT Department. Technologies Each CIC is well-equipped with equipment, including one server machine, five client systems, one each of a VSAT, laser printer, dot matrix printer, modem, LAN hub, TV, web camera and two UPSs (1 KVA, 2 KVA). Each CIC has two CIC Operators (CICOs) to manage the centre and provide services to the public. The project is a joint effort of the Department of Information Technology (DIT) under the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT), NIC and the state governments of the North-Eastern states. Primary Access Points Primary access points are the kiosks (CICs) created at each block headquarter, catering to around 50-100 villages. Capacity Building Since first opening in Yuksam, the CIC has seen the successful completion of the Basic Computer Awareness Training Programme for the first 10 batches of trainees and there has been an increasing number of interested persons. More than 80 people have been trained over the last three months, including 25 How effective are the Community Information Centres in providing access to information, education, markets and governance A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 61 Empowering the Poor students, 10 housewives, 15 farmers, 18 teachers, and eight panchayati representatives. The trainees were in an age group ranging from 10 to 78 years, including schoolchildren, college students, NGO members, secondary and pre- school teachers, nurses, doctors, ration shop owners, forest guards, farmers, radio mechanics, barbers, small shop owners, tourist guides, porters, hoteliers, hotel receptionists and others. The CIC also took special care to conduct lessons for the less educated local people. Constraints and Implementation Challenges The project has been implemented in the most difficult hilly terrain of India, in an area that is predominately inhabited by tribal communities. The geographical condition of the area is such that one CIC in one block (catering to 50-100 villages) is quite far away from the houses of most of the villagers. The level of computerization and database development in north-eastern states of India is poor, making it difficult to implement the project. CIC managers are government servants or volunteers paid a monthly honorarium. This has resulted in a lack of enterprise at the kiosk (CIC) level. Heavy capital investments in the CICs and the network have caused increased inputs into maintenance and the management of technology. It has become very difficult to maintain the equipment in far-flung areas. Most services provided in the project are not considered essential or useful by most villagers. A lack of IT-skilled manpower in these areas has also been a major stumbling block in driving the technology and its impact down to the communities. Project Outcomes This project has not been very successful in achieving its goals and objectives. Most CICs are equipped with high-end technology equipment and hardware. But its utilization is sub-optimal. Only a handful of users come to the kiosks which indicates the poor outcomes of the project.

The kiosks can be operated more efficiently by entrepreneurs working on a profit-sharing basis. It is also important to create services that are considered essential, or useful, by the community, or the usage may turn out to be a disappointment. Providing Internet access at kiosks does not necessarily mean that the community will become well equipped to handle and use Internet facilities. Sustainability Many operational CICs charge nominal amounts from users for services which helps them to meet day-to-day running expenses for consumables, stationery, fuel for the Genset, etc. DIT/NIC will continue to provide manpower support to the CICs for five years and NIC will provide technical and maintenance support for this period. They will continue to provide satellite connectivity after five years. The CICs will then be handed over to the respective state governments. The private sector may collaborate with government for effective service delivery. Substantive revenue generation has been partly achieved by many CICs such as Golaghat, Assam and Gangtok, Sikkim, which pay the salaries of the operators from their revenue. Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 62 Replication and Scaling Up The project is to be replicated and implemented in all the blocks of all seven north- eastern states of India. But this scaling up will be done through funds provided by the Government of India. As the project is not sustainable or economically feasible, the chances of its replicability in any other part of India are remote. Recommendations It is recommended that the project should focus more on the community and less on technology. It would be better if the Human Interest Story \u201cI couldn\u2019t find the revenue official, but got land records from the kiosk\u201d The owner of a petrol pump, Parmanand Modi, wanted a copy of land records of his petrol pump land to get a bank loan. He searched for the patwari and could not locate him for three days. The bankers were insisting on filing the application in time so management of the project were taken away from NIC and given to some local body or a voluntary organization. More CIC activities should be taken up by the communities in order to improve community involvement and participation in the project. It is recommended that, in the operation of CICs, government servants should be replaced by volunteers engaged from within the community who work on a profit sharing basis. It is also important to create more locally relevant content. It is suggested that the usage of the CICs would improve if low cost training sessions on computers and ICT are provided. It is also recommended that users be charged for all services. that the loan could be sanctioned before the end of the financial year. Parmanand\u2019s employee went to the kiosk and asked the kiosk manager whether the land records of the petrol pump were stored in the computer. The kiosk manager took Rs 25 and gave him copies of the records. Parmanand confirmed with the branch manager that the copies of the records from the CIC were acceptable at the bank. Later, the timely submission of the application resulted in the sanction of his loan. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 63 Empowering the Poor Background ITC Limited is one of India's leading diversified conglomerates. Traditionally a tobacco and cigarette producer, it has grown into a conglomerate dealing in hotels, packaging, agribusiness, IT, and fast moving consumer goods (FMCGs). ITC initiated its e-Choupal project in 2000 to streamline its dealings with Indian farmers. This is a project on a massive scale that ultimately aims to cover every sixth Indian village. Each choupal covers around six villages and 36,000 villages have been covered to date in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. Goals and Objectives e-Choupal aims to provide Indian farmers ready access to crop-specific real-time information and customized knowledge in their native language. By doing so, ITC wants to improves the farmers\u2019 decision-making ability, thereby helping them to better align their farm output to the projected demand in Indian and international markets. Planning e-Choupal, the web-based initiative of ITC's International Business Division, offers the farmers of India all the information, products and services they need to enhance farm productivity, improve farm-gate price realization and cut transaction costs.

ITC plans to operate such kiosks so that it can create an electronic stock exchange for the marketing of agricultural commodities through the use of ICTs. Services Provided e-Choupals help farmers realize larger harvests by providing them with the latest weather reports and best farming practices. The information is retrieved from the Internet or caches on hard disks, and is made available in the relevant local languages. Static content is installed on hard disk while setting up the Choupals or is made available on CDs. The e-Choupals also offer other critical services such as soil- and water-testing, which can further help farmers to enhance their yields. Apart from providing information on soya, the kiosks also have information about FMCGs and help villagers buy various products such as motorbikes, bicycles, tractors, etc. Importantly, insurance is one of the common products that is being sold across the network. e-Choupals have a facility for providing life insurance policies, goods insurance and other policies to the villagers. This service has added an extra benefit to the villagers in terms of minimizing their cost on travel. e-Choupal portals use Indian languages: Hindi, Marathi, Kannada, and Telugu. Through them, farmers can access the latest local and global information on weather, scientific farming practices, and market prices at the village level. e-Choupals also facilitate the supply of high quality farm inputs as well as purchase of produce at the farmers\u2019 doorstep. e-Choupal Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 64 Target Group and Intended Beneficiaries The e-Choupal initiative strives to transform the Indian farmer into a knowledge-seeking producer. Farmers\u2019 access to information will help them make the right choice about farm inputs and agricultural commodities. The major focus of e-Choupal is on small and marginalized farmers. Institutional Arrangements The e-Choupal network is managed by the International Business Division of ITC Limited. Sanchalaks, the trusted local farmers who run the individual Choupals, are not official employees of ITC but serve as extended parts of the ITC organization, and simultaneously as commodity brokers and consumer goods salesmen. ITC leverages the knowledge of the Sanyojaks who are grain merchants or wholesale dealers co-opted into the project. They are familiar with the land and have long-standing relationships with the villagers. They help manage the logistics of the e-Choupal network. Sanyojaks assist ITC teams in setting up new e-Choupals by conducting village surveys and helping identify the best Sanchalaks. They also help facilitate transactions by maintaining records, collecting price data from local mandis, and managing the physical flow of goods. In this manner, they still serve to compensate for infrastructure gaps along the supply chain, but no longer obstruct the flow of information and How effective is e-Choupal in providing farmers access to crop-specific real-time information A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 65 Empowering the Poor market signals. The Sanyojaks are paid commissions based on the services they render, and typically make more money as part of the e-Choupal network than they did independently. Technologies The Choupals use Pentium computers along with a dot matrix printer and a UPS (500VA). ITC had initially upgraded telephone exchanges by using RAX Network Synchronization kits, but eventually in most e-Choupals, wireless VSAT links have been installed by bypassing the exchanges. Even with these improvements, the bandwidth often remains limited. Hence, e-Choupals have started compensating by caching static content locally. ITC also uses a specially designed template for managing data combined with new imaging techniques in order to speed up downloads and to optimize bandwidth use. To overcome the problem of sporadic electricity, several kiosk computers use back-up batteries recharged with solar panels. Primary Access Points Primary access points for the farmers are the e-Choupals, each located between six villages (42 such kiosks in Ujjain district). The kiosk has a website \u2013 http://www.echoupal.com \u2013 which contains all the information regarding agricultural products.

The other major challenge for this project is to recruit a suitable person from each village who has leadership qualities and minimum education. The project also has to surmount regulatory barriers. The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act prohibits the purchase of specified commodities (including several that ITC deals in) from any source other than at government-designated mandis. ITC has overcome this challenge by convincing the political and bureaucratic leadership of various state governments that the \u2018spirit\u2019 of the Act (to benefit the farmers) is better served through e-Choupals. As a result, some states have amended the Act, while others have allowed specific exemptions for such new business models. Project Outcomes G Enhanced relationship with the farming community across 36,000 villages so far. G Reduced transaction cost for its agri- commodity purchases. G Information on inventory retained by the farmers that can improve the quality of trading decisions. G Provided means to expand the reach to the rural markets through the cross-selling of the company's products and services. G Capacity building of the farmers. G Increase of knowledge due to the use of computers and the Internet. Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 66 Key Lessons Learnt e-Choupals deliver relevant technology in the hands of the farmers, which can improve the economic condition of the entire village. e-Choupal is one of the very few ICT projects in India that has effectively utilized e-commerce transactions for poverty alleviation. One of the key lessons is that ICT can reduce the number of middlemen involved between agriculture commodity producers and final consumers. Another key factor is that very simple technology solutions are available to create networks in rural areas, which can function as virtual agricultural commodity market places. Sustainability The project is financially sound and sustainable as the cost incurred on the establishment of the kiosk was recovered by the company in less than two years from profit generated. The recurring costs are borne by the kiosk operators who receive commission on each transaction. The project is vibrant and sustainable, and has a bright future. Replication and Scaling Up There is ample scope to scale up this project due to the wide range of services provided at the doorsteps of the villagers. This project has been successfully replicated in states like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Human Interest Story International market intelligence can lead to profits Bhavarlal, a soybean grower in the Devgadh village of Ujjain district, earned a good profit due to the e-Choupal. He learnt from the Internet that Indonesia had produced a lot of palm oil that year and hence would be selling it in the Indian markets. Knowing this, he assumed that the rates in the local mandis would fall and therefore he sold his soybeans in good time to make his profit. This shows that timely information can help farmers, not only in improving their yields but also in getting better prices. Recommendations It is recommended that e-Choupals be converted into one-stop shops wherein the villagers can also receive other relevant and essential services from the kiosk. It is recommended that new e-governance, e-education and e-health services be added on along with entertainment and computer education at these kiosks. It is also recommended that the commission agent recognized by ITC for each region be eliminated and replaced by a cooperative society or a cooperative bank. Other recommendations include linking up to various agricultural prices prevalent in major market places in India so that the farmers have access to all the markets; and that Government of India should facilitate similar kiosks wherein farmers can make transactions and these kiosks become small electronic exchanges with each other. Information regarding the kiosks among the villagers is not widespread. There is a need to conduct proper gram sabhas before installing e-Choupals in the villages. Importantly, more emphasis should be placed on the involvement of women due to their active participation in agriculture. Better planned course curricula for learning computers should be implemented for the Sanyojaks to provide further training to the villagers. Contact Information S.

After a successful pilot, 10 centres were started on 25 August 2001 and then the project was renamed as e-Seva (Electronic Service in Hindi). On 10 October 2001, a portal \u2013 http://www.esevaonline.com \u2013 was launched. Currently, there are 33 centres operating in the twin cities. Goals and Objectives G To provide real-time online transactions. G To improve government-customer interface at all levels. G To improve service quality and innovation. G To improve operational efficiency. G To provide cost-effective services. Planning It was planned along the lines of a similar initiative in Singapore. Singapore Online (http://www.singaporeonline.com) is a well- known web portal that provides information about so many items such as job vacancies and business opportunities. Services Provided Presently, the e-Seva centres provide around 46 services such as payment of water and sewerage bills, property taxes, commercial taxes, income taxes, phone bills, registration of vehicles, issue of learner driving licenses, transfer of ownership of vehicles, registration of new trade licenses, renewal of trade licenses, registration of births and deaths, birth and death certificates, filing of passport applications, collection of examination fees, registration of documents and stamps (non- judicial), sale of bus tickets, sale of non-judicial stamps, collection of small savings, etc. The services are provided within 60 to 120 seconds. The centres operate on working days from 8 am to 8 pm and on public holidays from 9 am to 3 pm. Citizens are not charged for utility payments. Services like the payment of electricity/water/telephone bills and transport/ property taxes are available on a 24x7 basis on the web portal. Target Group and Intended Beneficiaries Citizens of the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad are the target group and intended beneficiaries. Institutional Arrangements The Directorate of e-Seva is headed by a director and has two deputy directors, one assistant director (technical), one assistant director (promotion), three senior assistants, one grievance officer and two helpers. Almost all hardware and software services have been outsourced. A PPP was envisaged at the outset, in 2001. Global tenders were called for entrepreneurs to take up e-Seva centres. CMS Computers Ltd got the tender for managing the centres. Software was designed at a cost of Rs 2.5 million by another company called RAM Informatics. The Government provided the premises and the managerial staff. The managing company provided the hardware, networking e-Seva Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 68 solutions, operators (with salaries paid by the Government), engineering staff, help-desk staff and security staff at all centres. The Government provided updated databases concerning the services while the company paid all telecom/leased line bills and electricity dues. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Government and the company for five years. On each transaction, Rs 5 collected from the concerned department as a user charge, of which 75-80 percent is paid back to the private partners. Earlier, four new- generation banks \u2013 Global Trust Bank, ICICI, HDFC and UTI \u2013 were selected to facilitate net- transactions of the payments. Later, two more banks, IDBI and Centurian Bank, also joined. A 4 percent surcharged was charged on every credit card transaction, which has been reduced to 1.5 percent. Technologies The network architecture is designed as an intranet on a WAN. The network is designed in three tiers. The first tier for the client-end is located at the e-Seva centres. The front end is Java-based. All centres are on 64 Kbps dedicated leased lines, with ISDN backup. The second tier has two Sun E250s and two Compaq ML530 data servers. The second tier also consists of application servers (using Oracle GiAS and running on Sun Solaris 8 Operating System), database servers (using Oracle 8i R3 and running on MS Windows 2000 Operating System), network monitoring servers (using Cisco Works and WhatsupGold on MS Windows 2000 Operating Systems), management servers (using MS putin), a firewall (using Cheuqn) and web servers (using Apache).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d21617c-ede6-4eef-8798-f7ec52f4af05": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d21617c-ede6-4eef-8798-f7ec52f4af05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Empowering the Poor", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "294f2f7375808a2272af5c50afbb922d4cff4e1b3b9b303d715e29c265360e2b"}, "2": {"node_id": "379178c6-7d12-4d42-8078-7d4b9713cede", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5cc8704a37fd0195a8f9efa3785492de381aca1b21162f75a9527729e241eb77"}}, "hash": "44ec7dc0cdb996c7daad6b6175f0b7960631704fa6c85cc56ba7e5c0359ba373", "text": "All machines used in this How effective is e-Seva in providing government-customer interface for a variety of online transactions A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 69 Empowering the Poor tier are Intel machines, along with Cisco switches and routers.

Primary Access Points Primary access points for e-Seva services are the e-Seva centres, which are established on spacious premises. Each centre has a waiting foyer, help desk, token counter and eight to15 operator counters. Six of the e-Seva centres have ATMs (two each of State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of India and Andhra Bank). Citizens can excess the portal from their households as well to avail of the services online. Capacity Building All operators are given four-day operational training on the operator terminal. Some efforts have been made in providing IT training in the concerned departments. The government and its numerous departments have paid little attention towards creating an e-workforce. There is an over-dependence on private technological partners, CMS Computers Ltd and RAM Informatics Ltd, for all technological solutions. The dependence on RAM Informatics Ltd and Jyothy Computers to provide all e-worker needs to be rectified by building the capacity and skills of redundant government employees. This becomes important in the context of a proposed expansion of 237 new e-Seva centres and the fact that the Government has to pay monthly salaries to all the operators engaged in these 237 centres. Constraints and Implementation Challenges The initial resistance came from vested interest groups, especially government officials and middlemen. The central success factors are political will, bureaucratic support, e-support of departments and infrastructure, and public demand. The revenue database of numerous government departments has been exposed (without impregnable safety measures) by multiple agencies (e-Seva operators, banks, citizens from the Web, technological partners). The project has not yet shown that it is technologically and financially sustainable in poor and rural settings. Project Outcomes In the year up to the time of the study, the number of transactions for the year doubled and the payments increased six times. Between 18 July 2002 and 17 July 2003 (in one year), 8.27 million transactions took place in the e-Seva centres and Rs 32.796 billion was collected as payment from these transactions. Key Lessons Learnt e-Seva is India\u2019s pioneering e-governance project. It has paved the way for others to follow. It has also embarked on a sustainable PPP. This project has a very sound business model. The project has provided integrated multi-departmental government services at one stop. The software, hardware and networking technology has been functioning satisfactorily since the inception of the project with almost no instance of breakdown (uptime percentage is 99.6 percent). This has emphasized the importance of laying down a reliable telecommunication infrastructure for the success of e-governance efforts. Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 70 Sustainability This project is financially sustainable. The government, private entrepreneurs and users are all winners in this project. The huge acceptance by the public of e-Seva counters also confirms its future sustainability. The organizational re-engineering and management practices adopted are also favourable for its sustainable existence. Replication and Scaling Up It is surprising that the country\u2019s most successful e-governance project has not been replicated in any other parts of India. The Government has decided to add 13 new e-Seva centres in the twin cities. This project is also going to be scaled up with the installation of 237 new e-Seva centres (including all 117 municipalities) in the rest of the 23 districts in the state of Andhra Pradesh. These new centres fall in six zones (four zones are taken up by CMS Technologies, one zone by United Telecom Limited, and one by CCS Technologies). Each district will be a separate intranet to start with, which will eventually be integrated into the Internet. Six new e-Seva centres have already been started in Rajmundri (Western Godavari district) on 30 July 2003. New services like railway reservations, sale of movie tickets, payment for traffic-related offences, payment of degree examination fees of the Open University, collection of bill payments of private landline and cellular companies, issue of encumbrance certificates, market value assistance, general insurance, reservation of tourism tickets for accommodation call centres, Indian Airlines ticket reservation, life insurance premium payment, issue of caste certificates, sale of the Indira Vikas Patra, renewal of drug licenses, issue of bus passes, etc., are also planned to be added. All ATMs of the State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of India and Andhra Bank will be converted to e-Seva centres.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41646f5e-4799-4a0c-8685-3a7b72dddee6": {"__data__": {"id_": "41646f5e-4799-4a0c-8685-3a7b72dddee6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Empowering the Poor", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e1d0b949323fabee79e48e415576f7113983525f5849ba7369598e1bf55ab2f"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb1b0148-4622-46a6-9878-1cb241675fa3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2655af61d63e0236fc14c5048cf85571bf0f2a35ff763f9bc40113e6c54a7096"}}, "hash": "0dfa17ce9126bbd90e9e68a5e73d291a1c4e939beea839743e12f72af092630e", "text": "Recommendations The project is highly recommended for Human Interest Stories All cash, no files S.

There was absolutely no file on his table or in his cabinet. He is happy that he has got rid of innumerable files, which used to be dumped on him when he was working as a junior accountant in the Irrigation Department earlier. He is handling cash, and no files in the e-Seva centre. A short walk from the hospital Sudhakar Reddy, 55 years old, was blessed with a son recently. He was in the nursing home with his wife and his first child. His wife insisted that he should take a walk to the e-Seva centre in the locality (LB Nagar) and make his electricity bill payment. He was hesitant because he did not want to leave his wife and child alone for a long period of time. However, he walked down to the centre to deposit Rs 228. To his surprise, the transaction was over so quickly that he was able to return to the hospital within 45 minutes. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 71 Empowering the Poor replication and up scaling in the urban and semi- urban areas of India. Presently, the project is using a Java platform, which requires the creation of an interface to integrate databases that are in diverse formats. It is recommended that the data structure be kept uniform for all government departments. The Government should coordinate billing procedures for all relevant departments, so that citizens receive bills of different utilities at the same time, and have to travel only once a month to e-Seva centres for clearing them. This would increase citizen satisfaction and would take care of the customer load on the network. The bandwidth of the communication lines between the Citizen Service Centres and the Data Centre at Khairatabad, as well as between the Data Centre and Departmental Servers of utility providers may be increased (to say, 128 Kbps), based on a network audit, which should also show the density of traffic flowing in each segment. All departmental servers should be shifted to the Khairatabad centre, which should be developed as a full-fledged data centre with a \u2018server-farm\u2019 maintained on 24X7 basis, with due disaster- recovery and business continuity provisions. e-Seva centres started in ATMs need to be revitalized and the procedures simplified, as only 12 transactions have taken place in the two years prior to the study, though there are six ATMs providing services. The usage of e-Seva centres in poor areas is very low (e.g., the Bahadur Pura centre has less than 300 transactions per month against an average of 25,000 in any other centre). Special efforts should be made to popularize the services amongst the poor and also to include services more relevant to the lower income groups. To reduce the huge expenses incurred in expanding the project, it is recommended that a change to Linux open source software be made. Basic amenities like toilets should be set up in all the centres. The expansion of 229 new e-Seva centres in 21 districts is planned to start on a WAN. Instead, it would be more cost-effective for the government and more convenient for the citizens if the expansion were carried on the Internet. It is also important to take steps towards discouraging cash transactions and encourage the plastic-money culture, especially to attract more customers. A co-branded e-Seva Debit Card (like the Petro Card) could be developed, in association with major tech-savvy banks. With such a Card, it would also be possible to introduce innovative schemes for inducing citizens to pay their bills promptly, like the accumulation of \u2018usage points\u2019, \u2018loyalty points\u2019, \u2018timely-payment points\u2019 which could perhaps be redeemed as a certain percentage discount on the bills. There has been no effort towards the introduction of Smart Cards in the project, which could safeguard the transactions against frauds. The focus ofexpansion of the services is on those involving payments and revenue collections.

The FRIENDS centre, or Janasevana Kendram, (Janasevana means serving people, Kendram means centre) is a one-stop integrated citizen service centre of the Government of Kerala. The centre functions as a single counter to remit utility bill payments, submit applications, seek information on government programmes and schemes, and provide access to other specialty services. After the success of the pilot, FRIENDS was launched in the remaining 13 district headquarters in 2001. Goals and Objectives G To improve government-customer interface at all levels. G To improve service quality and innovation. G To improve operational efficiency. G To provide cost-effective services. Planning The project was launched at Thiruvananthpuram in 2000, in a rather hasty manner, just before the assembly elections. FRIENDS centres were opened in all districts, even though networking and database integration were not taken up in the pilot. It was envisaged to expand the services in 2002 and expand the centres to talukas and blocks in 2003. By the time of the study, these targets had not been attained. Services Provided The centres work from 9 am to 7 pm in two shifts on all days including Sundays and are closed on every second Saturday and on public holidays. The operators or Counter Service Officers (CSOs) work in two shifts from 9 am to 2 pm and from 2 pm to 7 pm. The services offered at FRIENDS centres are: electricity bill payments (low tension and spot billing), fees for new ration cards, Kerala University examination fees, general fees for Kerala University, Motor Vehicle Tax, fee for licenses and permits from the Motor Vehicles Department, one-time vehicle tax, registration fee for motor vehicles, fees for trade licenses, building tax (one-time), basic land tax, revenue recovery, property tax, professional tax, fee for food license and trade license, water bill payments, telephone bills of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL). The participating departments are Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB), Kerala Water Authority, Corporation of Thiruvananthpuram, Motor Vehicle Department, Revenue Department, Civil Supplies Department and BSNL. Each FRIENDS centre has 10 counters (Thiruvananthpuram has 20). Each centre has basic amenities for citizens like toilets, a queue management system, air conditioners, help desk, general enquiry counter and waiting hall. No user charges are taken from citizens. FRIENDS does not even charge service charges from government departments for the services provided (only BSNL pays Rs 6 per transaction service charge to the Government).

All citizens of the district can avail of the services pertaining to the Transport Department and telephone bills. KSEB electricity bills can only be paid by citizens residing in the Malappuram section of KSEB. At Thiruvananthpuram, electricity bills are paid for residents residing in 19 electric sections, water bills for those residing in five sections and Revenue Department services to residents of 15 nearby villages. Civil supplies services are available to only those residing in the jurisdiction of two rationing offices. Many citizens are confused whether their work falls in the jurisdiction of FRIENDS. Institutional Arrangements Each FRIENDS centre is managed by one Project Manager (PM) appointed by the Government from any of the departments (at Thiruvananthpuram there are two PMs). There are two system administrators for each FRIENDS centre for two shifts. These are trained personnel brought on deputation from the Centre for Development of Imaging Technology (CDIT), a Government of Kerala undertaking. There are 20 operators for 10 counters (53 in Thiruvananthpuram). They are designated as CSOs and are posted to FRIENDS on deputation from the participating departments. There are no accountants, clerks or peons at the FRIENDS centres.

The server uses Visual Basic at the front end and SQL Server 7.0 for data bases. There are no firewalls in the server. Primary Access Points Primary access points for the citizens are provided at the FRIENDS centres at district headquarters. There is one access centre in each of the 14 districts. There were no online services for the citizens at the time of the study. Capacity Building Not much effort has gone into building the capacity of PMs and CSOs. All the PMs and CSOs are given four-day training at the time of induction. A few have undergone a refresher course. Similarly, department heads have also not undergone any training regarding the system. Constraints and Implementation Challenges There was initial resistance from government employees of the participating departments. PMs and CSOs have been posted on deputation to FRIENDS without their consent. Employees on salaries of Rs 4,000 and Rs 7,500 per month were performing the same task as the CSO, which any operator could have done. All the employees posted at FRIENDS feel that there should a fixed tenure for one year only. Due to the freeze on the new intake of employees, the departments are showing reluctance to depute employees to FRIENDS. Departments have also been insisting on departmental help desks for each of them at FRIENDS centres. The amount collected each day is transferred to the State Bank of Trivancore branch, from where, based on a Bank Transfer Statement provided by FRIENDS, the bank remits the money to the treasury, after which FRIENDS issues cheques to the respective departments. This normally takes five to seven days\u2019 processing time, and no reduction has been possible. All the departments and FRIENDS reconcile monthly accounts with the banks each month. The software for the project was created by a private organization, which was sub-let the work by CDIT. There were problems with Intellectual Property Rights which resulted in court action within six months of launching the programmes. This has severely hindered the growth of the project. There has been resistance from departments to go for full scale back-ending and consolidation of databases. Project Outcomes In one year (April 2002 to March 2003), 232,230 transactions were carried out at Malappuram centre. Of these, 47 percent were to deposit electricity dues, 43 percent to deposit motor vehicle dues, 5 percent to deposit water taxes and 5 percent for all other services put together. Rs 51.37 million has been collected from different taxes from this centre. On any average day, 400-450 citizens visit the centre. After introducing the collection of telephone bills, the number of users has increased. There is a growing demand from the citizens to expand services and to increase the number of centres in the district. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 75 Empowering the Poor Key Lessons Learnt The project justifies the idiom that \u201cSimple is Workable\u201d. It has become a popular project among the citizens, even with a basic LAN and in-house software and with government staff managing the project. The project has also established that inter-departmental coordination could be established if there is sufficient government will. It is a first step in providing a one-stop shop to citizens for all government-related services, especially when departmental databases are uncoordinated and difficult to integrate. The project proves that even government funded and managed projects can bring about a remarkable change in the government-citizen interface. Sustainability The project is sustainable, but there is no in-built revenue stream in the system. There is neither the concept of user charges nor that of service charges (except for BSNL). The expansion, scaling up, and upgrading will suffer because of the absence of funds to be ploughed back into the centres.

By introducing PPP in the establishment and management of the centres, the replication process could be expedited. The scaling up was envisaged by integrating FRIENDS with Akshaya centres, but no specific modalities had been worked out at the time of the study. Recommendations Presently, citizens have access to these services only from the FRIENDS centre situated at every district headquarter. It is possible to set up new centres at every taluk or at block level. Some services are available to the citizens residing only in municipal areas and some are available to all citizens of the district. This creates confusion amongst the citizens, so it is recommended that all the services be provided to every citizens of the district (or all citizens residing in a defined geographical and administrative unit). Some centres are located in very conspicuous locations whilst others are somewhat inaccessible (at Thiruvananthpuram the centre is located on the second floor of a shopping mall and at Calicut the centre is on the fourth floor). It is recommended that such centres should be shifted to public places, which are easily accessible by the citizens. It is also recommended that acceptance of payments through cheques, demand drafts and credit/debit cards be initiated. This will reduce cash handling, which in turn will reduce security hazards. New generation banks should be made the sole bankers of the centre for which they should allow the use of debit cards. The treasury should beseparated from money transfer from FRIENDS to the relevant government departments. This would reduce the cash handling time to 24 hours. Some PPP mechanism is urgently needed. Presently, all FRIENDS centres are fully funded and managed by the Government. The investment of Rs 2 million per centre constrains the Government from expanding the project further due to resource restrictions. Similarly, government employees should be withdrawn from CSO jobs and should be more effectively used in departmental back-ending of the databases. CSO jobs should be handed over to private entrepreneurs. The system software should also be converted into Linux and security firewalls should be installed. Client-end screens are presently viewed through Internet Explorer, which raises security concerns. A new and more secure browser should be put in place. There seems to be a lack of motivation in networking the operation, which makes it a less effective system. There is a need to integrate departmental database servers with the server at the FRIENDS centre. Finally, all services should be made available online from the website.

It was set up in 1986 and has three state-of-the- art manufacturing plants in Rajasthan. Aksh Broadband Limited is an offshoot of Optifibre Limited, which aims to connect every gram panchayat of Rajasthan to the district and state headquarters. As an integrated solution provider, Aksh provides the hardware, software and allied solutions for total dedicated connectivity. Gramdoot aims to bridge the digital divide between rural India and the rest of the world by providing e-governance and rural convergence through broadband services on OFC, connecting 407 gram panchayats in Jaipur district of Rajasthan. Goals and Objectives G To help bridge the digital divide between rural India and the rest of the world by creating the infrastructure. G To provide cable TV, telephony and Internet connectivity to all gram panchayats. G To develop a business model in rural broadband connectivity. Planning Gramdoot (meaning \u201cmessenger for the villages\u201d) was launched on 3 January 2002 by the Chief Minister of Rajasthan at Rampura Dabri village. The project was launched with three kiosks. A major drive to lay down OFC over electric poles was undertaken on a war footing; and 3,100 km long OFC had been laid at the time of the study, connecting all 407 gram panchayats of Jaipur district. The district has a geographical area of 11,151 sq km and is divided into 13 taluks (or tahsils) and 407 gram panchayats for administrative reasons. At the time of the study, 200 Gramdoot centres were operational. Services Provided Gramdoot provides numerous services. Complaints to the tahsil or district headquarters can be made from the Gramdoot kiosk. With this facility, problems regarding hand pumps, electricity supply and health-related services, etc., can be resolved easily at a nominal cost of Rs 10. Villagers can also file applications for obtaining various certificates such as caste/ domicile/income certificates at Rs 20. Presently, 34 types of application forms are available online to the villagers at a cost of Rs 20 with a facility to transmit them electronically to the single window system at the District Collectorate. Land records are available from the centre at a cost of Rs 20. The Network Operation Centre (NOC) of the project maintains a mirror server of the land record server at the NIC. The patwari (village revenue official) visits the kiosk twice a week (after a Government Order issued in June 2002) and signs the documents which are then couriered to the villager. Prevailing market rates of agricultural commodities like grains, pulses, vegetables, fruits in the agriculture commodity auction centre (mandi) are available at Rs 5. Gram Daak (Hindi version of e-mail for the villagers), Gram Haat (online buying and selling of the products in rural areas) and Vaivahiki (matrimonial alliances) services are also available at the centres. There is a databank of information about the government\u2019s programmes/schemes, agriculture information and pehchan. An authentic database of villagers with their photographs is also available. High speed non-dial-up Internet access at 70 Kbps is Gramdoot Jaipur, Rajasthan Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 78 available to the villager at a cost of Rs 30 per hour. Web conferencing facility at a rate of Rs 5 for three minutes is also available. A 32-channel cable connection is also made available at a cost of Rs 80 per month.

The Senior Vice President liaises with the state government and district administration, and Gramdoot managers with tahsil-level officials for e-governance services. Technologies ANL has laid down 3,100 kms of OFC, covering all 407 gram panchayats of Jaipur district. OFC carries four fibres (for cable TV, computer network, telephony and redundancy). The OFC are laid over electrical poles for which ABL pays Rs 100 per month per pole to the Rajasthan State Electricity Board (RSEB). At the Gramdoot centre level, connectivity is provided to cable TV connections through an RF cable. The network uses Optic Node (used for cable TV transmission), media converters and switches (used for computer network) and VoIP (used for telephony) at Gramdoot kiosks. At all major branches, a Fibre Distribution Management System (FDMS) is used. Seetapura has a NOC for the whole project. Jethpura has another parallel head-end NOC. A speed of 1.2 terra bytes per second is possible in the network in each of 407 gram panchayats. At the time of the study, the system was restricting the broad band to 100 Mbps. The network provides intranet connectivity to 200 operational Gramdoot centres through Random Access Server (RAS) and LAN. Seetapura NOC has taken a leased line (64 Kbps) from the Software Technology Parks of India (STPI). ABL provides another leased line to the district administration. The network uses software produced by Drishtee Foundation which runs on Windows NT and the client end works on Windows Explorer. The Seetapura NOC servers are linked through leased line to the Land Record Server maintained by NIC in the district headquarters. ABL has provided Pentium III computer, ink jet printer, web camera, head phone, UPS backup and telephone connections to each of the 200 operational Gramdoot centres. The network is maintained by the sister company ANL and the services by ABL. Primary Access Points e-Governance services and other e-services are accessible to residents of 200 gram panchayats from the Gramdoot centres. These centres also provide Internet browsing and video conferencing/chatting facilities. Cable TV facilities (32 channels) are accessible to 7,000 villagers from their household TV sets in 187 villages. Telephony had not been made operational as at the time of the study. Capacity Building All 200 Gramdoot centres have been given seven-day training on hardware, networking, e-governance services, and cable TV operations at induction. Gramdoot managers and network maintenance supervisors are provided with on- the-job training. Constraints and Implementation Challenges The project faces some challenges, even after 20 months of operation. The project has laid down 3,100 km long OFC (with 100 Mbps bandwidth) to all 407 gram panchayats without any needs assessment and economic feasibility assessment. ABL has bought 3,100 km OFC from AOL and the cable laying work is done by ANL. The most important constraint was finances. ABL has mobilized its own resources to the tune of Rs 260 million. The decision to lay OFC underground was discarded even though it would have resulted in OFC and network safety and security. In place, OFC has been laid on electric poles as it was four times cheaper than underground cabling and 10 times faster to lay down. But this has resulted in a catastrophic scale of cable cutting by disgruntled cable TV operators already working in rural areas, by thieves to sell it in the black market and by dissatisfied cable TV consumers in rural areas. The OFC over electric poles is also prone to damage by vehicles and external forces. The situation has become so critical that of 200 Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 80 Gramdoot centres, at any point of time, only 80- 85 have connectivity.

Initially, cable TV subscribers were provided with pay channels (like STAR, Zee and Sony) but these popular channels have been discontinued since March, 2003 due to a hike in pay channel charges. This has resulted in dissatisfaction among the consumers. Various e-governance services took a long time to start up. Three services (land record copy, complaint registration, and submission of applications) have become possible. But ABL remained unable to launch an effective publicity campaign to popularize these services in the rural areas. The back-end processing of all these services remains manual. Land records are physically taken by Gramdoots to village revenue officials for counter signatures. Similarly, complaints to the district administration are handled physically by the concerned officials and Gramdoots visit tahsil offices to deposit applications for caste/income/ domicile certificates. There was an organizational crisis in ABL. The Senior Vice President was replaced in May 2003 and three deputy general managers\u2019 services have been discontinued. Many staff members have left the project at different points of time. The intranet in 407 gram panchayats provides 100 Mbps connectivity. The network encounters a bottleneck when it comes to Internet browsing as leased lines taken for the network are only 64 kbps. ABL has not come out with any structured computer courses, thereby losing a huge potential of computer education in rural areas. Rural telephony over this infrastructure should have been a priority. ABL has been considering a tie up with Shyam Telnet (a basic telephone service provider). Project Outcomes ABL has invested heavily in Gramdoot without having any specific business model. Rs 185 million has been invested on the OFC (at a cost of Rs 60,000 per km); Rs 20 million has been spent on other equipment (ADFA, amplifiers, etc.); and Rs 35 million has been spent on buying computer equipment for 120 Gramdoot centres (around 80 centres are using rented computer equipment). Around Rs 260 million has been invested on establishing the project. Around Rs 20 million is paid in salaries every year to 350 staff working in the project. The annual recurring cost on rent payable to electric poles is around Rs 10 million. Similarly, ABL is paying millions of rupees annually on the rental of shops for all 407 centres, rent on computer equipment in 80 centres, and electricity and telephone bills at 200 centres. The financial returns on this capital investment and recurring costs are less than what they should ideally be. Transactions volumes are also low. There were only 447 complaints, 450 certificates and 1,040 land record copies issued in the 20 months prior to the study from 200 Gramdoot centres. This provided earnings of only of Rs 0.5 million to ABL in 20 months from the whole network. There are 7,000 cable connections (each paying Rs 990 annually). This has provided an income of around Rs 10 million since inception A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 81 Empowering the Poor to the time of the study. The project\u2019s early outcomes were disappointing and its financial viability remains questionable. However, during the two years up to the time of the study, the project has achieved more. The number of services offered increased, the bandwidth to the NOC was increased to 2 Mbps from 64 Kbps, and discussions were held with the Andra Pradesh government in an attempt to extend the project\u2019s scope. Key Lessons Learnt An important lesson from Gramdoot is that the provision of only volume bandwidth without a business model could be a losing proposition. Nevertheless, the project has also taught an important lesson that OFC laid down to villages could be used for entertainment (cable TV), information (intranet/Internet connectivity), and communication (telephony). Feasibility studies should always be carried out before investing huge amounts in creating infrastructure in rural areas. To a certain extent, the project also shows that e-governance services are difficult to manage in business-owned (or for that matter NGO-owned) projects. Gramdoot has employed kiosk operators (paying them an honorarium of Rs 2,000 per month besides paying rent, electricity and telephone bills and stationery charges), which discourages enterprise in managing these centres. Salaried employees at centres always result in poor performance. A franchisee model at the telecentre level is a better option. Sustainability The financial sustainability of Gramdoot is doubtful. The project has invested heavily in infrastructure and is spending considerably on annual recurring costs. On the other hand, the returns are less than Rs 15 million annually (which is even less than the recurring costs).

Unproductive expenditure on paying rent to hire space in these locations was still going on at the time of the study. Internal conflicts of the organizations, frequent changes at senior management levels, under- utilization of capacity and lack of consumer satisfaction are likely to compromise the project\u2019s sustainability further. Replication and Scaling Up This project has not been replicated in any other part of India. ABL is trying for loans from financial institutions/banks for expanding services and the network. The project aims to make the remaining 207 Gramdoot centres operational in six months. The project is also striving to add telephony to all 407 gram panchayats. Scaling up has been initiated in Rajmundri district of Rajasthan and discussions were underway at the time of the study to form a partnership with Lupin Pharamaceutical Ltd to take up another district. ABL was aiming to provide broadband services through OFC to all 32 districts of Rajasthan by 2005. Recommendations Immediate intervention for the modification of the project model is required as it is undergoing a financial, organizational and managerial crisis. ABL should try to start the remaining 207 Gramdoot centres at the earliest (on a franchisee model). If only 50 percent of the existing centres are struggling to ascertain network connectivity, than there are troubling times ahead. The maintenance of the cable network requires technically and managerially experienced staff for handling cable work in rural areas. ABL should try to make profit- sharing partnerships with existing cable operators in the rural areas of Jaipur (there are more than 15,000 cable connections in the hands of 20 cable operators). The management of network maintenance, especially efficient catering of cable cutting and amplifier stealing complaints, in an Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 82 efficient manner has to be built up. The project should try to increase cable connections from 7,000 to 20,000 in one year and to 40,000 in two years by including popular TV channels in the package for consumers. Organizational restructuring is also required, as presently everybody is doing everybody else\u2019s job. Role definitions at different management tiers have to be ensured, as they did not exist at the time of the study. Recurring expenditure should be reduced by cost- cutting methods. The project should stop emphasizing e-governance services, as they take time to become functional such that they can contribute returns on the initial investment. Instead, the project could develop e-health (telemedicine) and e-education (distance learning) through partnerships with educational institutions and hospitals. The leased line of 64 Kbps between Seetapura head-end and STPI is not serving any purpose. It should be at least 2 Mbps (considering that Human Interest Stories \u201cMy dhaba is equipped with cable TV\u201d Mohanlal Prajapati runs a small dhaba in Mohana village.

Gyandoot in Hindi means \u201cpurveyor of knowledge\u201d. The four pillars on which the Gyandoot community network was established were people, content, services and server. Goals and Objectives G To ensure equal access to emerging technologies for marginalized segments of the society. G To create a cost-effective, replicable, economically self-reliant and financially viable model to take the benefits of IT to the rural masses. G To implement a new grass-roots entrepreneurial model with the participation of groups of non-traditional entrepreneurs. G To provide self-employment through entrepreneurship to local rural youth. G To improve the quality, speed and sensitivity of the state delivery apparatus towards the needs of local citizen-customers. G To impact IT on the government-citizen interfaces as the thrust area, so that the benefits of the knowledge economy directly reach the marginalized have-nots and know-nots. G To search for the potential of rural markets in the digital domain. G To analyze the processes and modalities involved in the socio-cultural environment while taking technology to the deprived communities. Planning The Gyandoot project was planned using finances from the community as well as from private enterprises. The database and the server were placed at the district council office. It was decided to create an intranet network with dial- up modem connectivity to rural kiosks. The selection of services to be provided was decided on the basis of a participatory rural appraisal. Kiosks and telephone connections were selected at prominent places in the villages. The procurement of hardware was done by the village community and the managers for the kiosks were selected from the community, to work on a profit-sharing basis. Services Provided It was decided at the outset after consultation with the villagers to provide all the proposed facilities in the local language (Hindi). Software, eventually developed and installed for the network, was user-friendly and menu-driven at the client end. Initially, the network offered five services. Within a few months of its installation, the network was offering 22 services including rates of agriculture produce, land records, grievance redressal, Hindi e-mail, rural matrimonial services, rural e-market, application for caste/ residence/income certificates, information regarding government programmes and schemes, etc. Later, educational, health and commercial services were added. Target Group and Intended Beneficiaries The intranet covered five out of 13 blocks (geographical administrative units for development work) in the district. Forty kiosks Gyandoot Dhar, Madhya Pradesh Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 84 cater to inhabitants living within a radius of 5 km from each of these kiosks. The network provided kiosk access to inhabitants of 550 villages with a total of half a million population. Institutional Arrangements The community network is owned by the district council and the kiosks are managed by village councils. A project manager maintains the database and the server room in the district council. He is supported by four assistant managers, who are government servants. The kiosk managers are village volunteers, who were selected by the community and who manage the kiosk on a profit sharing basis. Various departments of the state government provide logistical support and databases for the network. Technologies Initially, dial-up telephone connectivity through modems was used as the media for communication. It was decided to use Pentium III computers available in the district council as RAS. The RAS was a P III 450 MHz CPU with 128 MB SDRAM-ECC, 2 X 9 ultra SCSI Hard disks, 2 MB Graphic Controller Card, 15\u201d colour monitor 48 X CD-ROM.

The network used CorDECT, which is a WiLL technology developed by TeNeT group, Chennai. Based on the Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications standard specified by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), CorDECT WiLL provides cost- effective, simultaneous high-quality voice and data connectivity in both urban and rural areas. This technology provides voice communication using 35 Kbps and Internet connectivity at 35/ 70 Kbps. Primary Access Points Initially, 21 community-owned client sites/ nodes working as rural cybercaf\u00e9 and cyber offices were established in 21 remote villages. Later, 19 privately-owned kiosks were added to the network. Capacity Building The project manager selected to manage the network is a professional IT expert. Four assistant managers are provided training in networking and database management. A three-day training was organized for all the kiosk managers manning the kiosks. All the head of the departments were given two-day computer training courses. Constraints and Implementation Challenges The biggest stumbling block in the creation of a community network were the bureaucratic procedures. The resistance from different departments of the state government was significant. Although it was easy to convince the district councils to provide funds for the server room and the village councils to provide funds for the rural kiosks, it was difficult to standardize the databases in different departments and to convince their staff to upgrade and update the databases. Power cuts in rural areas also hinder the usage of the kiosks. Telephone connectivity in rural areas is poor and has resulted in unstable and unreliable Internet connectivity. Existing laws, rules and regulations also created obstacles in the implementation of the project. Interdepartmental coordination, database management and streamlining departmental procedures became important implementation challenges. Project Outcomes Gyandoot has been described as a path- breaking e-governance and community network project. It has not only been effectively used for community participation in planning, execution and management but it has also created a new thinking regarding private and community funding in the establishment of community networks in India. It has been successfully proven as a viable business model. The network also established the acceptability of user charges by the villagers, functionality of CICs and the operational viability of WiLL technology. There were some pitfalls. The computerization of land records took almost two years to become fully functional on the network. The major hindrances remained the management of government functionaries at the grass roots and lack of technical backup. The e-health services were marred due to poor support from the health department. The web- based and intranet services could not be integrated. The network has been replicated in 30 districts in India. Gyandoot has won the prestigious Stockholm Challenge Award, 2000 and CSI National Award for Best IT Usage in India, 2000. The network has been adjudged a best practice by the UNDP, Asian Development Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, Time Magazine, World Economic Forum, the Government of India and the Planning Commission of India. Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 86 Key Lessons Learnt Rapid rural appraisal and participatory rural appraisal provided the necessary inputs for the effective implementation of a community networking project. Intranet networking is a better medium for community networking, especially in rural areas where connectivity is sub-optimal or poor. Profit sharing between community institutions like village councils and private entrepreneurs has proven to be an effective symbiotic relationship. User charges are easily paid by the poorest of the community and are an effective means of making the network financially sustainable.

One day, by chance, she overheard him talk about the availability of cheaper goods in Indore, Dahod and Surat. Simply out of curiosity, she went to the kiosk herself. She saw a young boy sitting in front of some machines. She gathered her wits and with a lot of hesitation asked the boy what he was doing.

He could not get a scholarship until he submitted the certificate. He walked into the kiosk in his village and asked the soochak to forward his application for a caste certificate. The documents submitted by him along with the certificate at the soochanalaya were adequate. He had planned to come back for more information on it after a fortnight but was pleasantly surprised, and very thankful, when the soochak came to his house after six days. He told him that the revenue department had informed him by e-mail that Shankarlal\u2019s certificate was ready and that he could pick it up from Dhar. He went to the tahsil office and collected the caste certificate. The school headmaster was surprised by the quick submission of the certificate. Shankarlal spread the word regarding the easy and less cumbersome mode of acquiring caste certificates among his friends. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 87 Empowering the Poor managing the kiosks and they provide remuneration to the kiosk managers. The burden of managing the kiosk is neither on the community nor the government. The project has been designed in such a fashion that its financial viability is ensured. The expansion of the project through increases in services, increases in the number of kiosks and the introduction of WiLL technology has also improved its sustainability. Replication and Scaling Up Gyandoot has been replicated in 33 districts in Madhya Pradesh and 12 districts in other parts of India. The network has been already replicated in numerous districts such as Balaghat, Bhind, Panna, Ratlam, Khandwa, Khargone, Badwani, Ujjain, Mandla, Jhabua, Dewas (all in Madhya Pradesh), Hisar, Sirsa (Haryana), Hamirpur (Himachal Pradesh), and Godhra, Surat (Gujarat). UNDP has sanctioned six projects on the line of Gyandoot in India. Recommendations The land record database is huge and is not properly maintained. It is recommended that land record databases be maintained and managed, the village maps be digitized and more useful services be introduced on the network. It is also recommended that local telephony from the kiosks be improved, as WiLL technology has been introduced in the network. Liaison with the telecommunication department to improve the Internet connectivity in the rural kiosks will be a good idea. e-Payment services for various government fees can be implemented so that citizens can deposit their electricity, telephone, water, property fees, etc., at a single kiosk. It is better for the sustainability of the project that more services are added on the network based on feedback from the villagers. It is also recommended that all the district servers be networked and integrated with the state-level server node.

All 48 centres/ kiosks are manned by private entrepreneurs who have entered into a franchisee agreement with EID Parry or N-Logue. There are Farmers Clubs organized in all 38 Parry\u2019s Corners and Kids Clubs instituted in all 10 Chiraag centres. Technologies The Server Room has one Dock Interface Unit (DIU, with six BUIC cards), two servers (a Master Internet Server and a Redundant Internet Server), and two Operation Monitoring Consoles. These are connected through modems and routers to six Compact Base Stations (installed on 95 metre high chimney/tower of the factory). There are two Repeater Base Stations (in Puddapate and Arasadikuppa villages). Satyam Info provides leased lines (64 kbps) linkage to CBS. There are two PIII PCs with the Chiraag team and two PIII computers with the Agriline team in the server team. The server uses Windows NT, ASP and HTML for web-based applications and SQL for the database. CorDECT technology provides 35/70 Kbps connectivity (with simultaneous Internet and telephony) within an area of 25-30 km radius. The DIU in the Server Room can accommodate up to 20 BUIC Cards (and can support 1,000 subscribers). Presently, there are 87 subscribers (38 Parry\u2019s Corners, 10 Chiraag centres, three educational institutions, three government connections, two solution providers, 11 factory connections and 13 private connections). Primary Access Points All the villagers residing in 45 villages (in Nellikuppam area of Caddallore district of Tamil Nadu) and three villages in Pondicherry can access these services at 38 Parry\u2019s Corners and 10 Chiraag centres. Capacity Building All the kiosk operators (manning 38 Parry\u2019s Corners and 10 Chiraag centres) have undergone one week\u2019s training on hardware, server and maintenance, Internet browsing and marketing. EID Parry has also trained 150 farmers to use the Net and portal ( to view their transaction record with the sugar factory). A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 91 Empowering the Poor Constraints and Implementation Challenges The project faced implementation challenges with the community and technology. There has been lukewarm response from village councils. This has been compensated by excellent participation by farmers\u2019 organizations and clubs. Commodity trading in sugar, tea, seeds, fertilizers, chocolates/candies still largely remains offline. The Commodity Trading System (CTS) is still in its formative stages. The installed capacity of 1,000 subscribers is not fully utilized. There were only 87 subscribers at the time of the study. The network is only used for data transmission, as voice transmission has not been finalized. Talks with Tata Infocomm are underway to use their OFC lines and setup to take up voice transmission as well. Less than 10 percent of sugarcane farmers are using CMS, which is making some headway but its universal usage will take some time. Internet browsing is not very popular with the villagers. Though the network provides continuous and unlimited connectivity at Parry\u2019s Corners and Chiraag centres, only a negligible proportion of the volume bandwidth is currently utilized. Project Outcomes The EID Parry and N-Logue partnership has grown over the three years prior to the study. The CMS has become popular with some sugarcane farmers. Health consultancy, especially related to eye ailments, is quite popular. The Blue Book and Green Book courses for children (age group six to16 years) have been tremendously successful. The project is providing an income of Rs 2,000 to Rs 4,500 per month income to kiosk operators from offline and online activities. Key Lessons Learnt The successful partnership between EID Parry and N-Logue Telecommunications Pvt Ltd has shown that such partnerships between the business community and technology providers can result in sustainable and viable projects. The project also highlights that industries and businesses having a rural base would benefit by creating communication channels through community networks. The kiosks must become not just information centres but also catalysts for the economic growth of the villages.

The earnings at Chiraag centres have still to be built up. The long-term sustainability of the project would finally depend upon increasing the number of CorDECT subscribers from 87 to 1,000, starting with vocal transmissions, using all available bandwidth at the kiosks and putting CTS online. Replication and Scaling Up The project has not been replicated in other parts of India. Warana Wired Village has recently adopted CorDECT technology (see page 121). N-Logue has entered into agreements in Tamil Nadu with numerous private entrepreneurs as LSPs in Alagumalai (Koimbatore), Teni (Teni), Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 92 Thiruvallur (Thiruvallur) and Thirupattur (Siv Ganga). EID Parry plans to replicate the project in three other sugar factories in Tamil Nadu and wants to scale up the services by introducing CTS. The plan is to scale up the project to increase the number of Parry\u2019s Corners to 100. Recommendations There are only 87 subscribers of the CorDECT technology against the installed capacity of 1,000. It is necessary to attain at least 80 percent of the installed capacity by an intensive drive to register new customers in rural areas and by making strategic partnerships with LSPs. The technology offers unlimited access to 35 Kbps bandwidth to all these kiosks, but only 2 percent of the available bandwidth is presently being used. It is advisable to create content and services which motivate villagers to browse the web more often. The use of voice transmission over the WiLL network needs to be sorted out at the earliest. The content on the Chiraag centres Human Interest Stories Kids and their new play field Samundeeswari is the 12-year-old daughter of a bullock cart driver from Valapet village. She studies in class VI in the nearby municipal school. Her father earns a meagre sum of Rs 1,500 per month. A few years ago she saw computers for the first time in a clothes shop. She asked many questions about the machine, but her parents could not provide satisfactory answers. Then, she learnt about Thirukandeswaram Chiraag centre. She motivated her father to pay Rs 100 for the Green Book Course at the centre. Now she visits the centres with her six school mates. She wants to own her own e-mail account by the end of the course. A one-stop shop for sugarcane farmers Priya is 22 years old and has completed MCom and DCA courses. She started a Parry\u2019s Corner in her house in Malaigimedu village in November 2000 in partnership with her brother. She has one Pentium III computer, a web camera, multimedia kit, and 4-in-1 (printer, scanner, fax, and copier). She also sells sugar, tea, seeds and candies for EID Parry on a commission basis. She procures paddy from farmers for the company. She has done video-conferencing with the District Collector and with the Arvind Eye Hospital for the villagers. She earns Rs 3,000 per month for the family. She says, \u201cMoney is no criterion. People are ready to pay for services. They only approach the kiosk based on their needs.\u201d mostly revolve around video-conferencing, for which the need in the villages is almost negligible. It is recommended that e-education (including distance learning), e-governance and e-business services be provided. Content development is an area wherein efforts are still required. There is an urgent need to develop new partnerships with schools, colleges, universities, health centres and hospitals, local/ regional/national employment providers, various tiers of local bodies, various departments of the government, etc. Contact Information EID Parry (India) Ltd Nellikuppam, Cuddalore District, Tamil Nadu Tel: +91 442 445 5212 Fax: +91 442 445 5335 E-mail: raghunandank@murugappa.co.in Websites http://www.indiagriline.com http://www.tnnel.chiraag.com http://www.n-logue.co.in A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 93 Empowering the Poor Janmitra Jhalawar, Rajasthan Background The Government of Rajasthan has enacted the \u2018Right to Information Act, 2000\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f02afc2-585c-4cdd-8b2e-6d4c6ae9cc3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f02afc2-585c-4cdd-8b2e-6d4c6ae9cc3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Empowering the Poor", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "653eaceb3c135f3a5b07e0ddb6f3123ad6409507b392e49cb2687148fbb26d9e"}, "2": {"node_id": "d74b0cd5-47cc-45a9-94e1-61d433607dc2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc8322ca26b55e6a185ecac2c445b48d5044db3074d5020560c858e6b2c4207a"}}, "hash": "36a20172097b9c4d2256bd104d7e0b935972a61ff7e86da36f1547e03a8551c5", "text": "UNDP and DOPT, India, have launched \u2018Improving Citizen\u2019s Access to Information\u2019 projects in six different parts of India.

A needs assessment of the citizens was carried out and after discussions with concerned departments, the services for the project were finalized. A society named \u2018Janmitra Society\u2019 was formed for the implementation and monitoring of the project. RajComp, a Government of Rajasthan undertaking, was given the responsibility to prepare software for the project. Two officers were selected from each department for the project. Applications were invited to establish Janmitra kiosks at 17 major towns and villages of the district. A total of 137 applications were received. Villages for the kiosks were selected based on OFC connectivity, population, rural market place, link with major roads, community response and community participation. Out of 137 applications, based on hardware availability, location of the kiosk building, telephone connectivity, and enterprise skills of the applicant, local residence of the applicant and their educational background and knowledge of computers, 21 applicants were selected. These kiosk owners then signed an agreement with Janmitra Society for a period of one year (an annual license fee of Rs 6,000 was planned but was not deposited). All the hardware and equipment were bought or owned by the kiosk operators and they manage the kiosks on a franchisee basis from the earning from user charges. Nine new kiosks were also launched in August 2003. Services Provided Various e-governance services are provided on the network. Land records are issued at a cost of Rs 20 (Rs 10 for the Government and Rs 10 for the kiosk owner). In 1999 data were updated and records of all land, including urban land and non-agricultural land, are provided from the kiosk. Anyone can ask for the record of any survey number without filing a written application. Patwaris (or village revenue official) visit the kiosk in their jurisdiction on Mondays and Thursdays and sign the records. The records are then delivered to the user by the kiosk owner either Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 94 by hand or by courier. All other land-related records (like girdabri and maps) are manually provided by the patwaris. Redressal of complaints related to 14 different departments can be sought from these kiosks at Rs 10. The complainant is given a receipt on filing an application and redressal takes seven to 15 days. The complaint is sent physically to the concerned department through a courier along with the online transmission. The District Collector monitors them every Monday. The redressal or the action taken on the complaint is made available online. Rs 20 is charged for the online submission of applications (old age pension, caste certificates, domicile certificates, arms license, social security schemes, etc.). The application is also sent physically through courier. The project also provides e-mail facilities, online mandi rates of agriculture/horticulture produce, online rural market place (gramhaat), matrimonial alliances (vaivahiki). Public awareness services about health, education, animal husbandry and agriculture are also available. One hundred and fifty application forms (pertaining to government departments), the Below Poverty Line list, list of development works, citizen charter, electric connection priority list, village- wise immovable property rates and village-wise drinking water resources are also available to the users. The kiosks open from 9 am to 7 pm, but only provide e-governance services on working days from 10.30 am to 5.30 pm. Numerous offline services like games, DTP, job work, computer training, etc., are also available at these kiosks.

There is another redundant server in the server room. The server uses Windows 2000 Server as the Operating System and SQL Server as the database backend. The front end of the software is in Visual Basic 6.0 and ASP. Intranet connectivity is available at 128 Kbps, and 21 departments can connect to the server through dial-up connectivity while 13 departmental offices are on LAN with the server. The data files are transferred as XML files and uses Batch Mode Technique. That is, data is transferred in batches rather than as individual files, so the kiosk operator connects only once or twice in a day. Primary Access Points Primary Access Points are 30 Janmitra centres established by the time of the study. The services are not available on the World Wide Web. Capacity Building The initially selected 21 kiosk owners were given 18 days of intense training on hardware, software, network, services, entrepreneurship development, etc. All the district level officials were given four-day training. Two persons from each department have been identified as nodal officials and have been given training. New inputs are provided to kiosk owners and officials in monthly meetings. Constraints and Implementation Challenges The mindset of government departments and their officials was seen as a major constraint at the time of the launch of the project. All the officials and concerned personnel of related departments have been trained and the mindset has been largely changed through capacity building modules. These departments have been provided with computers and have either LAN or dial-up connectivity with the server. The project area has a low rate of literacy (only 60 percent and the female literacy rate is as low as 40 percent). There is a lack of IT awareness among the general population. The publicity and awareness campaigns regarding the project have had very limited success. The large geographical project area and social problems between various communities have always resulted in implementation challenges. The databases in different departments are built on different platforms and have different data structures. The integration of these databases Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 96 is very challenging. The online processing of complaints and applications is still not taking place. Most departments are manually and physically handling these applications and complaints after online submission and offline delivery of original documents. Manual land records are still issued by the village revenue functionary, which has resulted in two parallel systems. Data updating, especially of land records, has numerous problems. Mutations are taking place manually and are not being registered on the database regularly. There is a dearth of technical manpower in the district. The ratio of technical manpower and onsite requirement for support is not proportional. Rural areas in Rajasthan are facing power cuts for as long as 12-14 hours a day. The UPS provides some kind of back-up, but the power shortage is so acute that it has become an important implementation challenge for the project. Similarly, at the initial phase of the project, telephone connectivity was a major cause of concern. However, there has been a lot of improvement in the connectivity. Project Outcomes The project has been under implementation since March 2002. In three months (May-July 2003), 810 users obtained land records from the kiosks, 355 users filed complaints and 214 users used online applications. Considering the situation of the project area, the response towards these three e-governance services can be termed as satisfactory. All the kiosk owners are also successfully acting as stamp vendors, petition writers, computer education providers and DTP providers. The project has resulted in transparency and accountability through a single point contact with the government. The project has provided a healthy revenue stream to the majority of kiosks. Key Lessons Learnt The Internet has miniscule content in the local language and there is an absence of any context with local needs. In rural areas, Internet connectivity is also not available in remote places. The project has successfully confirmed that community networks in rural areas need not necessarily be on the Internet; and that the success of an ICT project in a rural area depends on the needs assessment at the initiation of the project and on proper selection of villages and entrepreneurs. The integration of various e-services and offline activities (along with other related services) can generate enough revenue at information kiosks. In the project, most kiosks are earning Rs 2,500-4,000 per month of net income. Some kiosks are earning as much as Rs 4,000-7,500 per month.

Government has to be a major partner in any successful e-governance networks. A crucial lesson learnt from the Janmitra project has been that a close partnership with government is essential in a successful e-governance project. Sustainability The project\u2019s sustainability depends upon its level of institutionalization. It still remains person driven, with the present District Collector providing the leadership. What will happen to the project after his transfer is yet to be seen. The Janmitra project has been a financially sustainable one, but its sustainability on administrative grounds is not confirmed yet. Most successful projects in India have failed after the transfer of the project champion from the project area. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 97 Empowering the Poor Human Interest Stories Financially healthy telecentre The Janmitra kiosk at Bhawanimandi is owned by Pradeep Soni, a 30-year-old post graduate and a diploma holder in computer applications. Besides a Pentium III computer with a printer and a UPS, his kiosk has a scanner, a photocopy machine, STD/PCO and a TV repairing unit. His services include stamp vending and petition work along with computer education, DTP, job work, etc. He earns Rs 1,000 per month from Internet access. His monthly earnings from the STD booth is Rs 3,000, photocopy work is Rs 2,500, online services Rs 2,500, offline services (including computer education) is Rs 2,500, and from the TV repairing unit Rs 1,500. His monthly expenses are around Rs 4,000, and he earns Rs 8,500 per month as net profit. He thinks that this has become possible because he has developed his kiosk as a \u2018Composite Information Centre\u2019. Online tracking of complaints Twenty-eight-year-old Mahesh Kumar Jain comes to the Pachpad kiosk every week. He is keeping track of the complaint he filed a month ago from the kiosk. His father, a gramsewak (village development functionary), died last year while in government service. Mahesh had applied for his own appointment as a gramsewak on humanitarian grounds in Jhalawad. He used to travel 135 km to reach there and wasted many days and thousands of rupees in travelling. When he heard about the Janmitra centre, he filed his appeal electronically. He came to know from the district administration that he was not eligible for the job as he was not a graduate (a pre-requisite for the job). He has re- applied for the job of a clerk. He is satisfied now with the progress of his application. He knows that his appointment as a clerk is just around the corner. Now, he is thinking of settling down and getting married. Replication and Scaling Up Janmitra has been replicated in Dehradun district of Uttaranchal. The Government of Rajasthan has decided to replicate the project in eight districts of Rajasthan. The project was to be scaled up to 40 centres over the three months following the study. Electricity, water and telephone bills payments from these centres are planned to be added to the services. Online court cases and online education are envisaged to be added to the system shortly. The project was planning to use WiLL technology from CorDECT in Khanpur and Bhawanimandi blocks, which will provide connectivity to all 400 villages in these blocks. Recommendations There is a need to implement a publicity campaign to popularize the e-services offered by the network as these have not become popular in the rural areas. The project has not yet realized the full cooperation of the gram panchayats. Local and traditional bodies in rural areas should be involved in the campaign. It is recommended that land record mutations should be initiated online and security features built up to safeguard unauthorized updating or manipulation of land record databases. It is also recommended that departments be streamlined so that online processing and disposal of complaints and applications become possible. This would require a significant amount of back-end processing. The project should start e-payment services at the earliest, as it is a felt-need of the villagers and the community.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f97f6b4-8104-4948-a0c1-8d5320ed1ab7": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f97f6b4-8104-4948-a0c1-8d5320ed1ab7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Empowering the Poor", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fce6590a76f68028d817f3b088bc7246437af62a2c81cc2d5f3ef689269ca003"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7517909-dfef-45f1-8611-c85f741a00ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89e56e21d5ead014d308a56eba7e6b829422c4bb6295e01c566db8151e72c790"}}, "hash": "59f1d9f15631bedcd18ae2a0c2bd6f109f2ef2b3948669ca43c2c0e4a4243ef6", "text": "In-house capacity building should be taken up, as the project is technically dependent on two technicians hired for server room management by the Janmitra Society.

These have been in the form of electronic documentation and information exchange, information and service delivery to citizens, process automation and smaller computerization initiatives. One such initiative has been taken in the Godhra district of Gujarat. This project is known as \u2018Mahitishakti\u2019 (\u201cpower of information\u201d). The Mahitishakti project was started in 2001 and has facilitated information access for the rural citizens of the Panchmahal district. The project is implemented through about 80 information centres (Mahiti Shakti Kendras) through which citizens can access various types of information, Gujarat Geographic Information System (GGIS) maps, medical information, legal aid, online submission of applications, e-Darbar and opinion poll facility, grievance redressal, Mahiti Mahisagar (an electronic newsletter), photo gallery, entertainment like music, magazines, other useful Internet sites, etc. The project was supported by UNDP, the state government and actively promoted by Gujarat Informatics Ltd (GIL). Goals and Objectives G Electronic/online form submission, transactions and information exchange (e.g. citizen-government). G Immediate access to information on government schemes and subsidies, etc. G Online grievance redressal. G Enhanced and effective citizen-to- government interaction. G Dissemination of useful citizen-centric information, transactions and services. G The broad goals of the project are: G Transparency: Periodic display of the progress/status of schemes and plans. G Right to Information : Empowering the consumer of information. G Demystifying the office: Addressed with due support and access mechanisms. Planning The Collector of Godhra held discussions with the Concept Centre for Electronic Governance (CCEG) of IIM-A in October 2000 to develop a portal for enabling Citizen to Government (C2G) and Government to Citizen (G2C) transactions using IT as a medium. This was based on participatory rural appraisal exercises carried out by various NGOs. In October 2001, the project was launched by converting 14 STD/ PCOs as Mahiti Shakti Kendras (MSKs). Services Provided Over 200 forms have been made available for transactions between citizens and the government. These forms carry details of the documents to be attached with the main form at the time of submission. The forms and checklists have been made available as printouts at a prescribed fee at the MSKs. Information pertaining to ongoing schemes like those under the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) and District Planning Board (DPB), Tribal Area Sub Plan (TASP) and scarcity relief works, etc., are also available. The web- enabled version of the GGIS developed by Remote Sensing and Communication Unit Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 100 (RESECO) gives details of the resources available in every village of the district which are available in a query-based system. An electronic newsletter called Mahiti Mahisagar featuring medical help, legal help, a science corner, a children's corner, etc., is published. There is also a grievance redressal forum for citizens to voice their specific complaints. Electronic form submission for applications such as National Old Age Pension Scheme (NOAPS) are available, as well as water-related grievances and ration card applications. The applicant fills the form at the kiosk. The back-end process is carried out by the government staff and the final reply is sent to the applicant by e-mail and post. The portal also provides a chat session with the ministers and senior officers of the district.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98f7b218-ac1e-4539-9bd3-355973241c20": {"__data__": {"id_": "98f7b218-ac1e-4539-9bd3-355973241c20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Empowering the Poor", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34034a34c31557698028a716ccdd12ed8596166896cea951e4a1abc102cafb33"}, "2": {"node_id": "2dce78a7-22f6-4d26-8bf7-15c229b50892", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2794253abed63b999f54944f0e157ca45a5568ae1251ff081389948f0e910afb"}}, "hash": "ad2e3404bc6373f8b5166ce3b0b652cb291f0714019814884f13e4e9e57013bd", "text": "The portal also provides a chat session with the ministers and senior officers of the district.

The legal enabling framework between the trust and the MSKs is attained through a detailed contract agreement. The district information officer of NIC does the monitoring and is also the webmaster of the website. Data entry operators process the data for the portal. The line departments upgrade and update the information. NIC, RESECO and GIL provide the technological support to the MSKs. Technologies This project focuses on leveraging existing infrastructure with minimal additional costs/ resources such as converting the MSKs from existing STD/PCO booths. These MSKs have a computer with 128 MB RAM, 1.7 Ghz, 40 GB HDD and a dot matrix printer. A portal has been developed in ASP, Java and HTML whereas the database is in Access and Oracle. The client-end is on Windows 98. This portal has been developed by IIM-A. GIL and Adit Microsys (a private agency) manage the server whereas connectivity is established through a dial-up modem. Primary Access Points The primary access points are the nearest MSKs. There are 73 MSKs (48 STD booths and 25 dairy cooperatives). Capacity Building The MSK operators are provided with on-the-job training on using the computer and the portal. Constraints and Implementation Challenges The district of Panchmahals (Godhra) faced the worst ever communal riots lasting for six months in 2002, which hampered the growth of the project. STD/PCO booth operators have high expectations, which became difficult to manage through the basic ICTs that were deployed. There is a paucity of online dynamic data on the network, as mostly static data is being used. The management of the servers by Adit Microsys, located hundreds of kilometres away from the project site, also hampers the efficient management of the network. The apathy of government officials of line departments and technical departments is also a major implementation challenge. There is a conflicting situation between NIC and Gujarat State Wide Area Network (GSWAN), so much so that they are grossly under-utilized. Large files take a lot of time to download due to poor connectivity. Internet connectivity is poor as only six out of 80 MSKs have Internet connections. Frequent interruptions caused by irregular power cuts for three hours in the daytime obstruct the smooth functioning of the MSKs. Backend processing of the information received from MSKs is non- existent. Project Outcomes As many as 200 forms have been made available online. Some process reengineering has also taken place after approval of the government, reducing paperwork, for instance, in the NOAPS, the applicant does not now need to append the proof of age, income and residence while submitting the form. The Mahitishakti website is available on a 24x7 basis and facilitates online filling of forms, complaints, applications, etc. The most commonly used service is downloading the government forms. In all MSKs, 85 percent of the revenue is generated from downloading these forms. Most of the MSKs are not connected to the Internet. There is no intranet connectivity at the kiosks. Most MSKs are using CDs to download government forms, voter lists, BPL list and list of development works, etc. Key Lessons Learnt The project underlines the importance of an assessment of community needs before a planning community network. The strategy of converting existing STD/PCOs into MSKs is quite practical as an already established infrastructure can be optimally utilized for information and Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 102 communication needs. The project highlights the importance of intranet networks in rural settings as Internet connectivity is still very poor, especially in rural areas. The innovative use of GIS for citizens is a pioneering application. The project also effectively uses the local language, which facilitates usage of the network by citizens. Sustainability The project has converted existing STD/PCO booths and milk cooperative into MSKs. No project funding has been provided for this conversion; entrepreneurs have financed their own MSKs. However, the financial sustainability of these MSKs is doubtful. Internet connections are not available in most MSKs. Online transactions are also not taking place properly.

The shop sold books and stationery items. He later started providing STD/PCO and photocopier services at the store. In September 2001, he took a bank loan of Rs 47,000 from Bank of India under the Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Yojana. Out of the money he borrowed from the bank, he bought a Pentium III computer, an HP inkjet printer, a web camera and a UPS in order to start MSK services from his bookstore. He has earned Rs 134,000 from selling 9,900 forms. He also provides Internet browsing at the cost of Rs 20 per hour and has also undertaken DTP work. He says, \u201cI used to earn Rs 4,000 per month from the STD booth in my store earlier. With a gross reduction in the STD charges, this income has plummeted to only Rs 1,000\u201d. He feels online registration for employment and availability of land records could improve the profitability of the MSK. Replication and Scaling Up A total of 84 outlets at Dairy Cooperatives and 22 outlets of the District Cooperative Banks are planned to provide information at the grass- roots level. The state government has been planning for funding support from the UNDP to scale up the project in 28 districts of Gujarat. It has signed an MoU with N-Logue Communications Pvt Ltd to provide CorDECT technology for 10,000 villages in the Gyan Ganga project. Electronic payments of electricity bills, water bills, telephone bills, property taxes, etc., are also planned for this implementation. Recommendations Most of the data on this rural portal is static and online transactions are not taking place. However, it is recommended that electronic payments of different dues and taxes should only start after ensuring e-readiness of the network. The absence of land records in the project slows down its growth. Income at most MSKs comes fromdownloading government forms and is therefore very low, which is causing anxiety and unrest amongst MSK owners. Procedural restructuring and reengineering of government processes has not been taken up. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 103 Empowering the Poor Other income generating sources like stamp vending, deed-petition writing, etc., could also be added. It is also recommended that backend processing should be urgently improved, as it has become a major bottleneck in the growth of the project. It is also recommended that e-education, e-health and e-commerce activities be included in the project. The capacity building of government officials managing the project is far from satisfactory and needs to be improved. There is a need to increase utilization of land and GSWAN for the betterment of the project. It is also recommended that MIS be developed for the network. It is essential that all services should be made functional and operational, and sustainability and its viability should be assessed before scaling up the project.

This public- private programme also involves the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University. The technology provides high speed Internet wireless access to more than 1,000 systems within a radius of 25 km. The kiosks have been established by individuals who invested Rs 50,000 in computers and other accessories. Now these owners, who have installed the user-friendly Tamil software \u2018Padhami\u2019, \u2018Padhakkam\u2019 and \u2018Minnal\u2019, make an average income of Rs 2,500 a month and their patronage is growing steadily. As of the time of the study, a large number of villagers in these 30 villages have e-mail identities, which they use, among other purposes, for seeking assistance from the Government under various schemes. The SARI project has evoked excellent response from the Government and the public.

Target Group and Intended Beneficiaries The beneficiaries are the rural people from remote villages of Madurai. N-Logue encourages small entrepreneurs in all small towns and villages where it sets up its operations, to promote Internet awareness. Institutional Arrangements At the top level is N-Logue, which provides equipment, training and support and also takes care of regulatory and connectivity issues. To represent the second level, N-Logue identifies partners with a local entrepreneur (LSP) in every area in which it wishes to operate. These LSPs find subscribers, provide services and collect payments. At the lowest level are the village kiosks, which provide services and information aimed at the rural market. With the help of N-Logue, the LSPs recruit the local entrepreneurs who set up the kiosks. Thus there are up to three business entities involved in the operation \u2013 N-Logue, the LSP and a kiosk operator. They must work together for the operation to succeed.

Each kiosk has one Celeron PC (1.1 GHz), 20 GB HDD, 64 MB RAM, one dot matrix printer, one web camera, one UPS and one wall set with antenna. Primary Access Points The primary access points are the Chirag kiosks located in the houses of the villagers. Capacity Building Basic training on computers, the Internet and use of other services has been provided for two weeks. This training is provided inhouse whereas monthly kiosk meetings give a refresher course to the managers of the kiosk. Special training is also given to the operator in charge of technology on server management and refresher courses (held in Chennai). Local people with a minimum high school education and three to 12 months of computer education were selected as kiosk operators. They undergo eight days of formal training provided by the company. This is, at present, being imparted at Madurai Centre for Entrepreneurship Development. The training covers: G Basics of computers. G Use of Internet and other related services like e-mail, information searches, etc. G Various applications developed specifically for this project like e-government services. G General maintenance of various electronic gadgets installed at the information kiosk. G Marketing of services offered by the information kiosk at the local level. Constraints and Implementation Challenges The introduction of new CorDECT technology in rural areas is an implementation challenge. The limited numbers of telephones in the rural areas are inadequate to fully utilize the capacity provided by the CorDECT technology. Building three towers and six repeaters along with kiosks maintaining line-of-sight access is not a small technological challenge.

Human Interest Story \u201cEarlier, we had to pay at least Rs 250 to get an income certificate or old age pension. Now, the cost is only Rs 29, which includes a printout of the e-mail acknowledgement from the tahsildar,'' says 70-year-old Mondi of Pathinettangudi. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 107 Empowering the Poor Sustainability The project works on user charges. The technology is cost effective, but returns from investments still do not fully justify the existence of the project. The approach of using self-help groups in managing the kiosks is innovative but the kiosks are unable to provide adequate remuneration to all members of the group. Replication and Scaling Up The project has been replicated in many locations in Tamil Nadu including Nellikupam, Madira, Tirpur, Bhawani, Melladudurai, Shivganga and Tiruvallen. At the time of the study, 6,000 kiosks in Gujarat and Maharashtra had been sanctioned to be opened using the same methodology of implementation. The project has also been also replicated in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

It is a member-based organization working for poor women workers in the informal sector. Its members consist of street vendors, hawkers, kite makers, gum collectors, artisans, salt workers, etc. SEWA organizes workers to enter the mainstream of the economy through the strategy of struggle and development. SEWA has more than 750,000 members across India and more than 530,000 members in Gujarat. Two-thirds of its membership in Gujarat lives in rural areas. SEWA incorporates three movements: cooperative, women and labour. It believes in struggle and development: struggle against constraints and limitations imposed on women by society and the economy, and development to strengthen women's bargaining power and offer them new alternatives. SEWA has realized the power of ICTs for the development of the informal sector. Goals and Objectives SEWA's two main goals are to organize women workers to obtain full employment and self- reliance. Work security, income security, food security and social security are important aspects in this regard. To achieve these goals, SEWA has adopted an integrated approach of promoting collective strength and bargaining power for capital formation at the household level. Access to financial services to build capacity has been made possible so that members can compete in the market place and access market infrastructure, technology, information, education, and relevant skills, asset building, healthcare and child care. Planning SEWA uses ICT for enhancing efficiency and efficacy for its women members as well as for institutional capacity building. SEWA believes that, by doing this, it can create more employment opportunities for women. Services Provided SEWA has an integrated approach through which it assists its members in different ways: G SEWA bank for savings and credit. G SEWA social security (this includes insurance, healthcare, childcare). G Mahila SEWA housing trust. G SEWA Academy for all kinds of trainings. G SEWA Video. G SEWA Gram Mahila Haat. G SEWA Trade Facilitation Centre. G SEWA Union. G SEWA rural district associations (Gram Vikas). G SEWA BDMSA (Banaskanth DWCRA Mahila SEWA Association). Target Group and Intended Beneficiaries SEWA has a membership of over 530,000 women in Gujarat. The annual membership fee is Rs 5. To become a member, an individual be in the BPL category. All members of SEWA are informal sector women workers.

These associations act as a hub for the rest of the activities, hence the satellite communication programme (SatCom) is conducted at these offices. Telephones, fax, xerox and computers are also installed at these offices. The majority of its members use these centres for retrieving information. In some districts, SEWA has started developing Community Learning Centres (CLCs). These centres are located as clusters, with one centre for 12-13 villages. CLCs act as hubs for activities such as training and capacity building, Jeevan Shala (life school), savings and credit, housing, embroidery, salt laboratory, gum collection, etc. This centre includes a satellite communication set-up, 24-hour video- conferencing, data warehousing and disaster mitigation-related information. Capacity Building SEWA has been successful in building the capacity of poor women workers in the rural and How effective is SEWA in building women\u2019s capacity towards employment and self-reliance Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 110 urban informal sector by introducing various ICT tools and technologies. It started the video unit in 1984, which created a great impact on policy decisions pertaining to the life of informal sector women workers. With its satellite communication programme, started in 2000, it has educated members about the importance of insurance in their lives. This tool proved to be very useful at the time of an earthquake, for relief work and reconstruction. SEWA has also started video- conferencing for training in embroidery, advocacy, consultancy, and experience sharing amongst different districts. It has recently started computer training aimed at its members and their children. This programme has started showing good results. Members are able to access relevant information. Their ability to find alternative employment opportunities has increased tremendously. Constraints and Implementation Challenges SEWA strongly believes in development. The key challenge is getting women workers organized so that they have collective bargaining power. The other biggest challenge is the provision of appropriate tools and technologies for such women. \u2018Appropriate\u2019 means customized and financially viable. The language constraint is also a challenge to the further successful implementation. Project Outcomes SEWA uses a variety of technologies for spreading information to its members. SEWA makes sure that the video replay programme reaches all members, including the ones at the remotest places. The Satcom programme helps the members to directly interact with key officials. The outcome that the SEWA programme seeks from its computer training programme is self-reliance and creation of alternate employment opportunities. Until now, over 100 members have started using computers in their day-to-day activities. Key Lessons Learnt SEWA has created a blueprint for the informal sector. It has initiated many needs-based projects like water campaigns, policy-related changes, microcredit and microinsurance. In short, SEWA has adopted an integrated approach in a real sense. To provide an informal sector women worker with livelihood security and for her to achieve self- reliance, many requirements have to be met. The provision of savings and credit facilities, childcare, housing (asset building), watershed development, healthcare (hospital, midwives cooperative, insurance), training and capacity building are just some in which SEWA has been effective. SEWA has adopted ICT tools and technologies to facilitate members in achieving their objectives. A variety of tools are being used for this purpose. The technology used in SEWA is customized, hence it is optimally utilized. Technology has played an important role in the lives of thousands of its members. Sustainability SEWA\u2019s project is sustainable because it has a community-based approach. The programme is based on membership fees. SEWA does not believe in providing services for free. Until now, the project has relied on contributions from the members themselves. Replication and Scaling Up SEWA\u2019s various programmes have been replicated in more than five countries. SEWA, as the largest primary trade union for informal sector women workers, has been a role model in setting the blueprint for this sector. From the point of view of scalability, SEWA has adopted the latest tools and technologies, based on their relevance to the project.

She captured the harassment caused by the traffic police and trespassers to vegetable vendors. When this case was taken to court, it was declared that space should be allotted on the terrace of the vegetable market. This decision was impractical for women members as it was difficult for them to carry vegetables weighing 10 or more kilos up to the terrace. They were also not sure whether customers would come to the terrace to buy their vegetables. Therefore, the women vendors arranged a meeting to discuss this problem. Leelaben captured their discussion, which was heartrending. Then she presented it to the Municipal Commissioner of Ahmedabad. After watching the video, the Commissioner was in tears. It compelled him to change the policy and allocate space for two baskets from each vendor in the busy market. The power of computers Shobhnaben is a member of SEWA, active in savings and credit as well as a housing team leader. She used to work in the fields with her parents; and had no education due to financial constraints and workload. However, she did not give up her ambition. She completed a computer training programme at SEWA, and is the only woman who knows how to use a computer in her village. She insisted that the government school purchase a computer so that the future generation could become computer literate. She is now teaching schoolchildren computers from which she makes an income. Now, the digital format has been adopted. The video team is made up of both literate and semi-literate members. SEWA was the first organization to optimally utilize a satellite communication programme and then to extend this to 24-hour video-conferencing. Currently SEWA is providing consultancy in developing a customized CD-based programme for financial literacy to microenterprises. SEWA has also developed a course curriculum especially for semi-literate women, which can be replicated in similar areas for computer training. Recommendations SEWA needs to complete proper documentation, particularly in project management activities. Proper documentation for each project is essential in evaluating project outcomes and deciding the sustainability parameters. Even though the infrastructure is available at the district level, the centre is yet to optimally utilize ICT tools. To the spread of membership across Gujarat and India, there is a dire need to establish a networked solution. This will enable faster internal and external communication.

TARAhaat covers all three components for rural connectivity: content, access and fulfilment. The TARAhaat.com mother portal, a growing repository of information on issues of sustainable development, furnishes content. Access is provided through a network of franchised local enterprises. Delivery of information, goods and services is provided by local courier services or franchised TARAvans. The pilot phase began in August 2000 in the districts of Bundelkhand, surrounding the city of Jhansi. TARAhaat has been conceived with the view that it has to be mastered and used by people with wide variations in literacy, language, financial liquidity and levels of understanding. The project is implemented by an NGO called Development Alternatives, which has a staff of more than 400. It is a national not-for-profit organization working for 18 years on issues of sustainable development (equity, efficient management of resources, environmental conservation and empowerment) in the field, creating sustainable livelihoods (village industry, reforestation, water retaining structures, low energy buildings and materials, eco-friendly products and services).

Services Provided TARAhaat is a company dedicated to continuous innovation and product development. It creates its products and services in response to the needs of its customers. Its current products are focused on education, communication and e-governance. Its educational products, developed by TARAhaat\u2019s educational wing TARAgyan, range from those that equip A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 113 Empowering the Poor individuals with the skills needed to succeed in the job markets to those that enable them to compete in the global market place. Content on law, governance, health and livelihoods is already available, and content is added every day. Commodities market information, listings of the local yellow pages, and information about products are also available. One of the largest revenue streams of TARAhaat is envisaged to be e-education. The portal has begun delivering a basic computing course that combines classroom teaching and hands-on computer practice (offline and online). The subsidiary units in the portal include: G TARAdhaba which provided connectivity to villagers. G TARAbazaar which provides access to products and services needed by rural households, farmers and industries. G TARAvan which delivers goods ordered. G TARAdak which connects the rural families to the daughter married far off and to the son posted on the front. G TARAguru which provides mentoring and consultancy to village-based mini- enterprises. G TARAscouts/TARAreporter which collects relevant information for the portal. G TARAvendor which runs the store that will cater to products available at Tarabazaar.

The intended beneficiaries are rural folks and students. Institutional Arrangements TARAhaat.com is a portal centrally managed by Development Alternatives. The project implementation agency reports about the performance to the project partners. Rural kiosks managed by entrepreneurs as franchisees are monitored and supervised by a team of project managers and field officers. Technologies As a website on the Internet, TARAhaat is available to any user on the web. During the pre- rollout pilot phase, it was accessed through 20- odd TARAkendras by a growing number of users in two rural regions of the country: Bhatinda (amongst the richest regions) and Bundelkhand (amongst the poorest). TARAhaat brings the Internet and its benefits directly into the lives of rural poor in the remotest villages of India. It is a unique combination of a mother portal nurturing several vertical and horizontal portals within it, together with franchised cyber kiosks and delivery vans. TARAhaat combines a mother portal, TARAhaat.com, supported by franchised networks of village cybercaf\u00e9s and delivery systems to provide a full range of services to its clients. Primary Access Points Primary access points are the rural kiosks established in the rural areas and owned by private entrepreneurs as franchisees. Capacity Building TARAhaat provides training and management support to its network of franchised TARAkendras to enable them to provide standardized services. It also acts as a central provider of the products and services needed, adapting them to meet the local needs of each region. Constraints and Implementation Challenges The project has been launched by an NGO to initiate a sustainable network with the support of project partners and private entrepreneurs. The project faced difficulties in managing most of the services envisaged, as the government departments did not support the NGO initiative as originally expected. Some of the services provided in the network did not motivate villagers to come to the kiosks as they were considered not much use. The returns from the rural kiosks were miniscule compared to the investments made by private entrepreneurs. As around a dozen project partners were engaged in funding, the project faced the problem of too many investments in superfluous activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b65aff3-dd81-4314-9729-9a459e59f2ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b65aff3-dd81-4314-9729-9a459e59f2ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Empowering the Poor", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea01a818127cbd4797251411fd6fd595f0e2d98853e5f708467c50f3aa1bf5b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe506e83-b1e6-4213-a2ca-1e9793aab4ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8ecd24020f8c993bb4ad5d6c171e61d1f9b0b523c7779b29525df128bc9972a"}}, "hash": "e6c63f74dd3796f6aab525a59bf510e731d2ebf93b61b18dd79d11969d811b69", "text": "The project also depended heavily on e-commerce activities, which could not be realized in the project area.

A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 115 Empowering the Poor While the project provides a menu of services that is similar, in many ways, to other rural ICT projects, its current business model requires a considerable influx of capital before it can become self-sufficient. Key Lessons Learnt TARAhaat revealed a unique prospect for creating a financially viable rural network but it has failed to deliver the goods and has been unable to attain all its objectives and goals. The project relies on a combination of the mother portal nurturing several vertical and horizontal portals within it, together with franchised kiosks and delivery vans. The software used in the project is very user-friendly and has been professionally created. But poor backup arrangements and support system has made it nearly useless. A key lesson learnt is that as in the case of dot com firms, backward integration is important in rural ICT networks too. Human Interest Stories Speed of technology and business Lalitpur is the largest commodities trading centre of Bundelkhand and attracts itinerant traders daily from as far away as 150 km. They could not believe that they could get speedy information about their business at this (or any) TARAkendra. Ashok Kumar, a commodities trader from Delhi, said, \u201cMy father earlier made a profit margin of 20 percent because he had a car. Nobody had the information at the speed that he did. Long-distance call kiosks and, recently, roaming mobile phones, have changed all that so that margins are now below 5 percent. With the farmer having market knowledge, business will get even more competitive.\u201d He is transforming his business to real estate and rural cold storage facilities. Computers to the rescue Veerpal Kaur and Gurubhakt Singh, who had not seen a computer till a few months ago, are learning to operate a computer at their village TARAkendra and enjoying every bit of it. They are familiar with the basics of computers \u2013DOS, MSPaint \u2013 and can also surf the Net. The story, echoed by many youth in the villages of Bathinda and Bundelkhand, are especially significant as both are physically handicapped and could not have travelled to town to learn computing. Their self-esteem is regenerated enough for these two high-school dropouts to seek higher education and a career in IT. Sustainability TARAhaat was conceived as a business model. Twelve different private partners invested to start rural-based services from privately owned kiosks. The returns expected from privately owned kiosks did not materialize. The emphasis remained on preparation of the software and less importance was given to the services provided by the project. In the first two years of the project, the losses incurred on kiosks forced the owners to shut them down. The project has failed in fulfilling its business model objectives. Replication and Scaling Up TARAhaat was launched as a pilot in late 2000 in Bundelkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. In 2001, TARAhaat expanded its operations into Punjab. Presently, TARAhaat has 22 centres. The financial structure of TARAhaat breaks new ground by providing simultaneously for equity shareholder value and societal stakeholder wealth in a manner that maximizes both. Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 116 Recommendations It is recommended that the kiosks should not be expanded in other regions of rural India unless the present setup is made financially viable for the project partners and private entrepreneurs. It is also recommended that functional relationships be built with government departments through which numerous e-government services can be delivered to the masses. e-Education and e-health services in TARAhaat.com should be outsourced to other agencies working in this field. The cost of creating rural kiosks can further be curtailed so that their financial feasibility improves. More concrete steps are required to promote ICT-related services in rural areas. TARAhaat.com can also try to include more computer education in rural areas through its kiosks. It is recommended that more community practitioners than technologist be employed in the project.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7857c53a-aed6-4019-b7af-a17d13e18230": {"__data__": {"id_": "7857c53a-aed6-4019-b7af-a17d13e18230", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Empowering the Poor", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ff2b40a9b915784afa3c87209416fc96f590c9e950d727b0335012059bd3d61"}, "2": {"node_id": "5435fb4b-d457-4f0e-9a7b-2822c42872ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/empowering-poor", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f915073ae6d8b3239748c00b91831967daee07280d09c420999c4648efc8b0cd"}}, "hash": "bd277cb1dd4bb5070230d22279361030fabab0fef8212d41bf0866a0a25d2f7c", "text": "It is recommended that more community practitioners than technologist be employed in the project.

Its focus is on the empowerment of the rural poor and socially disadvantaged through microcredit and education programmes. It has been functioning in this field since 1993 in five districts of Tamil Nadu. It has 2,000 sanghas (women credit and thrift groups) and 60,000 women members. The organization provides loans ranging from Rs 2,000 to 6,000 at 12 percent interest rate for income generating activities and also for consumption activities. It has loaned Rs 480 million to around 39,000 members. The repayment rate of loans has been 98.4 percent. ASA decided to use the women sanghas to help bridge the digital divide. In May 2003, Vidyal Information Service Provider (VISP) was launched in six villages in phase I. Goals and Objectives G To empower the weaker sections of the rural community through the use of ICT. G To ensure equal digital opportunities to the have-nots in the villages. G To build a vibrant rural economy by becoming a rural ITES provider. G To build a sustainable, replicable and scalable business model. G To create rural techno entrepreneurs by leveraging the existing microfinance network of ASA. Planning The credit and thrift activities of ASA were adapted from the Gameen Bank of Bangladesh. The Grameen Technology Centre (GTC) provided financial and technological support to ASA for the implementation of VISP. The Drishtee Foundation was engaged to provide technical inputs and software/networking to the project. This foundation is a major IT- enabled service provider of platforms to deliver information and services to rural India and has the experience of managing 200 kiosks across five states. It was envisaged to start the VISP project in six villages (Somerasampettai, Kallukudi, Ramachandra Nagar, Thuvarankuruchi, Vaiyampatti and Manapparai) in phase I after carrying out a needs assessment of the villages. The location of the kiosks, or Community Technology Centres (CTCs), was chosen by the villagers and the entrepreneur was selected by the sangha members. The cost of the kiosk has been kept at the lowest at Rs 48,000. Each kiosk has one Celeron computer, a printer, a scanner, a copier, and a UPS, along with furniture, a telephone line and an ISP connection. Fifty percent of the project cost has been sanctioned as a long-term loan by ASA (12 percent interest; nine-months\u2019 grace and five-year long repayment schedule). Services Provided The services provided at VISP centres include the provision of prices of agricultural commodities, information on horoscopes and rural market places, matrimonial services, educational services, healthcare services, grievance redressals, provision of government forms, etc. Users are also provided discount Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 118 coupons to three private hospitals of Thiruchirapalli. They can get a 10-20 percent discount when submitting them to the hospitals. Other services include web browsing, DTP, data entry job work, net-to-phone and basic computer education. At the time of the field visit, most of the services were not made operational. Target Group and Intended Beneficiaries The target population is the residents of villages (and nearby villages). The emphasis has been on empowerment of the women members of sanghas. Institutional Arrangements There is a programme coordinator from ASA, a consultant from GTC and a technical resource person from Drishtee. Besides, a technical assistant, a marketing manager, and a service coordinator are provided by the implementation agency, ASA. Technologies The client end uses Windows 98/XP as the Operating System and Internet Explorer. The software is in Tamil. The server is maintained in the field office of Drishtee at Thiruchirapalli.

To a certain extent, the software does not match the objectives and goals of the project organization as well. Project Outcomes The cost to set up a kiosk is minimized in this project. This makes the management of the kiosk more profitable compared to the investment. The project has generated enthusiasm among villagers in using IT to alleviate poverty. The use of standardized software without creating local content has become a crucial challenge in managing the project. Poor connectivity through dial-up modems slows down the growth of the project. Most services, especially those related to e-governance, are not provided optimally by the district administration. This has created a major hindrance in its usage by the villagers. Key Lessons Learnt One of the key lessons learnt is that it is possible to reduce the initial investment cost of the kiosk. This, in turn, increases the financial feasibility of the kiosk. ASA has ensured that the capital investment on the kiosk was kept as low as Rs 48,000 (Celeron computer for Rs 23,000, scanner and printer for Rs 8,000, UPS for Rs 2,500, furniture for Rs 3,500, telephone line and ISP connection for Rs 3,000 and working capital of Rs 8,000). ASA has been working with women over the last decade and has been trying to piggyback the ICT network on the positive synergistic energies built in sanghas (as done by Grameen Trust in Bangladesh to implement Grameen Phone). Another important lesson learnt from the project is that the CTCs should be established initially in only those villages where there is demand. The project has also largely avoided \u2018re-inventing the wheel\u2019 by involving Drishtee Foundation in the development of software and establishment of network. Sustainability The project had been operational for only a short period by the time of the study. The restriction on the initial capital cost of the VISP centre increases the chances of future viability. Replication and Scaling Up The project has not been replicated anywhere else. Until the project outcomes are substantial and its financial viability is proven, there is little chance of it being replicated. Even then, it could be replicable (with some modifications) in places where microcredit operations have been established. ASA is keen to scale up the project Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 120 to 30 villages in six months following the successful outcome of phase I, and to continue opening increasing numbers after that. The project also plans to scale up services by including electricity billing, telephone billing, and railway reservations, stamp vending licenses, bus reservations, and video- conferencing. Recommendations Training provided from VISP centres should be standardized. Internet connectivity is poor, and that has reduced the demand for Internet browsing. There is an urgent need to establish reliable online connectivity, as all online services are to be provided from an Internet website. The Drishtee Foundation has been working in five Indian states in the field of community networking. It has developed user- friendly software for Indian villages and is using the same software (with Tamil fonts) without any customization. It is important that the software used in the project should cater to the local needs. The rural bazaar and matrimonial services have no local database. Mechanisms to build and update such databases should be explored. The local village council (gram panchayat) has not been involved in planning, implementation or monitoring of VISP centres in the village. Similarly, the project seems to be functioning without much support or involvement of various government departments. The e-government services promised by the VISP centres are still far away from implementation. e-Governance would be possible through VISP centres only after the involvement of various state government departments and all the three tiers of panchayat institutions. The project should try to impart e-education and e-health services through these centres, as these services could be engaged much more easily. Even offline activities, like horoscopes, a telephone directory, government information, government forms, etc., have not been provided.

This complex includes 25 cooperative societies, with an annual turnover of Rs 6 billion involved in the production of sugar and dairy products, poultry, and building construction. The Warana Project is jointly executed by the National Informatics Centre and the Planning Commission, Government of India; the Directorate of Information Technology and State Government of Maharashtra; and the Warana Sahakari Dugdh Utpadan Prakriya Limited (WSDUPL), Warana Nagar. The total cost of the project is Rs 25 million which was borne jointly by the three agencies in a ratio of 50:40:10. Goals and Objectives G To provide computerized facilitation booths in 70 villages, which are linked up to the central computer network at Warana Nagar. G To bring Warana Nagar on NICNET. G To increase the efficiency/ productivity of the existing cooperative societies by providing state-of-the-art computer communication network and latest database technology. G To create a database of villagers on various socio-economic aspects. G To provide tele-education to both primary and higher educational institutes by developing IT centres at most populous points. G To establish GIS of 70 villages. G To create greater transparency in the functioning of the cooperative society. Planning The Warana Wired Village Project was launched as a first wired village pilot with the joint effort of Government of India, Government of Maharashtra and a sugar cooperative. It was expected to wire 70 villages of Kolhapur and Sangli district of Maharashtra so as to establish a rural network connecting these villages with a computer network. Primarily, the project planned to provide IT facilities to sugarcane growers and members of the sugar cooperative societies. During the implementation of the project, various other services, like land records, prices of agricultural commodities in different markets and knowledge about various agricultural practices were provided. Some of the centres were linked with a VSAT and others were provided connectivity with dial-up modems. Services Provided The system includes web-based and intranet- based applications. The web-based applications are the agriculture produce market information system, agricultural schemes and crop technology information system, computer learning aids, village information systems, educational and vocational guidance systems, government documents and procedures systems, and computerization of the local cooperative market. Intranet-based systems Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 122 include the wired management of sugarcane cultivation, land records, the computerization of the Warana Milk Dairy, and a Grievance Registration and Redressal System. Target Group and Intended Beneficiaries The target beneficiaries are farmers, sugarcane growers and other villagers. It is intended to serve the information needs of farmers for cultivation practices, pests and disease control, marketing information and information on processing, bill payment position of sugarcane and dairy products. Institutional Arrangements The kiosk managers are usually government servants who are officially allocated the management of kiosks in rural areas. The content has been created in the local Marathi language by the NIC office in Pune, Maharashtra, through extensive interactions with the cooperative societies. The content is regularly maintained and enhanced at the location of the central system within the local university. Technologies NIC Pune is responsible for the design, development, and implementation of the Warana Wired Village Project. Both the University and business centres of Warana along with the six most populous villages (IT centres) around Warana have been chosen to house the VSATs. The IT centres are equipped with dial-up capability and UPS back-ups. Facilitation booths have been set up in 70 How effective is the Warana Wired Village Project in supporting 25 cooperative societies and accelerating socio-economic development A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 123 Empowering the Poor villages.

The information or services are available through a government servant managed kiosk. The connectivity available at these access points are either through VSAT or through dial-up modem. Capacity Building The project staff at the server end has been given extensive training in database management, networking and hardware maintenance. The kiosk managers in rural areas were given training for three days to use software effectively and to operate hardware equipment efficiently. Constraints and Implementation Challenges Warana Wired Village Project, as a pioneering community network project, has faced numerous constraints and implementation challenges. The standardization of databases at the sugar cooperative was an initial challenge which was effectively handled. The problem of connectivity in rural areas was taken care of through VSAT along with dial-up modem connectivity. Software prepared by NIC was upgraded many times to facilitate smooth functioning of services on the network. The kiosks have been managed by government servants which has created a situation where the services are available at the kiosks only on working days between 10 am and 5 pm. The initial inertia of kiosk managers in managing the kiosks in remote rural villages has caused a deterioration in the quality of services provided at the kiosk. Power shortage in rural areas of Maharashtra has also been a key issue. Project Outcomes The applications related to agriculture produce, schemes and crop technology as well as for education are not being used fully. One reason is the slow access to the Internet, insufficient awareness creation among the villagers, and the low levels of literacy in the area in spite of high levels of income. Although a number of different products and services were promised, this enormous infrastructural investment currently serves only as a distributed accounts system for the Warana sugarcane cooperative. The multiple utility card could not be made operational. There have been problems in the implementation of computerization of land records. The GIS has become obsolete, to a large extent, due to lack of updation of the database. Windows-based applications like crop guide, schemes of agriculture department, employment schemes, collectorate procedure, and vocational guidance are non-interactive and have not been updated. The market rates Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 124 of the agriculture produce have been dysfunctional and lie unused due to poor information management. The network has been reduced to computerization of the sugar cooperative, mostly due to non-participation of the local villagers. Not even a fraction of the project cost could be recovered in the three years up to the time of the study. The project remained dominated by NIC officials and technocrats, causing severe problems in community participation and management of services. The pilot project, due to its very high cost, has not been replicated anywhere in India. But, it has provided innumerable insights to the knowledge initiatives in the field of local governance started in India after 1998. Key Lessons Learnt There are three key lessons: 1. Any application should be developed only after an accurate assessment of the needs of the people as the project is intended to create direct impact on their livelihoods. 2. Once the information needs of the community are assessed, content and software applications should be developed with the continuous involvement and feedback from the community. The lack of local participation in content creation, as well as in software development, might not bring the intended results. This partly explains why much of the information, including that on sugarcane growing and agricultural prices, is unutilized and has not been updated regularly. A top-down approach will most probably lead to a waste of resources in the initial period of the project, without ensuring its future sustainability. 3. Specific efforts should be made to improve women and poor people\u2019s access to information. It has been observed that women generally visit information kiosks to obtain sugar factory services while only men are using the Internet services where available. With no means to get women involved and, in particular, to ensure that women are trained to become information kiosks operators, there is a possibility that they will be further marginalized. Similar considerations apply in case of poor people. In Warana, the information kiosks are mostly accessed by members of the cooperative societies and farmers who own their land. The poorest, landless labourers and tribal groups currently do not have a reason to visit the information kiosks because they do not need the services connected with sugarcane growing and harvesting.

Once such information is made available, efforts should then be made to improve access by the Human Interest Story Making life easy Ramakant Kale, a sugarcane farmer, owns one hectare of land in Pargaon village of Kolhapur district. There were long delays in sugarcane deposits and complaints about the content of the sugar in the cane when the weight and content of the cane were monitored by the Sugar Cooperative Society. Ramakant goes to the kiosk now to discover the weight of the sugarcane he deposited. He can also cross-check the amount of money he is supposed to receive from the Society. Warana Wired Village project has thus made his life much easier. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 125 Empowering the Poor poorest to the kiosks. Finding people with the right mix of skills and motivations is a necessary condition for any project to succeed in bringing ICT to rural communities. Sustainability The Warana Wired Village project has been implemented with high capital investment. Extra emphasis on hardware and technology has resulted in high capital costs. The project has been funded by Government of India, the state the Government of Maharashtra and the Cooperative Society. The very high capital investment has resulted in the project becoming a research project. It has become less replicable mainly because of this. The returns from the initial investments are low. The kiosks are manned by government servants whose salaries are paid by the state. The project is not sustainable and depends on more funding from government for its existence. Replication and Scaling Up Warana Wired Village project has been widely replicated, in different forms and in different ways in different parts of India. It has been of the model of all initiatives in India, which have used ICT for poverty alleviation and governance to rural kiosks as access points. Recommendations It is recommended that the sugar cooperative databases be more integrated and made more interactive so that cane growers can obtain all the services related to sugarcane growing and selling to the sugar cooperative. It is also recommended that land record databases be improved as they are not readily available from the kiosks and the available data are often not updated. Government servants and paid volunteers should be discontinued. Volunteers from the villages should be engaged in the management of the kiosk on a profit-sharing basis. It is also recommended that the focus of the project should shift from hi-tech technologies and technical equipment to community and social participation.

The histograms depict the number of responses that occurred within the defined ranges of values shown, indicating any clustering of values and any extreme values. We can see immediately that the values for the indicators \u2013 management of expectations, equality in decision-making, and leadership development \u2013 all components of the Community Participation construct, are skewed to the low end of their respective scales, confirming what is indicated by their mean values. Usefulness, sustainability, community acceptance and satisfaction are skewed to the high end. On the other hand, staff capability depicts an uneven, twin-peaked, distribution of values, which on closer examination, is explained by a bi-polar pattern consisting of rather high scores for 15 of the projects and rather low scores for the other 4.

Interpreting correlations begins with an assessment of the strength of the association followed by an assessment of its statistical significance, or its reliability. Strengths of association are generally interpreted as follows: G -1.0 to -0.7, strong negative association. G -0.7 to -0.3, moderate negative association. G -0.3 to +0.3, little or no association. G +0.3 to +0.7, moderate positive association. G +0.7 to +1.0, strong positive association. The statistical significance of the correlation represents the probability that the observed relationship in the sample occurred by chance and that no such relationship exists in the population from which the sample was drawn.

A two-tailed test of significance is used to detect a difference in means regardless of the direction of difference. Typically, results that generate statistical significance of <05 are regarded as borderline statistically as this level of significance involves a fairly high probability of error of 5 percent. Results that are significant at the p <01 level are commonly regarded as statistically significant, and at <005 or <001 levels as \"highly\" significant. Table 16 summarizes the statistically significant relationships. Interpreting Correlations It is important to note that it is not possible to infer causality from correlations. We cannot deduce from the observed relationships that a change in the value of one indicator causes a change in another. Causality can be argued, however, provided three issues are accounted for: G Logic. The relationship can reasonably be argued to be causal, in the supposed direction. A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 145 Empowering the Poor G Intervening influences. Relationships between two variables may be caused by many variables other than the two being compared. G Temporal difference. The causing influence should be present at a time before the variable it is argued to influence. Scale Reliability Scale reliability refers to how accurate, on average, an estimate of the true score is in the population of objects to be measured. It refers to the property of a measurement instrument that causes it to give similar results for similar inputs. When multiple indicators are used for scales, as in some in our study, then it becomes necessary to evaluate the reliability of those scales. One method assesses the internal consistency between the indicators; the extent to which they co-vary, on the basis that if they are actually measuring the same phenomenon, then they should vary more or less in synchronization. The output of this measure is called Cronbach\u2019s Alpha, which provides a coefficient for the average correlation of items within a scale. A value of 0.7 is normally accepted to indicate a reliable scale. Table 12 displays Cronbach\u2019s Alpha for the study indicators that were derived from the questionnaire. Scale Number of Items Cronbach\u2019s Alpha Usefulness 2 .603 Sustainability 3 .153 Usage 2 -.549 Community acceptance 3 .559 Service delivery 2 .110 Empowerment 3 .855 Three of these values for scale reliability are a lot less than desirable for highly rigorous research, falling short of the acceptable threshold of 0.7. In particular, the negative value for Usage, which is due to a negative average covariance among the two items used, violates reliability model assumptions. However, the negative covariance is weak -.215. Clearly, further development of the measurement instruments used in the survey questionnaire is indicated. Nevertheless, as the current research is ground-breaking in this field of enquiry, such findings are to be expected. The measurements were not pre-tested due to timing and logistical constrains. Accordingly, the examination of the statistical evidence continued, but interpretation of the results and conclusions should proceed with some caution due to these results. Table 12.

These results are generally more satisfactory for experimental research, except for Project Design, which of course includes the problematic Usage scale. Qualitative Measurements Not all the variables of interest in the research model were approached via the questionnaire. The supposition was that the outcomes of projects in terms of their scaling potential would be heavily influenced by factors that would not directly relate to the response of project users and would also be outside the control or influence of project management and sponsors. Nevertheless, it was felt that these factors could and should be assessed. Accordingly, they made up part of the research design in the form of interviews with project managers and other stakeholders and on- site observations. In order to arrive at useable assessments, the factors were assigned a grade on an arbitrary scale of 1-10, as displayed in Table 14.

A Study of Rural Development Projects in India 151 Empowering the Poor Regression Guided by the correlation analysis, where Project Outcomes and Project Design appear moderately correlated, we move to a regression analysis in order to determine whether Project Outcomes are important predictors of Project Design. The technique used linear regression analysis, which is a method for determining the association between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Our research model suggests Project Outcomes as a dependent variable, with Project Design and Community Participation as independent variables. We can test the association between these variables with the regression analysis model.

The ANOVA table first lists source of variance, Regression, Residual and Total. The Total variance is partitioned into the variance which can be explained by the independent variables (Regression) and the variance which is not explained by the independent variables (Residual, sometimes called Error). Note that the Sums of Squares for the Regression and Residual add up to the Total, reflecting the fact that the Total is partitioned into Regression and Residual variance. Next are the Sum of Squares associated with the three sources of variance, Total, Model and Residual, then the degrees of freedom associated with the sources of variance, the Mean Squares, which are the Sum of Squares divided by their respective df. These are computed to compute the F ratio, dividing the Mean Square Regression by the Mean Square Residual to test the significance of the predictors in the model. The significance level (0.000) associated with the F value (202.023) is very small. These values are used to determine if the independent variables reliably predict the dependent variable. The p-value is compared to the alpha level (typically 0.05) and, if smaller, it is possible to conclude that the independent variables reliably predict the dependent variable. Therefore, the group of variables; leadership development, staff capability, management of expectations, service delivery, equality in benefits, technology, community acceptance, influence on project management, and equality in decision-making can be used to reliably predict project outcomes (the dependent variable). Note that this is an overall significance test assessing whether the group of independent variables when used together reliably predict the dependent variable, and does not address the ability of any of the particular independent variables to predict the dependent variable. The ability of each individual independent variable to predict the dependent variable is addressed in the next table where each of the individual variables is listed. In the Coefficients table, the first column shows the predictor variables. The first variable (constant) represents the constant, also referred to as the Y intercept, the height of the regression line when it crosses the Y axis. In other words, this is the predicted value of project outcomes when all other variables are 0. The other values are the values for the regression equation for predicting the dependent variable from the independent variable. These coefficients describe the relationship Information and Communications Technology for Governance and Poverty Reduction 154 between the independent variables and the dependent variable. They explain the amount of increase in project outcome scores that would be predicted by a 1 unit increase in the predictor. The standard errors associated with the coefficients are used for testing whether the parameter is significantly different from 0 by dividing the parameter estimate by the standard error to obtain a t-value. The t-value and p-value (significance) appear in the following columns. They are used in testing the null hypothesis that the coefficient is 0. With a 2 tailed test, comparing each p-value to a pre-selected value of 0.05 of alpha yields statistical significance. Therefore all the coefficients having p-values less than 0.05 are statistically significant. The coefficients for equality in decision making (-.007) and management of expectations (-.021) are not statistically significantly different from 0 because their p-values are definitely larger than 0.05. The regression equation then is stated as: The predicted level of project outcome = .981+ (.072* Staff capability) + (.301* Community acceptance) + (.100* Service delivery) +. (075* Technology) + (-.007* Equality in decision-making) + (.058* Equality in benefits) + (.054* Influence on project management) + (-.021* Management of expectations) + (.081* Leadership development). Overall, the model explains 45.9 percent of the variance in project outcomes and it can be seen that independent variables with the largest influence on the dependent variable are those with the higher coefficients; community acceptance and service delivery.

Moore. Moore\u2019s research on technology diffusion suggests that the technology visionaries who conduct experiments to test new ideas do not make good references for the pragmatists who will be required to adopt those ideas into mainstream operation. Visionaries are people who see breakthrough potential in some technology and are willing to brave hell and high water to realize that potential. They provide tales of heroics, not the stories of smooth, predictable adoption that are required by the pragmatists who will scale up the technology into general usage and who just want a product that works. 40 Reengineering the Corporation: A Manifesto for Business Revolution, by Michael Hammer and James Champy. Although not without its critics, BPR has become a byword for the substantial changes that are often required for organizations to undergo in order to make effective use of ICTs and to focus the use of technology more closely onto the quality of customer service. In the development context, Public Administration Reform bears some resemblance to BPR, and it is being used in places as the platform for re-shaping public services that can be delivered more effectively using ICTs. 41 Animesh Rathore, Centre for E-Governance, Indian Institute of Management, An account of the Workshop on Scaling up ICT for Poverty Alleviation in India, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, 26-27 February 2004.

As India\u2019s poverty is deepening and its ICT industry booming, there are many projects underway that are using ICT to reduce poverty and promote good governance. This book systematically analyzes 18 projects in India that use ICT for the benefit of poor people, and provides recommendations on how ICT can be applied to the massive, widespread and seemingly intractable problems of poverty. The book also ranks the projects by their relevance, service delivery, community participation and empowerment, equality in decision-making and benefits, sustainability, replicability and their prospects for being scaled-up.

Simultaneously, there is growing pressure on the media with increasingly tighter regulations being implemented to enforce professional media standards in the Pacific Islands. This study used an analytical framework and evaluative criteria for identifying the specific conditions and factors for establishing media self-regulatory arrangements that meet key stakeholder concerns and needs at both regional and national levels in the Pacific Islands. The study draws on pre-existing schemes to identify a best practice criteria benchmark to determine when media industry solutions are likely to be effective. This benchmark is designed to guide not restrict the analysis, with the results supplemented by additional factors, including consultation with media stakeholders and case studies of media regulatory systems in developing and developed countries. A survey method was used to gather data from media industry professionals. The survey consisted of three parts \u2013 general information (gender, age, occupation, media type, country of residence), a Likert scale to measure perceptions of the criteria and a series of open-ended questions for respondents to provide in depth responses on benefits of and challenges in establishing a media self-regulatory scheme in the Pacific Islands. Survey participants were guaranteed anonymity and confidentiality of their responses. Initial findings from the study were presented to media professionals at the Pacific Islands News Association\u2019s (PINA) 3rd Pacific Media Summit 2014 in Noumea, New Caledonia in February to clarify and extend researchers\u2019 understanding of the preliminary analysis. A total of nine key findings were derived from the analysis of the data. These are summarised below and expanded upon in 6.0 Summary of Findings section: Number of responses exceeded expectations given the short implementation time period. Such a 1. response indicates that media professionals support the establishment of a self-regulatory scheme as an important step for the industry to take more responsibility for their professional conduct. Majority of survey responses to the 12 criteria range from Very Important to Important, thus supporting 2. the best practice criteria as a benchmark for the implementation of a media self-regulatory scheme. Survey responses consistently indicate that Training in law and ethics should be prioritised by a media 3. self-regulatory scheme. Recognising this criterion as important suggests that the media industry wants to address the criticism leveled at it by its own members and governments in relation to the quality of journalism in the Pacific Islands. Survey responses indicated a second consistent trend in relation to prioritising Public Awareness. This 4. result supports the need for a strong presence of the scheme at the national level so key stakeholders \u2013 media industry, citizens and governments \u2013 understand not only the specific objectives and functions of the self-regulatory mechanism but also the media\u2019s general roles and responsibilities to increase the freedom and vibrancy of media and thus contribute to sustainable development within the region. Survey responses indicate, when identified within national contexts, a distinct diversity of opinions 5. on what criteria should be prioritised. This result supports the central role of strong National Media Associations in developing a self-regulatory framework that addresses specific localised needs of media professionals. While an independent regional self-regulatory system is an important goal for the development of 6. media in the Pacific Islands it still has to function within a regulatory space in which governments control regulatory structure, thus focusing a potential system on the relationship between self- and co-regulatory systems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3a9d6fd-1d5f-4a4f-9033-3405b6ce24c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3a9d6fd-1d5f-4a4f-9033-3405b6ce24c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Feasible Study: Optimal Conditions for Effective Regional Media Self-Regulation in the Pacific Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dfc0b44fabc25702e82f086b6ff81e10d1f5fc35b361c290dfbb2559bf4d34e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "7a54f4f6-6bde-4327-a6c9-784b5be96a71", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49fe0258acc69734fd1d3246f73d3e7e4c910626b4f5b687c4aad51dc20014c5"}}, "hash": "cf9edb5e4cad290d09d16a7125d8b3280ce163593ad512a439c968144a16b124", "text": "Survey results indicate that respondents did not consider the three critical factors, as defined by 7.

Consultation process on a self-regulatory system needs to be broadened to include the opportunity for 9. people from all 14 countries to submit formal input into the ongoing process of moving the concept forward. The study provides several general and specific recommendations to establish a regional media self- regulation system. Given the significant number of responses from media professionals to the survey, there is clear and strong support for establishing such a system to improve professional journalism standards in the Pacific Islands. Based on the SWOT analysis of feasible media self-regulatory frameworks, the study overall recommends the adoption of Option C: Regional-National Media Self-/Co-regulatory system, but this process must begin at the national level with a strategy put in place and monitored by an appointed advisory body of eminent professionals and citizens. Furthermore, the overwhelming positive response to the benchmark criteria used this study indicates that such an approach provides an evaluative framework for development partners to undertake a capacity building assessment of media associations at the national level. The report makes a range of specific recommendations to enhance the feasibility of establishing a media self-regulatory system in the Pacific Islands. To achieve this goal of actioning the research results and moving the scheme forward, the following five recommendations are made: 1. Engage the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Pacific Office to undertake a capacity building assessment of the current established National Media Associations in Vanuatu, Tonga, Samoa, the Cook Islands and Fiji from May to June, 2014; 2. Adopt the 12 best practice criteria as an evaluative framework for UNDP to assess the capacity of the listed national media self-regulatory systems to identify the needs of national media self-regulatory systems; 3. Secure immediate and sufficient funding from the United Nations to support the initial capacity building assessment phase of National Media Associations with the view to accessing key consultancies and advisory representatives to move the establishment of a regional-national media self-/co-regulatory framework forward; 4. Engage in broader community consultation from May to June 2014, inclusive of media, governments and citizens and consumers across the 14 nominated Pacific Island countries, with a view to providing an appointed advisory committee with appropriate level of knowledge to enhance the sustainability of the system, specifically during the critical start-up phase of capacity assessment and implementation; and 5. Establish a representative advisory body of seven to nine advisors to oversee the assessment of National Media Associations and drive development of a regional-national self-/co-regulatory system over a six-month period from June to December 2014 with membership of the body drawing from respected journalists and editors, eminent citizens (including legal, academic and public figures) and journalists and media practitioners (see Annex J for key considerations for planning, design and implementation of the scheme and a general overview of a possible structure \u2013 see Figure 17). optimal conditions for effective regional media self-regulation in the pacific islands 3 aCknOwlEdgmEnts We would like to thank the Pacific Islands and international media community for supporting the \u201cMedia Self-regulation in the Pacific Islands\u201d survey. The number of responses (209 completed surveys) indicates strong support for a media self-regulatory system in the region. Furthermore, a significant majority of respondents, in the open-ended question section of the survey, emphasised the urgent need for such a regulatory system to improve the professional standards of journalism so the media can contribute more effectively to development in the region.

In spite of such supporting bodies, media in the Pacific has come under immense pressure from governments to attain a higher level of professional journalistic standards, responsibilities and practice. In Tonga, the country\u2019s Parliament initiated training for journalists in parliamentary ethics as a way to improve journalistic practices and conduct in that country (Oritaimae, 2013). In Fiji, the military government-backed Media Information Development Authority\u2019s (MIDA) called for the country\u2019s media to improve standards of reporting, with proposed training workshops scheduled on the controversial Media Decree, Parliamentary practices and ethics and new Constitution (Drageset, 2013). However, the potential for improving journalistic standards and media freedom was curtailed considerably by MIDA\u2019s decision to force foreign entities, including non- government organisations, to gain permission from the organisation to run independent journalism training workshops. This has been seen by many independent observers as a \u201cfurther clamp down on media freedom in Fiji less than 12 months out from the country\u2019s first elections\u201d in eight years (Sovaraki, 2013). As these examples illustrate, media in Pacific Island countries face an increasing degree of control over media freedoms, impacting on democratic reform and sustainability in the region. Furthermore, these examples reinforce the absence of media industry self-regulatory mechanisms that act to establish and enforce a common set of media standards in regards to journalism ethics and professional practices. Consequently, the media faces the real possibility of even tighter regulation that would retard the drive for democratic structures and media freedom in the Pacific Islands if the industry fails to take the initiative to set up functioning self- regulatory mechanisms and adhere to journalism practices that meet international standards. purpose of the study Against this backdrop of tighter regulatory mechanisms to reinforce professional journalism standards and practices and the current absence of self-regulatory mechanisms to enforce media standards, there exists an urgent need to assess the feasibility of establishing a media self-regulation system for the Pacific Islands. As such, the purpose of this study is to build an analytical framework and evaluative criteria for identifying the specific conditions and factors for establishing self-regulatory arrangements that meet key stakeholder concerns and needs at both regional and national levels. optimal conditions for effective regional media self-regulation in the pacific islands 7 The study recognises that broader industry, citizen and consumer interests raise distinct issues for the development and operation of an effective media self-regulatory framework, including: Industry \u2013 interests of media industry stakeholders relate to identifying and, where possible, minimising \u2666 regulatory burdens by supporting self-regulatory structures that enhance professional standards and practices by media organisations; Citizen \u2013 interests of the public as citizens relate to regulatory processes and decisions that improve \u2666 citizen engagement, incorporate citizen perspectives, are transparent and accountable, and find ways that further citizen participation in establishing and nurturing vibrant and emerging democratic structures through self-regulatory mechanisms. Consumer \u2013 the interests of the public, as consumers of media, relates to having adequate protection \u2666 and safeguards, and being able to make informed choices about their media consumption and the use of communication, information technologies and media services and products (Australian Communications and Media Authority, 2011). aims and objectives The overall aim of the feasibility study is to enable an informed discussion among media stakeholders about possible self-regulation mechanisms at the regional and national levels with a view to exploring viable options to establish such a scheme in the Pacific Islands\u2019 region. The feasibility study is defined by the following objectives: Present the various models of media self-regulation mechanisms and schemes; \u2666 Define a benchmark of best practice criteria for establishing an effective media self-regulatory system; \u2666 Engage in consultations with media professionals and development partners to assess the most important \u2666 best practice procedures that guide the establishment of a self-regulatory system; Determine the extent to which relevant perceptions of a media self-regulatory system aligns with \u2666 established best practice criteria that define the effectiveness of such a system at the regional and national levels; Discuss advantages and disadvantages of media self-regulatory schemes using lessons learnt from \u2666 existing mechanisms through international case studies from developing and developed countries; Develop at least two options for establishing an effective self-regulatory scheme in the Pacific Islands; \u2666", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ff94e07-c737-4f5a-9b1b-03556eefc818": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ff94e07-c737-4f5a-9b1b-03556eefc818", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Feasible Study: Optimal Conditions for Effective Regional Media Self-Regulation in the Pacific Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5810753fa9b6f37e0246d5067cf872e1f8827b6caf464b2518d21b62a1e4497"}, "3": {"node_id": "61c5426e-cd8d-4b1a-87b5-e626f589f041", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28284e09303a0ae77d45a35e1dab4119066b0e3097592ec60e5d795197e0e901"}}, "hash": "494d4c4e1b0021ed6446b65b71d5164f650c941f807b5eacf9e9bfd26ccd46d1", "text": "and Provide general and specific recommendations on what self-regulatory model would be the most viable \u2666 for the Pacific Islands.

It will identify the issues to take into account in the early, formative stages of considering, where discretion exists, whether to adopt a pure self-regulatory system and/or other media regulatory or non-regulatory arrangements. It will also assess whether education and/or training is a central requirement for a self-regulatory media system, in accord with the most vocal criticism of media in the region. The study will be informed by current industry and academic literature on media regulatory approaches worldwide that constitute a comprehensive regulatory toolkit for addressing the situation of professional media standards and practices in the Pacific Islands. 2. mEdia rEgulatiOn and thE paCifiC islands\u2019 COntExt Media regulation has moved beyond traditional ways of thinking in relation to regulatory frameworks to focus on the regulatory tools that can be deployed within a regulatory space. As Hitchens (2011) suggests, media policy and regulation that enables and governs media operations and functions must be considered across the entire environment, otherwise there is the risk of a regulatory imbalance and pressure points that would undermine key objectives. This regulatory space recognises that regulatory power and authority cannot be held within a single formal body (i.e. government), but dispersed between any number of entities \u2013 both private and public - with a shared and mutually beneficial raft of responsibilities. Such a system can accommodate a variety of regulatory tools from market through to self-regulation to centralised command regulation, enabling different jurisdictional responses to similar policy objectives. However, there exist a range of challenges to regulatory frameworks, including regulatory \u201cbite\u201d; scope of the regulation in relation to the range of media operators and funding; establishing an identity and thus credibility of the scheme among the diversity of stakeholders; and developing a simple, acceptable code of ethical and professional standards (Hitchens, 2011).

Examples include Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, which have all undertaken ongoing reviews of media regulatory systems over the past five years. Traditionally, self-regulation has been described as a viable option whereby industry voluntarily develops, administers and enforces its own solution to address particular issues facing the media with no formal oversight by the regulator (i.e. government-appointed authority). Self-regulatory approaches are characterised by the lack of legal backstop to act as the guarantor of enforcement of the codes of professional practice and ethical conduct (Australian Communications and Media Authority, 2011). In practice, self-regulation without any form of government or statutory involvement is rare. Most often self- regulation has become embedded in the regulatory framework, reflected by a range of \u2018joint arrangements\u2019 between the regulator and the regulated. Such regulatory approaches are enclosed within the accepted term of co-regulation, which can be understood as a combination of non-government (industry) regulation and government regulation. Co-regulation can mean that the media industry or a professional body representing the media develops the regulatory arrangements, such as a code of professional practice or standards, in coordination with government. This could pose important challenges for establishing a regional media regulatory arrangement that reflect a diversity of linguistic, geographic, political, regulatory, cultural, social, and media delivery issues and challenges. If established, such an arrangement would need to be administered by the industry with governments providing legislative backing to enable the arrangements to be enforced. Co-regulatory mechanisms can include legislation that: Delegates power to industry to regulate and enforce codes of professional conduct and practice; \u2666 Enforces undertakings to maintain compliance to such codes; \u2666 Prescribes a code as a regulation, but the code only applies to those who subscribe to it, thus relying on \u2666 voluntary compliance; Does not require a code of professional practice or standards, but has reserve power to make the code \u2666 mandatory; Requires industry to have a code and, in its absence, government will impose a code or standard, thus \u2666 reflective of the situations currently experienced by the media in the Pacific Islands; Prescribes a code as a regulation to apply to all industry members, in effect prescribed mandatory codes \u2666 (Australian Communications and Media Authority, 2011). According to the OECD (2009), when used in the right circumstances, self-regulation and co-regulation can offer a number of advantages over traditional command and control regulation, including: Greater flexibility and adaptability; \u2666 Potentially lower compliance and administrative costs; \u2666 An ability to harness industry knowledge and expertise to address industry-specific and consumer issues \u2666 directly; and Quick and low-cost complaints-handling and dispute resolution mechanisms. \u2666 Critical for the feasibility study is also identifying drawbacks of self- and co-regulation, which include: Possibility of raising barriers to entry within segments of the media industry; \u2666 Unintended monopoly power gained by participants that could restrict competition; \u2666 Danger of regulatory capture; \u2666 Potential to increase government compliance and enforcement costs. \u2666 Research by the Office of Communication (OfCom), the United Kingdom regulatory body that governs the communication industry, including the media, initiated an extensive process of consultation with relevant communication industry stakeholders as part of its ongoing review of regulatory structures. From the consultations, OfCom defined an evaluative framework for establishing optimal conditions for self- and co- regulatory schemes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff0417a4-31a3-4236-913b-86c81b4f3d26": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff0417a4-31a3-4236-913b-86c81b4f3d26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Feasible Study: Optimal Conditions for Effective Regional Media Self-Regulation in the Pacific Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa295b2e3aabbc13e24b8e88ad3582df2304f755cce30e4540fd3ec743575368"}, "2": {"node_id": "13460c8b-aacf-4bb0-b2a9-1a9a167e706f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed1fd6d5909ad2487334301ec25b7bc10c164621c633f528f00769c37ab14ed2"}}, "hash": "33e83e4cbd4f9f515de5b44acc628d39eb95612b09fae4712bb6302054f83d37", "text": "From a broad perspective, research indicated that self-regulation is most likely to work where the following conditions were present: optimal conditions for effective regional media self-regulation in the pacific islands 11 Industry collectively has an interest in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5dc41ece-39c0-453d-98d7-da5c2631aea7": {"__data__": {"id_": "5dc41ece-39c0-453d-98d7-da5c2631aea7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Feasible Study: Optimal Conditions for Effective Regional Media Self-Regulation in the Pacific Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab0c34f4890ffa149a963568c17319892c414e15f500d6e797b23d82ab21e4b1"}, "3": {"node_id": "6494f652-dca7-4846-8142-0be80a52a22d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e896d01b9fea67f08b1f3833ad2249c1eab24cfa867832e7b71b52327568ca46"}}, "hash": "c50b1181c6de1b21bd42211457cdbe51bf82423b940ebc4e4586fea4fbf8d6bb", "text": "solving the issue of regulation; \u2666 Industry is able to establish clear objectives for a potential scheme; \u2666 Industry solution matches the legitimate needs of citizens and consumers. \u2666 It also found that a regulatory scheme is unlikely to work if the following conditions were found: Incentives for individual companies not to participate existed; and \u2666 Incentives for participating organisations not to comply with agreed industry and professional codes. \u2666 (Office of Communications, 2008) To achieve optimal conditions, OfCom\u2019s consultations identified 11 best practice criteria for establishing self- and co-regulatory schemes within the communication industry, inclusive of the media. These criteria are: public awareness, transparency, significant industry participation, adequate resources (financial and human); clarity of processes and structures, ability to enforce codes, audits of performance, system of redress in place, involvement of independent members in decision making, regular review of objectives, and non-collusive behaviour (see Annex I). Of the 11 best practice criteria, OfCom\u2019s analysis indicates that adequate and proportionate resource commitments (e.g. suitable funding and human resource allocation), involvement of independent members in decision making (e.g. respect from non-media stakeholders) and transparency (e.g. openness and public accountability in relation to performance) are critical to ensure effectiveness of all regulatory schemes (Office of Communications, 2008). The 11 criteria will be used as a benchmark for the feasibility study. In addition, one other criteria has been added to the list, that of training, given the current criticism of the Pacific Islands\u2019 media in relation to the lack of professional journalism standards and adherence to a code of ethics. The study adopts a pragmatic and flexible approach to applying the principles, and takes additional factors into account as appropriate to the specific case of the Pacific Islands. This means in each instance we look to engage the stakeholders in discussions on how best to achieve the desired outcome of a regional media self-regulatory scheme for the Pacific Islands. To assess the success of a regional media self-regulatory system in the Pacific Islands, it is necessary to understand the context of the Pacific Islands media landscape. Two key studies provide insight into the complexity of this \u201cmediascape\u201d. A 2006 study, titled \u201cInforming Citizens: Opportunities for Media and Communications in the Pacific\u201d, focused on a range of issues related to media, governance and journalism standards. One of the key issues that emerged from the study was the need for independent regulatory bodies \u2014 at arm\u2019s length from government \u2014 to ensure that broadcast licensing and media regulation processes were as fair and apolitical as possible. In six countries, broadcasting is the direct responsibility of the prime minister \u2014 the Cook Islands, Niue, PNG, Tuvalu, Tonga and Vanuatu. In other countries, such as the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, the Prime Minister is responsible for public broadcasting, while commercial broadcasting is the responsibility of the minister who oversees telecommunications. A second finding links directly to this feasibility study in relation to journalistic standards and professional practices. It found a range of fundamental issues: overwhelming reliance on government-sourced information; news stories that use single sources, which failed the test of fair and balanced reporting; basic errors of detail; ignorance of the law; failure to confirm facts; corroborate allegations; failure to observe the rules of journalistic confidence; and poor editing of articles or broadcasts (Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, 2006). More recently, Pacific Media Assistance Scheme (PACMAS) released its \u201cRegional State of the Media and Communication Report 2013\u201d, which focused on media policy and legislation, media systems, media capacity building and content. The study provides an overview of current media operations throughout the region and media legislation within the 14 countries covered by the research (see Annex B).

We recognise that not all the criteria may be relevant or required for the Pacific context. As such, each criterion, once measured, will be weighted in relation to the objectives of the scheme and the importance placed on it by media professionals within their context. survey instrument structure and phases of implementation The survey consists of three parts (19 questions) \u2013 General and Demographic Information (gender, age, occupation, media type, country of residence), Best Practice Criteria using a Likert scale to measure individual perceptions of the 12 best practice criteria, and Open-ended Questions to allow respondents to provide in depth responses on the benefits of and challenges in establishing a media self-regulatory system in the Pacific Islands. Survey participants were guaranteed anonymity and confidentiality of their responses. A three-phase strategy was used to distribute the survey to increase the response rate. \u2666 Phase 1: An initial mail out was conducted via email to a data base of 250 contacts derived from several professional media contact lists. The email provided a short explanation of the feasibility study and a URL link to the survey, which was housed at a Survey Monkey online site. \u2666 Phase 2: Follow up telephone calls were made to each media contact 48 hours after the link was emailed to check if the email had been received and whether the survey had been completed. \u2666 Phase 3: Potential respondents were also identified via the LinkedIn database of business contacts, resulting in a further 201 media professionals being sent the link to the survey \u2013 these contacts were cross-referenced with the original contact list to avoid double-up contact. From the combined contact list and LinkedIn data base, a total of 451 surveys were randomly distributed to individual media professionals and media academics. Survey data was collected in two stages, from December 1 to January 15 (204 surveys) and then from January 16 to March 1 (a further 17 surveys collected). The data collected from December 1 to January 15 was collated and analysed to produce a preliminary report, in which the findings were presented to media professionals at a one-day Pacific Islands News Association 2014 3rd Pacific Media Summit workshop in Noumea, New Caledonia in February, 2014. The workshop was designed to provide the researchers with opportunity to gain more information and clarification by media professionals on the findings, with that input being included in the final analysis and report. Results of the surveys collected in the second data collection period were then added to those collected in the first data collection period. survey analysis processes and procedures Analysis of the data was undertaken in a two-step process. First, a number of analyses were conducted to determine Regional, National, and Media Type perceptions of the most important criteria. These analyses determined the extent to which relevant perceptions of a media self-regulatory scheme aligns with established benchmarks that define effectiveness of such systems, inclusive of the three most critical \u2013 adequate and proportionate resource commitments (e.g. suitable funding and human resource allocation, involvement of independent members in decision making (e.g. gaining respect from non-media stakeholders) and transparency (e.g. openness and public accountability in relation to performance). Furthermore, the findings will also indicate what priorities should be given to specific criteria within a national context to enhance the future ownership and thus support of the recommended system at a localised, national level. optimal conditions for effective regional media self-regulation in the pacific islands 13 The response items were converted to a 5-point Likert scale (1-Very Important, 2-Important, 3-Moderately Important, 4-Of little importance, 5-Unimportant). Thus, lower scores demonstrate greater perceived importance. The exact statistical analysis involved a number of single-factor Analysis of Variances (i.e. ANOVAs). An ANOVA analysis assesses whether perceptions of importance among the 12 criteria statements are statistically different. Three main analyses were conducted in this phase of examining the data. The nature of these analyses is listed below. 1. Pacific Region Analysis. This analysis involves all responses to the survey. The ANOVA will directly compare the perceived importance of all of the criteria statements. Specifically, this analysis will reveal the relative perceived importance of criteria statements. 2. National Analysis. This analysis will involve an individual examination of the responses from each of the relevant countries in the Pacific Region. The ANOVA will directly compare the perceived importance of all of the criteria statements for each of the countries.

Media Type Analysis. This analysis will involve an examination of the perceived importance of each individual media type at the regional and national level. The perceived importance of all criteria statements will be directly compared for each media type. There will be a single ANOVA performed for each media type. This analysis will reveal whether there are differences across the various media type in their perceived importance of the criteria statements. Second, the data set derived from the open-ended questions was coded to identify categories/themes and then compared to findings from the criteria analysis. The information derived from this analysis provides a deeper understanding of respondents\u2019 feelings and motives behind their answers to the criteria section of the survey, and thus assist in defining the feasibility of establishing a regional media self-regulatory system. It must be also noted that several weaknesses exist in the adopted approach and these need to be acknowledged. Research participants, while large in number, present their particular perspectives, experience and knowledge that relates to the establishment of a regional media self-regulatory scheme and the benefits and challenges emerging out of such an initiative. Nevertheless, not all of the people we would have liked to have included were available, and the views gathered will always, as in every case, present only a partial though relevant view on the defined issues. 4. rEsults A total of 231 surveys were received during the data collection periods with 209 surveys completed in full, constituting a response rate of 46.34%. Of these, 157 responses were gathered directly from Pacific Islands\u2019 media professionals based in 11 of the 14 nominated countries. general and demographic information As far as the gender of the participants, the sample included 85 females and 124 males. The age varied considerably with the majority of the participants from the 25-34 year bracket. The actual responses were 18-24 (28), 25-34 (80), 35-44 (53), 45-54 (32), 55+ (16). All four major Types of Media were represented with the greatest number of participants coming from the print media (85). The other participants were distributed among radio (31), television (46), and online forms of media (47). optimal conditions for effective regional media self-regulation in the pacific islands 14 Figure 2: Distribution of Survey Participants by Age The survey was completed by media industry employees and media academics from 22 countries, including 11 Pacific Islands (FSM, Fiji, Kiribati, Palau, Solomon Islands, PNG, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Republic of the Marshall Islands), as well as responses from Bangladesh, the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, Qatar, and the Maldives (see Figure 3, below for results from Pacific Islands countries\u2019 residents). A significant portion of the participants were from Fiji (80) and a lesser proportion from Non- Pacific Island countries (52). The significant number of responses, we believe, shows the importance placed by media professionals, both regionally and internationally, on the role of the media industry in sustainable development within the Pacific Islands\u2019 region. assessment of perceived importance of initiatives Participants gave ratings of their perceptions of the importance of each of the 12 criteria listed in Appendix I.

Specifically, across all of the countries, the following three initiatives were perceived as most important: 1) A self-regulatory scheme must engage in public awareness to ensure citizens and media consumers know their rights in relation to the media (i.e. Public Awareness); 2) A self-regulatory scheme must provide journalists with access to training in legal and ethical issues to improve professional journalism standards (i.e. Training); and 3) A self-regulatory scheme must establish clear processes and structures \u2013 agreement of terms of reference, institutional structures, funding arrangements, and time limits (i.e. Processes/Structures). assessment of nation-based responses Given that the bulk of the respondents were from Fiji, examination of their responses seems particularly important. Consistent with the general population of participants, the Fijians perceived Public Awareness, Training, and Processes/Structures criteria to be the most important. Interestingly, the analysis demonstrated that Public Awareness and Training initiatives were perceived in the most important three initiatives for five other Pacific Islands countries (i.e. Kiribati, Palau, Samoa, Vanuatu and FSM). There was some degree of variation in the three most important initiatives among the other countries: a) Papua New Guinea (Training, Resources, Processes/Structures); b) Solomon Islands (Training, Resources, Compliance); and c) Tonga (Training, Governance, Processes/Structures). See Annex I for a full listing of the perceived importance responses for each Pacific Islands\u2019 country. optimal conditions for effective regional media self-regulation in the pacific islands 16 assessment of media-type responses as a function region There was a fairly consistent pattern of perceptions across the various media groups. The analysis revealed that each group included the Training and Public Awareness criteria in their perceptions of the three most important initiatives. However, there was a significant degree of variation on the choice of the third important criteria. The third choices were: a) Governance for those in print and radio; b) Complaints/Redress for those in television; and c) Compliance for those in online media. assessment of media-type responses as a function of nation For print media, Fiji, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu perceived Training, Public Awareness, and Processes/Structures as the most important initiatives.

Central to achieving this goal is for a media self-regulatory system to conduct education and training programs that consistently deliver professional development programs and show improvement nationally and regionally. This focus on fundamentals of journalism would then contribute to an improved public image of the media in the region in relation to accountability, responsibility and respect. Further to achieving this goal, media professionals indicated that a self-regulatory system must also undertake strategic communication that creates public awareness of the mechanism including the media\u2019s critical roles and responsibilities, that balances the growing reach and impact of government control over the media in the region through policies and regulations applied by quasi-government bodies (i.e. Fiji\u2019s Media Information Development Authority). \u201c\u2026 public awareness will solve the misunderstanding people have about the media.

First, the data reveals considerable fragmentation at the regional level, given the diversity of countries and associated cultures, which contributes to a disjointed vision of how self-regulation works and benefits the media and society, resulting in a lack of ownership by the media professionals. Second, the data reveals considerable factionalism at the national level, with concerns over the lack of cooperation between different media groups and the impact of individuals who have their own personal vision of how the media should regulate itself. These concerns reinforce already known conflict situations that have hampered media development in countries. \u201c\u2026the challenge for this project is coordinating a media industry on a regional level that has a well- documented history of in-fighting, fragmentation and bad governance\u201d \u2013 Former Television Journalist Factionalism is an issue that proven to be debilitating aspects in various attempts to implement self- regulatory systems around the world. In the case of OfCom research and in the Rwanda and Indonesian case studies, specific emphasis was placed on dealing with factionalism early in the process of establishing a self-regulatory system because it created disunity and thus posed the greatest challenge to the effectiveness and sustainability of self-regulation. Unity and fraternity are considered critical ingredients in the defence of media freedom and promotion of ethical practices in journalism, which requires a united journalistic voice in promoting and defending ethical conduct and against media repression (Office of Communications, 2008).

A total of 12 media professionals attended the workshop and engaged in fruitful consultation and discussion within small groups on the following aspect: 1. Key findings presented in the preliminary feasibility report; 2. Possible options for a self-regulatory framework (i.e. national media self-regulation, regional-national media self-regulation and regional-national self-/co-regulatory system); 3. How to move the concept of self-regulatory system forward in the Pacific Islands, including development of regional Media Code of Conduct or Ethics, a 2-year media-led process, driven by expert group, supported by development partners, such as the United Nation Development Program (UNDP). Four key aspects emerged from the consultation process. First, consultation groups indicated that to move the concept of a self-regulatory system forward there needed to be a focus on the national interests first as a way of building from the \u201cground up\u201d through \u201cstrengthening/use of existing structures\u201d. This would then lead to securing broader support for a regional self-regulatory system that has specific and complementary objectives. \u201cFirstly, we need to get our national house in order (e.g. Samoa and Fiji). Each country has its own issues. Instead of jumping straight into a regional body we need to take some steps nationally first (e.g. such as Vanuatu)\u201d \u2013 Media Professionals Group A Second, workshop participants also focused on the critical issue of factionalism within national media contexts. Much of the discussion focused around the impact of individual personalities with participants providing specific stories in which media consultative groups had forged a strategy to improve national media standards, but were then \u201chijacked by individuals\u201d who then pushed for their own personal vision, which did not reflect the tenant or direction of the group or the interests of the broader media and those professional within the industry. \u201cMuch of the division/factionalism (in national media) has to do with personalities and egos \u2013 the solution is to GET RID OF THEM!\u201d \u2013 Media Professionals Group B Third, the groups agreed that one of the key priorities of a self-regulatory scheme is to engage with the community and its various publics, including the broader media community, citizens, consumers and governments. \u201cEducating and creating awareness-raising of what self-regulation entails for the media and publics \u2026 assisting this would be the development of a Code of Practice (more general than Code of Ethics) Statement of Principles to govern a regional [self-regulation] mechanism\u201d \u2013 Media Professionals Group B Fourth, both groups indicated that the consultation process needed to continue and be broadened to create a more inclusive environment for not only media professional but the general public within the nominated countries. \u201cThere is a need to continue the consultation process as currently it is not representative of the whole region \u2026 this process needs to also be wider consultation\u201d \u2013 Media Professional Group A 6. summary Of findings Analysis of the results of the study revealed nine key findings that have implications for the implementation of a media self-regulatory scheme.

Survey responses indicated a second consistent trend in relation to prioritising Public Awareness. This result supports the need for a strong presence of the scheme at the national level so key stakeholders \u2013 media industry, citizens and governments \u2013 understand not only the specific objectives and functions of the self-regulatory mechanism but also the media\u2019s general roles and responsibilities to increase the freedom and vibrancy of media and thus contribute to sustainable development within the region. 5. Survey responses indicate, when identified within national contexts, a distinct diversity of opinions on what criteria should be prioritised. This result supports the central role of strong National Media Associations in developing a self-regulatory framework that addresses specific localised needs of media professionals. 6. While an independent regional self-regulatory system is an important goal for the development of media in the Pacific Islands it still has to function within a regulatory space in which governments control regulatory structure, thus focusing a potential system on the relationship between self- and co-regulatory systems. 7. Survey results indicate that respondents did not consider the three critical factors, as defined by OfCom, of adequate and proportionate resource commitments, involvement of independent members in decision making and transparency, as critical criteria within their specific context. 8. Responses to the open-ended questions revealed several challenges to the viability and sustainability of the scheme, specifically government interference (i.e. policies and regulations), cultural differences (i.e. fragmentation) and national media differences and individual personalities (i.e. factionalism) as key challenges. 9. Consultation process on a self-regulatory system needs to be broadened to include the opportunity for people from all 14 countries to submit formal input into the ongoing process of moving the concept forward. 7. mEdia sElf-rEgulatOry mOdEls fOr thE paCifiC islands Much discussion and conjecture exists in relation to the type of media self-regulatory system \u2013 national or regional \u2013 that would best work in the Pacific Islands. For example, national media self-regulatory bodies, such as those formed in Vanuatu, Tonga, Samoa, the Cook Islands, and the recently launched Fiji body illustrate the kind of professional support such groups to media professionals. At a regional level, organisations such as PINA, PasiMA and PACMAS undertake specific roles in relation to functions and representations of media professionals and organisations in the Pacific region (see Introduction for a short profile of their functions and responsibilities). In acknowledging these ongoing discussions and considering the study\u2019s findings, we present SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analyses of three possible media self-regulatory approaches: 1. Option A: National Media Self-regulatory Scheme 2. Option B: Regional-National Media Self-regulatory Scheme; and 3. Option C: Regional-National Media Self-/Co-regulatory Scheme. The analyses are designed to draw out key aspects to initiate further discussion on what scheme would be feasible and viable in the Pacific Islands\u2019 region. As such, we use the 12 best practice criteria as a guide to conduct the SWOT analyses, but also draw into each analysis the role of government and culture because of the importance placed on these by respondents in the open-ended question section of the survey. It optimal conditions for effective regional media self-regulation in the pacific islands 21 must be noted that the following analyses are not exhaustive because each criteria can be interpreted in a variety of ways. However, they do provide a means by which to identify potential issues inherent in each of the schemes and to generate further discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of such media self- regulatory systems in the context of the Pacific Islands. The first step of that consultative process was to integrate the information gathered from the workshop staged at PINA\u2019s 3rd Pacific Media Summit into the SWOT analyses undertaken by the researchers. option a: national media self-regulatory scheme A National Self-regulatory Scheme would see the establishment of media self-regulatory representation in each of the countries, but without a regional governing body to support operations.

This aspect is supported by the diversity of survey responses across countries and media. However, several aspects limit the potential of a national scheme, including limited Resources, which forms one of the three critical criteria, particularly important to smaller Pacific Islands\u2019 countries. The two other critical criteria (Transparency and Respect) are also potential weaknesses of a nationally focused media self-regulatory scheme because success depends on the amount of resources available to the scheme. Several identified threats also raise concern over the viability and sustainability of a national media self-regulatory scheme, with direct government influence becoming a key factor in relation to the function, independence, management and processes/ structures of the mechanism. Potential influences include possible censorship and self-censorship, which could impact on the acceptance of the scheme by potential members and funders because of a lack of independence. Finally, a national media self-regulatory scheme would not have the kind of contact and support a coordinated regional governing body would provide to members when issues of direct or indirect government and/or cultural influences potentially arise. optimal conditions for effective regional media self-regulation in the pacific islands 23 option b: regional-national media self-regulatory scheme Regional-national Self-regulatory Scheme offers a range of advantages over a national self-regulatory scheme that service only their country\u2019s media. A regional-national self-regulatory scheme would retain control over the three critical criteria identified by OfCom, specifically those of resources, respect through independent members, and transparency in relation to its performance as a way to ensure effectiveness of the scheme. Furthermore, the location of the scheme would need to be in a non-participating Pacific Islands country to ensure independence from government or cultural influences, avoid claims of favouritism, and

indirect influence of Government on the \u2022\ufffd scheme\u2019s operation or members at the national level because of separation from the regulatory space (i.e. government regulation) The SWOT analysis (above) illustrates that one of the key advantages of a regional-national media self- regulatory scheme is that it can better focus on the three critical criteria \u2013 transparency, resources and respect, which would enhance the effectiveness and thus viability of a scheme. Of these, the most important function of a regional-national self-regulatory scheme is the potential to secure a broader range of funding to adequately resource the scheme, thus allowing it to establish viable and sustainable independent processes/ optimal conditions for effective regional media self-regulation in the pacific islands 24 structures, improved governance mechanisms, a responsive complaints/redress system, monitor trends and enhancing compliance to laws and regulations. Specifically, the regional-national governing body could fund and organise through regional bodies, such as PINA and PasiMA, urgently needed training in law and ethics to improve the quality of journalistic practice across Pacific Islands\u2019 countries, a key weakness identified by both media professionals and Pacific Islands\u2019 governments. However, this model\u2019s main weakness is its lack of coordination with already established government regulatory frameworks. The main challenge for this scheme would be to build trust and understanding of specific roles between the self-regulatory governing body and government controlled media regulation. Failure to establish such linkages weakens the effectiveness of a self-regulatory scheme. If the scheme attempted to negotiate such linkages this would have to be done in a way that ensured it retained its independence in relation to funding, decision making and transparency. option c: regional-national media self-/co-regulatory scheme Option C attempts to bridge the gap between a regional-national media self-regulatory scheme and already established government regulatory frameworks (i.e. broadcasting) to promote a regulatory space in which the media can take responsibility for its actions guided by an agreed upon Code of Ethics that governs professional conduct. One of strengths of a scheme that represents media professional and organisations in the region is that is constitutes a single representative entity (not a disparate set of national regulatory bodies) that can more effectively negotiate with governments to establish workable, co-regulatory arrangement that support professional standards through responsible media and meets the developmental needs of governments in the region. To achieve this goal requires the scheme to set clear, guiding objectives for its membership to support and governments to accept. For example, the scheme could be charged with jurisdiction to: 1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d3150b1-b858-4d59-8d05-fda52ae3c199": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d3150b1-b858-4d59-8d05-fda52ae3c199", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Feasible Study: Optimal Conditions for Effective Regional Media Self-Regulation in the Pacific Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b0dabaa97626b2c8a1123ca1f58e84b65c02e94433185c7570fa97a22c7b02d"}, "2": {"node_id": "aefbdc8e-688c-4561-a267-ae17e53d5a08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e41563d530b51640b6f860611b18fc61c1ba3a3dcb0e878605110e9e2871dc2c"}}, "hash": "60d09a85a3688b375dfe99033f1af26ad7c53a04641e37bc6181b62e142c7c9f", "text": "For example, the scheme could be charged with jurisdiction to: 1.

The report makes a range of specific recommendations to enhance the feasibility of establishing a media self-regulatory system in the Pacific Islands. To achieve this goal of actioning the research results and moving the scheme forward, the following five recommendations are made: 1. Engage the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Pacific Office to undertake a capacity building assessment of the current established National Media Associations in Vanuatu, Tonga, Samoa, the Cook Islands and Fiji from May to June, 2014; 2. Adopt the 12 best practice criteria as an evaluative framework for UNDP to assess the capacity of the listed national media self-regulatory systems to identify the needs of national media self-regulatory systems; 3. Secure immediate and sufficient funding from the United Nations to support the initial capacity building assessment phase of National Media Associations with the view to accessing key consultancies and advisory representatives to move the establishment of a regional-national media self-/co-regulatory framework forward; 4. Engage in broader community consultation from May to June 2014, inclusive of media, governments and citizens and consumers across the 14 nominated Pacific Island countries, with a view to providing an appointed advisory committee with appropriate level of knowledge to enhance the sustainability of the system, specifically during the critical start-up phase of capacity assessment and implementation; and 5. Establish a representative advisory body of seven to nine advisors to oversee the assessment of National Media Associations and drive development of a regional-national self-/co-regulatory system over a 6-month period from June to December 2014 with membership of the body drawing from respected journalists and editors, eminent citizens (including legal, academic and public figures) and journalists and media practitioners (see Annex J for key considerations for planning, design and implementation of the scheme and a general overview of a possible structure \u2013 see Figure 17). optimal conditions for effective regional media self-regulation in the pacific islands 27 9. bibliOgraphy Australian Communications and Media Authority.

Background Media in Pacific Island countries face varying degrees of enabling policy and legislative environments. Common across the Pacific region are concerns over the quality of media reporting and the absence of common media standards and enforcement mechanisms with regards to journalism ethics and standards. These concerns are largely shared by media representatives themselves. Simultaneously, there are an increasing number of voices in the region that call for tighter regulation of the media. There is thus a risk that without functioning self-regulation mechanisms and adherence to journalism standards, Pacific media will be facing an increasingly restrictive legislative environment. National self-regulation mechanisms to enforce media standards are non-existent currently, although efforts by development partners are underway and are likely to gain a foothold in some Pacific Island countries. At the same time, a number of media outlets across the Pacific have expressed their support for a regional media self-regulation mechanism to establish and enhance the adherence to media standards across the Pacific region. The establishment of such a regional mechanism has been promoted by the Pacific Freedom Forum. In the context of UNESCO\u2019s efforts to increase the freedom of the media, access to information and to use communication as a means of achieving sustainable development in the Pacific, and UNDP\u2019s programs promoting human rights and freedom of expression, the two organizations, in partnership with the Pacific Freedom Forum, have decided to undertake a feasibility study on establishing a regional media self-regulation mechanism for the Pacific. Objectives and Scope of Work 1. The overall aim of the feasibility study is to enable an informed discussion among media stakeholders about possible self-regulation mechanisms at the regional level with a view of exploring viable options to establish such a mechanism in the Pacific 2. The objective of the feasibility study is to present and discuss the various models of self-regulation mechanisms; their advantages and disadvantages based on lessons learnt from existing mechanisms; based on consultations with media and development partners in the Pacific; and taking to account a possible need to adapt these to the Pacific region. 3. The discussion on feasibility shall include at the minimum sections on: financing and sustainability of a regional mechanism; membership and appointments; relationship vis-\u00e0-vis national self-regulation mechanisms; as well as regional standard setting and enforcement processes. 4. The feasibility study shall include a clear presentation of at least two different possible media self-regulation models for the Pacific region including an outline of the process towards their establishment, and a recommendation with regards to the most appropriate model for the Pacific. A consultant will be hired to develop the feasibility study in close consultation with media stakeholders and development partners across the Pacific region. UNDP, UNESCO and PFF staff will provide additional support, quality control, and advise to the consultant. The international consultant on media self-regulation mechanisms will be responsible for the following: optimal conditions for effective regional media self-regulation in the pacific islands 29 Take responsibility for the overall timely and high quality delivery of the feasibility study. \u2022\ufffd Carry out a desk review of guidance documents as well as existing media self-regulation mechanisms globally, and \u2022\ufffd discuss pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of existing models as well as their adaptability to the Pacific region.

Public Awareness A self-regulatory scheme should ensure adequate public awareness to ensure citizens and consumers are aware of their rights, where the purpose of the scheme is to inform citizens and consumers and where participation in a scheme has reputational benefits, and where people have choice between members and non-members. 2. Transparency A self-regulatory scheme depends on stakeholder confidence, which requires openness and transparency in operation and a degree of public accountability in relation to the scheme\u2019s performance. This includes, at a minimum, publishing annual reports \u2013 including a mechanism for objective review \u2013 on the schemes progress. Effective arrangements for wide public consultation on broader significant issues are also desirable. 3.

The scheme will then be in a position to influence and act independently of, individual members, to ensure that its influence extends across the industry. 4. Resources A self-regulatory scheme should ensure there are adequate resources put in place to operate the scheme effectively. They must also ensure that the distribution of costs is proportionate and does not preclude smaller and less well-resourced players from joining the scheme. Staff resources need to be sufficient and skilled to cope with the volume and type of work which is likely to arise. Cost commitments should be based on what is required to achieve the objectives of the scheme, rather than on the willingness of industry to contribute. 5. Enforcement A self-regulatory scheme requires an incentive for members to comply. Administering this requires disclosure and transparency of information from members so participants can monitor effectiveness of the scheme. Disclosure of non-compliance penalties is necessary for identified breaches. 6. Processes/ structures A self-regulatory scheme should provide clear terms of engagement for scheme members from outset. These include an agreement of terms of reference, institutional structures, and clarity of funding arrangements, time limits to achieve the objectives where such limits are appropriate, decision making arrangements, and voting rights. 7. Governance A self-regulatory scheme should establish sufficient governance and administration to achieve its objectives. A scheme needs to set and audit Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to ensure consistency across the industry. Where KPIs have been set, they should be published and regularly reviewed in the light of changing circumstances. optimal conditions for effective regional media self-regulation in the pacific islands 42 8. Complaints/ Redress A self-regulatory scheme should provide consumers and citizens with the right to adequate complaint handling standards when dissatisfied by the initial response of the media provider. It is desirable to put in place genuinely independent appeals mechanisms that ensure that complaints are resolved quickly and effectively, and outcomes disclosed. An effective scheme will have an alternate address mechanism such as an independent arbitration, or an ombudsman scheme, which is easy to access and readily identifiable at the point of need and has even-handed and transparent procedures. 9. Respect A self-regulatory scheme should derive benefits if it is respected by other stakeholders including consumer and citizen groups, government and parliamentarians. Consequently, a system involving a mixture of independent lay and industry members will be appropriate in both the scheme\u2019s governing body and further operating committees. 10. Monitor A self-regulatory scheme should actively review trends in the market landscape and changes in citizen and consumer needs, and monitor whether their remit and operations are sufficient to meet these. 11. Compliance A self-regulatory scheme should provide sufficient transparency and agree to comply with relevant competition laws and codes within each country to ensure a commitment to non-collusive behaviour. 12. Training A self-regulatory scheme should provide professional development training and education to address criticism that journalists lack skills in legal and ethical training, reinforcing the need for a professional code of conduct. annex j: planning, design and implementation scheme \u2013 key considerations Function Promote freedom of expression through a responsible and independent media and through adherence to high \u2022\ufffd journalistic and editorial standards; Support education and training of media professionals in legal and ethical standards to improve professionalism \u2022\ufffd within the industry; Conduct or support key research into media issues relating to member countries and utilise its consideration of \u2022\ufffd these issues in its decision making; Sponsor an annual conference, as well as regular seminars and public lectures, where financially feasible, on media \u2022\ufffd re-related topics and initiate an annual journalism competition/prize at one of more of the journalism schools (Technical Vocational Education Training diploma and university degree programs) in the region; and Produce occasional papers on issues impacting on the Pacific Islands\u2019 media. \u2022\ufffd Independence Establish the self-regulatory body as an independent legal entity; \u2022\ufffd Operate the self-regulatory governing body from a base in a non-member country within the Pacific Islands (e.g. \u2022\ufffd New Caledonia) to enhance its independence in decision-making and from national political influence; Develop a constitution that reflects the self-regulatory body\u2019s legal entity and incorporate sections in order to \u2022\ufffd enhance the perception of independence from funders; Secure multiple funding sources that enables the self-regulatory scheme to be amply resourced (financial and \u2022\ufffd human) so it performs its defined functions in relation to the 12 best practice criteria benchmark (see Funding section below); Secure agreement with members (organisations and individuals) to accept the jurisdiction of the self-regulatory \u2022\ufffd", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5feebb0a-dfbb-4b45-bf2b-615f335159d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "5feebb0a-dfbb-4b45-bf2b-615f335159d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Feasible Study: Optimal Conditions for Effective Regional Media Self-Regulation in the Pacific Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/feasible-study-optimal-conditions-effective-regional-media-self-regulation-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "841e9090a843ed06b1789773cd1326de378b8184c1e77e4a0c9febf54babad4a"}}, "hash": "841e9090a843ed06b1789773cd1326de378b8184c1e77e4a0c9febf54babad4a", "text": "body in relation to conforming to the scheme\u2019s Complaints/Redress process, including the requirement to publish its decisions when required to do so; and Establish a provision for an independent review of the scheme\u2019s operations every five years. \u2022\ufffd Management Appoint a full-time Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to undertake operational activities of the self-regulatory body, \u2022\ufffd including overseeing the complaints process and to progress defined objectives and initiatives of the scheme.

MEETING SUMMARY On 30 June 2008, representatives from ten Forum Island Countries (FICs) convened in Honiara, Solomon Islands for the \ufb01 rst regional meeting on freedom of information legislation for Paci\ufb01 c government of\ufb01 cials. The meeting was organised by the Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) with support from the UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre. The meeting supports work under the Paci\ufb01 c Plan, the instrument which provides guidance to the work of the Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Secretariat as well as of relevant development partners. Under Initiative 12.3 on enhancing governance mechanisms, Freedom of Information (FOI) is identi\ufb01 ed as a milestone in support of the Plan\u2019s Good Governance Pillar. FOI is still a relatively new concept in the Paci\ufb01 c. In 2005, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative held a meeting on FOI for Paci\ufb01 c members of parliament.1 In 2006, the UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre held a FOI workshop for Paci\ufb01 c Civil Society Organisations (CSOs). Most notably, in February 2008, the Cook Islands Government became the \ufb01 rst FIC to pass a FOI law. This achievement by Cook Islands is a very positive and encouraging sign for the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb258ce2-8864-4d2e-8404-45802ef6a299": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb258ce2-8864-4d2e-8404-45802ef6a299", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Freedom of Information for Pacific Policy Makers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8439b20619b453179b7529431d25e9c422340da0fd4d7c7b0e8eee25a8955a6a"}, "2": {"node_id": "a21447f6-1fea-4a6e-a34a-a5db9202267d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ada088d3841d782a243df461246d9a1f897c6c98f062d2276867447f8c79abf2"}}, "hash": "3354368819def78c8b93527735c583be61ce2c483f59be74e67e77465a767b4f", "text": "This achievement by Cook Islands is a very positive and encouraging sign for the region. PIFS and the UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre were keen to build on this breakthrough, by organising a regional workshop to bring together policy makers and senior of\ufb01 cials from the Paci\ufb01 c to discuss the value of freedom of information as an important tool for strengthening and enhancing good governance in national governance and the Paci\ufb01 c region. Of\ufb01 cials who attended the workshop were from key agencies such as the Prime Minister\u2019s Of\ufb01 ce, Attorney General\u2019s Of\ufb01 ce, Information Ministry, Leadership Commission and Ombudsman of\ufb01 ces. It was envisaged that the workshop would encourage and empower participants to raise awareness in their countries in support of FOI. The workshop also aimed to build participants\u2019 capacities to recognise international best practice and standards in FOI law-making and to identify strategies for tackling some of the key practical issues that will have to be addressed if and when Governments begin implementing a new information disclosure regime. Solomon Islands Prime Minister, the Honorable Dr Derek Sikua, opened the meeting, acknowledging the need for the region to \u201cbetter accommodate freedom of information and to realize how its values could contribute to the social and economic development of our countries\u201d. The Prime Minister 5 recognised that the tyranny of distance, especially for countries with a scattered \u2018geographical spread\u2019 like Solomon Islands, would always present a challenge to the goals", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b4d2013-ed44-41fa-a276-209657de4218": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b4d2013-ed44-41fa-a276-209657de4218", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Freedom of Information for Pacific Policy Makers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8cccabb859661b0a6fbea4c3848527039fd450df92861092049312f7c7453a5"}, "3": {"node_id": "25e9a254-cc63-4e4d-bc7d-d6d7e879b7ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e459fe1b14248b6a17bdaa6f9024a5e1e1085207484b72ffe315d42d279bc47"}}, "hash": "3e21cbf89a2a9c69fd01975d3a5576f3718f31c80f5b77115b565a570a529e91", "text": "of an FOI regime, but technological advances in the form of internet and mobile phones were slowly easing this burden. It was very encouraging that the Prime Minister committed his Government to \u201cwork closely with the Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Secretariat and other stakeholders in considering a possible freedom of information policy and legislation that could give effect to the realization of freedom of information\u201d. Status of FOI in the Paci\ufb01 c \u2013 current to June 2008 Australia and New Zealand enacted FOI laws in 1982 and Cook Islands enacted the Of\ufb01 cial Information Act in February 2008. (NB: One year has been given for implementation preparation, such that the Act will come into force on 7 February 2009.) Article 51 of the PNG Constitution explicitly recognises the right of reasonable access to of\ufb01 cial documents, subject only to the need for such secrecy as is reasonably justi\ufb01 able in a democratic society. In 1999, civil society developed a draft FOI Bill. Article 174 of the Fiji Constitution requires Parliament to enact an FOI law. In 2000, an Exposure Draft FOI Bill was released by the Government but lapsed after the 2000 coup. In 2004, civil society launched a model FOI Bill. An FOI Bill was developed by the Government in 2005/06, but no progress has been made since the December 2006 coup. The Interim Government listed passage of an FOI law in its 11-point plan. Article 12 of the Kiribati Constitution and Article 24 Tuvalu Constitution include the freedom to receive and communicate ideas and information without interference as part of the right to freedom of expression. In Nauru, Article 12 of the Constitution recognises the right to freedom of expression, but there is no reference to the right to information. However, during the 2006/7 review of the Constitution, it was proposed to introduce a speci\ufb01 c right to information. Solomon Islands has included a speci\ufb01 c Right to Information in their draft Constitution developed in 2003/04. In Vanuatu, Transparency International developed a model FOI Bill and a civil society coalition is now working to develop model legislation. 6 In summary, in addition to important context setting discussions to ensure that all participants were aware of the many unique challenges of the Paci\ufb01 c, the meeting was divided into three main parts aimed at providing policy-makers with information on whether FOI legislation is useful for their country context and if so, to provide them with a grounding on the basic legal principles and implementation issues for consideration, which they could then take back and discuss with their government colleagues: Context setting to discuss the Paci\ufb01 c challenges in accessing information: Ms. Angie Heffernan from the Paci\ufb01 c Centre for Public Integrity facilitated discussions to draw out the key issues for participants in terms of practically implementing FOI in the Paci\ufb01 c. Day 1 \u2013 The Value of the Right to Information to the Paci\ufb01 c: Ms. Charmaine Rodrigues, the Paci\ufb01 c Centre Regional Legislative Strengthening Expert discussed the usefulness of freedom of information in the Paci\ufb01 c, with a special focus on its value of participatory democracy and development. Day 2 \u2013 International best practice in FOI law-making: Mr. Andrew Ecclestone of the New Zealand Ombudsman of\ufb01 ce discussed the core principles that should be considered and enshrined in an effective FOI law, noting however that there is no \u201cone size \ufb01 ts all\u201d approach and each country should develop a law suitable to its domestic context. Day 3 \u2013 The Practical Challenges of Implementation: Ms. Janet Maki, the Cook Islands Ombudswoman, discussed the process of enacting Cook Islands\u2019 new FOI law and some of the early implementation issues they are managing. Ms. Natasha Bodden, the Policy Analyst at the Cayman Islands Freedom of Information Unit, discussed the implementation challenges and strategies the Unit has developed to implement the country\u2019s new FOI law, which was passed in October 2007 and comes into force in January 2009. 7 II.

THE VALUE OF THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION TO THE PACIFIC At the outset, participants were informed that there are three main components that underpin the right to information: The right to request information. Every person has the right to request information from public authorities, and from private bodies at least where the information is needed for the exercise or protection of a right. Applicants should not have to justify why they need information from public bodies. Duty on the government to meet the request, subject to key exemptions in the public interest. Governments should have systems in place to process requests for information, including effective records management systems so that release of information is systematic, structured and managed. When assessing applications, exemptions to disclosure may be necessary to prevent \u2018harm\u2019 to the public interest from releasing information. An independent \u2018of\ufb01 cial\u2019 should be mandated to oversee decisions and ensure that information requests are being appropriately handled. Duty on the Government to provide certain baseline information proactively, on a routine basis without request. Proactive disclosure greatly reduces the burden of releasing the same information repeatedly. More broadly, it creates an atmosphere of trust between the public and government and enables people to more effectively engage with the government. Discussions focused on the value of the right to information for Paci\ufb01 c Governments. The UN has long recognised the right to information as a fundamental human right and which underpins all other freedoms. The Paci\ufb01 c Information Disclosure Policy Toolkit2 which was distributed to participants discusses the reasons why the right to information is valuable to the Paci\ufb01 c in more detail, but in summary, the right to information: Promotes democratic governance. Having an informed constituency that is engaging with government regularly, rather than only every 3-4 years when elections are held, contributes to more effective governance. When people can access real information, as opposed to propaganda, 10 they can make better choices about who to vote for. Having an informed public shifts the balance of power from the government to the public, as the public can ask questions about what is happening around them and therefore hold the government to account. Facilitates public sector ef\ufb01 ciency. An access to information regime requires strong information management systems. Improved information management will enable public of\ufb01 cials to operate more ef\ufb01 ciently. The idea that the decisions they make may become public will also encourage public of\ufb01 cials to ensure their policy advice and decisions are defensible and the arguments are well-considered. The threat of public oversight will improve overall policy advice, and ensure that decisions and advice are properly documented and based on high quality advice. Supports decentralization. This is particularly relevant in terms of service delivery in the Paci\ufb01 c. Throughout the region, many governments are pursuing decentralisation policies to bring accountability for services closer to the people, but money and effort is leaking through the system. Providing information to the public enables them to clarify the responsibilities of the different levels of government which in turn enables the general public to act as \u2018watchdogs\u2019 to ensure services are being properly provided and to hold agencies accountable. Supports participatory development. Allows for a more inclusive approach to development. With information in hand, the public are empowered to engage with their governments to provide inputs into the design of development activities and to continue to be involved in implementation and monitoring of projects, programs and policy decisions.

The private sector \u2013 particularly in terms of foreign investors \u2013 is more likely to invest in countries where they can easily access information about the legislative and regulatory environment, investment guidelines for setting up a business venture and how to obtain relevant permits and licenses etc. 11 Exposes corruption. Access to information legislation is an effective tool to empower the public to hold governments, public servants and the private sector (in certain circumstances) accountable. By opening up information held by governments, people can see for themselves that the government is doing what it says it is doing. Strengthens state-building. Depending on the sensitivity of issues, making information accessible to the public can mitigate con\ufb02 icts by reducing the circulation of misinformation. Misinformation and the grinding of the Paci\ufb01 c\u2019s \u201ccoconut wireless\u201d could result in unnecessary tensions between communities, whereas armed with relevant information people can understand the issues confronting them and may be less likely to feel disempowered and distrustful of government. In this context, information disclosure helps to build and gain trust in governments and could even facilitate dialogue between divided communities and between the government and communities. Improves media reporting. Access to information encourages fact- based reporting, signi\ufb01 cantly reduces misreporting, and may improve the investigative skills of journalists who are often unable to access hard data. There should be no excuses for journalists not to be fully informed and to report with greater accuracy and fact. By reducing the media\u2019s reliance on rumors, a higher benchmark of reporting can be set and met. At the end of the session, participants were shown a short DVD from the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) about the usefulness of the right to information to accountable and participatory development at the grassroots level of society in India.

INTERNATIONAL BEST PRACTICE IN FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAW-MAKING Mr. Andrew Ecclestone, an of\ufb01 cial from the New Zealand Ombudsman\u2019s Of\ufb01 ce, presented a range of best principles that have been developed based on national FOI legislations throughout the world. Participants were encouraged to keep these principles in mind when consideration is given to drafting national FOI legislation. Notably, the principles were drawn heavily from \u201c9 FOI Principles\u201d framework developed by Article 19, an international NGO which works to promote FOI globally. At a general level, participants were encouraged to recognise that the golden thread which binds a good FOI law is that access to information that is held by public authorities is a human right. Everyone is entitled to information held by government. Exemptions should be limited, narrowly drawn and focused on protecting the public interest. In general, enactment of laws \u2018forces\u2019 compliance from people and organisations under its jurisdiction. In countries where it may be dif\ufb01 cult to enact legislation, as a \ufb01 rst step, governments should be encouraged to develop information disclosure policies, either for the whole of government or on a sectoral basis. This alternative approach still supports the government machinery to disclose information and encourage better maintenance of records. For the wider Paci\ufb01 c, it was recognised that a key challenge will be for FOI legislation to be seen as being locally driven and developed. It will be important to develop partnerships and buy-in from all stakeholders, including governments, Members of Parliaments, of\ufb01 cials, the public and civil society groups. In the Cayman Islands, the FOI lawmaking process was very participatory in nature, with the FOI Bill published on the Government\u2019s website and made open to the general public for their comments and views. Many comments and suggestions were received from the public and civil society organisations locally and worldwide. By contrast, Cook Islands had a different strategy, with the development of their FOI legislation being led by the Government. 13 Good practice principles underpinning a Freedom of Information regime: 1. Maximum Disclosure The fundamental principle underpinning a good FOI law is that all information held by public bodies should be open for disclosure, subject to very limited exemptions. Within this broad principle however, some key issues need to be considered and answered taking into account the domestic context: What type of information: A practical de\ufb01 nition needs to be agreed on as to what types of information are covered by the law. In New Zealand for example, even where information is not written down, if an of\ufb01 cial has knowledge of something and gained that knowledge during his or her of\ufb01 cial duties, he or she can be required to write it down and provide it", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f897aa6c-52da-49bd-a76f-96ae4679ea70": {"__data__": {"id_": "f897aa6c-52da-49bd-a76f-96ae4679ea70", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Freedom of Information for Pacific Policy Makers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "772c67d7ba71a25fca3ff49ffed72205c89f7f9227d91dbb215c8a0388b653dc"}}, "hash": "772c67d7ba71a25fca3ff49ffed72205c89f7f9227d91dbb215c8a0388b653dc", "text": "to a requester. In India, people can request samples of materials under the law, so that they can check for example, whether public roads and buildings have been constructed using proper materials. Who must provide information: Countries need to decide which bodies will be covered by the law. At the very least, a wide range of public authorities should be covered \u2013 recognising that any sensitive information they hold will be protected by exemptions. In this context, coverage could include the Courts (e.g. information relating to administrative processes, budgets etc), the legislature (though there is the issue of parliamentary privileges, so disclosure could be limited), the Of\ufb01 ce of the Head of State (at least for administrative information) and the security and intelligence services. Consideration should also be given to including private bodies, for example, companies providing public services like water, electricity, gas or telecommunications. Participants also raised the issue of whether NGO\u2019s should be covered, at least where they are performing a public service function on behalf of the state or receive public funds. Who can request information: Countries need to decide who is eligible to request information, i.e., only citizens, residents in a country, or all persons irrespective of immigration or residential status. In many countries in the Paci\ufb01 c, many people are permanent residents and not citizens, so this is an important issue. Under Cayman Islands\u2019 FOI law, the right to access information is applicable to everyone, anywhere in the world. 14 In Cayman Islands, it is an interesting feature of their FOI law that unless the information being requested is for personal information, applicants must only supply a name and a mode to be contacted - but the name they supply does not necessarily have to be their own! In a small island scenario where \u2018everyone knows everybody\u2019, understandably, requesting information about an issue that involved a relative or a neighbour could have social repercussions. This clause recognises this issue and allows for the possibility of \u2018anonymous\u2019 requests. 2. Obligation to publish Public bodies should be under an obligation to publish and update key information, in an easily accessible medium and format. For example, information about government departments (including contact details), government programmes and services being provided to the public, relevant forms/\ufb02 iers/paperwork, departmental budgets and expenditure information, opportunities for the public to engage in government initiatives and the details of the award of licenses/permits/subsidies and contracts could all be regularly disclosed and published. Proactive disclosure is particularly useful in the Paci\ufb01 c where the \u2018tyranny of distance\u2019 has made it dif\ufb01 cult for many people, particularly in rural areas, to \ufb01 nd out about what the government does. Proactively disseminating information out to communities could help bridge this divide. In this context, participants were very clear that it will be important to harness available technology to address information access, especially for the disadvantaged rural communities. Most outer-lying Island communities have access to community notice boards which could be utilized in the dissemination of information. For example, information about the budgets of local schools and health clinics could be pinned to notice boards so that communities could then ask more informed questions about service provision. Public announcements could be made, particularly on the radio, which is a key medium for most Paci\ufb01 c Islanders. However, outreach continues to be a problem. For example, in Tonga, town of\ufb01 cers are the main government contact points in villages. The challenge is to get information out to town of\ufb01 cers to disseminate to the villages, including 15 those in outer islands. In Vanuatu, it was reported that there is a disconnect between communities living in remote islands and the central Government that is perceived to exist due to the lack of information that reaches them about the Government. Radio transmission from the capital, Port Vila, to the remote islands is poor but where these islands are closer to neigbhouring Paci\ufb01 c states like New Caledonia, Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea the people are well-informed about political, social and economic issues in these countries as the radio signals are far superior. In Tuvalu, radio is the only means of communication to the outer islands. Currently radio is serviced through FM which limits access, and is affected by poor satellite services. As a short-term remedy, important radio sessions are recorded by tape and distributed to outer islands via the Government\u2019s shipping services. In Solomon Islands, the Government and UNDP collaborated on the development of the People First Network (PFNet), a network of 20 computers located throughout Solomon Islands, with email and internet services for remote island stations.

Each fortnight, Government newsletters are sent through the email stations and are then printed and distributed around the centres. The Government also has a free feedback service, where members of the public can write to the government at no charge to report back on problems. 3. Limited exemptions based on the public interest It is a well-accepted FOI principle that not all information can be released to the public because some information is so sensitive that its release might actually harm the national interest. To protect against such disclosures, FOI laws have a section on \u201cexemption\u201d, which describe the circumstances in which information can be withheld. Global good practice suggests that Forum Island Countries need to be careful to avoid blanket exemption for whole institutions, such as the military, or for entire classes of information, such as Cabinet documents. Rather exemptions need to be issues-based, and premised on whether releasing the information will serve or harm the greater public interest. 16 Article 19\u2019s Model Law suggests that every test for exemptions should therefore be considered in 3 parts: (i) Is the information covered by a legitimate exemption? (ii) Will disclosure cause substantial harm? (iii) Is the likely harm greater than the public interest in disclosure? Some common exemptions were discussed to highlight the principle that a good exemption will be drafted to focus on the HARM potentially caused by disclosure, rather than the type of information. Sensitivity is also time- bound, such that release should be considered \u2018at the time of request\u2019. A few exemptions were discussed in more detail to highlight these issues: Information that would harm national security, defense or law enforcement: Instead of imposing a blanket exemption for all information held by the police, intelligence services or military, the focus should be on the potential harm caused to the investigation of offences, collection of evidence, apprehension of criminals, a fair trial, etc. Information that would harm international relations: Instead of applying a blanket exemption for information given by another country or body in con\ufb01 dence, the issue should be whether disclosure would harm the national interest. For example, if a donor, development partner or other inter-governmental organisation wants something kept secret, the question should be whether withholding the information is in the national interest, not just the interest of that body. Information that would harm national \ufb01 nancial and economic interests: For example, premature disclosure of new interest rates or monetary policy. But note the time issue. For example, during trade negotiations at the WTO or during the ACP talks, the position of governments may not be released as it may undermine its negotiating position. But once a trade agreement is reached, it might be appropriate to release information about the negotiations, for example, to help interested stakeholders to understand the basis of the agreement. Premature disclosure of a government policy: Sometimes, the early release of a new government policy could actually undermine its ef\ufb01 cacy, such that the information should be withheld. Nonetheless, information about policy development and the advice provided by of\ufb01 cials to Ministers should not necessarily be withheld because key stakeholders have a right to know whether Ministers are getting proper advice and then whether they are making sound decisions. 17 Commercially con\ufb01 dential information: Some commercial information, most notably trade secrets, must be protected. However, while other commercial information may be sensitive it may still be in the public interest to disclose it, for example, information about environmental hazards or threats to public health or safety. Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy: An FOI law should not be used to spy or invade the privacy of individuals. An exemption is therefore necessary to protect personal information. However, this exemption may not necessarily apply to public of\ufb01 cials because the public has a great right to know about what they do in their of\ufb01 cial capacity as public of\ufb01 cials and as it relates to their public duties. 4. Cheap, timely independent oversight A strong FOI regime needs to include an effective, independent appeals body which has the power to review refusal to disclose information and order disclosure if it appears that the law has not been properly complied with. For example, information requests cannot be refused simply because its release could cause public embarrassment for government of\ufb01 cials. An oversight body \u2013 which ideally sits outside the bureaucracy \u2013 needs to have powers to investigate appeals, make decisions and enforce them. In some jurisdictions, independent oversight bodies can also impose", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fae3a187-f38e-4a05-9ebb-6ae0a0617e6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fae3a187-f38e-4a05-9ebb-6ae0a0617e6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Freedom of Information for Pacific Policy Makers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12d29db9f11e1f89cd22cd782e357e5870780c8b896ced5752eb4f1fcc7f6919"}, "3": {"node_id": "9607532e-5159-4a9d-8442-7b753207ad92", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11222d58f9a6c6be212451b13ced2aa01b16afbdc4410fe8758c6dbe7b605b97"}}, "hash": "cb7ded246783a23b7d6b0858a80d78f78e5a2d3535bd0ad40a4a69897923556f", "text": "penalties where the law has not been complied with. In terms of independence, the courts are an obvious appeal route, but they are usually very costly and time-consuming. Internationally, different models have been used, for example, Ombudsman\u2019s of\ufb01 ce, a dedicated Information Commissioner or a tribunal. In New Zealand and the Cook Islands, the Ombudsman of\ufb01 ce has powers to review information decisions. In the Paci\ufb01 c, considering the special challenges of Small Island States in terms of limited human and \ufb01 nancial resources, it is important to consider carefully what institution is best placed to handle this role. For example, in Cook Islands, instead of setting up a new body, the Government tasked the existing Ombudsman with FOI. This will maximise limited resources. As countries like Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Palau consider setting up an anti-corruption commission, Leadership Code Commission or Tribunal and an integrity institution respectively, it will be important for governments to consider which of these organizations can implement FOI. Clearly, additional responsibilities for oversight of an FOI law require additional resources to ensure effect implementation of the law. 18 5. Simple, cost-effective, timely processes for facilitating access It is important that the law clearly sets out the procedures on how to deal with requests. This also helps public bodies to have a clear understanding of their new responsibilities. Ideally, requests for information should be processed within a reasonable amount of time by an appropriately designated of\ufb01 cial charged with the speci\ufb01 c responsibility for processing requests. It is recommended that agencies could appoint an Information Of\ufb01 cer to be responsible for deciding on the release of information. The Information Of\ufb01 cer should be a relatively senior of\ufb01 cial in the organization, who has the con\ufb01 dence of the head of the organization. Information Of\ufb01 cers can be supported with training to familiarize themselves with the law and their speci\ufb01 c role and responsibilities. Notably, the Information Of\ufb01 cer should not necessarily be the departmental media of\ufb01 cer. Public relations and media work require different skills to dealing with information disclosure requests. Information Of\ufb01 cers have a role in releasing information in addition to the processes of information release that every of\ufb01 cial is responsible for normally. Under a user-friendly FOI regime, public bodies have a duty to assist individuals requesting information. In the Paci\ufb01 c, this duty should explicitly cover people who are illiterate or do not speak the of\ufb01 cial language. Requests for information should be able to be made by telephone, so that people in outlying islands do not have to rely on the post. It should also be possible to make requests in local languages, rather than just the of\ufb01 cial language, as many Paci\ufb01 c countries have a large number of local languages and dialects. Ideally, the procedures for processing requests for information include: Acknowledgement of requests within a reasonable time; Processing requests within a set deadline, usually between 5-20 working days; Requests transferred as soon as possible if they are submitted to the wrong government body; Costs for accessing information should not be so high as to deter requesters. In the Cayman Islands, to make a request is free of charge. However, costs may be incurred in the actual processing or delivery of the information requested; Information to be provided in its original format or alternative form if requested; Where information is refused, a written notice provided which includes a justi\ufb01 cation and information about appeal rights. 19 6. Monitoring and promoting open government Experience from elsewhere demonstrates that it is important to constantly monitor the implementation of FOI laws to ensure that the law is being properly applied and that government departments are meeting their statutory obligations. In this context, most FOI laws include a provision which requires that an annual report is produced \u2013 either by the independent oversight body or the Department responsible for administration of the Act. The report should be tabled in Parliament. Some Acts also allow the independent oversight body to start their own investigations and table ad hoc reports and recommendations where they believe there is a problem with implementation (e.g. by a particularly agency or regarding a particular provision). Increasingly, FOI laws are now enshrining obligations on the Government to engage in: (1) training for public of\ufb01 cials; and, (2) public education programmes on the legislation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9607532e-5159-4a9d-8442-7b753207ad92": {"__data__": {"id_": "9607532e-5159-4a9d-8442-7b753207ad92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Freedom of Information for Pacific Policy Makers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12d29db9f11e1f89cd22cd782e357e5870780c8b896ced5752eb4f1fcc7f6919"}, "2": {"node_id": "fae3a187-f38e-4a05-9ebb-6ae0a0617e6e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb7ded246783a23b7d6b0858a80d78f78e5a2d3535bd0ad40a4a69897923556f"}}, "hash": "11222d58f9a6c6be212451b13ced2aa01b16afbdc4410fe8758c6dbe7b605b97", "text": "In South Africa and India, speci\ufb01 c clauses were included on education and awareness, with special mention of the need to undertake programmes for disadvantaged groups.

In fact, 28 September each year is celebrated by many FOI advocates as Right to Know Day. 20 V. PRACTICAL CHALLENGES OF IMPLEMENTATION Participants felt that FICs need to evaluate for themselves the costs and bene\ufb01 ts of having FOI legislation. In this context, FICs will need to consider the bureaucratic and administrative capacities of the governments before committing to enacting FOI legislation. For an FOI regime to work, awareness and buy-in from both government as well as the public is essential. High level commitment from heads of agencies and Ministers will help. Ms Natasha Bodden, Policy Analyst from the Cayman Islands FOI Unit shared many lessons learned from Cayman Islands implementation work, drawing on their own experiences as a small island state. Ms Bodden highlighted at the outset that starting partnerships with government, CSOs and the public from the very early stages of legislative development will help with implementation. The more aware people are of the legislation, the more likely it is to be properly implemented and effectively utilised. Coordinating implementation Both Cook Islands and Cayman Islands passed legislation which included a \u201cgrace period\u201d of 12-14 months respectively between enactment of the law and the date the law will come into force. This time lag was intended to give the bureaucracy time to prepare for implementation. This strategy has been increasingly utilised in FOI laws around the world, because it recognises that bureaucracies need time to organise themselves to ensure that when requests start coming in, of\ufb01 cials are prepared to deal with them. In Cayman Islands, during the current preparation period (starting October 2007 and ending on 1 January 2009), a FOI Unit was set up to guide implementation. This recognises that it is vital to identify an FOI \u2018champion\u2019 that has the respect of government of\ufb01 cials as well as that of the public to pursue implementation. The Cayman Islands FOI Unit consists of two staff and a secretary. The Cayman Islands FOI Unit developed a clear vision for their work, identifying as a priority that they wanted a participatory and transparent implementation process. They were very focused on planning, and prioritised the development of 2 key documents: 21 A Global Implementation Plan for the entire Government, with time lines and milestones for government at large. This would immediately identify, in some detail, key implementation tasks and the agencies responsible for them with strict deadlines for completion. The idea is that the whole of Government would adhere to the plan to ensure consistency across Government which would be monitored by an Implementation Steering Committee and the FOI Unit. A Model Action Plan for individual authorities to guide implementation, which would include prioritised actions/tasks and realistic time lines, based on the Global Implementation Plan. This would allow strategies to be tailored to agencies\u2019 particular needs and requirements. To begin with, a Baseline Assessment Sheet was sent to all authorities for completion, to identify their strengths, weaknesses, gaps and needs. This Sheet was then used to inform the individual Agency FOI Action Plans. In a practical sense, the development of the Action Plans made it vital for agencies to appoint persons in the agency to take the lead in getting things ready, which also kick-started the implementation process. To guide implementation, an early initiative was to set up an FOI Steering Committee (FOISC), approved by Cabinet, which comprised a senior member from each Ministry and Portfolio. This Committee was set up to facilitate participation of the bureaucracy in implementation. Senior of\ufb01 cials know their own agencies and are more able to effectively ensure that the requirements that need to be adhered to under an FOI regime are met. At a more operational level, the Cayman Islands FOI Unit also initiated the establishment of an Information Mangers Network to facilitate communication between the FOI Unit and all departmental Information Managers and between all Information Managers, so they could share their experiences, challenges and lessons learned. The FOI Unit has also been developing a detailed FOI Guidance Manual which can be used by Information Managers to help guide them as they process information requests. It is hoped that this will promote more consistency in decision-making by different of\ufb01 cials. Breaking down public service cultures of secrecy Many participants identi\ufb01 ed that within their bureaucracies there exists a strong bureaucratic culture of secrecy. Public servants are not used to sharing information with the public, and many are likely to (at least initially) be resistant to more openness. In Cayman Islands too, it was recognised early 22 on that a key challenge would be to make", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "610ee629-d821-4548-b1cc-666a5f504d9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "610ee629-d821-4548-b1cc-666a5f504d9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Freedom of Information for Pacific Policy Makers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c60d738816138ce044e421ecf2898fa87d4dc7418be7f2aa79ee55f2d0c67522"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ab7a335-7900-4d99-98ef-0cd96fd6556a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be6846d04a1b5711239807d811dae0322bd2ed6ec16ae7564150a51c30d7ecd8"}}, "hash": "83b964475b66f51933bf57d7332b58bf67eacbbfc967f6bb7f3074a2606147e3", "text": "public servants realize that FOI is a core part of the functions of every public authority rather than an \u201cadd- on\u201d. Changing the innate culture of secrecy that exists within Government is important to ensure that FOI legislation will not result in bureaucrats trying to retain procedures that make access dif\ufb01 cult or in of\ufb01 cials applying the law improperly. At the outset, the FOI Unit identi\ufb01 ed that they needed to develop a training strategy to include sensitisation of all levels of the bureaucracy, including Ministers; Chief Of\ufb01 cers; Heads of Agencies; Information Managers and Of\ufb01 cers; Records Of\ufb01 cers; and other key individuals within Government. It was recognised that while some of\ufb01 cials, most notably Information Managers, would need intensive training to ensure they understood the technical details of the entire Act. Other of\ufb01 cials could then get more basic training, to ensure that they knew the Act existed, their basic duties and who to refer people to for more information. The FOI Training Strategy identi\ufb01 ed: (i) Public servants in need of training and the skills necessary for each person; (ii) Ways to ensure sensitization of all staff of public authorities, e.g. from receptionists and \ufb01 le clerks to heads of department; (iii) Ways to evaluate the training and ensure its continuity when there is a change of staff; and (iv) Ways to ensure a process and network of support for Information Managers and training of trainers. An intensive awareness and training programme has been launched by the Cayman Islands FOI Unit to try to change the mindset of secrecy within Government staff. A total of 3,500 public servants require sensitization by December 2008. With an FOI Unit staffed by 2 active of\ufb01 cials, by July 2008, 1,000 having been sensitized already! Two main training programmes have been developed by the Cayman Islands FOI Unit: For all public servants: An open call session is sent with staff from all public authorities invited to attend; 23 Approximately 100 public servants attend each session which is 2 hours in length; Of\ufb01 cials are taught the basics of the FOI Law, including ways to assist their Information Managers Use of 2 video clips, a PowerPoint Presentation and a Quick Quiz at the end. Information Managers Training Course: 3-day detailed, intensive course on the FOI Law, Regulations, timelines, procedures; Participants are provided with a Guidance Manual, FOI Workbook (practical examples), other reference material for the use of the FOI Law; Participants are also provided with the sensitization material so they can sensitize their own staff who are unable to attend general sensitization sessions; A Certi\ufb01 cate is awarded upon completion of the course for future accreditation. Records management For administrative, legal and business reasons, of\ufb01 cial records are at the heart of any information regime. Without records, people cannot reconstruct what happened and what was decided, which undermines public accountability and ef\ufb01 ciency. However, throughout the Paci\ufb01 c it was identi\ufb01 ed that information and records management will be a key challenge to implementation of FOI. Speci\ufb01 c resources will need to be dedicated to cleaning up records and putting systems in place to ensure better record-keeping and information management. In Cayman Islands, it was recognised early on that information and records management was going to be a key issue. Prior to the enactment of the FOI Act, as in the Paci\ufb01 c, records had not been well-kept. In addition, in 2004, a massive hurricane hit Cayman Islands which destroyed many records. Unfortunately, the hurricane appears to also be a useful excuse for continuing poor records management. 24 Cayman Islands has a National Archives and Public Records Law 2007, which mandates record keeping within Government. The Cayman Islands National Archive (\u201cCINA\u201d) provides records management training to all Information Managers and Records Of\ufb01 cers. This is an ongoing process. The Cayman Islands FOI Unit and CINA are working closely to ensure all training is in accordance with the FOI Law and the FOI Unit provides training in accordance with the CINA Guidelines. CINA has published Guidelines which set out the absolute minimum requirements for authorities regarding record-keeping which must be met by January 2009.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ab7a335-7900-4d99-98ef-0cd96fd6556a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ab7a335-7900-4d99-98ef-0cd96fd6556a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Freedom of Information for Pacific Policy Makers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c60d738816138ce044e421ecf2898fa87d4dc7418be7f2aa79ee55f2d0c67522"}, "2": {"node_id": "610ee629-d821-4548-b1cc-666a5f504d9e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83b964475b66f51933bf57d7332b58bf67eacbbfc967f6bb7f3074a2606147e3"}}, "hash": "be6846d04a1b5711239807d811dae0322bd2ed6ec16ae7564150a51c30d7ecd8", "text": "They have also developed a File Plan template for agencies and a \u2018Retention and Disposal Schedule\u2019 has been drafted.

FIC representatives noted a general lack of resources in improving the dissemination of information to the smaller islands. The effectiveness of most civil services in reaching out to rural and outer-lying Islands is relatively under-developed, and this includes dissemination of information. In the Cook Islands, despite limited resources, the Ombudsman\u2019s of\ufb01 ce still tries to identify two or three islands per year for awareness programmes about role of Ombudsman. Islands have an Island secretary, and a Mayor who are contact points for Government ministries. Participants also recognised that there were real cultural dimensions faced within Paci\ufb01 c Islands around how people could access information. In some countries, there will be issues around ordinary people questioning of\ufb01 cials who may be prominent \ufb01 gures with a chie\ufb02 y status, or who are even respected family members. Questioning community elders or senior government of\ufb01 cials is a challenge in the current Paci\ufb01 c context. In that sense, a FOI regime ideally will need to provide an enabling environment where citizens feel a sense of empowerment and security to request for information. Ms Natasha Bodden from Cayman Islands noted in this context, that this was one of the reasons why they do not require people to put their names on applications. In a small country like Cayman Islands, which has only 50,000 people, there was real concern that people would be nervous to submit applications if of\ufb01 cials could know who they were. 25 26 In Cayman Islands, the FOI Unit has a limited public education role because public education has been designated to the Information Commissioner (the independent oversight body which is also responsible for handling complaints from requesters). Nonetheless, the FOI Unit has made sure to proactively bring the public into their work. Public focus groups have been used where members of the public are asked standard questions so the FOI Unit can judge whether and what additional public awareness may be required. To date, the FOI Unit has used its new FOI website as a key medium for reaching the public. For example, FOI Implementation Plans are available at all public libraries and on the website, inviting comment from the public. Minutes of all FOI Committee meetings are published on the FOI website and a Consultation Paper on the proposed FOI Regulations was published on the website and comments invited from the public for a 1 month period. The Cayman Islands FOI Unit has also used the media actively. They issue press releases on all FOI events and training and regularly do interviews to the press. A Quarterly Newsletter is also circulated in hardcopy, softcopy and published on the website. In 2007, the \ufb01 rst Annual Sunshine Week was held which included informative public education events, giveaways, and the like. Information dissemination Participants recognised that Governments need to have a greater commitment to improving and enhancing their communications strategies and infrastructure if they are to be more effective in disclosing basic information to the public. This is particularly important because of the scattered nature of the Paci\ufb01 c Islands. New ICT could help, but currently there is a lack of resources in improving exiting infrastructure and developing new ones to enhance access. It may be useful for Government to develop more integrated and comprehensive Information Policies, which not only deal with the legal and operational issues around FOI but also the broader information environment, such as internet access, the media, government communications facilities and the like. In this context, it was noted that public broadcasting bodies could be more effectively supported and utilised. The issue of language will also be a challenge, as many Paci\ufb01 c countries have numerous local dialects which will mean information will need to be calibrated for local needs. Participants noted that information provided and presentations made to communities are more effective when government of\ufb01 cials use the local dialect. Even more simply, government information is often very complex, such that it will be a key challenge for government not only to disseminate more information \u2013 but to disseminate information that is useful and can be understood by ordinary members of the public. Notably though, even if Governments provide information in of\ufb01 cial language, they could look to partnering with churches, NGOs and the media to disseminate the information in a more \u201cdigestible\u201d format. However, there will be challenges to be overcome.

Notably, the relatively high cost of ICT connections is a huge factor, especially with the cost of acquiring and setting up communication satellites. The issue of monopolies providing essential ICT services also adds another dimension in terms of whose interest is being served and costs involved in delivering services. Throughout the Paci\ufb01 c, over time IT systems need to be utilized more effectively to reach the people. There is a need to be creative in the dissemination of information to the public. 27 VI. WHERE TO FROM HERE? At the conclusion of the Workshop, participants endorsed an Outcomes Statement which endorsed freedom of information as an important tool for empowering Paci\ufb01 c people to engage in their own development as equal partners with their governments (see Annex 1). FIC participants were also requested to complete Feedback & Follow-up Forms to identify their ongoing needs. The Workshop discussions and subsequent feedback identi\ufb01 ed the following key priorities for follow up: The majority of participants identi\ufb01 ed that further awareness-raising and capacity development activities would need to be run at the national level with policy-makers and/or the public, most likely through local or national workshops. It will be important to bring in key line ministries and integrity agencies, as well as civil society to broaden domestic commitment to FOI in principle, in order to strengthen support for the development, implementation and utilization of an FOI law; It was suggested that the Workshop participants themselves, as well as other Paci\ufb01 c or even international FOI advocates could be used to build and develop a cadre of FOI champions within the Paci\ufb01 c who can advocate for FOI to other Paci\ufb01 c island countries. Paci\ufb01 c-Paci\ufb01 c exchanges would also be valuable helping each other. Some participants identi\ufb01 ed that they were already be keen to draw on technical assistance to support the development of Cabinet submissions and/or FOI legislation. Speci\ufb01 c national requests for assistance will be directed to PIFS; All participants commented very favourably on the useful contribution from the resource person from Cayman Islands, as they found her practical experiences from a Small Island State particularly relevant to their own settings. Consideration could be given to utilising similar types of resource people in future, from the Caribbean and/or other small island states to support the regional experts; 28 As the only FIC to enact an FOI law, Cook Islands identi\ufb01 ed that they could utilise external technical assistance to support implementation, but it was important that such assistance was coordinated if it was to be effective. It was suggested that consideration could be given to PIFS undertaking such a coordination role; It was suggested that to keep momentum strong and to capture lessons learned regarding the practicalities of developing and implementing FOI legislation, a \u2018Paci\ufb01 c FOI information-sharing network\u2019 and/or other such experience-sharing mechanisms could be developed, perhaps facilitated by PIFS. In the meantime, the UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre Legislative Strengthening Expert has already started an informal email network to share FOI information which may develop into something stronger over time; PIFS and the UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre are committed to responding to FIC participants\u2019 feedback and identi\ufb01 ed needs, and will develop an ongoing programme of support and technical assistance to FICs in support of the Paci\ufb01 c Plan to promote the development of effective freedom of information regimes in the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e298f4b-1601-4360-b01a-bbee11317913": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e298f4b-1601-4360-b01a-bbee11317913", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Freedom of Information for Pacific Policy Makers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d36aa0dd3fce7dada58bf82b90ca70dc9351fed86bf6608fc3ae965ddd62d65f"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d90e527-6c7c-40e8-b55d-80ed942c9161", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/freedom-information-pacific-policy-makers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b09964801a1fd8f23d0c6a3420e28d137ec5fbe2ffcb55c833988f2b70126572"}}, "hash": "60d8d37e6559a86772ddd51dcaed68bae6f4248331f256ad70b32d7697092a9d", "text": "Endnotes 1 See (1) FOI Conclusions by Paci\ufb01 c Parliamentarians at http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/programs/ai/rti/news/ paci\ufb01 c_foi_2005_wshp_conclusions.pdf and (2) Report and Recommendations from Regional Workshop with Paci\ufb01 c Parliamentarians at http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/programs/ai/rti/news/2006/paci\ufb01 c_mps_wkshp_foi_ booklet_jan06.pdf 2 http://www.undppc.org.fj/user\ufb01 les/\ufb01 le/Paci\ufb01 c%20-%20Info%20Disclosure%20Toolkit%20-%20Jul-06.pdf 29 2 http://www.undppc.org.fj/user\ufb01 les/\ufb01 le/Paci\ufb01 c%20-%20Info%20Disclosure%20Toolkit%20-%20Jul-06.pdf Endnotes 1 See (1) FOI Conclusions by Paci\ufb01 c Parliamentarians at http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/programs/ai/rti/news/ paci\ufb01 c_foi_2005_wshp_conclusions.pdf and (2) Report and Recommendations from Regional Workshop with Paci\ufb01 c Parliamentarians at http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/programs/ai/rti/news/2006/paci\ufb01 c_mps_wkshp_foi_ booklet_jan06.pdf 30 30 Annex 1: Outcomes Statement \u201cREGIONAL FREEDOM OF INFORMATION WORKSHOP FOR PACIFIC POLICY-MAKERS\u201d 30 June \u2013 2 July 2008 Final Outcomes Statement Of\ufb01 cial representatives from Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, gathered in Honiara, Solomons Islands for a three-day meeting to discuss the value and relevance of freedom of information for Forum Island Countries, a milestone for implementation in the Paci\ufb01 c Plan endorsed by Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Leaders in 2005.

Participants noted the Opening Statement by the Honourable Prime Minister, Dr. Derek Sikua in support of freedom of information and how its value could contribute to the social and economic development in the region. Participants speci\ufb01 cally noted that the Prime Minister\u2019s statement committed the Government of the Solomon Islands to \u201cwork closely with the Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Secretariat and other stakeholders in considering a possible freedom of information policy and legislation that could give effect to the realisation of freedom of information \u2013 one of our fundamental human rights\u201d. PACIFIC ISLANDS FORUM SECRETARIAT 31 31 Participants acknowledged that taking steps towards freedom of information is a key milestone for enhancing good governance in the region. In supporting the implementation of freedom of information participants recognised that: Freedom of information is an important tool for empowering Paci\ufb01 c people to engage in their own development as equal partners with their governments. In the Paci\ufb01 c, freedom of information can be harnessed as a tool for promoting participatory development, strengthening democratic governance, facilitating better government service delivery, supporting decentralisation, fostering economic development, promoting public accountability and transparency, supporting responsible and effective media reporting, and promoting and protecting human rights. Governments should be encouraged to consider developing freedom of information policies, laws or regulations. Access to information policies, laws or regulations and processes need to be designed to serve the public, in urban, rural and outlying island areas and should be simple, cost-effective and user-friendly. In the absence of legislation, Governments bodies and members of the legislature should proactively and routinely disclose and disseminate more information to the public that would enhance their transparency. Governments should recognise and work with the media and non state actors as partners in developing and implementing access to information. Development partners should work with Governments and other non state actors to ensure that legislative drafting assistance is available, upon request, to support Governments that wish to develop an access to information policy, law or regulation. Development partners should work with Governments to ensure that technical assistance, funding and/or other needed resources are available, upon request, to support Governments and other national implementing bodies who are working to implement an access to information policy, law or regulation. 32 Efforts should be made to harness information and communication technologies to promote access to information for Paci\ufb01 c peoples, including the radio, internet and television. Initiatives like the information partnership being implemented by the Solomon Islands Government and People First Network provide good models for consideration by Paci\ufb01 c Governments.

It provides substantive feedback to the authors from experts in the field who were not directly involved with the work from inception. Peer reviewing not only adds credibility and objectivity to the process, it also improves or validates the quality of the final product. Having said this, how can the review process be easier and more helpful? To what extent should reviewers be critical or suggestion-oriented? How can you increase the likelihood of getting in-depth and pertinent feedback from a peer reviewer who is working with you for the first time? There are various facets to take into account, apart from the technical content, such as the structure, methodology and style of the work. The checklists here may assist the reviewer in preparing feedback to improve the quality of the document, while providing useful inputs to the authors. There is also an overall final section on administrative feedback for reviewers to offer advice on the next steps for taking the document forward. These guidelines can be used by UNDP Country Offices for most drafts of papers, studies, background research, reports and other knowledge products intended for publication. They are particularly helpful in the development of Human Development Reports and MDG Reports. For feedback and comments on this tool please contact the Human Development Report Unit through our email asiapacific.hdru@undp.org. 5 Constructive Role The peer reviewer\u2019s aim should be to provide systematic and constructive input to ensure the clarity, objectivity and substantive validity of arguments advanced by the draft document under review. The more specific and constructive reviewers are, the more useful the writer will find their inputs for the next draft. The Peer Reviewer Roles Checklist can help reviewers clarify their role and the expectations that are placed upon them. The checklist also points out ways to save time. For example, it is not necessary to spend a lot of time proofreading, say, for spelling mistakes (one or two illustrative examples will suffice to alert the author) as the document will undergo editing after feedback has been incorporated. In Table 1, the left-hand column presents examples of frequently observed pitfalls that can waste a reviewer\u2019s time and take away time from more critical inputs or slow down progress for those they are trying to assist. The examples are loosely based on actual peer reviews. The right-hand column presents ways to avoid the common mistakes. 6 Table 1: Save Your Time What Wastes Time? What Saves Time? If the reviewer points out a problem without offering a solution. e.g.) The paper is entirely gender insensitive or gender neutral and does not provide any insight into the connection between information technology and gender. If the reviewer phrases his/her feedback in a suggestion-oriented way and offers a possible solution. e.g.) It is important that the paper discuss the connection between information technology and gender. For example, women working as telemarketers in Asia could be explored as well as those working in more high tech jobs. Also, using \u2018she/he\u2019 in hypothetical situations, instead of \u2018he\u2019 would make the paper more gender sensitive. When the peer reviewer offers suggestions, but they are not specific. e.g.) The conclusion should be strengthened with even a total overhaul. When the reviewer offers very specific suggestions. e.g.) An account of policy measures for judiciaries, human rights commissions and civil society groups could be given (i.e. this could be achieved by delving into a more complete account of the technical assistance measures that have been identified and tested by the UN in the field, e.g. UNAMA). A Terms of Reference document for the peer reviewer that is unclear or ambiguous. A Terms of Reference document that clearly indicates what is required of the reviewer. 7 Peer Reviewer Roles Checklist The role of the peer reviewer is to assist writers in expressing, refining and validating their ideas. A peer reviewer should not get caught up in providing critical evaluations and extensive re-writing. Read as a reader, rather than as a critic. Describe how you react to the piece. Point out where something doesn't read well and offer specific and practical suggestions for improvement. Be constructive and offer a way forward. Having said that, a peer reviewer should also", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4cb141cd-5183-4478-a8a3-a7797663b89c": {"__data__": {"id_": "4cb141cd-5183-4478-a8a3-a7797663b89c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-most-out-feedback-peer-review-guidelines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting the Most out of Feedback: Peer Review Guidelines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-most-out-feedback-peer-review-guidelines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7cda794382ace7a623af1d03ee5502bb3aabfb313781fb244c45be2f9795bc56"}}, "hash": "7cda794382ace7a623af1d03ee5502bb3aabfb313781fb244c45be2f9795bc56", "text": "be aware of the primary audience for any work. Your role is not primarily as a proof-reader. Hence, if you notice a recurring error, do point it out, but don't spend your time repeatedly correcting typos and individual spelling, grammar, or punctuation problems. If parts of the draft seem successful as it is, do say so. There is no need to feel duty-bound to find something to criticize. 8 Overall Content and Structure There are a plethora of issues and angles to think of during the review, itself. It is essential to read a paper at least two times for a clear and useful review. Certainly, one read of the document should focus on the overall impression, content and structure. If time allows, it may also be useful to space out readings in order to let the mind of the reviewer duly \u2018digest\u2019 the issues facing the paper and to offer well thought out alternatives. Sometimes after good reading, it may be necessary to read only parts of the paper again, rather than reading it in its entirety. Table 2 presents common errors peer reviewers can make when not taking into account the bigger picture. The examples are loosely based on actual peer reviews. The right-hand column presents ways to hone in on key content and structural components. The Overall Content and Structure Checklist presents some questions that may help provide constructive critiques in as non-contentious a manner as possible. It also points out material which would help the publication support an advocacy strategy (e.g. a clear main point, message or concrete recommendations). Of course, specifics will vary across publications. Table 2: Speed Progress What Slows Progress? What Speeds Progress? The reviewer focusing nearly exclusively on small details without also looking at the greater point of the document and what makes it new. When the reviewer adds a comment. e.g.) The paper should build on its mention of a judicial system with integrity that commands the confidence of the people and offer fresh insights into the age-old problem: \u201cwho will guard the guardians?\u201d The reviewer does not look at important structural components that could be merged, shifted or added. The peer reviewer provides suggestions on additional components that would be useful. e.g.) A box on high-level corruption exposed by the media in the region would be of considerable utility to us. A box on the limits of the press in the fight against corruption would also be useful (e.g. the absence/existence of FOI legislation, the absence/existence of whistleblowers legislation in a country etc). The reviewer gives feedback a little bit at a time or over a relatively long period. Depending upon the content of the paper, the reviewer provides all the feedback at once. 9 Overall Content and Structure Checklist Can the reviewer easily identify the main idea(s) and argument(s)? A good test is whether the reviewer would feel confident explaining the argument and ideas of the piece to others. Does the writer end with a synthesis and conclusion which address all issues brought up in the piece, bringing them to a logical end? Does the work add innovation or something new to the issue which the reviewer was not aware of prior to reading? Are any parts of the draft unclear or counterintuitive? Do arguments repeat without just cause? Does the paper's structure allow evidence and information to be presented in a logical and convincing manner? Do some points need to be more thoroughly illustrated or dropped due to lack of relevance? Do annex tables (if there are any) add to the paper? Do they support the argument in the paper? Are they necessary? Is some information too detailed? Are concrete solutions or recommendations evident and offered with specific reference to empirical support from the body of the piece? How can the author improve upon any of the points raised above? In other words, what are some helpful suggestions for them? 10 Style Readers can cast aside even the most logical methodology and compelling point if they are buried in a confusing style. Therefore, ensuring a crisp, consistent and reasonable flow is vital. So is a mode of writing which is tailored to the primary audience, whether they are policy makers, academics, or civil society groups. If a reviewer finds that he or she does not have the capacity to understand technical information for a specific audience, it could be flagged for consultation with the author.

Accurate referencing takes time; the more careful an author is, the easier it becomes for the intended audience. To help streamline the process of finalising the publication, peer reviewers can point out major gaps or frequent inconsistencies in citations that authors can fix. Table 3 shows ways peer reviewers can often loose time when critiquing style. The examples are based on actual peer reviews, while the changes the peer reviewer made are marked in red.

When the peer reviewer simply gives the suggestion. [Comment: Improve flow of sentences throughout, such as the one found on page 3, para 2, line 2.] 11 Style Checklist Do the style, diction, and point of view seem appropriate to; (a) the kind of idea that is being considered, and (b) the expected audience? Is the writing and layout clear and unambiguous? (If not, give specific guidance for rewriting). Does the writing flow easily? Does the reviewer feel lost at any point, if so where? Is the data presented easily understood and visually appealing (e.g. through tables, figures, graphs)? Does the reviewer see any recurring language which is too formal, informal or incorrect? Are there any recurring errors you notice in terms of punctuation, grammar or run-on sentences? Does the style conform to UNDP standards/guidelines? Are font, sub-section and graphic styles consistent? Do the big messages of the paper come out clearly? 12 Methodology Checklist Is the quantitative or qualitative methodology thoroughly explained? Have the writers used a logical methodological model? If so, have they followed it well? Have the writers given an accurate and objective interpretation of the literature or data? Have the writers used enough sources? Are they up-to-date? Have the writers used sources that cover the breadth of the specific subject being discussed? Are there any archetypal writers or theories which the writer must take into account for credibility issues? Are the sources relevant to the topic being discussed? Have the authors used an appropriate degree of qualitative and quantitative methods? Have sources of error been accounted for/explained clearly, especially in a second peer review? Do data and analysis highlight issues affecting economically, politically and socially excluded groups, depending on the paper? How consistently is the methodology used throughout the paper? Methodology Sound methodology is pivotal to the credibility of a given document and the UNDP as a whole. The Methodology Checklist can help reviewers cover the various aspects of sources and other methodological components. 13 Administrative Feedback Three options are suggested when giving administrative feedback. Reviewers may give a final conclusion from one of the following: 1) The document should be accepted, no revisions are necessary. 2) The document should be accepted with revisions as indicated. 3) The document should not be accepted. If the reviewer feels the draft should not be accepted as it now stands, please state what changes might be required to make it acceptable. Please be specific and constructive. 14 Annexure I UNDP Peer Review System for National Human Development Reports1 What is a Peer Review? Peer Reviews are a common practice in the academic and scientific communities as a process to ensure objectivity and assure quality in research and publications. In many cases, they are also valuable to ensure consistency within the field of research or publication and to contribute to greater prestige. Within the context of UNDP's work as a policy advisory institution, and given the value of NHDRs as tools to engage national counterparts in policy dialogue, it is increasingly important that these NHDRs become credible and influential publications. UNDP\u2019s Corporate Policy on NHDRs, approved by the Executive Team in March 2000, calls for more effective support within UNDP and the UN in general to raise the quality", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c22edeb-df92-4ad1-b3d6-38e6c3eaf9dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c22edeb-df92-4ad1-b3d6-38e6c3eaf9dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-most-out-feedback-peer-review-guidelines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting the Most out of Feedback: Peer Review Guidelines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-most-out-feedback-peer-review-guidelines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23e7caed6ff45fed48a1c4a1b82a7dfd5c9ad80e764647d3f0e49d84a2835f48"}}, "hash": "23e7caed6ff45fed48a1c4a1b82a7dfd5c9ad80e764647d3f0e49d84a2835f48", "text": "of NHDRs. In light of all the above, the establishment of a mandatory Peer Review system is one critical mechanism in these efforts. The following NHDR Peer Review System whereby Country Offices circulate each NHDR for comments and feedback prior to finalization, is external to the preparation process, and as such, does not replace the managerial and supervisory functions of the process. It is simply a review at the final stages of the process, conducted by \u2018peers\u2019, equivalent in competence and expertise to members of the national team. The NHDR Peer Review process is based on the existing experience of many NHDRs, where reviews are already being conducted. Some examples include: (i) RBEC whereby a process of quality control is carried out through the Regional HD Adviser, (ii) RBLAC and RBA which draw on the expertise of NHDR teams to help teams in other countries, (iii) the global NHDR SURF Network where comments to informal submission of drafts are made, and other existing mechanisms. This Peer Review Process is also based largely on consultations and discussions over the last year on the RRNet, during the June 2000 Beirut Retreat, and among BDP and Regional Bureaux NHDR focal points at HQ and the HDRO Director. 1 From UNDP. 2002. Peer Review System. Available online [http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/peer_review_system.pdf ]. Last accessed on 5 February 2008. 15 Principal Characteristics of a Peer Review Process I. COUNTRY OFFICE RESPONSIBILITY It is ultimately the responsibility of the UNDP Country Office, under the leadership of the Resident Representative, to conduct peer reviews. It is up to each office to determine the role played by the NHDR team in the process. However, since ultimately the responsibility for the NHDR content is that of the national editorial team, they should be given flexibility to participate in the choice and briefing of reviewers. By definition, NHDRs must be nationally owned and undertaken through a nationally driven process. A peer review should not interfere with this key objective of ownership. \u201cPeers\u201d should be those who will support this process. At the same time, since NHDRs are an important part of UNDP's corporate identity, UNDP Country Offices must take steps to exercise quality control. The fine line between independence and quality control should be navigated with care and with the best of intentions. It is in everyone\u2019s interest to produce a high quality report. II. COUNTRY SPECIFICITY In order to ensure maximum usefulness of the Peer Review System, the process must be systematic, but allow maximum flexibility in order to accommodate differing country contexts. In discussions on the value of a peer review, many concerns have arisen, especially regarding cases where the team is not convinced of the utility of the comments, or the reviewer was not fully sensitive to the country context. The overall purpose of these reviews is to contribute to improving the quality of the final product. An excellent review by a well-chosen reviewer can bring a fresh and objective point of view and make valuable, concrete recommendations to raise the Report\u2019s quality. Ultimately, the responsibility of evaluating and adopting the recommendations falls to the national team. In order to contribute to the success of the peer review, the reviewer must be furnished with the NHDR Corporate Policy, Terms of Reference for the NDHR, information on the report\u2019s intended target audience and any other information that will result in a review that contributes to a high quality NHDR. III. TIMING Timing of a peer review is crucial. At the early stages, it is useful to circulate outlines and early drafts among those with expertise in specific areas, for inputs on a voluntary basis. But at this early stage, while the comments may be useful to set the NHDR on the right path, the report as a whole is not yet in a position to be reviewed by an external reviewer. Reviewing just prior to publication is also not useful, as the review may call for changes that cannot be accommodated in time. 16 Therefore, the peer review process must be carried out at the stage when a draft of the entire Report is available, approximately 1-2 months before it is to be printed. This allows sufficient time for incorporating relevant recommendations into the report. IV. SELECTION OF REVIEWERS: A peer review must include 2-3 reviewers, with at least one reviewer not a UNDP staff member, and at least one reviewer being from outside the country of the NHDR. (In the case of a regional report, this does not apply.) Reviewers cannot include those who have authored or been main contributors to the NHDR. Reviewers must be carefully selected", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b4e2d17-0465-40e9-95a3-a478b485f8be": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b4e2d17-0465-40e9-95a3-a478b485f8be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-most-out-feedback-peer-review-guidelines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting the Most out of Feedback: Peer Review Guidelines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-most-out-feedback-peer-review-guidelines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "786d556a27de108a1af52d9540736bd333155aa3264cd70a700fa9c7d34b530d"}, "3": {"node_id": "b11faee9-905f-4e9b-a807-e891f0d94abe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-most-out-feedback-peer-review-guidelines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44e56c66cd1c3d10186d174540ad4908d9f4b9cbcabaadfaff4bc92741cce6db"}}, "hash": "436baf7e03d4590dc9b70c832418cd834bab2975539460de96e951f3c1db9775", "text": "for their expertise and understanding of the country context, and invited to review as part of a small, select group that the team is depending on to contribute to the quality of the Report. Reviewers could be drawn from a wide range of sources, including but not restricted to: the academic community, research institutes, BDP Policy Advisers, NHDR team members from other countries, Regional Bureau officers, civil society organisations, Human Development Report Office specialists, United Nations experts and government officials. While the selection of reviewers is up to the Country Office, the ability of this process to work on a systematic basis will depend on cooperation and direct help from many parts of UNDP. The NHDR Unit is preparing of a Roster of Consultants/Peer Reviewers, organised along geographic and thematic areas of expertise. This will soon be available to all NHDR teams and will include curriculum vitae\u2019s and contact information for references from previous reviews undertaken. Teams can also solicit voluntary reviewers through the SURF NHDR Network, with whom they can then formalize an arrangement. An extensive set of sample Terms of Reference has been collected by the NHDR Unit and is now available at http://hdr.undp.org/reports/intranet/country_docs.cfm NHDR teams from one country can be optimal \u201cpeers\u201d for national teams in the same region due to their familiarity with the language and the regional context. Widening the pool of those contributing to NHDRs can have many other benefits as well. It can contribute to greater exchange of human development knowledge across regions, to building greater capacity in the long run for policy analysis and can build wider ownership for mobilization of human development policy actions. For UNDP staff, it will strengthen their capacity to provide advisory services. 17 V. CONTENT Peer reviews should be based on the six NHDR corporate principles. These six principles (national ownership, independence of analysis, quality of analysis, participatory and transparent preparation process, creative presentation and sustained follow up), drawn from the UNDP Corporate Policy on NHDRs, were designed on the basis of the experiences of over 340 NHDRs. These principles address overall quality of the analysis contained in the reports, whether it is based on objective research, the relevance of that analysis to the country and region, and the effectiveness of the NHDR as an advocacy document. When considering the sixth corporate principles on \u201csustained follow-up\u201d, it is important for reviewers to assess the impacts of previous NHDRs. External reviewers can bring added value in terms of some or all of those areas. In addition to the Corporate Policy (available in E/F/S/A/R at http://hdr.undp.org/aboutus/nhdr/policy.cfm), there are several other pieces of information that should be provided to reviewers. Since not all NHDRs serve the same purpose, the reviewer should be provided the Terms of Reference of the NHDR process, information on the context of preparation (capacity at the national level, involvement of the UNDP office, availability of statistics, involvement of the government, etc) and the intended audience. VI. INCENTIVES NHDR production is a complex process requiring political and operational support at all levels. Optimally, a peer review should be a voluntary system of exchanges. However, at present, the built-in incentives are not sufficiently strong, either within or outside of UNDP, for a smoothly working system of reviews. Much of this support still needs to be negotiated, and the NHDR Unit is committed to assisting in this process. Regional Centres and BDP specialists are available to respond to requests for support from Country Offices as part of their technical backstopping role. Their contribution to NHDR reviews should be rewarded in their performance assessment. For other UNDP Programme Officers and specialists, this type of policy advice is in line with UNDP\u2019s core business, where these skills are increasingly valued and participation in knowledge networks and across offices and regions is being encouraged to build this capacity. In addition, staff members\u2019 RCA should reflect this contribution.

INTRODUCTION The 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness sets out to accomplish a major shift in the way development assistance is provided. Its core principles \u2013 ownership, alignment, harmonisation, managing for results and mutual accountability \u2013 are easy to state, but add up to a radical change for both donors and partner countries. The 3rd High-Level Forum in Accra in September 2008 is an opportunity to take stock of how far the reality of aid has changed in response to these principles. In preparation, a great amount of research and analysis is underway to assess the extent of behaviour change, to identify obstacles and to set the implementation priorities for the coming period. This information portal is designed to help governments in the Asia and the Pacific region to prepare for and contribute to the Accra debates. From our review of the literature, it would seem that many of the countries in Asia and the Pacific have not been always very active in international debates on aid effectiveness. It may be that some take the view that the region is simply too diverse for a single aid paradigm; others may consider that the Paris Declaration reflects the experience of European donors in Africa, and is less relevant to Asia and the Pacific. In fact, all recipients of ODA have a great deal to gain from the aid-effectiveness agenda. The Paris Declaration is a tool that all governments can use to maximise the value of their ODA. However, they need to engage with the agenda to maximise the benefits. This information portal offers: \uf0b7 an introduction to the issues likely to be debated at Accra; \uf0b7 brief descriptions of the current evidence and available literature which informs those debates, highlighting literature on Asia-Pacific countries; \uf0b7 information about on-going workstreams in preparation for Accra; \uf0b7 information and links on where to go for further information.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebb8b822-23b0-41f8-8ae2-1d61c7ec50a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ebb8b822-23b0-41f8-8ae2-1d61c7ec50a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting to Accra Information Portal on Aid Effectiveness for the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "91c76544d7038b134c901fe2c660f0d29b14309e9245648376473a4d6f891f56"}, "2": {"node_id": "92a80594-dac7-4f4b-a724-73d196167c1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf29cb05ef9a551f34c58bb99dfb3e65954c3247fcb757ac228deace5a7c213a"}}, "hash": "9f0d1083992ee225b0ba6167b4f210144e7d3854483dc7c7f01e3c3ad0107769", "text": "\uf0b7 Provocative questions and challenges for developing more analysis and evidence The first part of the portal is organised according to the nine roundtable topics provisionally on the agenda for Accra, together with cross-cutting themes: i) Country ownership ii) Alignment iii) Harmonisation iv) Managing for results v) Mutual accountability vi) Civil society and aid effectiveness vii) Aid effectiveness in fragile states viii) Health as a \u201etracer sector\u201f ix) The international aid architecture.

The principle of ownership means tailoring external assignment towards helping partners countries achieve their own development objectives. It recognises that policies and institutions for development will be effective only so far as they emerge out of genuinely country-led processes. The Paris Declaration commitments on country ownership include: \uf0b7 Partner countries exercise leadership in developing and implementing their national development strategies through broad consultative processes, and translate them into prioritised, results-oriented operational programmes. \uf0b7 Donors respect partner country leadership and help strengthen their capacity to exercise it. There are likely to be three main issues for debate in this Roundtable: i) National development strategies/PRSPs: How effective are national development strategies? Are partner countries able to produce realistic, prioritised strategies, and implement them systematically? ii) Participation: How broad is country ownership of national development strategies? Does it extend across government, horizontally and vertically? Does it include parliaments, civil society and citizens? iii) Conditionality: Have donors changed their practices on conditionality to respect country ownership? 1.1 National development strategies/PRSPs The PRSP initiative was launched in September 1999 as a condition for debt relief and concessional lending from the World Bank and IMF. It was based on the Bank\u201fs four CDF principles: (i) long-term, holistic vision; (ii) country ownership; (iii) country-led partnership; (iv) results focus. Countries were given detailed guidelines for preparing PRSPs in the World Bank\u201fs PRSP Sourcebook. From the outset, many observers pointed out the contradiction of using external conditionality to compel the production of a country-owned strategy. Many questioned whether the first generation of PRSPs were genuinely country owned. Furthermore, producing a comprehensive PRSP, based on realistic priorities and linked to the budget process, was an extremely ambitious undertaking for most developing countries. Some feared that PRSPs would become nothing more than wish lists of development projects. Now that many countries have produced a second- or even third-generation PRSP, however, the nature of the debate has changed. In countries like Vietnam, the principles of the PRSP have been incorporated into the regular planning process. Donors have become less directive as to the form and content of national development strategies, to Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 4 encourage greater country ownership. However, there are still questions as to how effective the approach has been in many countries. The first three documents present the views of the PRSP initiative\u201fs original sponsor, the World Bank. World Bank, \u201cResults-Based National Development Strategies\u201d, draft, October 2007 In 2006, the World Bank conducted 62 country-level Aid Effectiveness Reviews, which were used to set the baseline for the first Paris Declaration indicator: \u201cPartners have operational development strategies\u201d. The individual country reports can be found here. They are desk reviews based on existing literature, but provide a useful overview of aid- effectiveness initiatives in each country. This draft report is a summary of the reviews. The assessment as to whether a country has an operational development strategy is based on 3 criteria: a unified strategic framework; prioritisation within that framework, and a strategic link to the budget. While all 62 countries were found to have made some progress, only 8 satisfied all three criteria, suggesting that Paris Declaration 2010 target (75 percent of partner countries with largely developed operational development strategies) is some way off being achieved. Establishing a link between the strategy and the budget remains difficult for most countries, leading in turn to poorly prioritised strategies. Many countries still have multiple, parallel development strategies. The report notes that holistic development strategies should address cross- cutting issues like gender, HIV-AIDS and the environment. IMF and World Bank, \u201c2005 Review of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Approach \u2013 Balancing Accountabilities and Scaling Up Results\u201d, August 2005 This is an internal review of the PRSP approach carried out jointly by WB and IMF staff. It is a broadly positive assessment, suggesting that PRSPs have brought about a \u201cfundamental change\u201d in the relationship between low-income countries and donors. It found that while most PRSPs contained good qualitative and quantitative analysis of poverty, it was often hard to link that analysis to the policies selected.

It provides a more cautious assessment, finding considerable variation in the value of the initiative across different countries. It concluded: \u201cThe [PRSP] Initiative has added the most value in countries where government leadership and aid management processes were already strong. It has had less effect in countries with weak public sector capacity or with donor-dominated aid relationships\u2026 Where the government-donor dialogue was previously weak or donors continued to drive the agenda, PRSPs by themselves have not noticeably promoted donor coordination or increased government management of external assistance.\u201d It found that ownership of the PRSP was strong among government agencies directly involved in its preparation, but faded across line ministries and sub-national government. Importantly, it found that some countries had included policies they thought donors expected to see, including an overall emphasis on the social over the productive sectors. The evaluation called for strengthening analytical underpinnings, growth policies and Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 5 results focus. It found that, while the Bank had generally aligned its support to PRSPs, this had not involved much change in the content of its Country Assistance Strategies. Independent assessments of the PRSP initiative during the early years tended to be quite critical, suggesting that the approach was structural adjustment in a new guise, and that countries were preparing PRSPs merely to satisfy donor conditions. More recent literature, however, acknowledges that the initiative is beginning to make significant changes to national planning processes, although many practical challenges remain. Driscoll, Ruth with Alison Evans, \u201cSecond-generation Poverty Reduction Strategies: new opportunities and emerging issues\u201d, Development Policy Review, Issue 23(1), 2005 This review by the United Kingdom\u201fs official development think tank, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), concluded that the PRSP has begun to escape from its origins in HIPC and IFI conditionality, and become genuinely country owned. It found that second-generation strategies were more comprehensive and multi-sectoral, and have triggered a genuine shift in expenditure towards poverty reduction in health, education and transport. They had opened up the policy process and enabled civil society to engage in policy debates \u201con an unprecedented scale\u201d. However, it also noted the tendency of PRSP units to act as \u201cenclaves\u201d within government, and for ownership to be limited to core central ministries. The lack of budget links had resulted in poor costing and prioritisation, while weaknesses in public-financial management systems made the strategies difficult to implement. While donors were making genuine efforts to align with PRSPs, it found that this was often a pro forma process of reformulating existing policies in PRSP language. It found that too much assistance was still provided off the budget, and was fragmented across too many sectors, programmes and projects. Oxfam International, \u201cFrom \u201edonorship\u201f to ownership? Moving towards PRSP Round Two\u201d, Oxfam Briefing Paper, January 2004 Oxfam found that the PRSP initiatives had been disappointing in both process and content. It found that donors still wield too much control over policy content, through \u201cbackstage conditionality\u201d. It found that macroeconomic policies are still dictated by the IFIs, and are \u201cantipathetic to the interests of poor people\u201d. It found that PRSP content was limited to social-sector spending projects, with little discussion of key policy areas such as trade.

It analyses problems such as weak budget classification, which prevents agencies from matching their spending to PRS priorities, poor reporting on budget execution, and the difficulties of monitoring the impact of expenditure on poverty reduction. It notes that, where government lacks the capacity to execute budgets as planned, there is little chance of holding them to account for development results.

Ownership should be as broadly based as possible, with citizens participating in the formulation, implementation and monitoring of national development strategies through democratic processes and civil society. Participation, however, is a difficult quality to measure. Most PRSP countries have gone to some trouble to organise consultation across social groups and parts of the country. In many cases, however, this was an ad hoc process that fell away as soon as the PRSP had been adopted. To what extent has the PRSP initiative increased the openness of government as a whole? There is no consensus in the literature on this point. Early reviews of the PRSP initiative tended to conclude that participation in PRSP formulation had been artificial and Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 7 unsustainable. Some influential international NGOs continue to take that view. However, many Southern NGOs have acknowledged that the PRSP initiative has opened up new opportunities for them to participate in the setting of development policy. Academic commentators have criticised donors for their \u201eapolitical\u201f and even \u201ena\u00efve\u201f understanding of participation. David Booth, \u201cMissing links in the politics of development: learning from the PRSP experiment\u201d, ODI Working Paper 256, October 2005 ODI\u201fs David Booth is one of the leading academic commentators on the politics of development. He points out the dilemma for donors: effective participation is a function of healthy, democratic political processes, which by their nature cannot be \u201eengineered\u201f by external actors. He concludes that the theory that more participatory policy processes will be more effective has proved to be \u201cna\u00efve\u201d. His studies of the political economy of LICs suggest that real decisions on resource allocation are taken behind the scenes by small groups of politicians, and that formal policy processes are largely \u201cwindow dressing\u201d.

It argues that participation should not be \u201eprojectised\u201f as an ad hoc series of consultations during PRSP formulation, but should be institutionalised in the regular policy-making and budget processes. Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 8 ActionAid, \u201cRethinking participation: questions for civil society about the limits of participation in PRSPs\u201d, April 2004 ActionAid charges that participation has been limited to narrowly defined \u201epoverty reduction\u201f issues, namely spending priorities in health and education. Civil society has been excluded from discussion of controversial subjects such as industrial policy, trade, fiscal policy, price supports, regulation of foreign investment and interest rates, which are ultimately more important for poverty reduction. It argues that the IFIs continue to narrow the space for domestic policy by imposing restrictive macroeconomic policies. Practical guidance for strengthening participation can be found in these documents. Masud Mozammel and Sina Odugbemi, \u201cWith the support of multitudes: using strategic communication to fight poverty through PRSPs\u201d, World Bank, 2005 This World Bank publication makes a strong case for the importance of strategic communications to support the development process. Strategic communications are planned, deliberate and long-term, not ad hoc and reactive. They involve opening up the development policy process, ensuring free flow of information to opinion makers in society, using the mass media for foster debate, and using communications to boost awareness of national development strategies. The book contains useful examples of good communications practices from around the world, including from the Kyrgyz Republic, Cambodia and Pakistan. A follow-up book is to be released in 2008. Scott Hubli and Alicia Mandaville, \u201cParliaments and the PRSP process\u201d, World Bank Institute Working Paper, 2004 This is one of many reports concluding that parliamentary involvement in the PRPS process has been weak, and that this limits prospects for effective implementation. The document goes through the PRSP preparation, implementation and monitoring cycle, suggesting numerous points at which parliament could be better engaged. 1.3 Conditionality The principle of ownership means that donors should no longer try to dictate development policy through conditionality. Under the Paris Declaration, they commit to drawing their conditions, where possible, from a partner\u201fs own national development strategy, and imposing additional conditions only where clearly justified. In addition, donors should as far as possible use the partner country\u201fs own performance assessment framework to assess progress against the national development plan. Donor practice on conditionality is not covered by the Paris Declaration monitoring process, and there are at present no overall assessments of donor performance. However, individual donor practices are addressed in the DAC Peer Reviews. In preparation for Accra, a report is being prepared drawing together lessons from the 14 DAC Peer Reviews completed since adoption of the Paris Declaration. Conditionality is also one of the themes for the OECD\u201fs Global Forum on Development, a body which encourages dialogue between DAC and non-OECD governments and civil society.

Process-based conditions (e.g., on participation) are considered more legitimate, but there is considerable doubt about their effectiveness. Some argue that they lead to a box-ticking approach to participation. There is more consensus on performance-based conditionality, where the level of disbursement is linked to achievement against an agreed set of indicators drawn from the country\u201fs national development strategy, although allowance must be made for the effect of external shocks. The DAC website contains background papers produced for this event, including reports from Vietnam, Indonesia and Bangladesh. A number of donors have introduced new conditionality policies to reflect the Paris Declaration, including the World Bank. World Bank, \u201cReview of World Bank conditionality\u201d, September 2005 This report documents the World Bank\u201fs changing approach to conditionality in recent years, from an emphasis on policies for structural adjustment and growth, to a set of benchmarks designed to assess its borrowers\u201f commitment to their own development programmes. On principle, the Bank no longer uses conditionality to prescribe policies. The flip side is that the Bank should be more selective in its operations, engaging only where it sees clear evidence of prior commitment from the partner. In that way, the Bank sees its conditionality policy as contributing to, rather than detracting from, country ownership. It sets out five good practice principles for conditionality: ownership; harmonisation; criticality; transparency; and predictability. Other commentators contest this interpretation of the World Bank\u201fs practice. Some of the civil society articles cited above suggest that the Bank and the IMF still impose structural adjustment measures through their lending activities. Others suggest that the Bank has other ways of dictating country policy. ActionAid, \u201cWhat progress? A shadow review of World Bank conditionality\u201d, 2006 This report reviews the World Bank against its 2005 conditionality review and good practice principles. It claims that the Bank has no implementation plan in place to ensure compliance with its policies, and that staff incentives still encourage the use of intrusive conditionality. It has a superficial approach towards country ownership, and still uses loan conditions to push controversial economic reforms. Harmonisation in practice means that other donors link their conditions to the Bank\u201fs PRSC, rather than all donors linking to the national development plan. Wilks, Alex & Fabien Lefrancois, \u201cBlinding with science or encouraging debate? How World Bank analysis determines PRSP policies\u201d, 2002 This article argues that the World Bank no longer has to rely on policy conditionality, because it is winning the policy debates upstream through its \u201cnear monopoly on development analysis\u201d. It argues that the Bank and the IMF \u201coften give the impression that there is consensus on the development agenda, and that only details remain to be worked out.\u201d \u201cThe Bank constantly talks about capacity-building and listening, but seems reluctant to cede control of policy formulation processes or to recognise contributions or perspectives that diverge markedly from core Washington thinking\u2026 Indeed, the Bank often appears to imply that there is a vacuum out there that it needs to fill: that few others are doing serious policy analysis.\u201d Despite its commitment on principle to move away from one-size-fits-all development policies, in practice the Bank still acts as if there is a single, right answer to development challenges, making it averse to experimentation and debate. Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 10 Graham Bird and Thomas Willett, \u201cIMF conditionality, implementation and the new political economy of ownership\u201d, Comparative Economic Studies, Vol. 46(3), 2004 Along similar lines, Bird and Willett argue that the IMF has a perverse understanding of country ownership. IMF asserts that it uses conditionality to reinforce, rather than substitute for, national ownership, by acting as a \u201ccommitment device\u201d, helping to strengthen the hand of reformers and sustain support during implementation. However, if national ownership is solid, then conditionality is not needed, and if it is not solid, then conditionality is unlikely to succeed.

Given the great diversity of development challenges across the Asia- Pacific region \u2013 from microstates to world\u201fs most populous countries, from low income to rapidly industrialising countries, from conflict-torn states to one-party systems \u2013 there is a real need for more textured analysis on national development planning. \uf0b7 How has the PRSP initiative been adapted across the Asia-Pacific? Has it demonstrated its relevance as a tool for donor alignment? Are donors providing sufficient space for different planning traditions and capacities? \uf0b7 What does participation mean in the Asia-Pacific context? Are there specifically Asian models of grass-roots democracy and stakeholder engagement that can help inform global debates on country ownership? \uf0b7 How do Asian countries organise policy dialogue in a post-conditionality world?

Alignment The principle of alignment emerged as a corrective to two aspects of past aid practice that came under sustained criticism during the 1990s: the tendency of donors to try to dictate policies to developing countries; and the use of project modalities to bypass weak country systems. The failure of structural adjustment programmes in the 1990s proved that, where policy initiatives were developed by foreigners and signed off on by governments solely to access finance, they were rarely implemented effectively or sustained over time. Under the Paris Declaration, donors commit to basing their support on the partner\u201fs own development strategies. Traditionally, when confronted with weak capacity in a beneficiary administration, donors have created Project Implementation Units under their own direct control, to create an acceptable fiduciary environment for their assistance. However, capacity built up in PIUs is rarely transferred back into government. The short-term efficiency gains of bypassing government systems comes at the cost of a missed opportunity to build up the institutions and capacity required to replicate the project results over the longer term.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "668bef2a-1b4e-4577-aea6-ab2a1095ae83": {"__data__": {"id_": "668bef2a-1b4e-4577-aea6-ab2a1095ae83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting to Accra Information Portal on Aid Effectiveness for the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d72da2c03b31abd56d7f717405fd15e6d21fd3c8d0cc41ce300450c4c4211d8b"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c6ac78d-7e67-4a99-9b72-bd978235561d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1cdfb7a34fabed52b7d01f76d41db0d3a35436f393f87bb4a330095338a000bb"}}, "hash": "99f22621cb78713388998ee7f28531c970d8442cd67db7300a9f9698a52de4d1", "text": "Under the Paris Declaration, donors are now committed to phasing out PIUs and using government systems as far as possible to deliver their assistance At Accra, this Roundtable is likely to focus on a number of issues: i) Programme-based approaches: The experience in using programmatic assistance, including budget support, SWAps and similar arrangements, to increase alignment with country policies and systems; ii) Use of country systems: The experience of donors in using of country systems for aid", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbdfd5df-bf87-46ee-9781-185acde13e17": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbdfd5df-bf87-46ee-9781-185acde13e17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting to Accra Information Portal on Aid Effectiveness for the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac15f38413af1704ba704a3c83d0ed1fb8aea2eb32deff1a459f7a155de99858"}, "3": {"node_id": "b3809c36-f459-425e-b5ea-e5a9d4ec6238", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cded5e049b1618913100b1c141fa56a7dca9b7d6c903fea32d3b77f9fba23926"}}, "hash": "b88b1946806e8471e4307a3c1b9a0104c84ef16485935cde23b18110a04ceafc", "text": "delivery; iii) Capacity building: Progress on capacity building on country systems, and the effectiveness of technical assistance; iv) Predictability: The predictability of ODA, and reflecting ODA on the budget; v) Untying of aid. 2.1 Programmatic assistance Most donors now routinely relate their country assistance plans to their partners\u201f national development strategies. In most cases, however, this does not involved much change to the content of donor programmes. National development strategies tend to be broad enough to encompass most donor preferences. The more challenging side of alignment is the move towards programmatic forms of assistance. Traditionally, aid has been fragmented across too many small projects, which are difficult for partners to coordinate and end up becoming donor driven. To try to make development assistance more strategic, the Paris Declaration sets a target of 66% of aid flows to be provided in the context of programme-based approaches (PBAs). The official definition of PBA is contained in the following DAC publication. However, the definition is notoriously difficult to apply, and there are doubts as to the accuracy of the DAC baseline figure set in 2006. Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 13 OECD DAC, \u201cHarmonising donor practices for effective aid delivery: Vol. 2 \u2013 Budget support, sector-wide approaches and capacity development in public financial management\u201d, 2006 This is one of a series of good practice papers produced by the DAC to guide donors. It defines PBAs as having the following features: (a) leadership by the partner country; (b) a single comprehensive programme and budget framework; (c) a formalised process for donor co-ordination and harmonisation of donor procedures for reporting, budgeting, financial management and procurement; (d) efforts to increase the use of local systems for programme design and implementation, financial management, monitoring and evaluation. As well as increasing country ownership, PBAs are designed to increase the coherence between sectoral policy, spending and results, strengthen national capacity and reduce transaction costs, by anchoring assistance in an agreed, overall programme of action. It stresses that a PBA are not a particular aid modality, but an approach that can encompass projects, technical assistance or budget support. OECD DAC, \u201c2006 Survey on monitoring the Paris Declaration: Overview of the results\u201d, 2007 The survey revealed that PBA was one of the most problematic indicators to apply. The DAC itself understands the term as \u201cfairly restrictive\u201d, covering budget support, SWAps and \u201cother arrangements in which there are equivalent efforts towards joint planning and harmonisation of procedures\u201d. However, for the 2006 survey, many donors insisted on a looser definition. The survey revealed a baseline of 43%, but the real figure is likely to be substantially lower. On the whole, however, it found a strong trend towards the adoption of both budget support and SWAp-type arrangements, especially in the social sectors. Marcus Cox, Samuel Wangwe, Hisaaki Mitsui and Tran Thi Hanh, \u201cIndependent Monitoring Report on implementation of the Hanoi Core Statement\u201d, Hanoi, November 2007 This recent independent monitoring of aid effectiveness in Vietnam argues that moving towards PBAs is a key strategic priority, not just for increasing donor harmonisation, but also for overcoming Vietnam\u201fs legacy of scattered project aid and ensuring that donor assistance is as strategic as possible. PBAs provide a framework through which government and donors can agree on key priorities, and programme both national and ODA resources coherently to achieve them. However, effective PBAs need to evolve over time. Ministries need to develop the capacity to articulate clear priorities and preferred approaches, and to lead on aid management and capacity development. Effective alignment of donor assistance involves in parallel with greater sectoral capacity. The report also contains a discussion of the dilemmas that the PBA target can cause. Vietnam has set its own target of 75% PBAs. However, the government has also expressed a preference for more than half of its ODA to be provided for large infrastructure projects, which are traditionally delivered in project form. Donors and government are unclear as to whether they should broaden the definition of PBAs to cover well-aligned project aid, or to adjust the target downwards.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3809c36-f459-425e-b5ea-e5a9d4ec6238": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3809c36-f459-425e-b5ea-e5a9d4ec6238", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting to Accra Information Portal on Aid Effectiveness for the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac15f38413af1704ba704a3c83d0ed1fb8aea2eb32deff1a459f7a155de99858"}, "2": {"node_id": "bbdfd5df-bf87-46ee-9781-185acde13e17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b88b1946806e8471e4307a3c1b9a0104c84ef16485935cde23b18110a04ceafc"}}, "hash": "cded5e049b1618913100b1c141fa56a7dca9b7d6c903fea32d3b77f9fba23926", "text": "Agulhas, \u201cHow have programme-based approaches helped countries establish effective leadership over development assistance?\u201d, Paper for the 2006 Asian Regional Forum on Aid Effectiveness, September 2006 This paper is based on three case-studies of PBAs in Asia: Vietnam\u201fs general budget support instrument (PRSC); an education SWAp in India and a sectoral budget support programme in social service delivery in Pakistan.

Systems alignment within Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 14 PBAs remains a difficult challenge, with many donors still imposing additional rules and procedures. The report notes that PBAs vary considerably in the extent to which they embody the Paris Declaration commitments, and that donors must use PBAs as a platform to continue to pursue greater aid effectiveness. General budget support is still a relatively new tool in donor practices, and its ultimate impact is still uncertain. Some donors, such as DFID, are committed to providing two- thirds of their assistance as budget support; others are more sceptical. The multi-donor evaluation (below) was the first systematic attempt to assess the effects of general budget support. OECD DAC, \u201cHarmonising donor practices for effective aid delivery: Vol. 2 \u2013 Budget support, sector-wide approaches and capacity development in public financial management\u201d, 2006 The DAC Guidelines contain a chapter on general and sectoral budget support. As well as facilitating macroeconomic stabilisation and providing resources for the implementation of national development strategies, it notes that budget support can reduce transaction costs, facilitate donor coordination and enhance the predictability of ODA flows. It can help partner countries improve the allocation of their development resources, while reinforcing accountability by underscoring the importance of the budget as a tool of government policy. However, there are also potential disadvantages for partners, including increased volatility in aid flows and (on occasion) excessive conditionality. It advises donors to refrain from any earmarking of budget support, and to draw their conditionality as far as possible from the partner\u201fs own development strategies. IDA and Associates, \u201cEvaluation of General Budget Support: Synthesis Report\u201d, May 2006 This evaluation was commissioned by a consortium of donors and partner countries, and involved 7 studies including Vietnam. It notes that budget support was intended to bring about a step-change in the nature of dialogue and conditionality, centred on the implementation of a national development strategy. However, this change has happened only gradually, and has been more significant in the eyes of donors than partner countries. It has contributed to the alignment of assistance with partner budget cycles, as well as (by definition) the use of country systems for aid delivery. It has also contributed to donor harmonisation, although budget support arrangements themselves are not always fully harmonised. The high-level dialogue and review mechanisms around budget support have proved to be a useful complement to sectoral processes. One of its most important effects has been to increase the level of discretionary funding available to partners, which in turn increases the importance of the planning and budgeting process. It has also provided an important boost to improving public financial management. It found that there had been an overall increase in spending in the social sectors as a result of budget support, but that it was too early to identify long-term development impacts.

There has been little change in the delivery of traditional investment projects. It found there were three distinct groups of donors in their approach to use of country systems: (i) the development banks take a limited reading of the Paris commitment, recognising an obligation to use country system only as and when they reach international standards; until then they are bound by strict rules preventing them compromising on fiduciary standards; (ii) a group of bilateral donors with more permissive rules, enabling them to balance the greater development impact and sustainability of using country systems against the fiduciary risks; and (iii) a significant number of donors (around half of the total) still bound by very restrictive rules, enabling them to use country systems only in very limited conditions. However, the report also found that donors were receiving relatively little encouragement from their government counterparts to use country systems, and that traditional aid practices created vested interests that were difficult to overcome. The OECD has been developing a series of tools to help donors and partner countries reach a common assessment of the state of country systems and the reform priorities. Good practices suggest that these assessments should be done jointly by donors and partner countries, and shared among donors. The following document and sites provide guidelines for how these assessments are to be done. Public financial management Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) PEFA is the product of a joint initiative of a number of donors to strengthen assessment of PFM, procurement and financial accountability systems. Its Performance Measurement Framework is designed to provide a harmonised, country-led tool for measuring improvements in PFM systems over time. Guidance on applying it can be found on the website. Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 16 World Bank, \u201cPublic Expenditure Management Handbook\u201d, 1998 The World Bank produced this handbook in 1998, providing guidelines on how to strengthen budget processes, how to link and budgeting through an MTEF, and how to development effective public financial management information systems. It provides checklists of good practices in areas such as public audit and aid management. World Bank PFM Reform Database This database contains a wide selection of current reference material on PFM reform, covering budget preparation, budget execution, accounting and financial reporting, external oversight and cross-cutting issues. Examples are drawn from both OECD and developing countries. It also contains the newsletter FM Notes, which documents recent experience with PFM reform programmes. ODI Briefing Paper, \u201cLinking policies and budgets: implementing medium term expenditure frameworks in a PRSP context\u201d, June 2005 This paper summarises the results of an ODI research project on the experiences of developing countries in linking PRSPs to the budget through MTEFs. It found that introducing MTEFs had been a good catalyst for PFM reforms, even from a low base. A key successor factor was the setting of a clear budget timetable, integrating the various phases of the budget cycle with other planning processes. However, it also points to the need to manage expectations about how much time it takes to provide effective linkages between the PRSP process and resource allocation. The individual case studies can be found on the ODI Aid and Public Expenditure website. Procurement OECD DAC Joint Venture for Procurement In December 2004, Joint Venture members approved the Johannesburg Declaration, which recognised the importance of strengthening procurement to increase the effectiveness of development spending. The signatories undertook to develop new capacity building techniques and approaches, based on country ownership, to develop a common set of diagnostic tools and to focus on achieving measurable improvements in procurement systems. Since then, the Joint Venture has developed a set of good practice guidelines: Strengthening Procurement Capacities in Developing Countries, 2005. It represents a departure from previous approaches through its emphasis on the process of change, as much as the substantive content of procurement reforms. The Joint has also developed a New Common Benchmarking and Assessment Methodology for Public Procurement Systems, which has been applied in 22 pilot countries. The Joint Venture will be producing guidelines on using this methodology for Accra, as well as a good practices guide on procurement reform. World Bank on Public Procurement The World Bank has its own diagnostic tool for country procurement systems: the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) and guideline for its use.

Donors Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 17 agree to align their technical assistance behind country-led capacity development strategies. At present, there is considerable doubt among the donor community about the quality of technical assistance (TA) for capacity building. No other aid modality is as fragmented, poorly aligned and supply-driven, focusing on technical standards and imported models rather than workable reform processes. According to the World Bank, there were 20,000 separate TA activities in 2004 \u2013 equivalent to one per day per developing country. Officials from partner countries often admit to doubts about the value of foreign technical advisers. And yet experience with partner coordinated, procured and managed TA has not been very positive. The question of how to improve country leadership of capacity development will be an important one at Accra. Japan has commissioned a major study of technical cooperation, from which results will become available over the coming months here. ActionAid, \u201cReal Aid: Making Technical Assistance Work\u201d, 2005 In a stringing criticism of donor practices, ActionAid finds that TA, making up at least a quarter of all ODA, is overpriced and ineffective, and in the worst cases destroys rather than builds the capacity of the poorest countries. Most TA is designed and managed by donors, implemented by firms from the donor\u201fs own country, poorly coordinated and based on false assumptions about expatriate knowledge and recipient ignorance. It is under-evaluated, and stubbornly resistant to change. ActionAid suggests four principles for improving TA: putting recipient countries in the lead; giving them more space to choose their own development path; greater mutual accountable; and more specificity of assistance to country conditions. It advises Southern governments to draw up clear capacity-building plans, and to reject all offers of TA falling outside this framework. OECD DAC, \u201c2006 Survey on monitoring the Paris Declaration: Overview of the results\u201d, 2007 For the baseline survey, respondents were asked to identify TA meeting all four of the following criteria: (i) the TA supports the national development strategy; (ii) partner countries exercise effective leadership, including clearly communicated objectives from senior officials; (iii) donors integrate their support within county-led programmes; (iv) there are arrangements for coordinating donor contributions, especially pooled funding. What resulted was marked difference in perception between donor and partner country respondents. Partner countries often took the view that no TA at all met all four criteria. Donors tended to score their own programmes more generously. The official baseline was set at 48%, but the DAC notes that this is not a robust figure. Agulhas, \u201cWhat is required to deliver external assistance through country systems?\u201d, Thematic Study No. 2, Asian Regional Forum on Aid Effectiveness, Manila, October 2006 This report is based on case studies of procurement reforms in the Philippines and PFM reforms in Bangladesh. The case studies illustrate the importance of long-term, incremental reforms, in which process elements rather than technical sophistication are the main determinants of success. They point to a number of key success factors, including reform processes that are owned and driven by country stakeholders, painstaking consensus building and political management to build and sustain country ownership, a long-term vision for reform supported by considerable short-term tactical flexibility, leadership by the partner country over the form of TA, and TA providers with political and diplomatic, as well as technical, skills. Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 18 OECD DAC, \u201cHarmonising donor practices for effective aid delivery: Vol. 2 \u2013 Budget support, sector-wide approaches and capacity development in public financial management\u201d, 2006 These DAC guidelines on capacity development in PFM reflect contemporary thinking on good practice in TA. It stresses four key principles: (i) country leadership and ownership; (ii) the design and sequencing of reforms should fit country circumstances, rather than standard or imported solutions; (iii) capacity development must cover the institutional, organisational and individual levels, including both managerial and technical aspects; (iv) donor support should be provided in a coherent, coordinated and programmatic manner. There is a great deal of technical information and support available on capacity building, drawing lessons from both developing and OECD countries.

The site contains analytical reports and best practice guidance on civil service reform. 2.4 Predictability of aid In the Paris Declaration, donors undertook to provide reliable, indicative pledges of aid over a multi-year span, and to disburse aid in a timely and predictable fashion according to agreed schedules. Predictable aid enables partner countries to manage their public finances and plan their development expenditure. Donors also commit to ensuring that at least 85% of their assistance is reported on the budget. This is an area where donors have been performing rather poorly. In its Global Monitoring Report 2005, the World Bank found that aid tends to be more volatile than domestic revenues, and that aid volatility has increased over the last decade. The 2006 OECD Survey set an apparently high baseline of 88% of aid reported on budget, and 70% of aid disbursed according to annual schedules. However, there are reasons to be cautious of these figures, as over- and under-reporting and disbursement cancel each Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 19 other out, resulting in an artificially high baseline. For the majority of countries and most donors, performance is considerably below this level. Mokoro Ltd, \u201cPutting aid on budget: draft literature review\u201d, November 2007 This literature review of good practice guidance and donor policies notes that the term \u201eputting aid on budget\u201f is ambiguous, and can mean inclusion of aid in budget plans, parliamentary appropriations, treasury systems, accounting processes or financial reporting. Developing standard definitions and indicators has been problematic. The contemporary approach to management budgets stresses that they should be comprehensive \u2013 that is, include all revenue and expenditure in a single, central fund. This increases allocative efficiency, while improving external transparency and accountability. Placing aid on the budget results both in improved aid management and a stronger budget processes, ensuring that donor and recipients share common priorities. The report notes that this is a mutual commitment, and that reasons for poor aid capture can include poor supply of information by donors, weak demand for information by partner countries, and lack of realism in information provided by donors (usually in the form of over-estimates of the speed of project implementation). The treatment of non- cash aid in the budget emerges as particularly problematic, with some partner countries lacking budget categories for recording technical assistance and other in-kind support. OECD-DAC, \u201cDonor practices on forward planning of aid expenditures\u201d, 11 December 2007 This paper presents the results of a survey of DAC donors carried in 2007. Most DAC donors have annual aid budgets, supported by 3-4 years indicative budget planning. There are one-page descriptions of the budget procedures for each of the DAC bilateral donors. 2.5 Untying aid The Paris Declaration reaffirms the 2001 DAC Recommendation on Untying Official Development Assistance to Least Developed Countries. The Recommendation covered most categories of aid, but exempted TA and food aid. It sets out monitoring and review procedures that enable DAC to keep statistics on the tying status of aid (here). Overall, 82% of aid is currently untied. OECD Policy Brief, \u201cUntying aid to the least developed countries\u201d, July 2001 It is estimated that the tying of aid diminishes its real value by between 15 and 30%. It creates additional administrative burdens for partner countries, while causing a bias towards capital-intensive imports and donor-based technical expertise which may compromise country leadership. In short, tied aid is a costly way of subsidising jobs in donor countries \u2013 a form of protectionism that runs counter to the overall OECD commitment to open markets. ActionAid, \u201cReal Aid: Making Technical Assistance Work\u201d, 2005 ActionAid estimates that some $2.5 billion, or 3% of total ODA, is lost through tying practices.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "361e5760-215c-471e-b2d8-7e2af1a79058": {"__data__": {"id_": "361e5760-215c-471e-b2d8-7e2af1a79058", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting to Accra Information Portal on Aid Effectiveness for the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c462345ce6d8bd5d072ddbbb084769f522385cf9bea6fdff05e2505ee78bf3e1"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf7d3343-d0b3-4eb1-b574-f549b736f2c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51a2b0a767935d1c2e2fd8925ced5d0e62566b7a33746436eb370f2837d84585"}}, "hash": "268d3cf25d95826fd6135938e469332d0bd02fbbfcee4d72c2fad48d99318257", "text": "It states that the US, Italy, Canada, Greece, Spain and Austria are the worst culprits on tying of aid, while Ireland, the UK and Norway have fully untied their aid.

Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 20 Preparations for Accra \uf0b7 The DAC Joint Venture on Public Financial Management is planning to produce a report on progress on use of country PFM systems, with recommendations for key actions by donors and partner countries. \uf0b7 The DAC Joint Venture for Procurement will be producing guidelines on using the new benchmarking methodology, as well as a good practices guide on procurement reform. \uf0b7 The DAC is preparing a feasibility study on options for promoting regional and local procurement, as part of its Recommendations on untying aid. \uf0b7 The Strategic Partnership for Africa and the Collaborative African Budget Reform Initiative are preparing a study on \u201ePutting Aid on the Budget\u201f. Based on 10 country case studies, it will produce a synthesis report and good practice note. \uf0b7 The Strategic Partnership for Africa is also producing a study on capacity for aid management, including 9 country studies, synthesis report and good practice note. \uf0b7 The Multilateral Financial Institutions-Working Group on Environment is planning to organising three complementary workshops at Accra: (a) Opportunities in and Challenges to the Use of Country Systems for Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies; (b) Strengthening the Capacity of Public and Private Sector Institutions to Address Environmental and Social Dimensions of Development Plans, Programs and Projects; and (c) Experience with the Use of Strategic Environmental Assessments. \uf0b7 JICA is coordinating a multi-country study on technical cooperation for capacity development, to generate empirical evidence on how to make TC more effective. It will include 11 country case studies, including Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Thailand, Pakistan and Vietnam. Outputs will include a synthesis report and a booklet containing good practices and recommendations. Issues for the Asia-Pacific region The Asia-Pacific region, with its strong states, established planning traditions and relatively effective government systems, should be the global leader in country-led capacity development and use of country systems for aid delivery. However, it is not clear from literature whether this is in fact the case. The debates at Accra would benefit from further research on: \uf0b7 Which Asia-Pacific countries have expressed clear preferences to donors on aid modalities? Do regional preferences on external assistance (e.g., the high priority given to large infrastructure development) influence choice of aid modality? \uf0b7 Are there distinctively Asian approaches to capacity building? What makes for a successful reform path? What kinds of capacity-building assistance work best in Asia? \uf0b7 How predictable is aid to Asia-Pacific? Have donors changed their practices since the Asian financial crisis to ensure that aid flows are counter-cyclical? Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 21 The debate at Accra would benefit from more case studies of reform processes, focusing not just on the technical aspects, but on the process of change in all its political complexity. Only a good understanding of the political economy of institutional change in the region will enable donors to lift the quality of their capacity-building assistance. Examples of good case studies can be found here: \uf0b7 PFM reform in Bangladesh; \uf0b7 the education sector in India; \uf0b7 procurement reform in the Philippines. Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 22 3. Harmonisation Harmonisation refers to cooperation between donors to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their aid delivery. It includes programme-based approaches, joint projects (pooled funding) and other common arrangements, such as joint country plans or shared offices. Since the 2003 Rome Declaration, donors have been concerned that the proliferation of donors and the fragmentation of aid across too many activities is straining partner country capacity. Under the Paris Declaration, they commit to developing common arrangements for planning, funding, monitoring, evaluating and reporting on aid flows, and to reducing the number of duplicative field missions and diagnostic reviews. Harmonisation has come to consume a large share of donor time. Joint activities often come with additional transaction costs for donors, even if they are time-saving for partner governments. Joint programmes with too many donors quickly encounter diminishing returns. There are concerns that donors are now spending too much time talking to each other \u2013 in effect, doing the same old things in more complicated ways. The solution would appear to be in a better division of labour among donors. Donors should be achieving greater complementarity by becoming more selective in their choice of sectors, and by using of silent partnerships and other lead donor arrangements. Under the Paris Declaration, donors commit to greater delegation of authority to lead donors, while partner countries agree to provide clear views on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b99bde6-1de4-4ee8-9e63-d9eac159c177": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b99bde6-1de4-4ee8-9e63-d9eac159c177", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting to Accra Information Portal on Aid Effectiveness for the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f304dc3bc78a6b6accfd1ffba211607fe4287b9ce6f102cb7bd467d9cd8f122"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d006a17-46cc-4eef-a15f-013a358e7648", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3628383db6811c4fc11595b5a636e85068f53acebf970f3fb8b13066424912aa"}}, "hash": "01852c45d5a8878dc1c44290a339640b46480f847ec55d89819a246aa75bfab8", "text": "donors\u201f comparative advantage. However, so far there has been very little progress on complementarity at a practical level. In African countries, such as Tanzania, formalising the division of labour through Joint Assistance Strategies (JASs) has come to represent the state of the art in harmonisation. JASs are now preparation in some 15 African countries, but have not yet been tried in the Asia-Pacific region, although there have been some more modest attempts at joint country planning in Bangladesh and Cambodia. Agulhas, \u201cAre donor harmonisation initiatives a good investment in improved aid effectiveness?\u201d, thematic study for the Asian Regional Forum on Aid Effectiveness, Manila, 2006 This report is based on case studies of joint country planning initiatives in Bangladesh and Cambodia. Groups of four donors came together to conduct joint analytical work and risk analysis, and produce a common set of high-level objectives to guide their country strategies. Though each donor then developed its individual country strategy, these joint planning initiatives helped to improve strategic coordination and generate complementarities in programming. In Bangladesh, the partners developed a common outcomes matrix, nominating a lead donor for each outcome and sub-area for strategic planning and policy dialogue. COWI, \u201cJoint Assistance Strategies in Tanzania, Zambia and Uganda: Final Report\u201d, commissioned by Danida and the European Commission, 2005 This report summarises the content and process of Joint Assistance Strategies (JAS) in three African countries. The JASs provide a joint donor response to the financing requirements of the PRSP, setting out a common set of priorities, a common assessment framework for financing decisions, and a common set of indicators for measuring impact. In Tanzania, there is strong country leadership of the JAS, and government finds it\u201fs a valuable tool for managing its donor relations. It sets out the government\u201fs preference on aid modality, including a target of 70% general budget support. It Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 23 contains a chapter on complementarity, with a complicated process of capacity assessments, stakeholder consultations and adjustment of donor programming. However, this does not appear to have been implemented. In Zambia, by contrast, the JAS process was largely donor driven, but donors have made some progress in agreeing their own division of labour. In Uganda, division of labour has made little progress in the face of limited government interest. The study finds that the JASs are very sensitive to the design of the negotiation process, given the many different interests and predispositions among (and within) donor agencies, and that 2-3 years was required to achieve agreement. European Commission, \u201cEU Code of Conduct on division of labour in development policy\u201d, 2007 In February 2007, the EU member states agreed on a voluntary code of conduct on division of labour. In a series of flexible guiding principles, it encourages EU donors to select two focal sectors per country based on their comparative advantage (plus budget support and support to civil society). For other sectors, they should either exit or work through a silent partnership. In each strategic sector, there should be at least one EU donor active, but no more than three. Note that it is not at all clear how these principles will be made operational. With the expansion of the EU to 27 members, many new, small donors are coming on line, each with their own visibility requirements. The maximum of 3 donors per sector cannot apply equally to the European Commission and a small donor from Eastern Europe. OECD-DAC, \u201cTowards better division of labour: concentration and fragmentation of aid\u201d, Global Forum on Development, December 2007 This report presents the results of a DAC survey on aid fragmentation. It contains useful data, including the number of countries in which each DAC donor is active (e.g, 140 for the European Commission) and the number of donors per country (there are 37 countries with 24 or more donors). It points out the problem of the long \u201etail\u201f of small donors. There are 24 countries where more than 15 donors jointly contribute less than 10% of total ODA. The health sector in particular is characterised by a large number of small donors. In 2005, Cambodia had 27 donors, of which 16 provided less than 10% of ODA. 22 of them were active in the health sector, with 17 providing less than 10% of health ODA.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d006a17-46cc-4eef-a15f-013a358e7648": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d006a17-46cc-4eef-a15f-013a358e7648", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting to Accra Information Portal on Aid Effectiveness for the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f304dc3bc78a6b6accfd1ffba211607fe4287b9ce6f102cb7bd467d9cd8f122"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b99bde6-1de4-4ee8-9e63-d9eac159c177", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "01852c45d5a8878dc1c44290a339640b46480f847ec55d89819a246aa75bfab8"}}, "hash": "3628383db6811c4fc11595b5a636e85068f53acebf970f3fb8b13066424912aa", "text": "Preparations for Accra \uf0b7 The OECD-DAC Joint Venture on Managing for Development Results is preparing a set of good-practice guidelines and a self-assessment tool for donors on improving incentives for harmonisation and alignment. \uf0b7 The DAC is planning to produce draft principles on complementarity and rationalised aid delivery, to become part of the Accra", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8473c3e-b03e-4907-a1ae-dcd39d923660": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8473c3e-b03e-4907-a1ae-dcd39d923660", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting to Accra Information Portal on Aid Effectiveness for the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60741f33272037b2f32ec78e0c0d6b0bd859d8a465bc2e889aeecc8bfab977ee"}}, "hash": "60741f33272037b2f32ec78e0c0d6b0bd859d8a465bc2e889aeecc8bfab977ee", "text": "Action Agenda. \uf0b7 The World Bank\u201fs Legal Vice Presidency is launching a Legal Harmonization Initiative aimed at harmonising operational policies, practices and documentation between IFIs and bilateral donors.

India has addressed the issue through \u201eminimum stake\u201f rules for donors. Most Asian countries, however, do not appear from the literature to have taken up the complementarity agenda. So what are the Asian interests around harmonisation? The debate at Accra would benefit from clear signals on a number of points: \uf0b7 How do donors decide on the division of labour in the Asia-Pacific? What mechanisms have evolved, and how successful are have they been? \uf0b7 Is there an optimal number of donors per sector? Are Asian countries expressing preferences to donors on how to coordinate their efforts? \uf0b7 Do the countries of the region place greater weight by the efficiency or the effectiveness of aid? To what degree are transaction costs seen as a problem? Which donor practices would Asian countries most like to change? Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 25 4. Managing for results and development impact The Paris Declaration commits both donors and partner countries to managing their resources so as to maximise development results. This means having systems in place to monitor the impact of development initiatives, and using the information to improve decision making and programme performance. Specifically, donors and partner countries agree to establishing common reporting and assessment frameworks for more effective results monitoring, and donors agree to invest in capacity development and rely on country monitoring systems. Most countries have gone to considerable lengths to produce performance assessment frameworks with elaborate lists of indicators, in support of their national development strategies. Many have also tried to rationalise the multiple monitoring mechanisms for development assistance into a single, national monitoring system. However, experience suggests that this managing for results is one of the hardest principles of implement. The quality of administrative and financial data tends to be very poor. Fragmented government administrations are reluctant to share information. Many PRSPs are intrinsically difficult to monitor because of their \u201cmissing middle\u201d \u2013 the lack of an explicit theory on how the programmes are supposed to affect poverty outcomes. Most difficult of all, information on development outcomes is rarely used by policy makers to improve their policies. There is now a considerable volume of guidance and information available to assist countries with managing for results. This Working Table is likely to focus on practical lesson learning and overcoming obstacles. World Bank, \u201cResults-based National Development Strategies: Assessment and Challenges Ahead\u201d, October 2007 Three criteria: (i) quality of development information; (ii) stakeholder access to development information; and (iii) co-ordinated country-level monitoring and evaluation. The quality of survey-based data on poverty and human development has been increasing in most countries, but administrative data remains a weakness. Data sharing and dissemination have somewhat improved, but feedback loops into policy and planning remain a major challenge. On the whole, only 3 countries from the sample of 62 had \u201clargely developed\u201d performance assessment frameworks, although more than half had taken some action towards establishing them. David Booth and Henry Lucas, \u201cGood practice in the development of PRSP indicators and monitoring systems\u201d, ODI Working Paper 172, July 2002 This study finds that the PRSP initiative has led to an upsurge the measurement of final poverty outcomes, through household surveys and participatory poverty assessments. However, there is less interest in measuring intermediate process and achievements, which in the short term is more important for both learning and accountability. This contributes to the famous problem of the \u201cmissing middle\u201d: PRSPs tend not to identify the causal process by which their proposed actions will impact on poverty outcomes. This makes it difficult to select indicators which will verify whether or not these causal effects are actually taking place. It stresses that what matters is not technically advanced monitoring systems, but mechanisms to ensure that the available information is used to inform policy making. It calls for a new \u201cpolitical economy of information\u201d to understand why this is not happening.

It notes a tendency for monitoring reports to be produced to meet donor requirements, rather than support national policy-making, and for the tendency of donors to undermine the creation of a national system by insisting on stand-alone monitoring arrangements. Tara Bedi, Aline Coudouel, Marcus Cox, Markus Goldstein and Nigel Thornton, Beyond the Numbers: Understanding the Institutions for Monitoring Poverty Reduction Strategies (World Bank: Washington, 2006) This World Bank book is a study of the institutional arrangements for poverty monitoring systems, based on 12 country case studies. It finds that the record on establishing monitoring systems is very modest. Few countries have made much progress in rationalising ad hoc monitoring arrangements into a coherent system. Lack of coordination, lack of demand for information from decision makers, unclear mandates and responsibilities, lack of relevant and timely data and limited accessibility are all identified as key constraints to a culture of results-based decision making. It finds that, beyond weaknesses in data collection, few countries are making effective use of the data they have. There is a lack of data analysis, poor dissemination of data, and no institutionalised processes for feeding results information back into the policy and budget processes. Given the scale of the challenges, the book concludes that development an effective national monitoring system needs to be a gradual process, beginning with what is already there and introducing a flexible system that can be adapted over time. The book also contains diagnostic and guidance tools designed to help practitioners develop monitoring systems. It is widely accepted that civil society organisations have a comparative advantage in certain types of monitoring, particularly participatory poverty assessments and budget monitoring. Their involvement not only generates useful information for policy makers, it also helps with the public dissemination of results information and helps to boost accountability. There are many resources around to help civil society in this process, including: The International Budget Project The IBP was formed within the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in 1997 to build civil society capacity to analyze and influence government budget processes, institutions and outcomes. The IBP works with organisations that focus on the impact of the budget on poor and low-income people in developing countries or new democracies, with a view to making budget systems more responsive to the needs of society and more transparent and accountable to the public. It supports individual CSOs engaged in capacity building on budget monitoring, encourages civil society networks, and seeks to raise the profile of budget work in the international community. It commissioned a briefing paper from ODI on how civil society can have policy influence through budget monitoring (posted here). Budget Information Service (BIS) BIS was created by the Institute for Democracy in South Africa (IDASA) in 1995 to monitor inclusion and democracy in post-apartheid government policies. It has established a strong reputation in budget analysis, and provides support to civil society organisations throughout Africa. Its site contains many useful resource and toolkits, particularly on fiscal decentralisation and gender auditing.

DAC Joint Venture on Managing for Results The Joint Venture was formed to promote international lesson-learning and communities of practice on managing for results. It conducts periodic Roundtables for exchanging international experience, most recently in Hanoi in February 2007.

Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 28 Issues for Asia-Pacific countries A number of Asian countries, including Vietnam and Japan, have been very active at promoting regional networks to support managing for results. Technical expertise on poverty monitoring and choice of indicators appears to be relatively strong. It is the institutional side that presents the greatest challenge. There are a number of key questions that would benefit from greater evidence: \uf0b7 How have Asian countries organised monitoring systems across decentralised administrations? Have they succeeded in creating incentives to improve the quality of administrative data at the local level? \uf0b7 Which Asian countries have opened up their budget processes to external monitoring? Are there successful examples of strengthening accountability and grass-roots democracy through greater participation in the budget? \uf0b7 Under what circumstances does the political leadership make use of evidence on results when setting development policy? Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 29 5. Mutual accountability A key innovation of the Paris Declaration is that the commitments are reciprocal in nature, applying both to donors and partner countries. This creates for the first time the possibility for mutual accountability. However, mutual accountability is a difficult principle to institutionalise. A few countries (Tanzania; Vietnam) have introduced independent monitoring of aid effectiveness. Under the 2006 Baseline Survey, 41% of countries reported having some kind of mutual review mechanism, although the quality of these reviews varies significantly. Some commentators are sceptical that devices such as these can overcome the imbalance of power between donor and recipient. The Paris Declaration itself provides little assistance. It refers both to accountability between donors and recipients on aid effectiveness, and to strengthening the domestic accountability of partner governments for their use of development resources in general. The relationship between these different forms of accountability is unclear. It is fair to say that at present there is little consensus on mutual accountability. In preparation for Accra, the Joint Venture on Managing for Development Results is conducting two studies on mutual accountability: at country level (conceptual and good practice paper, recommendations); and at international level (study on existing mechanisms, synthesis report). It is hoped that these studies will produce a clearer vision of how to move forward. International mechanisms Paolo de Renzio, \u201cPromoting mutual accountability in aid relationships: synthesis note\u201d, ODI, January 2006 This paper describes a number of mechanisms for mutual accountability at the international level, including the EU\u201fs Cotonou Agreement, the DAC Peer Review process, the WB and IMF Global Monitoring Reports and the Africa Partnership Forum. It finds they are generally quite weak, with loose targets, unclear monitoring mechanisms, limited recipient voice and lack of enforceability. It calls for more dissemination of information on aid flows and performance, more independent monitoring of donor behaviour, stronger fora for high-level dialogue and measures to promote a common voice among Southern countries. At the country level, the paper argues that mutual accountability requires four conditions: confidence, credibility, coherence and capacity. ActionAid, \u201cMaking aid accountable and effective: an ActionAid Ten Point Plan for real aid reform\u201d, 2007 ActionAid argues that closed-door discussions between donors and partner governments can never be enough to secure mutual accountability. It argues for donors to adopt binding, monitorable agreements setting out the quantum and terms of external assistance. Donors should be held to account in international fora for their performance against their commitments. This should be done in a more representative institution than the OECD. It argues for the creation of a UN Commissioner on Aid, who would review donor conduct and act as an ombudsman to resolve disputes.

However, it also identified a number of factors working against mutual accountability, including lack of delegation of authority by donors to their country offices, poor information flows between donors and government and in some cases a lack of commitment on both sides. Marcus Cox, Samuel Wangwe, Hisaaki Mitsui and Tran Thi Hanh, \u201cIndependent Monitoring Report on implementation of the Hanoi Core Statement\u201d, Hanoi, November 2007 The Independent Monitoring of the Hanoi Core Statement (HCS) concluded that, while the basic elements for mutual accountability were in place in Vietnam, including clear, country-level, aid-effectiveness principles and commitments, well developed dialogue structures and an independent review mechanism, mutual accountability was still not very effective. The Report found that the HCS implementation process had become bogged down in detailed reforms, and the mutual accountability would be strengthened by separating political oversight from technical management. It also suggested an annual action plan on aid effectiveness, focusing on a few strategic priorities, to increase the focus.

Debt Relief International, \u201cAid effectiveness: better indicators needed: non- OECD aid often highly effective\u201d, Strategies for Financing for Development, Newsletter of HIPC CPB, Issue 32, 2007 The organisation Debt Relief International has developed a methodology to assist HIPC countries to assess the quality of their aid providers, based on their policies and procedures. The methodology uses the Paris Declaration indicators, plus additional indicators on concessionality, conditionality, predictability, flexibility in response to exogenous shocks, coverage of key PRSP sectors and so on. The idea is that donor league tables of this kind will increase competition among donors, and enable developing countries to make informed choices between aid providers. Preparations for Accra \uf0b7 The OECD-DAC Joint Venture on Managing for Development Results is planning to develop a set of recommendations on mutual accountability mechanisms. To that end it has commissioned two different studies: one on mutual accountability at the international level (managed by DFID) and the other at the national level (managed by Germany). Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 31 Key issues for the Asia-Pacific region The Asia-Pacific region is in general less aid dependent than Africa, giving it more equal relations with donor countries. Countries such as Vietnam can be quite assertive with donors, negotiating a mature development partnership. However, from the literature, it appears that they remain reluctant to criticise donors for poor aid practices. Useful questions to explore for Accra would include: \uf0b7 What structures have been developed at country-level for mutual accountability? How can peer pressure between donors be intensified? \uf0b7 What has been the experience with independent monitoring on aid effectiveness? \uf0b7 What is the relationship between mutual accountability with donors, and domestic accountability for the use of development resources? Are the two in conflict? Are there useful examples in the region of bringing parliaments and civil society into the accountability relationship? Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 32 6. Civil society and aid effectiveness What is the role of civil society in aid effectiveness? On the one hand, international civil society has been a strong advocate internationally of changes in donor aid practices, and is increasingly active in policy debates. On the other hand, NGOs are also major development actors in their own right, both as donors and as implementing agencies. The DAC estimated private philanthropic flows to developing countries at $3 billion in 2003 (compared to around $8 billion in ODA), and that number has since expanded dramatically with the arrival of new private foundations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative. Should there be a set of aid-effectiveness principles applying to NGOs? The DAC has been running consultations with civil society as part of the preparations for Accra. An Advisory Group on Civil Society and Aid Effectiveness has been formed, comprising representatives of civil society organisations (CSOs), donors and partner countries and chaired by CIDA, to assist civil society to prepare for and participate at Accra and to provide them with a platform for participating in aid-effectiveness debates.

An International CSO Steering Group has also been established to coordinate a parallel, CSO-led consultation process, including an event in Accra. A draft policy paper has been produced, and is being circulated among NGOs for comment. Its activities are reported on the BetterAid website. International CSO Steering Group, \u201cFrom Paris 2005 to Accra 2008: Will aid become more accountable and effective? \u2013 a critical approach to the aid effectiveness agenda\u201d, 2007 The paper describes aid effectiveness as one of a triad of issues on development finance, along with debt and realising the 0.7% GNI pledge. It states that some donors have attempted to reduce the Paris agenda to a mere technical process around aid delivery, ignoring its key political dimensions. It calls for the agenda to be broadened to encompass the ultimate goals of development \u2013 poverty reduction, gender equality, human rights and social justice. It calls for a more democratic interpretation of country ownership, for a complete end to all policy conditionality, for higher standards of openness and transparency on the part of both donors and partners, and for more support to NGOs as development actors. It calls for a new system of independent monitoring of the Paris Declaration at international, national and local levels, supported by a new ECOSOC Development Cooperation Forum. It calls for donors to use aid purely for poverty eradication, and not for their own foreign and economic policy interests, for the untying of all aid, the reform of technical assistance, a more needs- based aid allocation process, and new targets on multi-year predictability of aid. Advisory Group on Civil Society and Aid Effectiveness, \u201cConcept Paper\u201d, September 2007 This concept paper notes that CSOs play three roles in the development architecture: as donors; as channels or recipients for ODA; and as watchdogs of the public interest. While the Paris Declaration does not create obligations for CSOs, it refers to them in a number of contexts, including consultations on aid coordination and participatory approaches to formulating and implementing national development strategies. The Paris Declaration seems to imply that the national development strategy represents a national consensus on development priorities, without recognising the reality of political debate. Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 33 It fails to acknowledge that CSOs may legitimately represent alternative points of view. CSOs therefore seek an understanding of country ownership that is more political in nature, allowing space for a plurality of views and recognising the reality of power imbalances. The concept paper also notes that, while CSOs can at times be effective partners of government and donors within development programmes, they also have a comparative advantage in localised, participatory development initiatives. Advisory Group on Civil Society and Aid Effectiveness, \u201cIssues Paper\u201d, September 2007 This paper is designed to initiate discussion on the quality of CSO relationships with their primary constituents, with each other, with partner country governments and with donors. It suggests a range of issues affecting the quality of these partnerships. Regarding partner country governments, it notes the importance of an enabling legal environment for civil society activity, of institutional platforms for policy dialogue and of partnerships in the implementation of development projects and programmes. Real Lavergne and Jacqueline Wood, \u201cAid effectiveness and non-state partnerships: analytical considerations\u201d, paper for CIDA, December 2006 This paper notes that the new aid paradigm relates mainly to government-to-government relations, and is abstracted from local political realities and human rights issues which are of more concern to civil society actors. While civil society recognises the importance of the aid-effectiveness agenda, it has difficulty defining its own role within it. The paper suggests several ways of enriching the agenda, to include: more recognition of the role of non-state actors in areas such as enhancing political representation, advocacy, innovation, knowledge sharing and building social capital; more elaboration on donor partnerships with non-state actors; more recognition of the political dimension of development; a recognition of the limits of planning and the value of decentralised development activities. Catherine Agg, \u201cTrends in Government Support for Non-Governmental Organizations \u2013 Is the \u201cGolden Age\u201d of the NGO Behind Us?\u201d, UNRISD Civil Society and Social Movements Programme Paper Number 23, June 2006 This very interesting study of the rise of NGOs as development actors notes that they were seen by donors during the 1990s as a means of bypassing weak and corrupt states. This involved assumptions that were untested empirically and had dubious democratic credentials. The return to alignment and programmatic assistance undermined the position of NGOs, leading some to predict the demise of the NGO sector.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71b2545a-1d69-4a13-bd9a-a3398b6f221f": {"__data__": {"id_": "71b2545a-1d69-4a13-bd9a-a3398b6f221f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting to Accra Information Portal on Aid Effectiveness for the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f9612ffc3a1f1e6595524e0d7ef6af42f469f078a2cea3d6fdb1e13b138322c"}, "3": {"node_id": "dbcd6d9d-606b-4dba-9f04-90f19b63794d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eda7255670f21c2a94124029e8a6fbd0e4fda4c30d07307c2f66b0572b0f1987"}}, "hash": "6a316b0acc6d58260c338671c9083a2472c68336bc8c808e2e105d9e5de476ca", "text": "However, while some donors (Canada, Sweden, Switzerland) have significantly reduced the proportion of their ODA going through INGOs, others (the UK, Norway, Japan, the Netherlands) have not, but have encouraged their NGOs partners to move away from implementing small aid projects towards partnership and knowledge transfer with Southern NGOs. In addition, the rise of global funds and private philanthropic flows has created new sources of funding for international NGOs. The article is critical of INGO practices towards Southern NGOs, noting their tendency to control funding sources and create dependency. Their continuous efforts to transfer their own skills and promote their own countries\u201f development agenda often create resentment among their Southern partners. It suggests that Southern NGOs need greater autonomy to play a constructive role in their own societies. Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 34 Key issues for the Asia-Pacific region Civil society from the Asia-Pacific region is not playing an active role in aid-effectiveness debates. The debates underway among international development NGOs in preparation for Accra would certainly benefit from an Asia-Pacific perspective. Many of the issues under discussion have been historically been of great interest to Asian NGOs, including country ownership and policy conditionality. In addition, it would be useful to have some clearer statements from Asia-Pacific countries about the role of national civil society in the development process. Many Asian countries have begun to recognise the potential of partnerships with civil society in meeting new development challenges, particularly around rapid urbanisation and the social challenges it generates. But the literature suggests that, in some countries, development NGOs still have uncertain legal status, and are not yet fully accepted as participants in the policy-making process. Useful questions for Accra would include: \uf0b7 What effect has the Paris Declaration had on NGOs and other civil society actors in the Asia-Pacific region? Has it increased or decreased their capacity to participate in the development policy process? \uf0b7 What role do NGOs play in development in the region? What good examples of partnership have emerged? \uf0b7 What is the relationship between local and international NGOs in the region? Are international NGOs supporting local civil society in ways that allow them to pursue their own interests? Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 35 7. Fragile states Donors use the term \u201efragile\u201f for states with a high degree of political or institutional instability or incapacity, where conventional aid-effectiveness principles are most challenging to apply. There is no official definition of a fragile states. The World Bank uses the term for countries with a low score on the IDA Resource Allocation Index (formerly CPIA score). Donors like DFID use a more subjective analysis, drawing on sources such as the Failed States Index published by the Fund for Peace. The Paris Declaration contains a short section on fragile states. It states that, while the guiding principles of aid effectiveness apply, they need to be adapted to take account of weak ownership and capacity, and to meet the immediate needs of service delivery. It recommends that donors harmonise their activities with each other, through joint needs assessments and strategies, while involving national counterparts as much as possible through instruments such as Transitional Results Matrices. This has been supplemented by a set of Principles for Good International Engagement in Fragile States, which have been piloted and refined over the last couple of years. While there is clearly a need for some kind of guiding principles in fragile states, there is continuing debate in the literature about how far the Paris Declaration paradigm is applicable. DAC, Principles for Good International Engagement in Fragile States There are 12 basic Principles: (i) take context as the starting point; (ii) do no harm (avoid sudden, destructive cuts in assistance); (iii) state-building is the central objectives; (iv) prioritise prevention and risk analysis; (v) recognise the political-security-development nexus; (vi) align as much as possible with local priorities and systems, including \u201eshadow alignment\u201f; (vii) donors should ensure coherence among their own agencies through \u201ewhole of government\u201f approaches; (viii) development practical coordination mechanisms; (ix) mix and sequence aid instruments to suit the context; (x) act fast and exploit windows of opportunity; (xi) stay engaged \u2013 core institutions require at least 10 years to build; (xii) avoid pockets of exclusion.

However, they stressed the need for flexibility in the application of the Principles, to adapt them to country context. They also noted the tendency of different actors to reach very different conclusions about what the Principles actually mean. There were concerns that the Principles were silent on gender, human rights, democratisation, corruption and the role of the private sector \u2013 all of which were considered very important in fragile states. DAC, \u201cWhole of Government approaches to fragile states\u201d, 2006 This DAC reference document provides guidance on \u201ewhole of government approaches\u201f (WGAs) to fragile states \u2013 that is, coherent policies and actions across the security, political and economic affairs, as well as the provision of humanitarian and development aid. It notes that these sphere often come into conflict, and government departments often have strong disincentives to work in cooperation with each other. It recommends that WGAs are overseen by the highest level of government, and involve consultations across a wide range of stakeholders, upfront investment in joint analysis and country- specific joint operational strategies. Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 36 Nicholas Leader and Peter Colenso, \u201cAid instruments in fragile states\u201d, March 2005 This review by DFID of the choice of aid instruments in fragile states looks at joint frameworks for strategic planning and coordination, programme aid (e.g., balance of payments support, debt relief and budget support), technical cooperation, projects, social funds, pooled funding arrangements, multi-donor trust funds, global funds and partnerships, and humanitarian assistance. It notes that the traditional approach of donors was to offer limited funding, mainly humanitarian projects delivered through NGOs, with short time commitments, with TA as an attempt to improve government policies but little attention to alignment. This was exactly the reverse of the Paris Declaration principles. It argues for a new approach, which recognises the diversity of fragile states contexts and, while recognising the element of risks, work nationally and programmatically rather than through projects. Programmatic interventions should work with the state, as well as a broad range of other actors. Strategic frameworks such as Consolidated Action Plans and Transitional Results Matrices can help to provide coherence within and between donors. The general principles of the Paris Declaration should be applied as far as possible, recognising that harmonisation among donors is not substitute for alignment. It recommends careful selection and sequencing of aid effectiveness, based on the interplay of commitment and capacity for poverty reduction. ODI, \u201cHarmonisation and alignment in fragile states\u201d, report to the Senior Level Forum on Development Effectiveness in Fragile States, London, January 2005 This study, commissioned by the DAC, assesses whether the harmonisation and alignment agenda is relevant to fragile states. It argues that aid-effectiveness principles are even more important in fragile states, given the potential for donor behaviour to undermine fragile state-building processes. It stresses the differences among fragile states, depending on the level of country leadership and political relations with donors. It introduces the concept of \u201eshadow\u201f systems alignment, whereby donors work in a way that is as compatible as possible with government systems, without necessarily aligning to government policies \u2013 for example, using national budgetary classifications and timetables, with a view to moving towards full alignment over time. It contains recommendations around diagnostics, progressive alignment, harmonisation, selectivity and sequencing of interventions, support to policy-making processes and monitoring. Agulhas, \u201cDeveloping Poverty Reduction Strategies in Low-Income Countries Under Stress\u201d, January 2005 This report, commissioned by the World Bank and DFID, argues that the PRSP approach is directly applicable to LICUS countries (that is, countries with the lowest CPIA scores). While the undertaking is more difficult and the results more modest, the PRS is nonetheless a useful tool for addressing deep-seated institutional problems. The focus should be on progressive introduction of PRS practices into donor and government behaviour, as and when country conditions allow. Where a PRSP is impractical, donors can rely on a Transitional Results Matrix as a transitional step. It recommends that PRSPs in fragile states should focus more on governance reforms and institutional requirements for poverty reduction, and to focus monitoring more on the process of institutional change.

Lisa Chauvet & Paul Collier, \u201cDevelopment effectiveness in fragile states: spillovers and turnarounds\u201d, 2004 This famous econometric study find that, once a state enters \u201efragility\u201f, it is likely to take considerable time to exit that status. The costs of fragility, both to the state itself and its neighbours, are extremely high, estimated at around $80 billion. It stresses the importance of a \u201eturnaround\u201f, when a fragile state begins to improve its policies and institutions. It finds that TA delivered before a turnaround has begun has no discernible effect, but can be highly effective after that \u2013 that is, it is effective only when a country both wants and needs it. Other forms of assistance are most effective during the middle of the first decade of reform (5th to 8th year of the turnaround). More of Collier\u201fs work can be found on his website.

Governance and Social Development Resource Centre (GSDRC) DFID\u201fs open-access GSDRC contains a useful topic guide on fragile states, including publications on policy coherence, harmonisation and alignment, aid allocation and aid instruments. World Bank on fragile and conflict-affect states The World Bank site links through to a large number of publications and sites on conflict analysis, governance and participation, security sector reform, environment, social drivers of conflict and many other issues. The publication \u201cMaking aid work in fragile states: case studies of effective aid-financed programs\u201d (2005) contains case studies from Timor Leste and Cambodia. Conference: Engaging with Fragile States \u2013 Challenges and Opportunities, Addis Ababa, July 2007 This event, hosted by the World Bank\u201fs Independent Evaluation Group, was designed to share experience on working in fragile states. It included sessions on governance, capacity building, donor coordination and post-conflict transition. The conference presentations can be found here. Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 38 Senior Level Forum on Development Effectiveness in Fragile States, London, 13- 14 January 2005 This high-level meeting on aid effectiveness in fragile states helped to shape current policy approaches in fragile states. The website contains an extensive list of background papers, on topics such as defining fragile states, policy coherence, aid instruments and service delivery, aid allocation and harmonisation and alignment. United Nations \u2013 World Institute for Development Economic Research (UNWIDER) UNWIDER has an extensive list of publications on fragile states and post-conflict recovery, that can be searched on their publications page. Issues of the Asia-Pacific region The Asia-Pacific region is a rich source of lessons on state-building (Timor Leste; Afghanistan), on complex peace processes (Sri Lanka; Cambodia; the Solomon Islands) and major humanitarian operations (the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; the 2005 Pakistan earthquake). This experience is documented through an extensive literature. However, there a number of important issues which are not yet treated in any detail in the literature. \uf0b7 The DAC principles stress the importance of \u201eWhole of Government\u201f coherence \u2013 namely, between aid and policy areas like security, immigration and trade.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fc0d101-9398-42bb-aebd-084f259fd150": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fc0d101-9398-42bb-aebd-084f259fd150", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting to Accra Information Portal on Aid Effectiveness for the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e52f0ff3a5b6c6bd896603da1770648486aff66367f62b8794a27b717d9271a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb9c340c-0b58-4d26-8bf6-8ef24734f5d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c88cdc2c7313c8cbdc917141375365b3c2e8a8960850067a25bbcb393f7c1313"}}, "hash": "2f5dfec9a59361a61dff92947273c05a6b9700840780f0d52935a188ecbea088", "text": "There are complex geopolitical interests at play in Asia, which make these principles difficult for donor countries to apply.

Health as a \u201etracer sector\u201f The OECD-DAC has decided to treat health as a \u201etracer\u201f sector for implementation of the Paris Declaration, to shed a more practical light on changing aid practices. The health sector accounts for 3 of the 8 MDGs, making it a critical sector, but one where progress has been hard to achieve. It has seen both major increases in resource allocation, and a proliferation of aid instruments and approaches. It is also the sector where the international aid architecture has been at its most dynamic, with the emergence of more than 100 global partnerships and vertical funds addressing different health challenges. Not all of these developments have been conducive to improved harmonisation and alignment. The health sector therefore offers a rich source of lessons and experience. World Bank and World Health Organization, \u201cAid effectiveness in health\u201d, Paper for the Global Forum on Development Pre-Meeting on Aid Effectiveness in Health, December 2006 This is a report of a meeting between the World Bank and the WHO on aid effectiveness in the health sector. The challenge is to balance vertical financing (money raised for specific communicable diseases) with horizontal spending to improve health systems. The new global health funds have been effective at mobilising finance and at partnerships with the private sector, but have tended to overshadow sectoral coordination. There is a tension between the global funds\u201f focus on results on particular health issues, with the need for sustainable development of health systems. To balance these pressures, the two organisations have developed new Good Practice Guidance, and will be carrying out further analysis with a view to presenting recommendations at Accra. World Bank, \u201cIntegrating global partnership programs with country-led national programs: synthesis of findings and recommendations\u201d, December 2006 This study looks at the ability of global programmes \u2013 e.g., Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria (GFAMT), Global Environment Facility (GEF), Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFA FTI) and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) \u2013 to align with country priorities and systems. It finds large variations depending on the characteristics of individual funds. EFA FTI is an example of a well-aligned mechanism, while the global health funds are struggling to fit within country-level coordination mechanisms. The challenge is greater in ODA-dependent, low-capacity countries, where recurrent funding for health systems is more difficult to secure. The report concludes that the proliferation of new global programmes needs to be controlled, and where they are necessary they should be designed with a view to fitting better within the overall development landscape. Denis Dreschler & Felix Zimmerman, \u201cNew actors in health financing: implications for a donor darling\u201d, OECD Development Centre Policy Brief No. 33, 2006 This paper is based on a study of the health sector in Ghana, which has seen a rapid increase in financing not just from donors, but also global programmes, NGOs, private foundations, the pharmaceutical industry and FDI. Despite this, both the volume and quality of health services have declined, while the MDG health indicators have stagnated or deteriorated. The authors attribute this to weaknesses in policy making and planning in the face of increasingly complexity in the sector. They single out three factors: (i) a lack of information systems to forecast flows and design more effective policies; (ii) a lack of coordination mechanism encompassing both traditional donors and new actors; and (iii) weaknesses in country ownership and leadership capacity, in particular higher-level management skills in the health administration. Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 40 WHO, \u201cAid effectiveness and health: making health systems work\u201d, Working Paper No. 9, 2007 Aid effectiveness is particularly challenging in health, not just because of the complexity of the aid architecture, but because of the large numbers of donors, the extent of unmet needs, cross-sectoral implementation challenges, private sector involvement in health services, and the long-term recurrent nature of most health needs. Progress towards the MDGs has been slow, despite scaled-up assistance. Health often receives insufficient priority in PRSPs, with little attention to equity and financial sustainability. Global funds have led to distortions in health financing \u2013 for example, funding for HIV-AIDS doubled between 2000 and 2004, while funding for primary health care dropped by half. Some global issues like SARS and avian flu have attracted a great deal of attention, while developing vaccines needed by poor countries has not.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd7d0d46-83c7-4feb-82fe-791f6d0fe5ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd7d0d46-83c7-4feb-82fe-791f6d0fe5ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting to Accra Information Portal on Aid Effectiveness for the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e938cab70b47c4b46f292258f8398f6434c5a33157d53cce4f37a3e1f8bb07bc"}, "2": {"node_id": "03a51e37-a201-453b-aa47-4566572d88aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d29d9393bf02549061d2e3647db0be36d7aea16d5c81d78409289055ea0f32c7"}}, "hash": "1fbf1dc4aacfd4646d342f92e19ec64fb5c53e127abee512fdc76cdfc8c78463", "text": "With more than half of aid off- budget and earmarked for specific projects, recipients find it difficult to secure sustained funding for health systems.

WHO, \u201cPoverty Reduction Strategy Papers: their significance for health \u2013 second synthesis report\u201d, 2004 This paper is somewhat dated, but looks at how first-generation PRSPs dealt with the link between health outcomes and poverty. PRSPs recognise poor health as one of the elements of poverty, but few provide comprehensive information on the health needs of poor people. Few examine the specific difficulties of deliver health services to poor people. \u201cIn the main, PRSPs do not systematically identify those health issues which are the biggest contributors to poverty or the greatest brake on economic growth, and then set out to tackle them. Nor do they look systematically at the health situation of the poor \u2013 beyond noting that they tend to have the worst health outcomes and are unable to afford health care fees.\u201d There are a various international initiatives underway to improve aid effectiveness in health, as part of a Global Campaign for the Health MDGs. An International Health Partnership was launched in September 2007. It consists of the Health 8 (Gates Foundation, GAVI, GFAMT, UNAIDS, UN Population Fund, WHO and the World Bank) and eight bilateral donors, and was established to follow up on the High-Level Forum on the Health MDGs in September 2006. It has developed a workplan for scaling up and improving the quality of health services by providing increased, sustainable funding and improving service-delivery and coordination. The workplan is now being piloted in seven countries. Further information can be found at the sites: Global Health Policy Research Network (GHPRN) The Central for Global Development runs the GHPRN, which brings together academic, policy and implementation experts to tackle a range of policy issues on health. The site contains a range of publications on health financing. Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria The Global Fund site contains information on its governance arrangements and programming, including its policies on country coordination mechanisms. Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 41 Health Systems Action Network This is a global network of health professionals. The site contains a useful guide to new financing mechanisms in the health sector. Preparations for Accra \uf0b7 WHO is commissioning a study on the constraints on long-term financing in the health sector. \uf0b7 The World Bank is conducting two country case studies on scaling up. \uf0b7 WHO will present a statistical analysis of health ODA, identifying donor orphans. \uf0b7 There will be a stock-taking exercise to identify country experiences on agreements on mutual accountability and results-oriented health plans. \uf0b7 WHO and the DAC are developing a set of indicators to monitor aid effectiveness in health. \uf0b7 UNAIDS is preparing a report on the \u201eThree Ones\u201f and using the CHAT to support country ownership. \uf0b7 GFTAM is coordinating a study on learning and adaptations by global health programmes in response to the Paris Declaration. \uf0b7 These different products will be synthesised into a single report on aid effectiveness in the health sector for Accra. Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 42 9. The international aid architecture There is a clear consensus in the literature that the current international aid architecture \u2013 that is, the structures and institutions for supplying development assistance \u2013 is not fit for purpose. It has never had an \u201earchitect\u201f, and there has been no serious reform since the creation of the International Development Association in 1960. New institutions are often created, but old ones are almost never shut down. There are now more than 1,000 mechanisms for supplying development finance, with no clear division of labour and widespread incoherence. With poor representation both of developing countries and emerging markets, its legitimacy is widely challenged. Two issues have already been identified for this Roundtable: \uf0b7 Global Funds: New vehicles for mobilising development finance, especially in health, have proved to be a poor fit with the Paris Declaration\u201fs country-led approach. \uf0b7 Emerging donors: Emerging market donors, especially China and India, are becoming increasingly important providers of development finance. Are they going to challenge the Paris Declaration consensus? A number of other issues are also debated in the literature, including: \uf0b7 IFI governance: There are strong calls for reform of the governance arrangements of the international financial institutions, to give developing countries greater voice. \uf0b7 UN reform: There are major reforms underway to rationalise the UN development system, beginning with its representation in-country.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "664c5e56-b43e-4905-ace9-a4c100beadbd": {"__data__": {"id_": "664c5e56-b43e-4905-ace9-a4c100beadbd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting to Accra Information Portal on Aid Effectiveness for the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03fe9e7ce8162dc70d2c2d4e3dbf87c1c7fecbf1ea3342848ba59e6c8d641b3e"}, "2": {"node_id": "e350eb15-cb5f-436c-8692-06e03cd90195", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d65c0cbe539071dd12fd5e6d0e33c082b4c6d01a2fa819d6f83137310b029f8"}}, "hash": "2ded20b8e4c42f72b2d33ed4ea2c03a662b27d90b08d7ec14aae9956bc9b28e4", "text": "9.1 Global Funds There has been a proliferation of Global Funds in recent years, generally customised to plug specific gaps in the international system or to mobilise finance for a single issue.

Menocal, Alina & Simon Maxwell & Andrew Rogerson, \u201cBackground Paper\u201d, Commonwealth Secretariat and La Francophonie Workshop: The Future of Aid: User Perspectives on Reform of the International Aid System, Dhaka, 20-21 March 2006 This study comments that the prolific growth of Global Funds \u201cis connected to the widespread political appeal in donor countries of well-focused, single-issue responses to Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 43 powerful advocacy campaigns, as against more diffuse, less tangible approaches based on recipient ownership.\u201d Most Global Funds use a \u201evertical\u201f programming approach \u2013 that is, they implement a standard set of programmes in a specific sub-sector across all their countries of operation. This approach is not consistent either with harmonisation with other donors or alignment with country strategies and systems. In the health sector, there are widespread concerns that Global Funds are diverting resources away from basic sector- wide reforms. These distortions tend to be the greatest in countries with weak planning and budgeting. Rogerson, A., Hewitt, A. & Waldenberg, D., \u201cThe International Aid System 2005- 2010 - Forces For and Against Change\u201d, London: ODI, 2004 Most global funds take the form of highly targeted vertical programmes, providing finance directly to governments using a template programming approach. This approach is widely seen as at odds with the dominant paradigm for effective aid under the Paris Declaration. The principle of \u201eadditionality\u201f used by many of the funds (i.e., they only support activities that would otherwise not have taken place) is inherently contradictory to complementarity, both to national development efforts and other donor programmes. World Bank, \u201cIntegrating global partnership programs with country-led national programs: synthesis of findings and recommendations\u201d, December 2006 This study looks at the ability of global programmes \u2013 e.g., Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria (GFAMT), Global Environment Facility (GEF), Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFA FTI) and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) \u2013 to align with country priorities and systems. It finds large variations depending on the characteristics of individual funds. EFA FTI is an example of a well-aligned mechanism, while the global health funds are struggling to fit within country-level coordination mechanisms. The challenge is greater in ODA-dependent, low-capacity countries, where recurrent funding for health systems is more difficult to secure. The report concludes that the proliferation of new global programmes needs to be controlled, and where they are necessary they should be designed with a view to fitting better within the overall development landscape. In recent time, the major Global Funds in health have become more sensitive to criticisms of their aid practices. In preparation for Accra, GFTAM is coordinating a study on learning and adaptation by global health programmes in response to the Paris Declaration. 9.2 Emerging donors Non-DAC donors \u2013 particularly the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 are becoming increasingly important providers of development assistance. However, they are not well represented in global policy-making fora, and have been marginal to discussions on aid effectiveness. de Ferranti, David, \u201cThe World Bank and Middle Income Countries\u201d in Birdsall N.

This group already meets at the level of Finance Ministers. This would be a way of bringing emerging markets into the tent, to address global challenges. Some commentators are concerned that non-DAC donors will undermine the consensus on poverty reduction and aid effectiveness. However, a recent review by Debt Relief International found that the gap in aid practices between DAC and non-DAC donors was less than often supposed. Richard Manning, former DAC Chair, also suggests that we should welcome the increased diversity in the aid market. Harmer, A. & L. Cotterrell, \u201cDiversity in Donorship: The changing landscape of official humanitarian aid\u201d, ODI, 2005 New and emerging donors, especially China, may undermine the international consensus on poverty reduction and aid effectiveness. New donors are not part of the DAC consensus on aid effectiveness. They tend to mix political with development and humanitarian objectives, and are not explicitly committed to poverty reduction and the MDGs as the ultimate purpose of aid. They have strong visibility requirements and tying practices. They are underrepresented in international fora where development policy is discussed. Debt Relief International, \u201cAid effectiveness: better indicators needed: non- OECD aid often highly effective\u201d, Strategies for Financing for Development, Newsletter of HIPC CPB, Issue 32, 2007 A recent study by Debt Relief International on behalf of HIPC countries found that certain non-DAC donors (e.g., Venezuela and India) perform better than many DAC donors on aid effectiveness. Non-DAC donors on average are better at providing aid on the budget and use less conditionality. Manning, R., \u201cWill \u201eEmerging Donors\u201f Change the Face of International Co- Operation?\u201d, Development Policy Review, Vol. 24(4), 2006 Richard Manning argues that new donors do not represent a major challenge to the aid- effectiveness consensus. He identifies three possible risks for LICs in the rise of new donors: (i) offers of less concessional development finance could cause a return to unsustainably high levels of debt; (ii) non-DAC development finance could undermine efforts by DAC donors to create positive incentives for reform, and help entrench poor standards of governance; (iii) non-DAC donors may fund high-profile, white-elephant projects that distort national spending priorities and cannot be sustained. However, he also supports the idea of greater choice for developing countries, and believes that the DAC should not act as a cartel. He believes that the priority is to encourage new and emerging donors to commit to the MDGs, and to participate more in the multilateral system. Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 45 Preparations for Accra \uf0b7 The DAC Working Party on Aid Effectiveness has established a Working Group with non-DAC providers of development assistance to look into issues like division of labour and south-south or trilateral cooperation issues. It will seek to encourage non-DAC donors to participate in the 2008 Paris Declaration survey. \uf0b7 In addition, Japan is funding a study on aid practices and perspectives on aid effectiveness by emerging and transition economies. 9.3 IFI governance The World Bank sits at the heart of the present international aid architecture, and enjoys considerable confidence among the donor community. However, there are a number of pressing reform issues on the table. First, there are strong criticisms of the Bank\u201fs own governance arrangements, particularly the method of choosing its President and the lack of effective developing country representation on the Board. Second, the IBRD is losing its traditional MIC clients, who now have ready access to the capital markets. Most of them are now repaying more than they borrow. This reduces the Bank\u201fs ability to cross- subsidise its operational costs and IDA activities from IBRD income, raising the question of whether its basic business model is still viable.

(ed.), Rescuing the World Bank: A CGD Working Group Report and Selected Essays, Washington DC: Center for Global Development, 2006 Ahmed argues that donor countries are not using the potential of the World Bank effectively. They choose to channel a large share of their funding through trust funds, encumbering the Bank with additional conditions and procedures, and thereby reducing its ability to aggregate across donor interests. \u201cI find it extraordinary that in a recent year the World Bank received a larger sum of grants from its shareholders in trust funds than it got for IDA\u2026 It is remarkable that as shareholders we construct an elaborate mechanism for setting priorities and discipline in the Bank, and then as donors we bypass this mechanism by setting up specific separate financial incentives to try to get the Bank to do what we want.\u201d International Financial Institution Advisory Commission (\u201ethe Meltzner Commission\u201f), Report, US Congress, March 2000 The Meltzner Commission established by the US Congress in 2000 recommended that the Bank move out of lending to all countries with capital market access, and concentrate on providing performance-based grants to LICs. To reflect this change in role, the Bank should be renamed \u201cthe World Development Agency\u201d. The Commission argued that capital markets have changed profoundly since the Bank was established, and that the Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 46 private capital flows to developing countries now dwarf the Bank\u201fs lending. Furthermore, most of the crises in the past quarter century have come from too much lending, rather than too little. There is therefore no longer a case for providing development finance in the form of loans. Birdsall, N., \u201cA global credit club, not another development agency\u201d in Birdsall N. (ed.), Rescuing the World Bank: A CGD Working Group Report and Selected Essays, Washington DC: Center for Global Development, 2006 Nancy Birdsall explicitly rejects the idea of turning the Bank into a \u201eWorld Development Agency\u201f, providing grants and TA to LICs. She supports the original vision of the IBRD as a global credit union, in which wealthy depositor countries guarantee the borrowings of poor countries, enabling them to access development finance at favourable rates \u2013 in effect, using the greater collective credit worthiness of the members to access cheaper credit. In her view, all members of the credit union should be formally equal. Such a credit union is self-regulating, because countries that do not wish to access development finance on the terms offered can simply choose not to do so. The literature contains many reform proposals for the World Bank, including: \uf0b7 Changes to the composition or voting weights within the Board, to reflect the growing importance of the emerging markets and to give more voice to borrower countries; \uf0b7 Greater use of double-majority voting (of members and of shares) in the Board, which would force the G7 group to make more effort to build consensus with borrower countries; \uf0b7 Measures to improve the quality of representation on the Board, including publication of transcripts and providing secretariats to development countries members to help them engage in policy debates; \uf0b7 A transparent, merit-based leadership selection process; \uf0b7 Combining the Bank\u201fs field presence with the regional development banks; \uf0b7 Changes to staff incentives to reduce disbursement pressures; \uf0b7 Broadening the mandate, to permit the Bank to finance non-state actors; \uf0b7 Stronger independent evaluation; \uf0b7 New financing terms for borrowers, such as 10-year financing agreements, to increase predictability of aid flows. 9.4 UN reform The literature describes how far the UN development system has deviated from its original design. Originally, there was to be a single UN Development Fund with voluntary core contributions, administered by UNDP as fund manager, with individual activities delivered by the Specialised Agencies. During the 1970s, however, the UN agencies began to fundraise separately, becoming increasingly competitive with each other. At the same time, there was a proliferation of new, autonomous funds and agencies, often created in the aftermath of international conferences. Far from providing a coherent global governance structure, the UN system came to exhibit all the shortcomings of the international aid architecture as a whole.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59b01b86-5183-4945-9bb2-46eb5e2fcf1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "59b01b86-5183-4945-9bb2-46eb5e2fcf1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting to Accra Information Portal on Aid Effectiveness for the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27ccaaeb05a51306cb4ca944757cf9b606a583c0c933169d0d9d989deaf0465b"}, "2": {"node_id": "b46a30f8-98d3-4abf-a99d-afc6a29b5ec2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7fe05becbe5909a69542d2fffe9d1b64729c3d9e07b32ced09de2abc44b14dac"}}, "hash": "13caced9cc85aabd6e25b0c5cb4388116e6f98c8f53083a64053a00f061d12dd", "text": "Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 47 Dirk Messner, Simon Maxwell, Franz Nuscheler & Joseph Siegle, \u201cGovernance reform of the Bretton Woods Institutions and the UN Development System\u201d, Friedrich Ebert Stiftung Occasional Paper No. 18, May 2005 \u201cAfter the decolonization of the 1960s, and due to the pressures exerted by the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "787d4762-c1f5-48fa-871b-b33afc98ea62": {"__data__": {"id_": "787d4762-c1f5-48fa-871b-b33afc98ea62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Getting to Accra Information Portal on Aid Effectiveness for the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3ff4d275797befef8f4ed67379704eb1d153d83027fd1843eed1d0b3fcb4ff3"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6949d3d-fb03-45cc-9ac7-2cc172bf607f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/getting-accra-information-portal-aid-effectiveness-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a2c598709cd01ab02ef85f6b159d323483e51aa7109ba15b0ba5af55fc075e0"}}, "hash": "2d1cc7cfc956dcdad1dee8f7bca1b2dc3eab3599c9ea2974a6bf173c8529179f", "text": "resulting new majority in the UN General Assembly, a thicket of specialized agencies, sub- agencies, programs, funds, commissions, and committees has developed, all of them tasked with the resolution of individual problems of development without much coordination among them.

UNFPA & UNICEF are doing similar work in health services for youngsters and young women. UNDP has three service lines related to AIDS, basically doing similar things as UNAIDS. Coordination among its own agencies consumes an increasingly large share of UN resources. OCHA has 400 professional staff dedicated to coordination of humanitarian activities, while $25 million (15 percent) of the budget of UNAIDS goes to coordinating the work of other agencies. Despite its institutional shortcomings, most authors agree that the UN\u201fs global presence, neutral status and legitimacy among developing countries make it a key element of the IAA. Because it is more representative than the IFIs, it has a comparative advantage as a forum for making policy and setting global norms and standards. Authors point to the role it played in the 20th century in developing international human rights norms, and more recently to its success in persuading both donor and recipient countries to sign up to the Millennium Development Goals. It also a natural home for addressing global public goods, such as climate change. A number of authors have called for the establishment of a new, high-level UN body, of equivalent rank to the Security Council, to take on overall governance of the international aid architecture. Dirk Messner, Simon Maxwell, Franz Nuscheler & Joseph Siegle, \u201cGovernance reform of the Bretton Woods Institutions and the UN Development System\u201d, Friedrich Ebert Stiftung Occasional Paper No. 18, May 2005 This paper proposes the establishment of a Council for Global Development and Environment, of equivalent rank to the Security Council, to replace ECOSOC. The Bretton Woods Institutions would be brought under the UN umbrella, retaining their operational autonomy, but answerable to the Council on overall policy direction and priorities. Like the Security Council, it would be a membership-based body, with 11 permanent and 11 non-permanent members (both divided between industrialised and developing countries) representing the regions of the world. It would also act as principal funding vehicle for the UN development system. Dervis, Kemal with Ceren Ozer, A Better Globalization: Legitimacy, Governance, and Reform (Washington, D.C.: Center for Global Development, 2005) Kemal Dervis offers a similar suggestion for a UN Economic and Social Security Council, also of equivalent rank to the Security Council, designed to bring the BWIs within the legitimising umbrella of the UN. It should be at a higher level than ECOSOC with a stronger mandate, making decisions based on weighted voting and constituencies (determined by population, GDP and contribution to the UN global budget). He proposes 14 council members, with representation by experts rather than ambassadors. It would not have executive decision-making power, but would elaborate policies and Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 48 guidelines for development agencies to avoid duplication, promote long-term cooperation and evaluate aid effectiveness. It would appoint the heads of the BWIs, based on transparent criteria and procedures. The current UN reforms are seeking to rationalise the UN development architecture at country level by creating a single Millennium Development Fund that would finance all country activities against a single country plan, based on the principle of the Four Ones (one leader, one programme and budget, one fund and one office). These reforms are a product of the UN High-Level Panel on System-Wide Coherence, which reported in 2006.

Within civil society, there have been fears that the move towards harmonised platforms for policy dialogue has narrowed the space available for cross-cutting issues. There are also fears that donors have concentrated their efforts on strengthening their relationships with partner country governments, at the cost of traditional partnerships with civil society. These concerns have not yet been subject to rigorous study. Arguably, the PD principles are as relevant to promoting cross-cutting issues as they are to any other area of development cooperation. It may be that the new structures for aid delivery offer promising new platforms for promoting cross-cutting themes. These questions have been the subject of debate within the OECD-DAC Networks (Gendernet, Govnet and Environet), and of recent workshops in Dublin and Bangkok (see below). DFID has commissioned a major research project \u201cSupport for strengthening the poverty impact of the Paris Declaration\u201d, which is designed to assess whether cross-cutting issues are being adequately addressed in national development plans and monitoring arrangements. By the time of Accra, a more informed debate should therefore be possible. Rosalind Eyben, \u201cGender equality and aid effectiveness \u2013 challenges and opportunities for international practice: experience from South East Asia\u201d, paper for the Bangkok workshop, April 2007 This paper is a report of Workshop on Aid Effectiveness and Gender Equality in South East Asia, Bangkok, April 2007, designed to deepen understanding of the challenges and opportunities for promoting gender equality through the new aid-effectiveness machinery. The workshop report presents lessons from case studies in Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam and Timor Leste. Workshop participants questioned how far the cause of gender equality is owned within most Asian societies and government, particular at lower levels. They called for more research and evidence on gender issues, including gender-disaggregated development statistics, in order to develop a more results-oriented approach. In Cambodia, a Technical Working Group on gender has promoted greater ownership, including establishing Gender Mainstreaming Action Groups in 21 of 26 line ministries. While the institutional machinery for mainstreaming gender is largely in place, actual impact on sector policies and budgets is still weak. In Vietnam, there are various bodies to promote gender equality, including the National Council for the Advancement of Women, but gender remains marginal to the central policy dialogue with donors. The Poverty Reduction Support Credit does not mainstream gender objectives, or attempt to assess the impact on gender equality of its policy initiatives. In Indonesia, there is a strong commitment to addressing gender issues like maternal health at the central level, but significant problems in ensuring these issues are prioritised across a decentralised system of government. The workshop concluded that (contrary to the views of many women\u201fs NGOs) the Paris Declaration is a potentially useful framework for making aid work better for women. However, some of the changes associated with the Paris agenda, such as the reduction in staff capacity associated with programmatic spending and the diversion of effort into technical aid-delivery issues, have reduced the space for gender work. Aid efficiency arguments tend to favour large programmes over small targeted interventions with civil society that may have greater impact on gender. There is a danger that Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 50 diversity and voice within development policy debates may be minimised, especially if gender advocates in civil society are not permitted a seat at the table. Cathy Gaynor, \u201cParis Declaration commitments and implications for gender equality and women\u201fs empowerment\u201d, paper commissioned by Irish Aid, 2006 Gaynor notes that gender has been marginal to the aid-effectiveness agenda. Reviews of PRSPs and SWAPs suggest that tend to be gender-blind, take a narrow perspective on gender, lack empirical evidence or fail to translate gender analysis into operational plans. It notes that, while the PD contains only passing reference to gender, its principles are generally supportive of gender equality objectives and strategies. Ownership implies that men\u201fs and women\u201fs voices are heard equally in the national development strategies. Alignment calls for donors to build country capacity to develop and implement policies on gender equality, and to align behind them. Harmonisation is a call to rationalise and focus donor support. Managing for results means capturing gender dimensions in performance assessment frameworks. Mutual accountability means giving women a voice on the policies that affect them.

UNIFEM discussion paper, \u201cPromoting gender equality in new aid modalities and partnerships\u201d, March 2006 This paper argues that mainstreaming of gender in the new aid architecture must include adequate financing of programmes for women, accountability systems to track donor and government contributions to gender equality, and gender-sensitive monitoring and reporting. It argues for including women in the definition of country ownership, for building incentives to make public administrations more responsive to women, for capacity-building for departments of women\u201fs affairs, and for the introduction of gender-sensitive indicators in PRSPs and policy matrices. DAC, \u201cAction-Oriented Policy Paper on Human Rights and Development\u201d, 2007 This paper argues that there should be a natural synergy between human rights and the PD.

At the same time, experiences and approaches from rights-based approaches to development can help to enrich the PD principles of ownership and mutual accountability.

It stressed that national ownership must extend beyond government to include parliaments, civil society and the public, and noted the importance of working with those who represent marginalised groups. It emphasised the importance of gender- and human rights-responsive budgeting, and Asia-Pacific Aid Effectiveness Portal February 2007 51 promoting budget literacy across society. It pointed out that instruments for harmonisation, such as Joint Assistance Strategies, can provide a key platform for promoting cross-cutting issues.
