A partir de abundantes conocimientos locales y tradicionales, las personas en las zonas rurales han comenzado a acomodarse a variaciones extremas del clima utilizando toda una serie de estrategias de adaptaci\u00f3n y de afrontar las amenazas. Las estrategias agr\u00edcolas de adaptaci\u00f3n incluyen la diversificaci\u00f3n de cultivos; plantar variedades de cultivos resistentes a sequ\u00edas, inundaciones y plagas; cultivar a m\u00e1s altura; practicar agricultura en curvas de nivel; plantar bamb\u00fa para prevenir la erosi\u00f3n de suelos; y construir canales temporales de drenaje. Las estrategias financieras para afrontar las amenazas incluyen, dedicarse a trabajo no agr\u00edcola; buscar otras fuentes de ingresos en el pa\u00eds y en el exterior; tomar pr\u00e9stamos de prestamistas, parientes y amigos; vender ganado; buscar asistencia financiera gubernamental; alquilar, vender o empe\u00f1ar las parcelas; y disminuir el consumo de alimentos. Con recursos y apoyo limitados, las agricultoras est\u00e1n organizando y formulando nuevas estrategias con el fin de asegurar sus Estudio de caso 1 / 244 medios de vida y el acceso a necesidades b\u00e1sicas. En particular, los miembros Mahan de las provincias de Rizal, Pampanga, Quez\u00f3n y Cotabato Sur, est\u00e1n participando cada vez m\u00e1s en iniciativas de agricultura org\u00e1nica, programas integrados de manejo de plagas, agro-silvicultura y proyectos de plantaci\u00f3n de \u00e1rboles. Las agricultoras que son miembros de Amihan en Montalban y Rizal, est\u00e1n comenzando a cultivar una variedad ind\u00edgena, tradicional, de arroz que no requiere dosis masivas de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos y pesticidas, y es m\u00e1s resistente a plagas que las variedades comerciales. Las mujeres tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n plantando \u00e1rboles frutales y vegetales en los surcos que separan las lagunas de arroz como forma de intercultivo. Mientras que esta pr\u00e1ctica alternativa de cultivar arroz solo da una cosecha al a\u00f1o, por otro lado respeta el medio ambiente y genera mucho menos GEI que los cultivos comerciales. Al mismo tiempo, adapta el cultivo del arroz a las prolongadas temporadas h\u00famedas que el cambio clim\u00e1tico produce. Desde el punto de vista de los campesinos pobres y de las mujeres, la protecci\u00f3n de sus medios de vida y fuentes de sustento est\u00e1 por encima de todo, y conlleva medidas de adaptaci\u00f3n que incorporan resistencia al clima en la agricultura y la pesca, aseguran el acceso de las personas a agua potable y a otras necesidades, y proporcionan seguridad y protecci\u00f3n social, entre otros.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "164794a8-0616-437e-a536-4ea3a866385c": {"__data__": {"id_": "164794a8-0616-437e-a536-4ea3a866385c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/manual-de-capacitacion-en-genero-y-cambio-climatico", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Manual de capacitaci\u00f3n en g\u00e9nero y cambio climatico", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/manual-de-capacitacion-en-genero-y-cambio-climatico", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b222a89cdfa73f4aa943f8bce5460c1573d3b1de4aaa5d4143cbfff310338c9f"}, "2": {"node_id": "313003c4-f5a6-4e55-97bd-fd4a655933d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/manual-de-capacitacion-en-genero-y-cambio-climatico", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "596ab4ec90b3378aa8f495e113f3307112c5e5e6798e3669eeca1d501657959e"}}, "hash": "91b4e7e22cf7f293125be3351c97041dcec0d90540d91fecc8193c2cc03df64e", "text": "Amihan tambi\u00e9n pide apoyo y fondos gubernamentales dirigidos hacia comunidades rurales, y en especial para mujeres rurales, que provean semillas org\u00e1nicas; fertilizantes y pesticidas; acceso a tecnolog\u00edas agr\u00edcolas asequibles; difusi\u00f3n de t\u00e9cnicas agroforestales y provisi\u00f3n de cr\u00e9ditos agr\u00edcolas con bajo inter\u00e9s; y planes de seguros de cultivos destinados de manera espec\u00edfica a peque\u00f1os agricultores. Adem\u00e1s en la actualidad, Amihan est\u00e1 cabildeando con el Congreso para que anule la Ley de Biocombustibles 2006. Esta organizaci\u00f3n considera que las plantaciones de jatropha, un cultivo importante para la producci\u00f3n de biocombustibles, requiere muchos insumos qu\u00edmicos que generar\u00edan resequedad de los suelos. Amihan tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 promoviendo la aprobaci\u00f3n de una ley de reforma agraria que buscar\u00eda promover dicha reforma, mediante el establecimiento de seguridad en la tenencia de la tierra y animar\u00eda a los campesinos a invertir en pruebas clim\u00e1ticas (as\u00ed como en abordar aspectos b\u00e1sicos de justicia y equidad). Adem\u00e1s, Amihan est\u00e1 comenzando un proceso de incidencia pol\u00edtica en torno al cambio clim\u00e1tico a nivel global. La respuesta del gobierno filipino ante los desaf\u00edos de adaptaci\u00f3n y mitigaci\u00f3n del cambio clim\u00e1tico se reflejan en sus pol\u00edticas en cuatro ejes principales: 1) promover inversiones en proyectos de energ\u00eda renovable como mega represas hidrol\u00f3gicas por medio de subsidios; 2) ampliar proyectos de MDL, y establecer a modo de prueba un sistema de comercio de carbono; 3) expandir la asistencia gubernamental para el desarrollo, pr\u00e9stamos y donaciones procedentes de pa\u00edses donantes as\u00ed como de instituciones financieras regionales e internacionales; y 4) cobrar cuotas a usuarios por algunos servicios ambientales, fomentando iniciativas del sector p\u00fablico y privado, y la privatizaci\u00f3n de empresas y tierras p\u00fablicas. Tambi\u00e9n hubo un par de proyectos de adaptaci\u00f3n con \u00e9nfasis en la agricultura. Por ejemplo, el Proyecto Filipino de Adaptaci\u00f3n al Cambio Clim\u00e1tico Fase 1 incluye el dise\u00f1o y medidas costo-efectivas de adaptaci\u00f3n en agricultura y gesti\u00f3n de recursos naturales. Si bien los beneficios de agrupar los riesgos y seguros contra las amenazas clim\u00e1ticas para apoyar los esfuerzos de adaptaci\u00f3n, se valoran cada vez m\u00e1s en la esfera internacional, estas \u00e1reas siguen estando relativamente subdesarrolladas en las Filipinas, debido en gran parte al escaso inter\u00e9s del sector privado.

Existen problemas importantes en cuanto a la respuesta del gobierno en sus pol\u00edticas y financiamiento de la mitigaci\u00f3n y la adaptaci\u00f3n. En primer lugar, la dependencia en m\u00e1s instrumentos de financiamiento con los que pueda adquirir m\u00e1s deudas para financiar los desaf\u00edos del cambio clim\u00e1tico, aumentar\u00e1 su ya elevado endeudamiento. Adem\u00e1s, el gobierno no reconoce que subsidiar proyectos de energ\u00eda renovable a gran escala, tales como las mega-represas hidrol\u00f3gicas podr\u00eda tener implicaciones adversas sociales y de g\u00e9nero. Al decidirlo as\u00ed, el gobierno ha pasado por alto otros proyectos de reducci\u00f3n de GEI tales como la gesti\u00f3n forestal comunitaria y planes de agro- silvicultura, con s\u00f3lidos resultados potenciales de alivio de la pobreza. Tambi\u00e9n ha olvidado concentrarse en medidas de adaptaci\u00f3n que podr\u00edan incorporar la resistencia al clima en la agricultura y la pesca, y con ello asegurar el acceso de las personas al agua y a otras necesidades. En segundo lugar, el gobierno ha optado por establecer un sistema de comercio de carbono en lugar de crear un impuesto nacional al carbono y a otras formas de contaminaci\u00f3n que podr\u00edan haber reducido las emisiones de GEI y tambi\u00e9n generar fondos p\u00fablicos para la adaptaci\u00f3n. Las investigaciones muestran que un impuesto nacional al carbono en Filipinas podr\u00eda no solo reducir la pobreza y aumentar el bienestar de sus ciudadanos, sino que tambi\u00e9n generar\u00eda ingresos para adaptaci\u00f3n que podr\u00edan mejorar la equidad de g\u00e9nero, en especial, si el financiamiento de la adaptaci\u00f3n se utilizara para apoyar el desarrollo rural. Por \u00faltimo, imponer pagos al usuario por servicios ambientales podr\u00eda tener un impacto regresivo en la distribuci\u00f3n e impedir que las mujeres rurales accedieran a dichos servicios.

Energ\u00eda y g\u00e9nero Busca establecer los v\u00ednculos entre cambio clim\u00e1tico, uso de energ\u00eda, relaciones de g\u00e9nero y los subsecuentes impactos en la vida cotidiana de mujeres pobres en \u00c1frica. El enfoque es amplio en el intento de proveer una perspectiva de la complejidad de los factores considerados en el an\u00e1lisis. Resalta la diferencia en el uso de la energ\u00eda en los pa\u00edses desarrollados y en desarrollo y entre hombres y mujeres, y explora el impacto del uso de la energ\u00eda sobre el cambio clim\u00e1tico. El sub-sector energ\u00e9tico m\u00e1s vulnerable es el de la biomasa, utilizado por el grupo m\u00e1s grande en la categor\u00eda de consumidores: las mujeres pobres. Annecke, W. (2002).

However, the world has progressively recognized that women and men experience climate change differently, and that gender inequalities worsen women\u2019s coping capacity. It has also been acknowledged that women are important actors of change and holders of significant knowledge and skills related to mitigation, adaptation, and the reduction of risks in the face of climate change, making them crucial agents in this area. Consequently, there is an urgent need to adopt a gender-responsive approach towards climate change policy making and programming. Linking climate change to human development remains an important challenge, particularly because climate change is perceived by many as a purely scientific or technical issue. This publication responds to the needs of policy makers and climate change scientists to understand and address better the gender dimensions of climate change. It clarifies the linkages between gender and climate change mitigation and adaptation. We are pleased to introduce and recommend this Training Manual, designed by the Global Gender and Climate Alliance (GGCA), as a practical tool to increase the capacity of policy and decision makers to develop gender-responsive climate change policies and strategies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "398b7340-d59b-47fa-944d-f861b6a8f6f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "398b7340-d59b-47fa-944d-f861b6a8f6f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e3b09749f3b0e51818622f2283d085e069d9169cf56dd51d24af03240bacaf6"}, "2": {"node_id": "60e5951e-810b-444b-b79c-61040f961305", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "093075a0e7a58e7857e9cbb31309c182f2aae0abbe8ffb65a97a2078ffd61f21"}}, "hash": "ae7a457ac1b0c4f685ee2ce96eb429fa8df0548332d8661d0d83d077ac44855e", "text": "At this crucial moment, on the way to negotiating the new international climate change strategy, this publication provides all actors with the essential knowledge and concrete guidance on how their actions on climate change can better answer the needs of women and men in developing countries.

Influencing climate change is directly linked with poverty eradication. Therefore, it is most important that we achieve a comprehensive new agreement on climate change before the end of 2009. The most important measures for mitigating climate change will be increasing the use of renewable energy, and reforestation, as well as halting the rate of deforestation. Adapting to climate change will affect agriculture, food security and water management in rural areas. Regenerative ecological agriculture can provide a good mitigation tool. Most of these livelihoods are traditionally women\u2019s tasks in developing countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6bd2d746-6363-482e-bdd3-3aeb8ce7d79f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6bd2d746-6363-482e-bdd3-3aeb8ce7d79f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76f4e7bdc4b7ae67c0e8e6fe695d8f03f677284ee4950e8c68f7b17da9bd95a4"}, "3": {"node_id": "414853df-2e21-443a-89c0-70746a1eaf43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05afc7e2e3c2461fcf60b8f54295a6e4d12aff080ea7bfd6e4e96bdf90b95085"}}, "hash": "e4e60fc2fb1a62fb72f32785169edcd8ef43cf07548d757d752c3f4e8b82a9db", "text": "In Africa, for instance, 80% of food production is managed by women. The analysis of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change indicates that the impacts will hit hardest the poorest regions and the poorest people who have the least resources for facing the changes brought by increasing droughts, floods or storms. Seventy percent of these poor are women. This means that poor women will have to struggle with the impacts of climate change. However, they can also be powerful agents of change. Empowerment of women in planning and decision making as well as implementing measures influencing climate change will make our common efforts more effective especially at the local level. This requires that men and women understand the process of climate change, and share information on counteracting its negative impacts. It will be important that women have equal access to knowledge, resources and technology, which are necessary in influencing climate change. Likewise it will be important that women participate more actively in the negotiations shaping the new comprehensive regime on climate change. Finland is pleased to cooperate with the Global Gender and Climate Alliance, and to support its work on empowering women in order to influence climate change. This manual is an important element in promoting the understanding of climate change, its impacts and gender dimensions. We hope that this increased understanding will strengthen cooperation and we call upon all governments, relevant international organizations and financing institutions, civil society and the private sector to take part.

Working Group on Review of Implementation of the CBD WHO World Health Organization WRI World Resources Institute WSSD World Summit on Sustainable Development 5 Introduction Introduction In November 2007, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Women\u2019s Environment and Development Organization (WEDO) participated in a meeting in Tepoztl\u00e1n, Mexico to explore a joint collaboration on the topic of gender and climate change. During the meeting, these institutions recognized the need for a coordinated strategy among global institutions working on this issue. This resulted in the establishment of the Global Gender and Climate Alliance (GGCA) which was formally launched on December 11, 2007 in Bali, Indonesia at the UN climate change conference. To date, more than 25 UN agencies and international civil society organizations have joined the Alliance. The primary goal of the GGCA is to ensure that climate change policies, decision making, and initiatives at the global, regional and national levels are gender-responsive. In recent years, the main decision makers involved in climate change initiatives, programmes and policy development, have acknowledged that they don\u2019t know enough about the links between gender equality and climate change. One of the primary challenges faced by an institution or government in addressing gender equality is isolation from other similar efforts and lack of experience. For example, in a 2006 UN survey of environmental ministries, governments cited lack of capacity and understanding on the topic of gender and environment, and specifically on gender and climate change, as a reason for not incorporating gender into their work. Among development and environmental institutions, and in the climate change arena in general, there is a need to develop a common understanding of the linkages between gender and climate change, using a language that policy makers and climate scientists can understand. The climate change arena would benefit from coordinated collaboration across sectors and institutions, and increased capacity and political commitment amongst policy makers, the UN system, civil society and the women\u2019s movement. Therefore, central to the GGCA\u2019s strategies is the need to build capacity at global, regional and local level to design and implement gender-responsive climate change policies, strategies and programmes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bde84d58-d8c2-4978-956b-65273f1b622b": {"__data__": {"id_": "bde84d58-d8c2-4978-956b-65273f1b622b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5abe9dfd382e1f17c52897e4a0262586c5d8bc38ad165bfe984a22a5ffc7067d"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ca018af-a352-48af-9439-9811d208e50e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0009e932c5a548adb105b7f77aaca86131743ba373ff6a1914b76628d0ad6508"}}, "hash": "59181b606715e2513b93e5c532d39678a6fae0f64c625d579e221e9769a2b5f3", "text": "To meet the demand for improving skills in gender and climate change, and to build up a pool of trainers in different regions and countries, the GGCA 6 has developed the present training manual.

The training manual draws on existing in-house materials (research data, analyses and extracts from international frameworks) that have been adapted or expanded but also includes newly compiled case studies to illustrate the concepts in each module. It presents key conceptual and methodological advances in gender relations in the context of climate change. The topics covered in this manual relate to the topics covered in the Bali Action Plan. How to use this manual The manual is modular: the trainer can choose topics and exercises according to the target group and the length of the training. The manual consists of the following modules: Module 1: Gender and gender mainstreaming Module 2: International law instruments as a framework for mainstreaming gender in climate change Module 3: Overview of gender issues and climate change Module 4: Gender mainstreaming in adaptation efforts Module 5: Gender-sensitive strategies for mitigation actions Module 6: Gender-sensitive strategies on technology development and transfer to support actions on mitigation and adaptation Module 7: Gender mainstreaming in climate change financing mechanisms Appendix: Annotated bibliography Each module contains: a description and analysis of the topic; an outline of the learning objectives of the module and how to carry out the exercises; an explanation of the activities, procedures and timing; handouts and exercises for distribution. At the end of the manual you will find additional material such as a bibliography, and an appendix with an annotated bibliography with the latest materials available on gender and climate change. 7 Introduction Notes for trainers A variety of different actors and stakeholders can be involved in the training: \u2022\ufffd Representatives from the Ministry of Environment \u2022\ufffd Representatives from the Ministry of Energy \u2022\ufffd Representatives from the National Risk Reduction Platforms Representatives from other Ministries, such as Agriculture, Finance, \u2022\ufffd etc. \u2022\ufffd The Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs/Gender \u2022\ufffd Parliamentarians \u2022\ufffd Researchers and academics \u2022\ufffd United Nations institutions \u2022\ufffd Civil society organizations Women\u2019s groups \u2022\ufffd All these representatives/entities carry out different activities, which result in different training needs. To make your gender and climate change training as successful as possible, you should take the following ten 1 steps into consideration: Target group 1. You must first define your target group. A training course designed for members of a women\u2019s activist group, who are not familiar with climate change issues, would contain different topics from a training course aimed at government officials working in the Ministry of Environment, who may conversely never have heard of basic gender concepts or gender analysis tools. If previous knowledge of potential target groups suggests they are too diverse, it is advisable not to bring them together in one training course, as you may need to cover too many different topics in detail, which may be less interesting for some participants. However, in some cases, a training course may provide a platform for an exchange of knowledge (e.g., between gender experts and climate change specialists in your country) and you may want to act more as a facilitator of this knowledge-sharing process than as a trainer. You should also take into 1 These steps have been adapted from Schneider, K. (2006). Manual for Training on Gender Responsive Budgeting. Eschborn, Germany: GTZ. 8 consideration the sex, age and social hierarchies of participants. Some people may, for example, feel too inhibited in the presence of their superiors to participate actively or contribute effectively to the training. Similarly, in some cultures, people may feel more comfortable with participating fully if women and men are provided opportunities to speak in separate spaces. Training needs assessment 2. Having decided on the target group, you must decide what potential participants in your training course need to know, and then find out what they already know. What they should know is largely dependent on their role in their institutions, and it is important to understand their needs before planning your course. A possible way to find out what the participants\u2019 needs are is by preparing a questionnaire that participants can fill out in advance of the training. Objectives of the training 3. Based on the training needs assessment, you need to define the objectives of the training. A training course may aim at sensitization and awareness raising, if the concept of gender and climate is completely new to participants. If participants already have some sound knowledge, then the objective may be to enable participants to define procedures and criteria to measure if gender considerations have been taken into account,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29cf6564-268e-4428-9597-738835fcaf05": {"__data__": {"id_": "29cf6564-268e-4428-9597-738835fcaf05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4efb4ee87d5157450d7606714178b69c995613f92397f67873a0c22fff9dd496"}}, "hash": "4efb4ee87d5157450d7606714178b69c995613f92397f67873a0c22fff9dd496", "text": "for example, in financial mechanisms. You also need to define how you expect the participants to use the information they are going to receive; this will allow you to fine-tune your messages. Choosing the length and timing of the training 4. Depending on the target group and the objectives of the training, you must decide on the length and timing of the course. Remember that some decision makers may only be able to take part in a brief session, and that some people/organizations are busier at certain times of the year. Therefore, you need to make sure you are transmitting the essential information in the most appropriate way, and at a suitable time, using the best methodology and approach. Choosing relevant topics to be covered 5. The choice of topics to be covered largely depends on the result of the training needs assessment, the objectives of the course and its intended length. 9 Introduction Do not try to put too many topics into one training course or session. Participants need to have sufficient time to discuss topics and to work on exercises. If you want to cover topics that you are not very familiar with, e.g., mitigation efforts in your country, you may consider inviting an expert for a specific session or to work closely with a co-facilitator whose knowledge complements yours. Defining the sequential order 6. When you draft your training programme, you must think of the sequential order of the topics you want to cover. The sessions should be coordinated, and you may need to lay out a sound foundation of the basics before moving on to more complicated topics. Choosing the training methods and media to be used 7. A variety of training methods are used in each of the modules. Trainers should take care to avoid lengthy lectures or large group discussions, always remembering that each individual learns in a different way. You should try to use as many of the following training methods as the length of the course allows: \u2022\ufffd Lectures by the trainer (using PowerPoint presentations, overhead projectors, etc.) \u2022\ufffd Background reading material \u2022\ufffd Group discussion \u2022\ufffd Exercises \u2022\ufffd Case studies \u2022\ufffd Role-plays \u2022\ufffd Buzz groups (usually small groups consisting of three to six people who are given an assignment to complete in a short time period) \u2022\ufffd Presentations by participants \u2022\ufffd Expert/ \u201chigh-profile\u201d guest speakers Videos \u2022\ufffd These different methods are useful for a variety of reasons. Group discussions, for instance, allow a common understanding of certain topics to develop, whereas lectures and background reading are appropriate means of conveying knowledge. Exercises, case studies and role-plays involve participants as actors and allow them to apply their newly gained knowledge, although they are more time-consuming. However, even for a one-day training course, you should prepare one or two exercises to keep participants interested throughout the training session. You may consider a discussion that applies 10 training concepts to \u201creal-world\u201d situations, in order to encourage ownership of the concepts learned. It is also important to consider who is delivering the message. Decision makers may be more receptive to a message coming from a well-known expert or high-profile presenter. For example you might want to have an intervention from a former prime minister or a Nobel Prize winner. Designing exercises 8. This manual provides a number of different exercises that you may want to use in your training course on gender and climate change. However, these exercises are merely intended as suggestions: you may choose to change them slightly to adapt them to your own purposes, or indeed to create your own, completely new exercises. Prepare handouts and background reading materials 9. You will also find handouts in the manual that you can copy and distribute in the course of your training. You may also want to consult some other useful manuals on gender and climate change and case studies from different countries, which are available on several websites. At the end of this manual you will find an appendix with an annotated bibliography listing additional reading material and useful websites. Information that is relevant to the context that the participants operate in on a daily basis, whether locally, nationally or regionally, will help the training sink in. 10. Evaluation At the end of every training course, you should ask participants to evaluate the training. The evaluation method can vary according to the length of the training course.

It cuts across other forms of inequality so that it is a feature of rich as well as poor groups, racially dominant as well as racially subordinate groups, privileged as well as \u2018untouchable\u2019 castes\u2026 gender inequality intersects with economic deprivation to produce more intensified forms of poverty for women than men. Gender inequality is part and parcel of the processes of causing and deepening poverty in a society and must therefore constitute part and parcel of measures to eradicate poverty (Kabeer, 2003). Key messages \u201cSex\u201d and \u201cgender\u201d are not the same: understand the crucial \u2022\ufffd difference; \u2022\ufffd Gender gaps/inequalities do exist: show available data and facts; \u2022\ufffd Understand the implications of gender gaps/inequalities, i.e., control over assets; Gender mainstreaming adds a \u201dhuman face\u201d to the climate change \u2022\ufffd agenda; It is essential to integrate gender concerns into planning and \u2022\ufffd implementation of climate change policies; \u2022\ufffd Gender concerns also highlight other inequalities i.e., class, ethnicity. 1.1 What is gender? The term \u201cgender\u201d refers to socially ascribed roles, responsibilities and opportunities associated with women and men, as well as the hidden power structures that govern relationships between them. Gender is \u201c... in essence, a term used to emphasize that sex inequality is not caused by the anatomic and physiological differences that characterize men and women, but rather by the unequal and inequitable treat ment socially accorded to them. In this sense, gender alludes to the cultural, social, economic and political conditions that are the basis of certain standards, values and behavioural patterns related to genders and their relationship\u201d (Riquer, 1993). Despite recent advances, it still remains the case that in most societies there are significant differences between the rights and opportunities of women and men. These include, among others, differences in relation to land and 14 resource rights, possibilities for advancement at work, salaries and opportunities to participate in and influence decision-making processes. The reality is that inequality between men and women is ingrained in social norms and values around the world. Overcoming these inequalities is one of the principal focuses of the international community. To the extent that gender-based analysis seeks to highlight inequalities and promote revision of law and policy, and most importantly of the process of their development, it will of necessity tend to focus primarily on women\u2019s issues (see Box 2). In doing so, it does not seek to invert inequalities but rather to eliminate them in an attempt to eradicate inefficiencies which undermine development and hamper the realization of global human rights. Box 1 Gender differences/gaps According to the best available data approximately 70% of those who live on less than a dollar each day are women. Women work two-thirds of the world\u2019s working hours yet receive only 10% of the world\u2019s income. Women own only 1% of the world\u2019s property. Women members of parliament globally average only 17% of all seats. Only 8% of the world\u2019s cabinet ministers are women. Seventy-five percent of the world\u2019s 876 million illiterate adults are women. Worldwide women received 78% of the wages received by men for the same work, although in some regions, they have a better educational background. In some parts of the world, the wage gap between women and men is close to 40%. Of the 550 million low-paid workers in the world, 330 million or 60% are women. In a sample of 141 countries over the period 1981\u20132002, it was found that natural disasters (and their subsequent impact) on average kill more women than men or kill women at an earlier age than men.

Gender equity means fairness of treatment for women and men, according to their respective needs. This may include equal treatment or treatment that is different but considered equivalent in terms of rights, benefits, obligations and opportunities. In the development context, a gender equity goal often requires built-in measures to compensate for the historical and social disadvantages of women. Hence, both gender equity and equality must be pursued in a complementary manner where gender equality is the ultimate goal. In other words, in order to achieve gender equality, it is often necessary to pursue gender equity measures. The achievement of gender equality is not a one-off goal. Because progress can all too easily be eroded, gender equity needs to be constantly promoted and actively sustained. Source: Aguilar et al., 2006. Overcoming inequalities and maximizing opportunities for full and effective participation of all sectors/ stakeholders of society in policy and legislative development and implementation, is considered crucial for achieving global sustainable development objectives and human rights. Addressing gender inequalities and promoting the adoption of a gender equality perspective in the development of law and policy is therefore seen as a route to enhancing the collective welfare of societies and the global community. Where gender inequalities are enshrined in cultural practices and/or national or customary law, resistance to change may be strong. This kind of resistance is in no small part exacerbated by fears that gains by women may signify loss by men of power, prestige and benefits. In order to make progress in the face of such realities, it is important to acknowledge these fears but frame the debate in terms of efficiency and advancement, allowing men to understand that achieving gender equality benefits not only women, but men as well. In order to achieve gender equality, there is a need to redress inequalities related to access to resources and promote equity in order to rectify the historical and social disadvantages experienced by women (see Box 2). 16 1.2 What is gender mainstreaming? \u201cMainstreaming\u201d is a process rather than a goal that consists in bringing what can be seen as marginal into the core business and main decision-making process of an organization (UNESCO, 2003). Box 3 Impediments to the mainstreaming of gen- der in policy making Gender is not viewed as a \u201ccore competence\u201d of policy-making bodies, either in the international development community or at national and local levels. There is thus a lack of gender expertise in these bodies. Where such expertise exists, it tends to be found in either: (a) the sectors traditionally associated with gender and women\u2019s issues; or (b) the programmes that directly address women\u2019s concerns or gender equality efforts. Limited consultation takes place with primary stakeholders. While having poor people participate directly in such consultations may take longer to achieve, the consultations have also failed to include, or have included in a very token way, organizations that work with the poor as well as those that work for gender equity goals. The ones consulted also tended to be those who already had a relationship with governments and donors. Source: Kabeer, 2003. Gender mainstreaming is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, policy or programme, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women\u2019s and men\u2019s concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies, initiatives and programmes. Thus, gender mainstreaming ensures that women and men benefit equally from the development process that or at least inequality is not perpetuated (ECOSOC, 1997). Gender mainstreaming is not only a question of social justice and human rights, but is necessary for ensuring equitable and sustainable human development by the most effective and efficient means. A gender-mainstreaming approach does not look at women in isolation, but instead assesses the situation of women and men \u2013 both as actors in the development process, and as its beneficiaries (ECOSOC, 1997). Rather than adding women\u2019s participation onto existing strategies and programmes, gender mainstreaming aims to transform unequal social and institu- tional structures, in order to make them profoundly responsive to gender. Gender 17 Module 1 mainstreaming, therefore, differs from a \u201cwomen in development\u201d approach in that its starting point is a thorough and rigorous analysis of the development situation, rather than a priori assumptions about women\u2019s roles and problems. Experience has shown that gender issues differ according to country, region and contextual circumstances. At the same time, experience has also shown that rigorous, gender-sensitive", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3815b8e7-181d-4f5a-89de-5b9d40f4c5a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3815b8e7-181d-4f5a-89de-5b9d40f4c5a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ab1a337d4d6e726764042287863fe1f7a08eaed7883105ca01b2e5749038576"}, "3": {"node_id": "6425adcf-e43b-4a84-a60f-4d62b23c850a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed3120b92c11577ed97564cf8be345c8582fe22d3bfaa7c86c142085fbd6e170"}}, "hash": "709afc24becfb201e58eb705a3de01bd863c5281f0c6a784b37b0d757494bb77", "text": "analysis invariably reveals gender-differentiated needs and priorities, as well as gender inequalities in terms of opportunities and outcomes. Gender mainstreaming seeks to redress these problems (Aguilar et al., 2007). The use of a gender equality perspective requires analysis and understanding of the different roles and responsibilities, needs and visions of women and men, as well as their respective levels of participation and influence in decision making. It goes beyond mere recognition of differences towards building more equitable relations between women and men. These principles have informed UN mandates on gender mainstreaming. In 2005, for example, the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) adopted a resolution with a view to ensuring the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in all the policies and programmes of the United Nations system. The ECOSOC resolution calls upon \u201call entities of the United Nations system, including United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, to intensify efforts to address the challenges involving the integration of gender perspectives into policies and programmes, including steps such as developing action plans for gender mainstreaming, incorporating gender into programme budgets, training on gender issues for staff, and gender analysis for policy and programme work\u201d (see full list in Module 2). Two fundamental impediments to the mainstreaming of gender have been identified in a seminal study on gender and poverty eradication (Kabeer, 2003). These are lack of core competence of policy-making bodies, and limited consultation with primary stakeholders (see Box 3). 1.3 Women\u2019s special condition In applying a gender perspective, attention needs to be given to what has been called women\u2019s \u201cspecial condition,\u201d i.e., the social, economic and cultural factors and mechanisms which keep women in a situation of disadvantage and subordination with regard to men (see Box 4). 18 Box 4 Women\u2019s special condition Women\u2019s special condition consists of social, economic and cultural factors and mechanisms that maintain women in a situation of disadvantage and subordination with regard to men. Such subordination is expressed in varying manners depending on the historical and cultural context. Women\u2019s condition as a conceptual and operational tool for analysis entails consideration of material status, or the level to which their \u201cpractical needs\u201d are met, such as access to water, electricity, housing, health care, employment and income-generating services. This concept connects women\u2019s material wellbeing to the specific circumstances surrounding her social environment and the roles and responsibilities that society accords to women.

In relation to climate change governance, this may include establishment of special measures to facilitate women\u2019s access to information, technologies, and participation in the definition of financing mechanism procedures, among others. Eradicating discriminatory practices and developing meaningful opportunities for women\u2019s participation at all levels of decision making will take time and effort. It will require commitment on the part of decision makers and women themselves. Securing this commitment will require the adoption of policy and legislative measures to ensure that women\u2019s participation and consultations with women provide them with an opportunity to affect the outcome of decision-making processes. Developing such processes and ensuring consistency and continuity in regard to gender equality and equity, requires mainstreaming gender in policy making at all levels. 19 Module 1 Social Watch.

Its DSAP programme \u2013 Development of Sustainable Agriculture in the Pacific \u2013 has worked across 17 Pacific nations. In the atolls, the DSAP focused on identifying problems and testing technologies with farmers to improve their traditional agricultural systems. Traditionally, the farmers used tree crop-based multi-storey agricultural systems. DSAP worked to integrate livestock into these systems. In the lowlands, the emphasis moved from research to identification and promotion of promising technologies, such as improved crop varieties, pest and disease management, land conservation and agroforestry technologies. DSAP also deploys communication outreach tools to better promote project efforts within member countries, for example, the use of radio, and the production and use of posters, handbooks, brochures and videos at a national level. The project was designed on a model that encourages country-level planning, implementation and coordination. This has been achieved by establishing National Steering Committees (NSCs) involving a range of relevant stakeholders from both government and civil society. The primary beneficiaries are men and women farmers in Pacific Island Countries, and many local communities, comprising thousands of people, are likely to have benefited. The initiative\u2019s focus on better environmental and natural resource management for improved agriculture and sustainable livelihoods, has resulted in spin-off benefits for both disaster risk reduction, especially in reducing risks associated with climate change, and gender equity and equality in the region. Considering that Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have a high vulnerability to climate change, the programme has included climate change adaptation measures such as improvements to the quality of soil, more use of drought-resistant or saltwater-resistant crops, improved irrigation systems, better management of pests and diseases, evaluation of tissue plant cultures, terraced and planted hillsides to prevent landslides and run-off, and support for widespread home gardens for better access to nutritious food. The use of a participatory needs assessment approach to improve sustainable agricultural production and food security has been key to success in mainstreaming gender while also addressing the challenges of hazards Case study 1 / Module 1 22 such as drought, flooding, rising sea levels, and other hazards that climate change is predicted to intensify. DSAP has used its Participatory Rural Approach (PRA) model to identify the needs of women, men and youth throughout the community. For example, men and women plant and work with different crops in different islands. This consultative process listened to local needs, in order to find the right tools and appropriate technologies in response. The project worked at the national and at the community level, and involved all stakeholders in a participatory consultative process. Gender perspectives are embedded in the approach. The setting up of national mechanisms to ensure that all relevant stakeholders have been involved in the project has taken time, involving a considerable investment in regional, national and local consultations. This has been followed by a painstaking process of establishing sustainable linkages with rural communities, developing their trust and understanding. However, the benefits of this approach are now being realized at the country and community level, in that the right agricultural technologies have been identified and adopted to overcome the right problems, improving production. In 2007 the DSAP Programme was awarded the SPC Gender Award for its significant efforts to integrate women as well as youth in its activities into many different ways, including its recruitment process and its capacity-building activities using gender indicators as a means of measuring women\u2019s participation. The project also includes other measures to ensure that gender is included throughout the implementation of the initiatives, such as: (1) appointment of gender focal points and an advisory board; (2) design and implementation of gender sensitivity training to staff and members to incorporate gender analysis approaches; (3) capacity building of both men and women from the communities; and (4) promotion of technological training and participation of women, among others. DSAP has been implemented in: Fiji, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, Kiribati,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2bb546cf-12a2-4e28-89a4-f7a93490ec49": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bb546cf-12a2-4e28-89a4-f7a93490ec49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e68514937d3110bca455bcf311f8960067711f9af7fe04f6419405531f65b2e"}, "3": {"node_id": "2bcb43a5-73b9-48d3-813f-7ef2cce4c878", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2189d7618526d50d6c64b3f04ae9c5b83f06bee1d24bfc635904897677a7107d"}}, "hash": "8530009163eb9bee71ecbc066432c6400656ac6f46b490f53929cb004744cfb7", "text": "Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Wallis and Futuna.

UNEP has played a pioneering role in linking women and environment since 1985, when it held a special session on women and the environment at the Third World Conference on Women held in Nairobi. Also, the XVII, XVIII and XIX sessions of the Governing Council of UNEP highlighted the role of women in environment and development. After the appointment of a gender focal point in 1999, UNEP submitted a report to the Governing Council at its twentieth session on the role of women in environment and development (UNEP/GC.20/10). The UNEP programme of work 2004\u20132005 included a commitment to make gender a cross-cutting priority in all of its programmes. In the domain of international environmental governance, the Bali Strategic Plan for Technology Support and Capacity- building, 2004, requests UNEP \u201cto integrate specific gender-mainstreaming strategies, as well as education and training for women, in formulating relevant policies, and to promote the participation of women in environmental decision-making.\u201d In 2004, pursuant to the Global Women\u2019s Assembly on the Environment: Women as the Voice for the Environment, Governing Council decision 23/11 on gender equality in the field of the environment underlined the need to improve UNEP\u2019s internal capacity in these respects. Despite these many isolated efforts towards gender equity and equality, for many years, governments and civil society organizations, both at the national and international levels, have been requesting that UNEP define a strategy in relation to gender. The UNEP Gender Plan of Action (2006), which outlines a framework for integrating a gender perspective within all UNEP divisions, branches, units and activities during the period 2006\u20132010, is the result of a series of inputs: the analysis of UNEP\u2019s current performance in gender and the environment, including interviews with UNEP senior staff and an analysis of more than 40 internal documents. It is also based on a review of the implementation of plans of action of similar institutions and international partners. The plan was elaborated with the support of IUCN and the Women\u2019s Environment and Development Organization (WEDO). It constitutes UNEP\u2019s continuing response to the global commitments of the last decades, its compliance with recommendations of international fora and major mandates within the UN system. The Gender Plan of Action was reviewed at a senior management workshop on 30 June 2006, and was subsequently presented to UNEP staff at a meeting on 3 July 2006. At the workshop, UNEP Executive Director, Achim Steiner, expressed his full commitment to implementing the Plan of Action, stating that gender mainstreaming at UNEP was required by numerous mandates and that undertaking such work was not optional. Case study 2 / Module 1 24 The content of this document is also a reflection of the increasing awareness that gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment are important prerequisites for environmental conservation and sustainable development. UNEP\u2019s Gender Plan of Action reads: \u201cGender mainstreaming has been the primary methodology for integrating a gender approach into any development or environmental effort. Gender mainstreaming is intended to bring the diverse roles and needs of women and men to bear on the development agenda. Rather than adding women\u2019s participation and a gender approach onto existing strategies and programmes, gender mainstreaming aims to transform unequal social and institutional structures in order to make them profoundly responsive to gender. Achieving gender equality and equity is a matter of shifting existing power relationships to benefit those that are less empowered.\u201d This Plan of Action defines the role that UNEP will play in stimulating and facilitating efforts, both in-house and with partners at the national, regional and global levels, to overcome constraints and take advantage of opportunities to promote gender equality and equity within the environmental sector.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2bcb43a5-73b9-48d3-813f-7ef2cce4c878": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bcb43a5-73b9-48d3-813f-7ef2cce4c878", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e68514937d3110bca455bcf311f8960067711f9af7fe04f6419405531f65b2e"}, "2": {"node_id": "2bb546cf-12a2-4e28-89a4-f7a93490ec49", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8530009163eb9bee71ecbc066432c6400656ac6f46b490f53929cb004744cfb7"}}, "hash": "2189d7618526d50d6c64b3f04ae9c5b83f06bee1d24bfc635904897677a7107d", "text": "It has been defined as a changing document that will continue to evolve according to institutional, political, and global and regional realities.

To increase the quality and efficiency of UNEP\u2019s work in environmental conservation and promotion of sustainable development. The implementation of this Plan has already begun and several of the organizational measures recommended have already been accomplished: first, with the appointment of a Senior Gender Adviser; second, with the formation of a group of 15 gender focal points in UNEP\u2019s offices and divisions; and third, having each Regional Office develop and implement its own gender plan of action independently. These new efforts will not only benefit thousands of men and women worldwide, but will also enhance the execution of UNEP\u2019s mission, since the Plan establishes strategies with reachable targets and proposes instruments to address gender concerns in UNEP technical areas.

Opened for signature at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the CBD is the international framework for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and the equitable sharing of its benefits. The Executive Secretary of the CBD has placed great importance on the fact that gender equality is a prerequisite to poverty eradication and sustainable development. The livelihoods of rural and indigenous peoples and those of communities living in poverty are often closely tied to the use and conservation of biodiversity. In these communities, women play a leading role in caring for their families and communities, in sharing their intellectual and social capital, and in protecting and managing biodiversity resources. In many societies, women as well as men are agents of change, but their contributions do not receive equal recognition. Gender equality between women and men has a cumulative effect of improved biodiversity management and protection, and poverty alleviation for communities. The commitment of the CBD to mainstreaming gender considerations throughout its work started in March 2007, as the Executive Secretary appointed a Gender Focal Point in line with the internal mandates. Then, from 16\u201318 January 2008 in Geneva, the Secretariat of the Convention and the Senior Gender Adviser of IUCN carried out a workshop to elaborate the CBD Gender Plan of Action. The CBD Gender Plan of Action has been drafted on the basis of: an analysis of the current performance of CBD in the area of gender and biodiversity; a survey conducted among CBD staff; and a workshop with staff from divisions within the CBD Secretariat and with the participation of resource persons from UNEP, WEDO, the Global Environment Facility Small Grants Programme (GEF-SGP) and UNDP. The Plan is also based on a review of the implementation of the action plans of similar institutions and international partners, including UNEP and IUCN. This Plan of Action defines the role that the CBD Secretariat will play in stimulating and facilitating efforts, both in-house and with partners at the national, regional and global levels, to overcome constraints and take advantage of opportunities to promote gender equality. It is also a reflection of the increasing awareness that gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment are important prerequisites for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. A presentation of the plan was made to delegates at the Sixth Meeting of the Working Group on Access and Benefit Sharing (WG ABS 6) and then approval of the Gender Plan of Case study 3 / Module 1 26 Action was formalized as a decision of the Ninth Conference of the Parties (COP 9) of the CBD held in Bonn, 19\u201330 May 2008. The decision of the COP reads: \u201cThe Conference of the Parties welcomes the development by the Executive Secretary of the Gender Plan of Action under the Convention on Biological Diversity, (UNEP/ CBD/COP/9/INF/12/Rev.1), and invites Parties to support the implementation of the Plan by the Secretariat.\u201d This Plan pursues four strategic objectives: \u2022\ufffd To mainstream a gender perspective into the implementation of the Convention and the associated work of the CBD Secretariat; \u2022\ufffd To promote gender equality in achieving the three objectives of the CBD and the 2010 Biodiversity Target; \u2022\ufffd To demonstrate the benefits of gender mainstreaming in biodiversity conservation, sustainable use and benefit sharing from the use of genetic resources; and \u2022\ufffd To increase the effectiveness of the work of the CBD Secretariat. The period of implementation of the actions proposed is from 2008\u20132012.

Once identified, the person who filled out the poster writes his 5. or her name on it and pays the reward. The posters should then be taped to the wall for all to see. 6. Instruments and techniques I. Introduction techniques Note: There are several useful methodologies to break the ice and/or encourage the participants to get to know each other. One way would be to pair people and ask them to introduce each other. In cases where participants are likely to dominate the floor/take too much time to present, the facilitator may want to use the \u201cmatch technique\u201d where presenters are asked to make their presentations while they burn a match. This gives equal time to all presenters, and may be particularly useful when addressing high-level government officials. 31 Instruments and techniques / Module 1 Introduction of gender-related concepts Instruments and techniques II. Techniques for introducing gender concepts Objective: Introduce gender-related concepts Materials: Concepts and definitions, box and masking tape Procedure: Before the course, write out the concepts and definitions on 1. separate pieces of paper (see box below). Place all the papers in a box. 2. Explain that the assignment is intended to draw attention to 3. some gender concepts. 32 Gender refers to roles, responsibilities, rights, relationships and identities of men and women that are defined or ascribed to them within a given society and context \u2013 and how these roles, responsibilities and rights and identities of men and women affect and influence each other. These roles, etc., are changeable over time, between places and within places. Gender division of labour concerns the allocation of the tasks and responsibilities of men and women at home, at work and in society according to patterns of work that are felt to be acceptable in a particular place and time. Gender equality refers to equal rights, voice, responsibilities and opportunities for men and women in society, at work and in the home. Gender equity refers to fairness between men and women in access to society\u2019s resources, including socially valued goods, rewards and opportunities. Gender gaps refer to societal differences between men and women that are felt to be undesirable. Gender mainstreaming refers to the consideration of gender equality concerns in all policy, programme, administrative and financial activities, and in organizational procedures, thereby contributing to organizational transformation.

Gendered access to resources, facilities, services, funds, benefits and decision making refers to the differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s rights and opportunities to make use of these resources and to take part in decision making, due to norms and values existing in a particular place and time. Gendered control over resources and decision-making processes refers to differences between women\u2019s and men\u2019s rights and power to decide on the use of resources, gain benefits, and take part in decision-making processes, due to norms and values existing in society.

Sex refers to the biological nature of being male or female. The biological characteristics of men and women are universal and obvious. Sex roles are those that are bound to one particular sex due to biological factors, for example, giving birth. Women\u2019s empowerment refers to the process in which women reflect upon their reality and question the reasons for their situation in society. It includes developing alternative options and taking opportunities to address existing inequalities. It enables them to live their lives in the fullness of their capabilities and their own choices in respect of their rights as human beings. In the Beijing Declaration, it was agreed that \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment and their full participation on the basis of equality in all spheres of society, including participation in the decision-making process and access to power, are fundamental for the achievement of equality, development and peace.\u201d1 Source: UNDP.

Techniques for introducing gender concepts Objective: Introduce gender differences/gaps and understand some of the causes and possible solutions Materials: Handout 1: Analysis of gender differences/gaps, marker pens and flip charts Procedure: Divide the participants into groups and appoint a leader in 1. each group. Ask the leader of the group to read out the statements. 2. If the participants are aware of other gaps they can include 3. them on the list. 38 Handout 1: Analysis of gender differences/gaps According to the best available data approximately 70% of those who live on less than a dollar each day are women. Women work two-thirds of the world\u2019s working hours yet receive only 10% of the world\u2019s income. Women own only 1% of the world\u2019s property. Women members of parliament globally average only 17% of all seats. Only 8% of the world\u2019s cabinet ministers are women. Seventy-five percent of the world\u2019s 876 million illiterate adults are women. Worldwide women received 78% of the wages received by men for the same work, although in some regions, they have a better educational background. In some parts of the world, the wage gap between women and men is close to 40%. Of the 550 million low-paid workers in the world, 330 million or 60% are women. In a sample of 141 countries over the period 1981\u20132002, it was found that natural disasters (and their subsequent impact) on average kill more women than men or kill women at an earlier age than men. Sources: Social Watch Gender Equity Index, 2007 and 2008; Oxfam, 2007; Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper, 2007; and ILO, 2008. Ask the groups to identify the causes of the gaps and possible 4. actions to overcome them. Participants should write their answers on the flip charts provided. Ask each group to present their results. If possible, provide 5. additional information on the causes and possible ways to overcome them. Finally, ask the participants what they have learned from the 6. assignment. Note: If time is limited, the facilitator can prepare a quiz in PowerPoint to present to the group and generate discussion.

Note: The facilitator should remind the participants once again that understanding the different gender impacts allows the participants to look at climate change issues with a HUMAN FACE. 43 Module 2 Module 2: International law instruments as a framework for mainstreaming gender in climate change1 In the past three decades numerous international instruments have been generated to ensure gender equality and non-discrimination against women and to adopt measures related to sustainable development. This includes declarations, conventions, platforms, action plans, resolutions and agreements. They reflect the evolution of ideas and trends that guide the thinking and action of States, international organizations, academia and civil society (Aguilar et al., 2008).

Climate change impacts affect environment, human rights, sustainable development, health and all sectors of society. Positive action, if taken in these areas, could decrease pressure from climate change. Even though the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol lack specific language related to gender, there are numerous international legal instruments that mandate the incorporation of the gender perspective which also apply to the existing climate change framework. The importance of mainstreaming gender equality for the realization of human rights, sustainable development and/or poverty eradication and disaster reduction has been recognized in a series of international instruments. 1 The discussion on legal instruments draws heavily upon: Tobin, B. and Aguilar, L. (2007). Mainstreaming Gender Equality and Equity in ABS Governance; and Aguilar, L. [In press]. Putting Words into Action\u2026Analysis of the Status of Gender Mainstreaming in the Main Multilateral Environmental Agreements. 44 These include Agenda 21 (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, 1992); the World Conference on Human Rights (1993); the Beijing Platform for Action (4th World Conference on Women, 1995); the 1997 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW); the Millennium Declaration (2000); the Johannesburg Plan of Imple- mentation (World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), 2002); the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD); the UN Conven- tion to Combat Desertification (UNCCD); and the Hyogo Frame- work for Action (World Conference on Disaster Reduction, 2005). There are also internal mandates within the UN that call for the mainstreaming of gender. These include resolutions from the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) as well as from the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). Human rights instruments and environmental laws and policies of regional organizations such as the Organization of American States, the European Council, the United African Organization and national laws in individual states may also serve as \u201c\u2026means to call upon governments to fulfil their obligations in terms of gender equity\u201d (Garc\u00eda, 1999). 2.1 Human rights as a starting point International human rights play an important role in promoting gender equality and equity.

Principles of equality and protection against discrimination are enshrined in major human rights instruments including: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which accords protection \u2022\ufffd to the rights of women, prohibits discrimination and accords equality before the law.2 The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which \u2022\ufffd prohibits discrimination,3 promotes equality of women\u2019s and men\u2019s rights4 and equality before the law.5 The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, \u2022\ufffd which prohibits discrimination,6 and calls for equality of women and men regarding the rights recognized by the Covenant. These instruments, though not legally binding by themselves, are highly influential and together with CEDAW establish a clear prohibition on discrimination. Their relevance for climate change efforts is: to further define the obligations of states to ensure that any laws and policies adopted in this area fully respect the rights of women to equal treatment before the law; to reinforce any obligations on states to secure fair and equitable distribution of benefits (funds, technology, information) and to ensure women\u2019s participation in decision making regarding adaptation and mitigation initiatives, policies and mechanisms. 2.1.1 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) CEDAW is the principal instrument for the protection of women\u2019s rights, adopted in 1979 by the General Assembly of the United Nations.7 An Optional Protocol to CEDAW, adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1999, came into effect December 22, 2000.8 The Optional Protocol establishes 2 Article 7. 3 Article 2.1. 4 Article 3. 5 Article 26. 6 Article 2.2. 7 As of September 2007 CEDAW had been ratified by 185 countries (ratifications, accessions and successions): http://www. ohchr.org/english/law/cedaw.htm. 8 As of September 2007, 90 countries had ratified the Optional Protocol to CEDAW. 46 procedures whereby women may file complaints requesting investigation of violations of rights. CEDAW, commonly referred to as a bill of rights for women, seeks to promote adoption of measures to secure elimination of different forms (and levels) of discrimination against women. CEDAW defines discrimination against women as: \u201cany distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field\u201d.9 Even if an action, law or policy were not intended to discriminate, it may be discriminatory if such is its effect (Facio, 1996). In its preamble, CEDAW states that State Parties are bound to guarantee men and women equal opportunities in terms of economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights.", "start_char_idx": null,

without any discrimination, the opportunity to represent their Governments at the international level and to participate in the work of international organizations\u201d.16 The cumulative effect of these provisions is to create obligations on countries to ensure that women are granted equal opportunities and the conditions necessary to enable their: participation in decision making; negotiation of climate change agreements; and equitable participation in access to financial mechanisms and technologies. They may also be interpreted as requiring states to ensure the fullest possible participation of women in law and policy making at the international level, where such laws and policies are necessary to prevent discrimination. National implementation of CEDAW has occurred at various levels including incorporation in constitutional law. The Ugandan and South African constitutions, for example, contain significant provisions based on the Convention\u2019s principles which guarantee women\u2019s equality.17 The courts have also begun to develop jurisprudence on gender equality with reference to CEDAW\u2019s provisions. A presentation by the UN Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, on the 25th anniversary of CEDAW\u2019s adoption, drew attention to a number of cases in which courts had relied on the Convention. This included: decisions by the Supreme Courts of Nepal, directing the government to submit legislation to Parliament to address discriminatory laws; the Constitutional Court of Guatemala upholding a challenge to the penal code, which has provisions treating men and women differently; and a decision of the High Court of Tanzania that overruled elements of customary law which denied women the right to inherit and sell land.18 These cases demonstrate the preparedness of courts to reference the Convention in a wide range of issues. It is conceivable that cases regarding climate change issues may well appear before courts based upon discrimination against women, for example relating to access to financial mechanisms and technologies, or the right to participate in decision-making processes. 14 Article 14.2(g). 15 Article 13(b). 16 Article 8. 17 Statement by Ms Rachel Mayanja, Assistant Secretary-General, Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the work of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, New York, 23 July 2007. 18 Ibid. 48 It is important to point out that of the 195 Parties and Observer States to the UNFCCC, only eight have not signed CEDAW.19 This demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of Parties to the UNFCCC have already made commitments to gender equality and their international law by being part of CEDAW. 2.1.2 Gender and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples On 13 September 2007, after more than 20 years of negotiation, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (DECRIPS) was finally adopted. It received 143 votes in favour, four votes against (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA) and 11 abstentions (Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burundi, Colombia, Georgia, Kenya, Nigeria, Russian Federation, Samoa and Ukraine). Although the UN Declaration is not a legally binding instrument it will be highly influential in defining the position to be taken within the debates and regulations under any type of agreement related to climate change. DECRIPS specifically prohibits discrimination against women,20 providing that all the rights and freedoms recognized in the declaration be guaranteed equally to male and female indigenous people.21 This sets a standard which should inform the implementation of the Declaration. The Preamble to DECRIPS acknowledges the importance of indigenous knowledge, cultures and traditional practices for sustainable and equitable development and proper management of the environment.22 DECRIPS recognizes indigenous peoples\u2019 rights over the lands, territories and resources they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired.23 DECRIPS also recognizes that \u201cindigenous peoples have the right to participate in decision making in matters which would affect their rights\u2026\u201d.24 Based on these provisions, for DECRIPS to be fully implemented will require the recognition of the role of women in climate change adaptation and mitigation initiatives and policies. Since women will be (and are) affected by climate change, their needs and interests need to be reflected at the community, 19 They are Iran, Nauru, Palau, Tonga, Sudan, Somalia and Qatar.

Potential difficulties may arise in reconciling DECRIPS provisions prohibiting discrimination and those relating to self-determination. Amongst the rights that may conflict with a gender equality approach to implementation of the declaration are the right to define the responsibilities of the individual to the community, to apply customary law to regulate community affairs, and to choose representatives to participate in decision making.25 Finding the balance between individual and collective rights in a manner which enhances cultural integrity while securing the integrity of women\u2019s rights, is a challenge that will require open-mindedness, willingness to compromise and change, and commitment from all parties. 2.2 Gender equality Within the United Nations there have been a series of mandates to ensure that gender equality principles are mainstreamed in the work that the institution is supporting. In July 2005, at its 39th plenary meeting, ECOSOC adopted the resolution \u201cMainstreaming a Gender Perspective into All Policies and Programmes in the United Nations System.\u201d This resolution calls upon \u201call entities of the United Nations system, including United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, to intensify efforts to address the challenges involving the integration of gender perspectives into policies and programmes, including: Developing action plans with clear guidelines on the practical \u2022\ufffd implementation of gender mainstreaming; Fully incorporating a gender perspective into programme budgets; \u2022\ufffd Ensuring continuous awareness raising and training on gender issues \u2022\ufffd for all staff; Requiring gender analysis for both policy formulation and \u2022\ufffd programmatic work; Ensuring commitment by senior management to gender \u2022\ufffd mainstreaming; 25 Tobin, 2007. 50 Strengthening accountability systems for gender mainstreaming; \u2022\ufffd Continuing to support governments and to work with civil society in \u2022\ufffd their efforts to implement the Beijing Platform for Action; Development and institutionalization of monitoring and evaluation \u2022\ufffd tools and gender-impact analysis methodologies, promoting the collection, compilation and analysis of sex-disaggregated data; and Promoting mainstreaming of gender perspectives into key macro- \u2022\ufffd economic and social development policies and national development programmes.\u201d Furthermore, the 52nd session of the Commission on the Status of Women (2008) identified gender and climate change as its key emerging issue. Specific provision on Financing for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women urged governments to: \u201cIntegrate a gender perspective in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation and reporting of national environmental policies, strengthen mechanisms and provide adequate resources to ensure women\u2019s full and equal participation in decision making at all levels on environmental issues, in particular on strategies related to climate change and the lives of women and girls\u201d.26 2.3 Disaster risk reduction The Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), which resulted from the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe, Japan (2005), includes the principal mandate in relation to gender equality and empowerment of women in the context of disaster risk reduction. This Framework for Action, adopted by 168 states, sets a clear expected outcome - the substantial reduction of disaster losses, in lives as well as the social, economic and environmental assets of communities and countries - and lays out a detailed set of priorities to achieve this by 2015. An important feature of the HFA is its legally non-binding character, which allows it to set out a well-grounded set of technical and organizational requirements for reducing disaster risks, while leaving the details of its implementation to the decision of governments and relevant organizations, according to their needs and capacities. The HFA emphasizes that disaster risk reduction is a central issue 26 Resolution 21(jj) (E/CN.6/2008/L.8). 51 Module 2 for development policies, in addition to being of interest to in various scientific, humanitarian and environmental fields.

In the guiding principles for developing risk reduction strategies, the document specifies: \u201cGender is a core factor in disaster risk and in the implementation of disaster risk reduction. Gender is a central organizing principle in all societies, and therefore women and men are differently at risk from disasters. In all settings - at home, at work or in the neighbourhood - gender shapes the capacities and resources of individuals to minimize harm, adapt to hazards and respond to disasters. It is evident from past disasters that low-income women and those who are marginalized due to marital status, physical ability, age, social stigma or caste are especially disadvantaged.

For these reasons it is necessary to identify and use gender-differentiated information, to ensure that risk reduction strategies are correctly targeted at the most vulnerable groups and are effectively implemented through the roles of both women and men\u201d (UNISDR 2007, 5). To support national governments in achieving the goals for risk reduction, the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) Secretariat convenes global platforms (June 2007, June 2009) to monitor progress and discuss emerging disaster threats, such as climate change. 2.4 Gender and sustainable development At the international level, gender issues have been raised in numerous summits and conferences,30 and there is explicit reference to the rights of women in a range of international instruments.31 Among these have been a number of global sustainable development agreements including Agenda 21, the WSSD Plan of Implementation, the CBD and the UNCCD, which make commitments on gender and women. The relationship between women and environment has also arisen in relation to international agreements on women and gender equality, such as the Beijing Platform for Action and its ten-year review, and the Millennium Declaration. 2.4.1 Agenda 21 Agenda 21, which establishes a blueprint for sustainable development, was adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, in R\u00edo de Janeiro in 1992. It includes a complete chapter (24) entitled \u201cGlobal Action for Women towards Sustainable Development\u201d, which calls upon governments to make the necessary constitutional, legal, administrative, cultural, social and economic changes in order to eliminate all obstacles to women\u2019s full involvement in sustainable development and in public life. 30 These include: Children\u2019s World Summit (New York, 1990); United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, (R\u00edo de Janeiro, 1992); World Conference on Human Rights (Vienna, 1993); International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo, 1994); World Summit on Social Development (Copenhagen, 1995); Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995); Second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Istanbul, 1996); World Summit on Food (Rome, 1996); and United Nations Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court (Rome, 1998). 31 These include the Cairo Action Programme, Agenda 21, Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development, Copenhagen Action Plan, Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements, the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT), the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, Rome Action Plan on World Food Security, and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action which contains a whole section entitled: \u201cThe equal status and human rights of women\u201d. 53 Module 2 Agenda 21 calls for the adoption of measures to translate its objectives into clear strategies.32 This is to be achieved through government policies, national guidelines and plans to ensure equity in all aspects of society, including women\u2019s \u201ckey involvement\u201d in decision making and environmental management. 2.4.2 WSSD Plan of Implementation The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) Plan of Implementation (2002), adopted in Johannesburg, promotes women\u2019s equal access to and full participation in decision making at all levels, on the basis of equality with men.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1173dece-b8ac-4d75-b8aa-34bddde84935": {"__data__": {"id_": "1173dece-b8ac-4d75-b8aa-34bddde84935", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0cec9163509734e94136395598a886eca355c41b2c1f32152cfdfe19f35da7d"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3b7e99a-c67d-4a31-b53f-06dde7bc5d94", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ab1249122fd676754cef23c2a665f586cfc3b4fc26d53eec695e58850f177b6"}}, "hash": "5e2d9c854b61fd073bb37b3b7421ac232fbb210b71d4d557b7db20f6508d1933", "text": "It calls for mainstreaming gender perspectives in all policies and strategies, the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and the improvement of the status, health and economic welfare of women and girls through full and equal access to economic opportunities, land, credit, education and health-care services. 2.4.3 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and Beijing +10 Two documents emanated from the IV World Conference on Women: the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.

The Platform for Action warns that: \u201cthe human rights of women, as defined by international human rights instruments, will only be dead words unless they are fully recognized, protected, applied, and effectively enforced, at national legal and practical levels, in family, civil, criminal, labour and commercial codes, as well as in administrative regulations\u201d (Paragraph 218). Strategic Objective K of the Beijing Platform for Action commits to securing the active involvement of women in environmental decision making; integrating gender concerns and perspectives in policies and programmes for sustainable development; and strengthening or establishing mechanisms at the national, regional and international levels to assess the impact of development and environmental policies on women. In March 2005 at UN Headquarters, the 49th session of the CSW, also known as \u201cBeijing +10\u201d, assessed progress made since the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action. Beijing +10 was a call to action against discriminatory laws and other violations of women\u2019s human rights. It specifically calls on Member States to enhance rural women\u2019s income-generating potential; noting the 32 Section 24(f). 54 importance of the agricultural sector, particularly in developing countries, and the importance of greater security of land tenure and property ownership for resource mobilization and environmental management. 2.4.4 Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals At the 8th plenary session of the UN General Assembly in September 2000, countries adopted the Millennium Declaration, committing themselves to respecting the equal rights of all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.33 The UN also adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which are referred to as a blueprint for the realization of the Millennium Declaration. The MDGs promote poverty reduction, education, maternal health, gender equality, and aim to combat child mortality, AIDS and other diseases. The MDGs, with a target year of 2015, are an agreed set of goals that can only be achieved with the full commitment and collaboration of all actors.34 Poor countries have pledged to govern better and invest in their people through health care and education. Rich countries have pledged to support them, through aid, debt relief and fairer trade.35 The Declaration identifies certain fundamental values as being essential to international relations in the twenty-first century. Among other things, Signatories commit to: assuring equal rights and opportunities for women and men;36 promoting the empowerment of women as an effective way of combating poverty, hunger and disease, and achieving truly sustainable development; and ensuring that the benefits of new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, are available to all. The Declaration is of particular interest due to its linkage of human rights, the rights of women, and the rights that stem from the UNFCCC. Taken together, these establish a platform of fundamental interrelated values on gender, environment and human rights. According to the 2005 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Report, gender continues to be \u201cone of the world\u2019s strongest markers for disadvantage.\u201d Reducing inequality would, therefore, be instrumental in making progress towards achieving the MDGs. 33 Article 4. 34 For a review of progress on the MDGs see www.paris21.org/betterworld. 35 Retrieved on July 21, 2006, from: http://www.undp.org/mdg/. 36 Article 6. 55 Module 2 2.4.5 The \u201cRio Conventions\u201d As a result of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \u2013 a conference popularly known as the \u201cRio Earth Summit\u201d \u2013 three international treaties arose: the UNFCCC, the CBD and the UNCCD, known ever since as the Rio Conventions. The three Rio Conventions are related. Climate change affects biodiversity and desertification. The more intense and far-reaching climate change is, the greater will be the loss of plant and animal species and the more dryland and semi-arid terrain around the world will lose vegetation and deteriorate. Due to this fact, a Joint Liaison Group, or JLG, was established in 2001 to boost collaboration between the secretariats of the three Conventions. Through the JLG, information is shared, activities are coordinated, and measures are identified that can simultaneously attack all three problems.

However, and particularly since 2007, the CBD has initiated a process focused on promoting gender mainstreaming in its regular activities. For example, in a decision made at its second meeting in July 2007, the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on Review of Implementation of the Convention (WG RI-2) urged Parties: \u201cin developing, implementing and revising their national and, where appropriate, regional biodiversity strategies and action plans\u2026 [to] Promote the mainstreaming of gender considerations\u201d.38 In regard to National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs), Article 6 of the CBD establishes that each Party should develop its own NBSAP or equivalent instrument.

Examples of this recognition can be found in the NBSAPs from Mali, Bhutan and El Salvador, among others. In Mali, for example, women tend to be the ones that use the shea tree, edible tamarind and fonio. Additionally, certain vegetable species are valued because women use them for basket making, weaving, and pottery making. Bhutanese women are often the ones who manage or harvest underused species that could contribute to food security, agricultural diversification and income generation. In several communities in El Salvador, women are usually the ones that have a greater knowledge of the diversity of plants and animals for medicinal purposes due to their traditional role as carers. \u2022\ufffd Women play a key role in biodiversity conservation and, in particular, agrobiodiversity conservation. For example, in Yemen, women select seeds with specific characteristics and are in charge of growing \u201cwomen\u2019s crops\u201d such as groundnuts, pumpkins and leafy vegetables. This has the effect of raising biodiversity and food security on their farms. Additionally, in Mali it has been recognized that the calabash tree\u2019s maintenance and development is due to the uses women give to it. \u2022\ufffd Women\u2019s economic freedom and security depends largely on agricultural activities and the use of natural resources. Bhutan recognizes that women could benefit greatly if the activities on which their livelihoods depend are supported and a sustainable use of the resources is promoted. An example that illustrates this can be found in Benin, where mushrooms are an important food supply for rural populations. Actions taken by an NGO created opportunities for marketing mushrooms, which resulted in increased incomes for women. \u2022\ufffd NBSAPs from Guinea, Mauritius and Mali recognize that some resources used by women are collected in a way that compromises their development and regeneration. If these practices are improved and women are included in the process, conservation strategies could be more effective. In Guinea, for example, loss of soil fertility is associated with traditional techniques of smoking fish carried out by women that use large quantities of mangrove trees (Rizophora sp.). Many fisherwomen in Mauritius depend on octopus fishing even though the maximum sustainable yield has been exceeded because they collect female octopus before they reach maturity. Box 2 Examples of how gender and women\u2019s issues have been addressed in the NBSAPs 59 Module 2 \u2022\ufffd Nepal recognizes that one of the major weaknesses of community forestry is that not all forest users are equally represented in community forestry management. They suggest that adequate attention should be paid to identify all users, to inform them of their rights and responsibilities, and to involve disadvantaged groups and women in community forestry management. \u2022\ufffd There is a link between women\u2019s education and the preservation and conservation of natural resources. In Togo, women are responsible for the exploitation of natural resources but they have less access to education than men, e.g., the proportion of men taught to read and write is higher (69%) than that of women (38%). The lack of education hinders women\u2019s understanding of sustainable practices, which could lead to the further degradation of the resources they depend on. \u2022\ufffd Kenya, Liberia and Zimbabwe mention that gender imbalances exist in land access and ownership. Kenya identifies land as the country\u2019s most important natural resource, and recognizes that although their statutory laws do not prevent women from owning land, women still face numerous difficulties in relation to land tenure. \u2022\ufffd Malawi\u2019s NBSAP mentions that both HIV/AIDS and gender are key issues that affect their country\u2019s biodiversity and should be included in the biodiversity programmes. \u2022\ufffd Some Parties, like Belize, Benin, Maldives, and Marshall Islands, have included women\u2019s groups in participatory consultation processes to formulate their NBSAP. In addition, Nepal\u2019s NBSAP proposes the formation of separate groups for men and women to ensure active participation by women. The effective inclusion of women and their issues in many local and international processes is truncated because, in many countries, men are still the ones who are in charge of public spaces, and in many working groups, there is the misconception that men guarantee the vision of \u201cthe community\u201d.

In early 2008, an analysis of NBSAPs was conducted. It was determined that up to April 4, 2008, 160 of the 190 parties to the CBD had presented their 60 NBSAP; of the 141 examined, 77 mentioned gender or aspects related to women. Based on this analysis by Quesada-Aguilar and Mata (2008), some examples of how countries have addressed gender issues are presented in Box 2 above. In 2007, as mentioned above, the CBD Executive Secretary launched a process for the promotion of gender equality within the Convention. As part of the celebration of International Women\u2019s Day (March 8, 2007), the Executive Secretary designated a Gender Focal Point in the CBD Secretariat. With support and technical direction from IUCN, at the end of 2007 and early 2008 the CBD Secretariat carried out an internal process aimed at developing the Convention\u2019s first gender strategy. The plan was approved by the CBD Bureau in February 2008 and approved by the COP 9 in June of that same year: \u201cthe COP welcomes the development of a Gender Plan of Action under the CBD as presented in the document UNEP/CBD/COP/9/L.4 and invites parties to support the Secretariat in its implementation.\u201d In this way, the CBD established a historic milestone by becoming the first multilateral environmental agreement (MEA) with a strategy to promote gender equality among women and men. The UN Convention to Combat Desertification The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Desertification (INCD) which, at the start of the 1990s, prepared the UNCCD, established that to combat desertification effectively both women and men should participate fully in the preparation and implementation of dryland development activities. The INCD also recognized that participation does not materialize just by a decision but requires special support activities that will promote women\u2019s opportunities for participating including awareness raising, training and capacity building, and education. This convention is one of the few international instruments that established a link between the environmental situation, gender equality and social participation. This was largely because the UNCCD was always tied more with local development and the eradication of poverty (in comparison to other MEAs), given the fact that countries from the South led its elaboration. In the initial years of its execution, the commitment to push for equality among men and women was an important element in many of the related activities carried out by the UNCCD in the local, national, regional and global sphere. In the convention\u2019s implementation, governments as well as NGOs 61 Module 2 and international organizations provided financial and technical support for programmes directed specifically at women. Furthermore, UNCCD was characterized by its efforts to strengthen the role of women in all areas of its implementation. The Convention also made great progress in internalizing equality between men and women in UNCCD governance, and over the years experienced women\u2019s growing participation in governing entities. However, there is still a long way to go before women and men are represented equally, and several delegates to each Conference of the Parties (COP) continue calling for the rectification of gender inequality, especially with respect to women\u2019s low participation in the Roster of Experts, the Ad-hoc Open-ended Working Groups, and in the processes of preparing the national action programmes. However, during the COPs held to date, deliberations about the role of women and gender mainstreaming have not played a significant part in the plenary discussions of the COP or Commission on Science and Technology. An examination of the decisions at the different sessions shows that issues concerning gender and women\u2019s roles are mentioned in only a limited way; conclusions and general recommendations need considerable work before they can be translated into operational activities. Many of the people interviewed by Knabe and Poulsen (2004) stated that gender and the role of women is frequently viewed as no more than rhetoric, and there appears to be a vacuum in terms of concrete activities. This could be interpreted as a result of limited capacity, and should be analyzed and addressed in future UNCCD initiatives. 2.5 Policy coherence Policy coherence is an essential prerequisite of efficiency and sustainability that ensures that other policies will not jeopardize climate change efforts. As set out by Lambrou and Laub (2004), the multiplication of international instruments, sources of both hard law (such as the Rio Conventions, the CEDAW\u2026) and soft law (such as Agenda 21, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, the MDGs, the Beijing Platform for Action\u2026), make the monitoring", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e3c3178-3d86-4dc7-86ce-d3980f19b003": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e3c3178-3d86-4dc7-86ce-d3980f19b003", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8dd2f649f06b6c0c3ae692c305641fd5aca4fd0ed6522f1890c727ab0b3fa262"}, "3": {"node_id": "d270ead9-e7e9-4fd4-aea4-bb0854cbb688", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8bffb9ddc98310fa719e16b1018c05fd16a83d11a8cc1d21c435e5dec5960021"}}, "hash": "7d2087f4df93b15da0e4294a9efd1cf7fffc2ddc9b8929ec04c2ee3517060abd", "text": "process increasingly difficult. A harmonization of procedures and approaches between international instruments would facilitate the monitoring of these instruments from cross-sectoral perspectives, such as gender, sustainable development, the fight against poverty, and climate change. 62 In terms of the legal instruments, policy coherence should be ensured in three different dimensions as regards climate change and gender: \u2022\ufffd Coherence between the \u201cRio Conventions.\u201d Both climate change and gender affect all Rio Conventions. Therefore, it is beneficial to adopt similar approaches as regards the mainstreaming of gender and promote a cross-fertilization of experiences. As the CBD is actually at the most developed stage of gender mainstreaming, the method applied by the Secretariat of the CBD could be used as a source of inspiration for the other two Conventions on climate change and desertification. Shared approach at national level among NBSAPs, NAPAs and \u2022\ufffd NAPs. Due to the fact that all Rio Conventions are dealing at the moment with climate change issues, a harmonization exercise should be carried out at national level in terms of their approach towards climate change and gender (NBSAPs, NAPAs and NAPs) which could contribute to a more systematic approach to mainstreaming gender in the environmental sector. In fact, since some NBSAPs have already taken important steps towards the promotion of gender equality, the design of NAPAs can draw on their experience. Some NAPAs have already started to address some gender elements (Pearl, personal communication). For example: - Uganda has included in their criteria equity and gender issues, taking into consideration disadvantaged groups. The NAPA also expresses the need to develop guidelines for mainstreaming gender issues. - Burundi\u2019s Adaptation Plan mentions as one of its objectives women\u2019s empowerment. - The Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea documents recognize women\u2019s role in water, agriculture, community development and their vulnerability. - Bhutan and Malawi include references to gender which are related to fulfilment of the MDGs and women\u2019s participation. 63 Module 2 Coherence between NAPAs and other national legal tools dealing \u2022\ufffd with gender equality. In democratic countries gender equality is one of the main legal principles of the national legal system. In many cases, the commitment of countries to gender equality is expressed and guaranteed by a series of instruments; such as, the constitution, international agreements the countries are parties to, the so-called \u201cEqual Treatment Acts\u201d, and other national regulations. Thus, the mainstreaming of gender in NAPAs will contribute to the coherence of the national legal system and ensure that the national adaptation programmes are not discriminatory in violation of other national and international legal tools affirming gender equality. As a final remark it is important to highlight the fact that since the UNFCCC was drawn up within the framework of the United Nations, decisions of the General Assembly and conventions or treaties dealing with gender issues constitute mandates.

This sets a standard which should inform the implementation of the Declaration. Article 18 states that \u201cindigenous peoples have the right to participate in decision making in matters which would affect their rights, through representatives chosen by themselves in accordance with their own procedures\u2026\u201d Article 32 reiterates, \u201cindigenous peoples have the right to determine and develop priorities and strategies for the development or use of their lands or territories and other resources.\u201d World Conference on Human Rights Main inputs At the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, 171 states adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. Specific\ufffdtext Article 11 of the Declaration states, \u201cThe right to development should be fulfilled so as to meet equitably the developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations.\u201d The outcome documents urge treaty monitoring bodies to include the status of women and the human rights of women in their deliberations and findings, making use of gender-specific data. It also urges governments and regional and international organizations to facilitate the access of women to decision-making processes.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENT Agenda 21 Main inputs Agenda 21 establishes a blueprint for sustainable development. It was adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Agenda 21 is to be achieved through government policies, national guidelines, and plans to secure equity in all aspects of society, including women\u2019s key involvement in decision making and environmental management. Specific\ufffdtext Chapter 24, entitled \u201cGlobal Action for Women towards Sustainable Development,\u201d calls upon governments to make the necessary constitutional, legal, administrative, cultural, social and economic changes in order to eliminate all obstacles to women\u2019s full involvement in sustainable development and in public life. Agenda 21 recognizes the importance of the knowledge and traditional practices of women, and underscores the contribution women have made to biodiversity conservation (Section 24.2 (c)). Agenda 21 calls for the adoption of measures to translate its objectives into clear strategies (Section 24(f)). In the rest of the text, women are specifically mentioned in 159 cases. WSSD Plan of Implementation Main inputs The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) Plan of Implementation 2002, adopted in Johannesburg, promotes women\u2019s equal access to and full participation in decision making at all levels, on the basis of equality with men. 70 Specific\ufffdtext It calls for mainstreaming gender perspectives in all policies and strategies, the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and the improvement of the status, health and economic welfare of women and girls through full and equal access to economic opportunities, land, credit, education and health-care services. Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals Main inputs At the 8th plenary session of the UN General Assembly in September 2000, countries adopted the Millennium Declaration, committing themselves to respecting the equal rights of all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. The UN also adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which are referred as a blueprint for the realization of the Millennium Declaration. Specific\ufffdtext The Declaration identifies certain fundamental values as being essential to international relations in the twenty-first century.

Of the so-called Rio Conventions, the Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD, 1994) most clearly recognizes the role of women in rural livelihoods and encourages the full participation of women and men in the implementation of the convention. The UNCCD stresses the important role played by women in regions affected by desertification and/or drought, and instructs national action programmes to provide for effective participation of women and men, particularly resource users, including farmers and pastoralists and their organizations. Specific\ufffdtext Prologue: Stressing the important role played by women in regions affected by desertification and/or drought, particularly in rural areas of developing countries, and the importance of ensuring the full participation of both men and women at all levels in programmes to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought; PART II: General Provisions Article 5: Obligations of affected country Parties (d) Promote awareness and facilitate the participation of local populations, particularly women and youth, with the support of 71 Table 1.

National action programmes shall, as appropriate, include the following general features: (c) The increase in participation of local population and communities, including women, farmers and pastoralists, and delegation to them of more responsibility for management. Convention on Biological Diversity Main inputs The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) recognizes the role of women in the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and affirms the need for the full participation of women at all levels 72 Main inputs of policy making and implementation. However, only recently have steps been taken to ensure gender mainstreaming in the convention\u2019s implementation. Since 2007, a more focused approach to gender mainstreaming has been undertaken \u2013 the CBD Secretariat has appointed a Gender Focal Point and a new Gender Plan of Action has been elaborated. Specific\ufffdtext The Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) mentions women\u2019s practices, knowledge, and gender roles in food production, as do various decisions of the Conference of the Parties, including: (a) SBSTTA recommendation II/7, on agricultural biological diversity and the role of women in managing practices and knowledge; (b) COP decision III/11, para.17, on promotion of women\u2019s knowledge and practices in the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in the agricultural sector; (c) The annex to COP decision III/14 on Article 8(j): gender balance in workshop organization; (d) Annex I to SBSTTA recommendation IV/7, on potential impacts of tourism on cultural values, including gender; (e) SBSTTA recommendation V/14, para. 2 (i) and annex III to COP decision VIII/10, on gender balance in the composition of ad hoc technical expert groups, the subsidiary body and roster of experts; (f) COP decision V/16 \u2013 element 1 of the programme of work of Article 8(j) on promotion of gender-specific ways in which to document and preserve women\u2019s knowledge of biological diversity; (g) COP decision V/20, on gender balance in the roster of experts; (h) COP decision V/25, on socio-economic and cultural impacts of tourism: the fact that tourism activities may affect gender relationships (through employment opportunities for example); and (i) Annexes I and II to COP decision VI/10, annex to COP decision VII/1: Gender as a social factor that may affect traditional knowledge. Decision V/16: Article 8(j) and related provisions states: \u201cRecognizing the vital role that women play in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and emphasizing that greater attention should be given to strengthening this role and the participation of women of indigenous and local communities in the programme of work.\u201d Under \u201cGeneral Principles,\u201d the Programme of Work on the implementation of Article 8(j) and related provisions of the CBD calls for: \u201cFull and effective participation of women of indigenous and local communities in all activities of the programme of work.\u201d Task 4 of the programme of work calls on Parties to develop, as appropriate, mechanisms for promoting the full and effective participation of indigenous and local communities with specific provisions for the full, active and effective participation of women in all elements of the programme of work, taking into account the need to: (a) Build on the basis of their knowledge; (b) Strengthen their access to biological diversity; (c) Strengthen their capacity on matters pertaining to the conservation, maintenance and protection of biological diversity; (d) Promote the exchange of experiences and knowledge; (e) Promote 73 Table 1.

COP 9: Welcomes the development by the Executive Secretary of the \u201cGender Plan of Action under the Convention on Biological Diversity,\u201d as contained in document UNEP/CBD/COP/9/INF/12, and invites Parties to support the Secretariat\u2019s implementation of the plan. UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Main inputs The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) fails to recognize the gender aspects of climate change and omits the issues of gender equality and women\u2019s participation entirely. Also, its Kyoto Protocol, that outlines reductions in greenhouse gases until 2012, fails to integrate a gender perspective in its operationalization and mechanisms, such as the Clean Development Mechanism. Women\u2019s caucuses since COP-11 in 2005 have strongly lobbied for a gender approach in all these critical areas. At the last COP-13 in Bali, the gender cc \u2013 the Women for Climate Justice network of women\u2019s organizations and individuals \u2013 was established, as well as the Global Gender and Climate Alliance of UN organizations, IUCN and WEDO along with other international organizations. IUCN has been working with the Secretariat of the UNFCCC; there is a new Gender Focal Point and a series of steps (i.e., sensitization of staff, gender and adaptation efforts) are going to be conducted. Specific\ufffdtext Gender equality is a guiding principle in the design of National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and it was advised to include gender expertise in NAPA teams. Many of the national reports submitted by signatory nations to the UNFCCC Secretariat emphasize the vulnerability of women and the importance of gender equality albeit in broad terms. Most countries include some reference to the MDGs or national commitments to empowering women, but few detail how urgently women are affected by climate change, much less how they might be identified as powerful actors and agents for change. RISK REDUCTION Hyogo Framework for Action Main inputs It includes the principal mandate in relation to gender equality and empowerment of women in the context of disaster risk reduction and evolved from the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe, Japan (2005). 74 Specific\ufffdtext General considerations (d) A gender perspective should be integrated into all disaster risk management policies, plans and decision-making processes, including those related to risk assessment, early warning, information management, and education and training; ii) Early warning (d) Develop early warning systems that are people-centred, in particular systems whose warnings are timely and understandable to those at risk, which take into account the demographic, gender, cultural and livelihood characteristics of the target audiences, including guidance on how to act upon warnings, and that support effective operations by disaster managers and other decision makers. ii) Education and training (m) Ensure equal access to appropriate training and educational opportunities for women and vulnerable constituencies; promote gender and cultural sensitivity training as integral components of education and training for disaster risk reduction. 75 Instruments and techniques / Module 2 How binding are the legal instruments and how do they implicate the UNFCCC? Instruments and techniques I. Techniques for analyzing the legal framework Objective: Introduce some of the most important legal instruments and demonstrate their importance for climate change initiatives and policies at the international and national level. Materials: Copies of CEDAW, United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Resolution 2005/31, Hyogo Framework for Action and Beijing Platform for Action (point K). With larger groups, other legal instruments could be incorporated into the analysis. Marker pens and flip charts 76 Procedure: Divide the participants into four groups and appoint a leader 1. in each group. Assign one legal framework to each group. Give them time 2. to read it.

The nature of that vulnerability varies widely, cautioning against generalization. But climate change is likely to magnify existing patterns of gender disadvantage (UNDP Human Development Report, 2007). Key messages There is a causal interrelationship between climate change and \u2022\ufffd gender: (1) climate change tends to exacerbate existing gender inequalities; (2) gender inequalities lead women to face larger negative impacts; Women are not just victims but active agents of change and possess \u2022\ufffd unique knowledge and skills; Understanding the risks and different impacts of climate change on \u2022\ufffd men and women is key in achieving sustainable development and the MDGs. Climate change will affect all countries, in all parts of the globe. But its impacts will be distributed differently among regions, generations, age classes, income groups, occupations and genders (IPCC, 2001). The poor, the majority of whom are women living in developing countries, will be disproportionately affected. Yet most of the debate on climate so far has been gender-blind. Because climate change affects women and men differently, a gender equality perspective is essential when discussing policy development, decision making, and strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Women are not just helpless victims \u2013 they are powerful agents of change, and their leadership is critical. Women can help or hinder strategies related to energy use, deforestation, population, economic growth, science and technology, and policy making, among other things. 1 The discussion on gender and climate change draws heavily upon: Aguilar, L. [In press]. Climate Connection. Women and Climate Change: Vulnerabilities and Adaptive Capacities. State of the World. 80 Climate change and gender inequalities are inextri- cably linked. By exacerbating inequality overall, climate change slows progress toward gender equality and thus impedes efforts to achieve wider goals like poverty reduction and sustainable development. Gender inequality can worsen the impacts of climate change (see Box 1); meanwhile, taking steps to narrow the gender gap and empower women can help reduce these impacts. 3.1 Causes of vulnerability, or specific conditions that make women, especially poor women, vulnerable to climate change Vulnerability is a reflection of the state of the individual and collective physical, social, economic and environmental conditions at hand. These individual and collective conditions are shaped by many factors, among which gender plays a key role. Gender-based vulnerability does not derive from a single factor, but reflects historically and culturally specific patterns of relations in social institutions, culture, and personal lives (Enarson, 1998). Gender relations will shape the above-mentioned four conditions of vulnerability. The intersection of these factors with caste, racial and other inequalities, creates hazardous social conditions that place different groups of women at risk (Enarson, 1998). However, there is a need to avoid being simplistic and just seeing women (because of their sex) as victims. Women are not vulnerable because they are \u201cnaturally weaker\u201d: women and men face different vulnerabilities due to their different social roles. For example, many women live in conditions of social exclusion. This is expressed in facts as simple as differentials in the capacity to run or swim, or constraints on their mobility, and behavioural restrictions, that hinder their ability to re-locate without their husband\u2019s, father\u2019s or brother\u2019s consent. 2 Purdah - a norm that prescribes spatial movement, behaviour and attitudes of women. Box 1 Gender inequality and climate change In some communities in Bangladesh, women are deprived of the capacity to cope with disasters by being kept in dependent positions in terms of accessing information from the world outside the bari, and by being denied the right to take major decisions. In this respect, purdah 2 as an institution which prevents women from engaging in socio- economic roles outside the household directly prescribes women\u2019s vulnerability to disaster. Source: Ikeda, 1995. 81 Module 3 It has also been found that the vulnerability and capacity of a social group to adapt or change depends greatly on their assets. Next to their physical location, women\u2019s assets such as resources and land, knowledge, technology, power, decision-making potential, education, health care and food have been identified as determinant factors of vulnerability and adaptive capacity. As pointed out by Moser and Satterthwaite (2008), the more assets people have, the less vulnerable they are and the greater the erosion of people\u2019s assets, the greater their insecurity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02221a08-c86e-406b-af14-a3f7a9331713": {"__data__": {"id_": "02221a08-c86e-406b-af14-a3f7a9331713", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e03decc0d6a3200216c83eb2371a4f0e587f4ae8ced2b68d0f713c81649ff89c"}, "2": {"node_id": "a0fd2d74-c9f9-45a7-95fc-75959f2f8e0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a2f6ff175c3452193add54390483e0cb42f5da187d9b05f622928396442bc62"}}, "hash": "08c0e0c05c8e8bfd6a18c3b510e6e5c5d2f10df71b02c0543c9024b6119f7101", "text": "Data from around the world indicates that women tend to have less or limited access to assets (physical, financial, human, social and natural capital).3 Women\u2019s assets largely determine how they will be affected by and respond to the impacts of climate change.

Through both direct and indirect risks, it can affect their livelihood opportunities, the time they have available to them on a daily basis, and overall life expectancy (see Table 1). In addition to exacerbating existing risks, climate change can reveal new risks that have been hidden. Box 2 Gender and assets Gender inequalities exist in the access to valuable resources such as land, credit, agricultural inputs, technology, and extension and training services that would enhance their capacity to adapt. In Liberia, women produce 60% of food crops despite their lack of access to farmland, low level of technological training and knowledge, and lack of financial assistance (Liberia NBSAP, 2004). An analysis of credit schemes in five African countries found that women received less than 10% of the credit awarded to male smallholders (FAO, 2008). Fewer than 10% of women farmers in India, Nepal and Thailand own land (idem). In Kenya, although their statutory laws do not prevent them from owning land, in practice women still face numerous difficulties in trying to own land (Kenya NBSAP, 2000).

Fact sheet IUCN-CBD. 3 Differentiated data on access of women and men to assets can be found in various institutions within the UN system: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Gender-related Development Index (GDI); the UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM); the UN International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW); the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). 82 Table 1. Direct and indirect risks of climate change and their potential effect on women Climate change effects Direct Indirect Potential risks Increased ocean temperatures Increased drought and water shortage Increased extreme weather events Increased epidemics Loss of species Examples Rising incidence of coral bleaching due to thermal stress. Morocco had 10 years of drought from 1984 to 2000; northern Kenya experienced four severe droughts between 1983 and 2001. Greater intensity and quantity of cyclones, hurricanes,\ufffdfloods\ufffdand\ufffd heat waves. Climate variability played a critical role in malaria epidemics in the East African highlands and accounted for an estimated 70% of variation in recent cholera series in Bangladesh. By 2050, climate change could result in species extinctions ranging from 18\u201335%. Potential effect on women Loss of coral reefs can damage the tourism industry, a sector in which women comprise 46% of the workforce. Women and girls in developing countries are often the primary collectors, users and managers of water. Decreases in water availability will jeopardize their families\u2019 livelihoods and increase their workloads, and may have secondary effects such as lower\ufffdschool\ufffdenrolment\ufffdfigures\ufffdfor\ufffdgirls\ufffdor\ufffd less opportunity for women to engage in income-generating activities. In a sample of 141 countries over the period 1981\u20132002, it was found that natural disasters (and their subsequent impact) on average kill more women than men or kill women at an earlier age than men. Women have less access to medical services than men, and their workloads increase when they have to spend more time caring for the sick. Poorer households affected by HIV/AIDS have fewer resources to adapt to climate change impacts. Adopting new strategies for crop production or mobilizing livestock is harder for female-headed and infected households. Women often rely on crop diversity to accommodate climatic variability, but permanent temperature change will reduce agro-biodiversity and traditional medicine options, creating potential impacts on food security and health. 83 Module 3 An increase in climate-related disease outbreaks, for example, will have very different impacts on women than on men. Each year, approximately 50 million women living in malaria-endemic countries throughout the world become pregnant, of whom over half live in tropical areas of Africa with intense transmission of Plasmodium falciparum. An estimated 10,000 of these women and 200,000 of their infants die as a result of malaria infection during pregnancy, and severe malarial anaemia contributes to more than half of these deaths (WHO, 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7cef1b2e-efac-4873-83ce-2654cf22c30e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7cef1b2e-efac-4873-83ce-2654cf22c30e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cfdc22cdad9da6f051f603eba84671ac9133628f8ff4a17c2ca94b9b26036c56"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5cc3522-5d53-4ec3-b993-d6c5630025fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "989edaa1a7a0027ecbc45ab89a6daae241b726ae671211575b11e33fa0dcce3c"}}, "hash": "fe6605e6e1692e2d6b6826a82424aa9d3f45406c9142047203d8ad2ebe5c22ba", "text": "A 2007 study by the London School of Economics, the University of Essex and the Max-Planck Institute of Economics analyzed disaster events in 141 countries and found that when women\u2019s economic and social rights are not protected, more women than men die from disasters.

Source: See Bibliography. Decreased crop production In Africa, crop production is expected to decline 20\u201350% in response to extreme El Ni\u00f1o-like conditions. Rural women in particular are responsible for half of the world\u2019s food production and produce between 60-80% of the food in most developing countries. In Africa, the share of women affected by climate- related crop changes could range from 48% in Burkina Faso to 73% in the Congo. 84 Table 2. Establishing the linkages between MDGs, climate change and gender Millennium Development Goals MDG 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Threats due to climate change Reduction of agricultural production for survival and commercial ends Food security at risk Gender implications Women make up the majority of the world\u2019s poor \u2013 of the 1.3 billion poor worldwide, 70% are women. Loss or reduction of domestic species of plants and animals used by women to ensure food security of their families. Atmospheric brown clouds (ABC) due to aerosol loads and greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations have reduced historical rice harvests (Cramer, 2006). Rice is the major caloric intake of developing countries. Women are already more vulnerable to nutritional problems (for example, 50% of the women and children in developing countries are anaemic) due to physical, social, economic, gender and cultural issues (e.g., pregnancy, lactation, inequitable food distribution within families). Reduction or extinction of marine species used by women for household consumption or for productive activities. In some cases, the trade-offs between consumption and survival can exacerbate gender bias in nutrition. Research in India has found that girls\u2019 nutrition suffers most during periods of low consumption and rising food prices, and that rainfall shortages are more strongly associated with deaths among girls than boys (UNDP, 2007). 3.3 Gender equality, climate change and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): what is the link? Gender equality is the focus of the third MDG and a prerequisite to fulfilment of all the MDGs (Kabeer, 2003). The manner in which climate change magnifies existing gender inequalities will significantly hamper efforts to achieve these goals. Developing countries are addressing swift environmental changes that block progress on poverty reduction and sustainable development goals, and gender inequality further entrenches these countries in poverty and underdevelopment. In a similar manner, the MDGs are interdependent and reinforce each other (see Table 2). Climate change is a global security and human rights issue. It represents a serious challenge to sustainable development, social justice, equity and respect for human rights, also for future generations. Gender is a central factor in the juxtaposition of these issues. 85 Module 3 MDG 2: Achieve universal primary education MDG 3: Promote gender equality and empower women Increases the workload needed for agricultural production and subsistence activities Environmental changes are likely to drive migration Less access to safe water Increases deaths and injuries where inequality exists Exacerbates existing gender inequalities Inhibits political, economic and social empowerment Generally, girls and women are responsible for the collection of water and fuelwood. In the poorest areas of the world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, women and girls can spend 3\u20134 hours per day on these tasks. Flooding,\ufffddrought\ufffdand\ufffddesertification\ufffdcan\ufffdextend\ufffdthese\ufffd burdens geographically, forcing more girls in more communities to forego education. Of the 115 million children of the world who do not go to school, three- fifths\ufffdare\ufffdgirls,\ufffdand\ufffdwomen\ufffdconstitute\ufffd75%\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdworld\u2019s\ufffd illiterate population (Oxfam, 2007). According to UNHCR, 80% of refugees in the world are women and children. Migration of populations, given extreme changes and disasters, could interrupt and limit the opportunities for education.

The main goals of the project were to provide a solution to the scarcity of firewood and to create sustainable livelihoods for the community. However, as the project has evolved, empowering women with education about the environment, and giving them the skills to diversify their livelihoods in an environmentally conscious way have led to significant success in effecting change. Diversifying women\u2019s sources of income, and afforestation of the region, will help mitigate the future threat of climate change with its weather- related hazards such as flooding, landslides and drought. The initiative also contributes to climate change mitigation through reforestation efforts. The Mama Watoto Women\u2019s group in Kenya was formed in 1990 to address the scarcity of fuelwood and the poverty of rural women. It comprises 28 women and their families (a total of 150 people) in the Kakamega Region in western Kenya. Kakamega is about 30 km north of the Equator, with very high annual precipitation. Firewood was the communities\u2019 main energy source. As it grew scarce, women were forced to collect wood illegally from the reserve that borders the community, the Kakamega National Forest Reserve, exposing themselves to legal action, fines and imprisonment. Since the establishment of the group, the women grow fast-maturing trees for firewood and timber in \u201cwomen-made forests\u201d in sections within their families\u2019 or their own farms. The afforestation programme has improved soil fertility, reduced illegal harvesting, and increased the vegetation cover in the Kambiri region, thereby increasing carbon sequestration (FAO, 1994). The group has ensured that families who were previously being prosecuted for destroying the forest, are now sustainably using available resources. The group has expanded the harvesting, processing and packaging of honey which has improved household incomes. Cultivation of soya beans is also raising household incomes, facilitated by a collective storage unit built by the group. Additionally, the group has introduced fish farming, and sustainable harvesting of herbs and medicinal plants. Overexploitation of forest resources has significantly reduced since community members have diversified their farmed products. The group works to counteract threats to existing biodiversity through education. The group also cares for orphans and runs a home based for people living with HIV/AIDS. All group activities are driven by community needs and the structure of the organization encourages inter-generational participation, which helps maintain the sustainability of the project. Also, the group works very closely with research and government institutions. Partners in this initiative include: the Shanderema Self- Help Group (orphans); Ivakale Focal Area Group and Musembeli Women\u2019s Group (orphans); Lugusi Post Test Group (home-based HIV/AIDS care); Kenya Wildlife Service-Buyangu Camp (protection of forest resources); GROOTS Kenya (peer learning and exchange); Jamii Network Group, Ivakale Bidii Self-Help Group, Ileho Youth Association, I.I.R.R.

The InterCooperation Bolivia initiative aimed to support and use traditional knowledge of climate prediction for better decision making in agricultural production and risk management. Gradually, it turned its focus towards strengthening the capabilities of both women and men in rural communities. As a result, local groups of technology suppliers were formed, called yapuchiris, who sell their services at market prices to other farmers.

These local experts have strengthened local capabilities in disaster risk management, traditional agriculture and climatic knowledge by consolidating and spreading indigenous knowledge. The collective innovation of the yapuchiri system arose from a need for more technical assistance to farmers, and a lack of PROSUKO (Programa de Suka Kollus) funds for more engineers. Intercooperation supported the yapuchiris in selling technological and financial services to local farmers. The PROSUKO\u2019s rural partner is the Uni\u00f3n de Asociaciones Productivas del Altiplano (UNAPA) \u2013 a farmers\u2019 organization set up from former beneficiaries of PROSUKO projects, composed of 32 communal associations. UNAPA has a formal membership of 289 fami- lies, and provides services to approximately 2,500 families in five provinces of the Depart- ment of La Paz in Bolivia. UNAPA provides financial and non-financial services to its members. Financial services are a credit service through the Bolivian micro- finance system, and a crop insurance service to cope with meteorological risk to agricultural production. Those services were developed with the help of specialized partners such as the PROFIN Foundation, a support programme for micro-financing initiatives in Bolivia. UNAPA\u2019s non-financial services are provided by yapuchiris, that is, farmers with a particular artisanal dedication to agriculture. PROSUKO worked with yapuchiris to strengthen their capabilities with the aim of having them work for UNAPA as providers of agricultural research and extension services. With PROSUKO\u2019s facilitation, they designed the UNAPA position on agricultural risk management, and are developing and testing technologies to cope with different risks. At present, UNAPA has 60 yapuchiris, 10 of whom are women. The gender element of the system arose from the need to focus and improve on productive farm work assigned to women. For instance, women are traditionally responsible for the storage of seeds and reproductive materials but not every woman in the community manages this to a high standard. Women yapuchiris were storing a very large quantity of potato varieties, grain seeds, and other species, including medicines. Moreover, they researched and knew under which conditions and where to sow every species and variety. They had the knowledge to design strategies for risk management, and assisted other women farmers in doing so. In a majority of cases, women yapuchiris not only transferred knowledge, but helped to build up the analytical capabilities of farming women. 92 Furthermore, female yapuchiris have taken a specific leading role in negotiating long- term market access for local produce. Since market access is another UNAPA service, women yapuchiris have negotiated a long- term potato contract and are developing markets for new products such as chuno and tunta (processed frozen and dried potato), and Andean grains, such as canawa and quinoa. They are also involved in adaptive risk management, and in monitoring bio- indicators of climate and weather-related hazards. The initiative started in October 2006 and concluded in July 2008, covering two complete agricultural cycles. In two years, yapuchiris were able to overcome frost damage to potato crops within communities, whereas more than 10 years of scientific research had made no impact at the grassroots level. The first cycle emphasized climate prediction through the observation of local flora and fauna. This allowed for crop planning that was more sensitive to risk. The yield losses were reduced by 30\u201340% in this first cycle. The second cycle then focused increasingly on the empo- werment of women in market participation. That year, yield losses from frost, flooding, drought and hail were also reduced by 80\u2013 90%.

Gender perspectives: Integrating Disaster Risk Reduction into Climate Change Adaptation. Good Practices and Lessons Learned. Switzerland: UN/ISDR. 93 Case study 3 / Module 3 Case study 3 Highlighting local coping strategies for drought The CRiSTAL Tool: Community-based risk screening tool \u2013 adaptation and livelihoods The \u201cCommunity-based Risk Screening Tool \u2013 Adaptation and Livelihoods\u201d (CRiSTAL) is a decision support tool. Drawing on the environmental impact assessment model and the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework, CRiSTAL aims to provide a logical, user-friendly process to help users better understand the links between climate-related risks, people\u2019s livelihoods, and project activities. Between 2004 and 2006, an interdisciplinary team conducted a series of field tests on completed or ongoing natural resource management projects in Bangladesh, Mali, Nicaragua, Tanzania and Sri Lanka. In the Malian Sahel, the CRiSTAL has shown that rural communities have developed coping strategies for extreme climate events such as droughts. The process has also identified an increase in the disaster risk of heavy rainfall, in line with climate change predictions, for which no traditional coping strategies have yet been developed. CRiSTAL was developed by Intercooperation (the Swiss Foundation for International Development and Cooperation), the International Institute for Sustainable Development, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Stockholm Environment Institute, with funds provided by the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC). The CRiSTAL approach also provides a gender-specific vulnerability analysis for different parts of the population, highlighting the specific coping strategies of women, and resulting in clear pointers for how gender- specific measures will need to be incorporated into projects. The initiative The analysis in Mali with CRiSTAL, a project planning and management tool, is part of an overall approach by Intercooperation to strengthen local capacity in climate change and disaster risk reduction work. The tool produces answers about the current climate risks, their impacts at the local level and the current coping strategies of the community. By listing the different hazards occurring in the region and their impact on livelihood resources, the participants learn about climate change and disaster risk reduction\u2019s link to their everyday lives. This approach also provides space for a gender-specific analysis on the differences in vulnerability in the rural population. The analysis was conducted within the \u201dProgramme d\u2019appui aux organisations paysannes pour la valorisation des resources naturelles,\u201d or the so-called J\u00e8kasy Programme in Mali. The Programme is funded by SDC and is implemented by Intercooperation. Its aim is to contribute to the sustainable development and diversification of natural resources in the re- gions of S\u00e9gou and Sikasso; some complementary activities in local economic development are co-financed by the Liechtenstein Development Service (LED) and the Canton of Vaud. The criteria for selecting the region were: Household economies supported by \u2022\ufffd women\u2019s income, through use of non-timber forest products; \u2022\ufffd Social conflicts over access to, and use of, natural resources among pastoralists, farmers and forest gatherers; Land degradation and desertification, \u2022\ufffd with pressure on fertile land.

CRiSTAL provides a space for grassroots stakeholders to be heard. Moreover, it produces a simple but systematic climate and livelihood analysis so participants can get a clearer idea about the current climate change situation and possible threats to their livelihoods. Simultaneously, the analysis makes stakeholders at the national, regional and local level aware about climate change issues. Women did not have their own workshops during the CRiSTAL process, but particular attention was paid to women\u2019s participation, and a female programme officer in charge of the region\u2019s work was skilled in addressing sensitive issues. The CRiSTAL analysis highlighted the clear gender-specific distinctions between livelihood activities, with women having a key role in certain agricultural activities, e.g., cooking, collection of dry firewood and shea nuts, and the extraction of shea butter. However, the management of the agricultural land as well as the various activities related to agroforestry parks, are run entirely by male community leaders. Although from a legal perspective, all natural resources belong to the State, from a local traditional perspective the owners are clearly defined within a community and they are men. Women in the community generally do not own land and have hardly any rights regarding the management of natural resources, despite often working in the fields. The power of the male landowners over the natural resources means that the poorest groups, in particular women, are doubly excluded \u2013 from both the land and its resources \u2013 and are thus more vulnerable. The communities have always struggled against the region\u2019s semi-arid conditions. Climate hazards such as droughts, lack of rainfall during the rainy season, and irregular rainfall are a part of daily life. According to the participants, since the severe droughts in the 1970s, the Malian government stated that such events should not be considered an external threat, but need to be integrated into daily life and production strategies. CRiSTAL was able to highlight women\u2019s coping strategies: \u2022\ufffd Due to food insecurity in the region, generally caused by drought, women in Mali have always stored their harvest separately from the family. Although most of the women do not own land or trees, certain products are exclusively harvested and collected by women. For example, the collection of shea nuts as well as the extraction of shea butter is exclusively a women\u2019s activity. These products are then used during difficult periods when the harvest made at household level is insufficient. \u2022\ufffd The selling of firewood, or chickens and goats, are other coping strategies that women use to get through difficult periods. \u2022\ufffd Although this remains an exception, it has nonetheless become more common that women in peri-urban areas try to form associations to gain access to land by renting or purchasing plots. Women will even buy land from their husbands for agricultural production, and try to get micro-loans from banks or micro-finance organizations. 95 Case study 3 / Module 3 \u2022\ufffd The elaboration and the implementation of local conventions can also facilitate the rights and the access of women to natural resources so that they can manage land plots. However, the CRiSTAL participatory process of listing 30 years of hazards showed: (a) a more frequent occurrence and an increase in the intensity of climate hazards and (b) new phenomena such as \u201cvents violents\u201d (strong winds) from the Sahara and more heavy rainfall causing floods. In September 2007, floods in several regions of Mali illustrated the local vulnerability to a new phenomenon \u2013 no traditional coping strategies for heavy rainfall and floods exist. Besides landslides, other severe consequences were the losses of many crops including a great proportion of the annual harvest. Lessons learned \u2022\ufffd Better collaboration between men and women is needed to deal with climate risks. Sharing the risks of production between all members of the household is a strategy for dealing with climate insecurity. \u2022\ufffd The impact of climate change will worsen the exclusion of women involved in agriculture, due to their lack of fertile land. Particular support has to be given to women so that they not only have access to natural resources, but can also make decisions on the management of trees, for example multi- purpose tree species. \u2022\ufffd Gender inequity has a negative impact on the management of the land and the agroforestry parks.

Additional support by the government and NGOs is needed to protect rural communities. \u2022\ufffd As the recent floods have shown, rural communities are vulnerable to new climate hazards. It is therefore increasingly important that disaster risk reduction be embedded at the national, regional and local level. In Mali, two different Ministries are \u2022\ufffd responsible for climate change and disaster risk reduction. Supraministerial collaboration and exchange is necessary for guaranteeing coordinated work in areas of overlap. Although gender-specific analyses regarding disaster risk reduction and climate change are essential, the National Adaptation Programme for Action (NAPA) and the National Communication do not fully integrate these aspects into their analyses. Encouraging communication between the people responsible for climate change and disaster risk reduction at the national level is required. The analysis in Mali is part of Intercooperation\u2019s overall approach, and many projects are currently using CRiSTAL as a tool for understanding vulnerability and for checking ongoing coping strategies. CRiSTAL is also being used for adjusting concrete programmes and projects in order to increase livelihood resilience. It is highly recommended to incorporate these kinds of analyses into country programmes and projects.

Research in India has found that girls\u2019 nutrition suffers most during periods of low consumption and rising food prices, and that rainfall shortages are more strongly associated with deaths among girls than boys (UNDP, 2007). MDG 2: Achieve universal primary education Increases the workload needed for agricultural production and subsistence activities Environmental changes are likely to drive migration Less access to safe water Generally, girls and women are responsible for the collection of water and fuelwood. In the poorest areas of the world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, women and girls can spend 3\u20134 hours per day on these tasks. Flooding,\ufffddrought\ufffdand\ufffddesertification\ufffdcan\ufffdextend\ufffdthese\ufffd burdens geographically, forcing more girls in more communities to forego education.

According to UNHCR, 80% of refugees in the world are women and children. Migration of populations, given extreme changes and disasters, could interrupt and limit the opportunities for education. Men are more likely to migrate, either seasonally or for a number of years. Female-headed households left behind are often the poorest. The workloads of these women, their children and the elderly increase significantly\ufffdas\ufffda\ufffdresult\ufffdof\ufffdmale\ufffdemigration. 101 Instruments and techniques / Module 3 MDG 3: Promote gender equality and empower women Increases deaths and injuries where inequality exists Exacerbates existing gender inequalities Inhibits political, economic and social empowerment A 2006 study of 141 natural disasters by the London School of Economics found that when economic\ufffdand\ufffdsocial\ufffdrights\ufffdare\ufffdfulfilled\ufffdfor\ufffdboth\ufffdsexes,\ufffd the same number of women and men die in disasters. On the contrary, when women do not enjoy economic and social rights equal to men, more women than men die in disasters. This gender discrepancy has come to light in a range of major disasters, including Hurri- cane Mitch, Hurricane Katrina, and other storms in the Americas; European heat waves; and cyclones in South Asia. In some Latin American countries, due to the social behaviour assigned to men, in disaster situations, men tend to take extreme risks during natural events under what is call the \u201csuperman syndrome.\u201d This has caused unnecessary deaths, i.e., crossing rivers with strong currents.

It is well documented that climate change affects women more than men. This is because of existing inequalities. The vicious circle is that the more women are affected negatively by climate change, the worse the inequalities get. And the worse the inequalities get, the worse the impact becomes. This vicious circle has a devastating effect on economic and trade growth, and can significantly delay achievement of the MDGs (Supachai Panitchpakdi, Secretary-General of UNCTAD, 2008).

Adaptation was originally viewed as a secondary and long-term option to which to turn if mitigation efforts were not enough. As it has become clear that mitigation efforts will not be sufficient, adaptation is now considered to be a priority. Humanity, Box 1 Definition of adaptation The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines adaptation as: \u201c\u2026adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects or impacts.

It is dynamic and changes with time, place and social, economic, and political conditions (Wilches-Chaux, 1998). The vulnerability approach in understanding relations between human populations and their environment tells us that vulnerability and therefore risk are social constructs, related to development processes. Disasters related to natural or human-made phenomena, including climate variability and change, are not natural but are a result of decisions made within a social, economic and political context. Gender relations tend to play a major role in the structuring of this context and therefore will have importance in vulnerability and risk construction, and their effects. Box 2 Definition of vulnerability \u201cVulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to and unable to cope with adverse effects of climate change including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude and rate of climate change and the variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity and its adaptive capacity.\u201d Source: IPCC, 2007. 109 Module 4 The Human Development Report 2007\u20132008 affirms that the historic disadvantages of women, with limited access to resources, restricted rights and no voice in decision making, make them extremely vulnerable to climate change. Given that there is a wide range of variability in the nature of this vulnerability, it is not enough to make generalizations, but climate change may increase present gender disadvantages (UNDP, 2007). There is significant socio-economic differentiation between men and women that is deeply rooted in social structures around the world. These include differences in access to resources such as land, credit, education, as well as unequal opportunities to participate in and influence decision-making processes. Because women use and manage natural resources in a way that is different from men, and degradation of natural resources affects them differently, these patterns of disadvantage may increase with the change in or loss of natural resources associated with climate change. For example, rural women in developing countries are the principal producers of basic foods and the agricultural sector is very exposed to risks of drought and uncertain precipitation; this means that climate change endangers food security as well as the wellbeing of families and their capacity to survive (FAO, 2007). Due to the fact that women are more vulnerable, women\u2019s participation in climate change adaptation initiatives is critical. Furthermore, it may be expected that women, by conserving the soil and water, building embankments to avoid floods and by doing more non-agricultural work, will make a large contribution to the efforts that will be required to confront climate risks. 4.2.1 Factors influencing risks for women in disasters i) Physical location The poor (the majority of whom are women) are likely to be physically located in places vulnerable to disaster risks and in poorly built environments. For example, in cities, they are likely to have inadequate housing, living in slums and shantytowns, with poor access to basic services, while in rural areas, they may Box 3 Factors that influence the vulnerability of a population Factors that influence the vulnerability of a population: environmental, physical, economic, and social which includes: political, ideological and cultural, educational, institutional and organizational. A gender perspective to vulnerability has to consider all these factors and how they each affect men and women and in what specific ways.

A case in point is a local woman representative from Bangladesh, who explained that when floods arrived, poor women did not have the capacity and resources to move to higher grounds; she lost everything she had, including her livestock (cited in the Actionaid, WEDO and UNDP event at COP-13, December 2007). In urban locations, poor women living and working in marginal areas can also be exposed to technological or human-made risks. In the Caribbean, urban women living on the island of St Lucia and in the city of Haina in the Dominican Republic specified being at risk", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6e602b6-89e4-4c8a-8123-ac1b790eda96": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6e602b6-89e4-4c8a-8123-ac1b790eda96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71873f1e4781fe9c5349b8f88f1377d6cc7e1c5f50ba9c667c040ba456c51ccd"}, "3": {"node_id": "3cbad8b6-52f0-41fc-868e-e6229a35fe56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a0fd95189efc040282cbd8dc5b950bbb0c9828831b846aa9f1c762dfe0674e66"}}, "hash": "979d8c37c03ef2e746f1ef8625ffa7992e3d1eea7ab11dc3a44f57715b68d6d4", "text": "due to industrial wastes (from pharmaceutical industries for example where they also worked) and from waste dumps and industrial warehouses which contain toxic and highly dangerous materials such as propane gas installations (Meyreles, 2003). ii) Social aspects Social vulnerability is linked to the level of wellbeing of individuals, communities and societies. It comprises features related to access to basic human rights, education and literacy levels, good governance, organizational systems, values, customs and ideological beliefs. Due to gender differences/ gaps, many women are less privileged and as a result they are more vulnerable and therefore more likely to be exposed to greater risk. For example, women are more prone to nutritional deficiencies because they have unique nutritional needs (especially when they are pregnant or breastfeeding); in south and south-east Asia, 45\u201360% of women of reproductive age are underweight and 80% of pregnant women have iron deficiencies (FAO, 2000). Gender-based violence is also a socio-cultural construct that can create specific risks for women and girls in disaster-related situations. iii) Economic factors Women are more susceptible to poverty, they have lower incomes than men, are more likely to be economically dependent and have limited access to land, finance and credit, as well as having limited likelihood of control over productive resources (Mehta, 2007); in south Asia women have less access to credit, technical resources and employment; they have limited ability to earn cash income; and have limited independent engagement in decision making; 111 Module 4 which limits their capacity to respond to disasters. In India, Nepal and Thailand for example less than 10% of women farmers own land (FAO, 2007). Furthermore, women are over-represented in the informal economy and agricultural sectors, which are underpaid, and are most susceptible to disaster risks (Mehta, 2007). iv) Education and information As regards education and literacy levels, women and girls experience many obstacles that limit their opportunities to obtain an education; of the 876 million people in the world who are illiterate, two-thirds are women and three- fifths of the 115 million children that do not go to school are girls (Lara, 2004). It has also been noticed that after a disaster or during stressful times many girls are forced to drop out of school to help with chores in the house or to save money (Davis et al., 2005). Access to information, education and communication plays a critical role in determining the effectiveness of early warning systems which are critical in reducing the impact of floods, droughts, hurricanes, tsunamis and other disasters. Women have lower literacy levels, and therefore are less likely to respond to written early warning announcements and instructions; poor education leads to less involvement in decision making and less representation in disaster response organizations and training, hence lowering their capacity to respond to disasters. v) Political will Lack of political will to acclimatize to gender and climate change, and limited access to political power and representation for marginalized groups such as women exacerbates their vulnerability to disasters. 4.2.2 Vulnerabilities and capacities It is important to note that the differences in men and women\u2019s social positions not only create specific gendered vulnerabilities and risks but also generate gender-specific capacities. The specific capacities that women have developed in different social and cultural settings can be very important during all the phases of disaster management and also for climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. For example, research on women\u2019s risk at the local level in the Caribbean (Enarson et al., 2001) has shown that Caribbean 112 women consider family and friends networks as their main capacity during disaster situations. In Dominica, for example, the Koudmen, or family and friends network, has a sacred character (ibid). Women in communities tend to have valuable information regarding community and family members: who is missing, who needs special attention. Local governments should start a bottom-up process where these capacities and others are recognized and utilized. The Cuban experience in disaster management is a good example of a community- based approach (Wisner et al., 2006). Disaster studies con- tain many examples of analyzing gender vulnerabilities and capacities that could be very useful for climate change adaptation efforts (see Gomariz, 1999). 4.2.3 Disaster risk management Climate change is not a threat associated with an isolated catastrophe but with the risk of disaster which, in many respects, is slow to appear.

In other words, risk management is the result of the capacities of societies and their stakeholders to transform risk by acting on its external and underlying causes. It includes intervention methods and means that tend to reduce, mitigate or prevent disasters. Disaster risk management and climate change adaptation efforts should be integrated. The Oslo Policy Forum Report recognized \u2022\ufffd During the Bangladesh cyclone of 1991, early warning signals did not reach large numbers of women. The information was passed through the market places, and because Bangladesh society is highly sex-segregated, many women do not have easy access to market places. \u2022\ufffd It had been expected that men would convey the warning to their family members but they did not do so; consequently women were uninformed, unprepared, and unable to respond to the risks of disaster for themselves, their children, and their belongings. \u2022\ufffd Relief distribution centres and shelters were reported to be ill-suited for women\u2019s gender and culture-specific needs: in a social context where seclusion is customary, the shelters were reported to be crowded and lacked privacy for pregnant, lactating and menstruating women. Shelters also lacked separate toilets and adequate water supplies (UNEP, 1997). \u2022\ufffd Studies have shown that ensuring women have access to the warning systems, achieves positive results. In Hawaii during the 1998 El Ni\u00f1o event, women were targeted with early warning information that included information about treating drinking water; this succeeded in significantly reducing the incidence of diarrhoea (Kinoti, 2008). \u2022\ufffd In rural communities of El Salvador, women were taught how to use radios in order to report on rising water levels. This led to more effective early warning information for the whole community (Enarson et al., 2003). \u2022\ufffd There are disaster warning information needs specific to women. A study conducted in South Africa reported that women farmers preferred seasonal climate forecast information to be relayed by extension workers or through schools as opposed to the radio, which was the preferred medium for men since men have greater access as well as more time to listen to radios (Kinoti, 2008). Box 5 Example of the consequences of the lack of a gender response in early warning systems 114 that \u201cDRR is a fundamental element to achieve climate change adaptation\u201d (OPFR, 2008). The report makes specific recommendations regarding funding, development plans at all levels, integration and communication efforts between DRR and climate change experts. It also stresses collaborative efforts and strengthening of the international system, amongst other important suggestions, in order for disaster risk management and climate change adaptation to become concerted efforts and support sustainable development (ibid). Disaster risk management may function as a link between decision making, planning, execution and control that allows women and men to analyze their surroundings, and decide and develop proposals about concerted action designed to reduce existing risks, that is to say risks which, if not properly managed, may become disasters. A gender-differentiated impact becomes more evident during emergency situations: Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper analyzed disasters in 141 countries and \u2022\ufffd found that, when it came to deaths, gender differences were directly linked to women\u2019s economic and social rights; in societies where women and men enjoyed equal rights, disasters caused the same number of deaths in both sexes. They also confirmed that discre- pancies were the result of existing inequalities. For example, boys were given preferential treatment during rescue efforts and, following disasters, both women and girls suffered more from shortages of food and economic resources (Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper, 2007). Studies show that women, boys and girls are 14 times more likely than \u2022\ufffd men to die during a disaster (Peterson, 2007).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9fca2b2-f98f-4554-8ce6-092287f099ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9fca2b2-f98f-4554-8ce6-092287f099ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5f7051a8ba2c1cdb103093c1e0f9e1e80b0a3da580e2f932c6a6fdde400b084"}, "2": {"node_id": "e68f9436-7982-4c68-87c1-856c3ab90aa1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "079e987c62b467968d5f90afb84403814827a0b6fcb75f0d2eaec831f61fa2aa"}}, "hash": "1baebba19bfad83c4c4c1ed162a34deec9d1e83445243a8a538c4ea0ca24a9da", "text": "In 1991, during the cyclone disasters in Bangladesh, of the 140,000 \u2022\ufffd people who died, 90% were women (Ikeda, 1995).

This social prejudice means that girls and women in Sri Lanka have very few possibilities of surviving in future disasters (Oxfam, 2005). Following a disaster, it is more likely that women will be victims of \u2022\ufffd domestic and sexual violence; they even avoid using shelters for fear of being sexually assaulted (Davis et al., 2005). Nutritional condition determines the capacity to deal with disasters \u2022\ufffd (Cannon, 2002). Women are more likely to suffer from malnutrition because they have specific nutritional needs when they are pregnant or breast-feeding, and some cultures have food hierarchies. For example, in south and south-east Asia, 45\u201360% of women of reproductive age are below their normal weight and 80% of pregnant women have iron deficiencies. In sub-Saharan Africa, women lift much heavier loads than men but consume fewer calories because the culture rules that men receive more food (FAO, 2000). In some cases, gender differences also increase men\u2019s mortality in \u2022\ufffd disaster situations. Many men are exposed to risky situations and even die because they believe that by being the \u201cstronger sex\u201d they need not take precautions and because society expects them to take heroic rescue action. For example, there were more immediate deaths among men when Hurricane Mitch struck Central America, not only because they were engaged in open-air activities, but because they took fewer precautions when facing risks (Bradshaw, 2004). In Kenya, fetching water may use up to 85% of a woman\u2019s daily \u2022\ufffd energy intake; in times of drought a greater work load is placed on women\u2019s shoulders, some spend up to eight hours a day in search of water (Duncan, 2007). Extreme weather events often create conditions conducive to \u2022\ufffd outbreaks of infectious diseases; heavy rains produce insect breeding grounds, and contaminate clean water sources while drought on the other hand can cause fungal spores and spark fires. Women, especially expectant mothers, are highly vulnerable to water-borne diseases, thermal and other extreme events. 116 In refugee camps that arise as a result of natural disasters and conflicts \u2022\ufffd over scarce resources, women and the girl child refugees are exposed to higher risks compared to male refugees. Social strains in such situations aggravate stress levels in the family, which may result in incidences of domestic violence. A study in Uganda shows how male and female-headed households \u2022\ufffd fare differently in resettlement situations. Women agreed \u201cit was a much harder job for them due to lack of tools and men\u201d. The impact of resettlement on health, supplying basic necessities such as water and childcare, was much worse for the female-headed households (Katwikirize, 2002). 1. Think big: gender equality and the principles of risk reduction must guide all disaster mitigation aspects, responses to disasters and reconstruction. The window of opportunity is quick to close. 2. Know the facts: gender analysis is not an option but it is imperative to direct help and plan an equitable recovery. 3. Work with women in base organizations: in communities the women\u2019s organizations have information, knowledge, experiences, networks and resources that are vital to increase resilience when faced with disasters. Work with and build the capacities of existing women\u2019s groups. 4. 5. Resist stereotypes: base all initiatives on knowledge of the specific contexts and differences of each culture, economic situation, as well as political and sexual differences, and not on false generalizations. 6. Use a human rights approach: democratic and participatory initiatives are of more help to women and girls. Both men and women have a right to the conditions they need to enjoy their fundamental human rights, as well as simply to survive. 7. Respect and build women\u2019s capacities. Avoid overburdening women who already have a very heavy workload and many family responsibilities. Source: Gender and Disasters Network, 2005.

The women do not normally become involved with decision making, but the information they provided benefited the entire community (Anderson, 2002). 4.3 The role of women in climate change adaptation 4.3.1 Women and men as agents of change As already stated in Module 3, it is necessary to stress that women are not vulnerable because they are \u201cnaturally weaker\u201d, but because conditions of vulnerability faced by men and women are different because of their gender. Women, like men, have particular socially-built vulnerabilities and capacities which have been developed through a socialization process. They are, however, also capable of bettering themselves, becoming empowered, or changed. Women are not passive, they do not only receive help \u2013 they are active agents with different capacities to respond to the challenges posed by climate change. 4.3.2 Differentiated relationship of women and men with the environment When we discuss vulnerabilities, or the role women and men can play as change agents, the starting point is an analysis of the differentiated relationship women and men have with environmental resources. Women and men relate differently to the environment for a combination of the following reasons: Level of dependence on environmental subsistence resources; \u2022\ufffd Unequal relations in using, having access to, and controlling \u2022\ufffd resources, and in the distribution of benefits; \u2022\ufffd Ownership of, and rights to, resources; and 118 Differentiated knowledge about resources, their products and \u2022\ufffd environmental problems. As discussed in 4.2, when ecosystems become more fragile and natural resources are totally lost or are out of reach, poor communities \u2013 that depend on them for their survival \u2013 are the most affected, particularly women, the elderly and children. Because women use and manage natural resources in a way that is different from men, and degradation of natural resources affects them differently, these patterns of disadvantage may increase with the change in or loss of natural resources associated with climate change. For example, rural women in developing countries are the principal producers of staple foods. Their role in agricultural production is essential for the nutritional status of families as well as the generation of a source of income. However, female farmers are often overlooked in agricultural policies and strategies or those relating to climate change. Farmers are often perceived as \u201cmale\u201d by policy makers, planners and agricultural service deliverers. As the agricultural sector is very exposed to risks of drought and uncertain precipitation, this means that climate change endangers food security as well as the wellbeing of families and their capacity to survive (FAO, 2007). In the Dominican Republic, urban women living in marginalized sectors, for example in the city of Santo Domingo, many of whom are heads of households, are responsible for the family\u2019s water supply. In areas where there is no piped water, women have to travel distances to get fresh water, or buy water, thus straining low family incomes with no guarantee as to the quality of the water (Meyreles, 2004). Climate change could greatly affect the situation of families living in these conditions, impacting on health and income in important ways. 4.3.3 Women\u2019s role in adapting to and mitigating climate change Due to women\u2019s higher level of vulnerability, as a result of historic and existing socio-economic inequalities, their participation in climate change adaptation initiatives is critical. Furthermore, it may be expected that women, in their specific relation to natural resources, through the conservation of soil and water, the building of embankments to avoid floods and other types of related activities could make a significant contribution to the efforts that will be required to confront climate risks. One example is the community of Keur Moussa in Senegal, where erosion was making less water available, washing the soil off the land used for sowing crops, and causing young men and women to migrate to the 119 Module 4 cities. Women\u2019s organizations helped to control erosion by building canals in the shape of a half moon to retain the water, recover the crop lands and improve agricultural output (see Case study 2 in Module 6). 4.3.4 Risk management and empowerment of women As described above, women are mostly perceived as victims of climate change and not as positive agents of change that can contribute to adaptation strategies. Moreover, it is not often recognized that natural disasters could also provide women with a unique chance to challenge and change gender roles in their society (Enarson, 2000). For example, in 1998 the community of La Masica, in Honduras, was given gender- sensitive community training about early warning and risk systems. With that training, the women in the community", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3897b9d-13a3-43ea-bfa1-68ca16b7474e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3897b9d-13a3-43ea-bfa1-68ca16b7474e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ddd49b7b7d3f53a14631b2b29359daa147aa6cd124a96d6be7cf67c14ccad2ae"}}, "hash": "ddd49b7b7d3f53a14631b2b29359daa147aa6cd124a96d6be7cf67c14ccad2ae", "text": "took charge of monitoring the early warning systems that had been abandoned.

A transnational oil company in their country was burning most of the natural gas to cut maintenance costs and avoid involvement with other industries; the amount of gas being burnt was more than in any other part of the world and emitted more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the whole sub-Saharan region. In 1999 the women of the Niger delta organized simultaneous protests in Nigeria and the United Kingdom that resulted in the company\u2019s London headquarters being closed, and the temporary closing of the wells. As the protests continued, the company turned to military control and in a confrontation, 200 people were killed and many women raped. Hundreds of women members of the Niger Delta Women\u2019s Organization for Justice, indignant about the rapes and assassinations, organized a protest, as well as several political awareness workshops for women. Finally, in January 2006, due to social pressure, the Nigerian courts cancelled the gas company\u2019s licence and ordered that a stop be put to flaring natural gas in petroleum wells in the western zone of the Niger delta. This unprecedented international action shows that women are important agents for change who can help to mitigate climate change. Source: Adapted from Turner and Brownhill, 2006. 120 prevent\u201d. The campaign proved effective in changing men\u2019s attitudes towards violence against women, and therefore tackled existing power structures (Pan- American Health Organization, 1998 as quoted in WEDO, 2008). Another example comes from Bangladesh, where climate patterns have changed in recent years and rains have become increasingly stronger and less predictable. The floods of 2004 left enormous losses with 280 people losing their life, around four million having to be evacuated and thousands of others left without food or housing (MAAS, 2004). In the district of Gaibandha a woman named Sahena was trying to deal with these flood patterns. She organized a committee in her community to prepare women for when the floods arrive. The committee taught the women to make portable clay ovens, to raise their houses and use radios to hear of possible floods or climate change. Although Sahena faced resistance from her husband and women in the community, she became president of the committee and managed to earn the respect of the community. Efforts such as hers save lives and empower women (Oxfam, 2008). During the aftermath of Hurricane Georges in the Dominican Republic, local rural and urban women\u2019s organizations were the first to deal with the situation in shelters. Due to their work with endemic medicinal plants, the women were able to help with remedies and providing care, before official medical personnel could come in. These organizations also helped with reconstruction efforts, getting aid for rebuilding homes for the community and helping women to take part in credit projects for rebuilding. This gave women a new status in their community and changed the way women were perceived and their role in decision making (Meyreles, 2000). 4.4 Climate change adaptation and equitable access to resources An understanding of the relations between gender and sustainable development requires an analysis of patterns of use, knowledge and skills related to managing, using and conserving natural resources. Only by applying a gender approach is it possible to have a clearer and complete view of the relations people have built with ecosystems. Men and women face their social, economic and environmental reality in different ways; how they participate is also different and is closely related to age, socio-economic class and culture. For example, women have access to only 5% of the concessions given worldwide to manage and use natural resources. 121 Module 4 The following resource sectors, in addition to the forestry and energy sectors outlined in other modules of this training manual, are relevant for finding equitable adaptation responses to climate change. 4.4.1 Water and sanitation Climate change causes increased water availability in humid tropics and at high latitudes, and a decline in water availability and increase in droughts at mid latitudes and low semi-arid latitudes.

More than 1,000 million people in less developed countries have no access to drinking water and 2,400 million lack access to a proper sanitary service. In most parts of the world, in rural and urban areas, women and girls are responsible for collecting water for cooking, cleaning, health and hygiene, and if they have access to land, growing food. Increasingly limited water supplies, poor service delivery, and pollution are jeopardizing women\u2019s survival and that of their families. 4.4.2 Biodiversity and ecosystems It is estimated that each temperature increase of 1\u00b0C makes species migrate up to 160 km away from the zones where they are located, because seeds are dispersed and habitats changed. The speed with which climate change is occurring will be such that it will not allow natural adaptation and will put to the test the resilience of socio-economic systems. In addition, anthropogenic changes in most cases reduce options for finding appropriate locations to which to migrate. If species are not able to find new habitats, change their life cycles, or if they do not have evolutionary processes that result in new physical characteristics, they will be condemned to extinction. Ecologists have estimated that between 15\u201337% of natural species may be extinguished by 2050 as a result of climate change and habitat change (Thullier, 2007). Studies have demonstrated that certain species are more vulnerable than others to the effects of climate change. For example, it is predicted that, if present GHG emissions are maintained, up to 60% of mountain plant species could be extinguished (Thullier, 2007) and that coral reefs will experience episodes of bleaching every two years (Donner et al., 2007). 122 Changes in precipitation, melting ice patterns and glacier reduction will affect the levels of rivers and lakes, limiting access to drinking water. This is vitally important in regions that get their drinking water from melting mountain snow and ice and in which a sixth of the world\u2019s human population lives. The inhabitants of dry lands face more frequent and longer-lasting droughts. As this situation worsens, millions of people will be obliged to move when they see their water sources impaired. It may also be anticipated that the natural response of human beings to the rise in temperature will be to increase their demand for potable water for urban and agricultural needs. This will cause wetlands to be over-exploited with the effect of reducing flows in rivers and streams. The rise in temperature will lead to increased evapotranspiration, reduced run-offs and infiltration and, therefore, less availability of fresh water and soil humidity. Forest fires are also an increased risk. Women and men play different roles in community conservation efforts, with women often taking leadership in seed selection and preservation. Women have a profound knowledge of the flora and fauna in their environment and respective conservation methods, and traditionally have used indigenous resources for food, medicines and energy. It has been found that women invest 90\u201395% of the money they receive related to biodiversity on improving the family\u2019s quality of life. When species are lost, this has an impact on the most vulnerable groups, particularly women. While biodiversity management systems rely on women\u2019s knowledge, skills and labour, it often does not include women in decision making, including related to new technology or information (FAO, 1999). The use of energy and the production of energy are also areas in which men and women have different roles, information and perspectives. Energy- saving activities will affect women\u2019s household activities and may take up more time. Situations in which energy is scarce, specifically in urban settings were activities depend on energy input, can produce life-threatening situations due to improper or illegal connections to power supplies in poor settlements. Generators and other energy-producing technologies can be highly contaminating, specifically in the home where women and children are. In the Dominican Republic, between 1960 and 2000 the majority of small disasters 123 Module 4 occurred in poor urban homes due to fires caused by electrical short-circuiting (IFC and LA RED, 2002). Access to clean and safe energy is an important aspect of avoiding disaster situations and of adaptation strategies for climate change. 4.4.3 Agriculture and food security Agricultural ecosystems and food security are especially vulnerable to climate change. There are localized negative impacts on small landowners, subsistence farmers, and fishermen, and declines and increases in cereal crop yields depending on the region. Since the practice of agriculture began more than 12,000 years ago, about 7,000 species of plants have been cultivated for food, and today 90% of our", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5a99fca-50b9-4a2f-9eb0-906825663f1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5a99fca-50b9-4a2f-9eb0-906825663f1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "297d6387dad8dfa0a567794f2379237901247498213d3173e355fbba1ee3fcbc"}}, "hash": "297d6387dad8dfa0a567794f2379237901247498213d3173e355fbba1ee3fcbc", "text": "food is provided by only 15 species of plants and eight species of animals. Conserving varieties of wild ancestors of these foods could provide alternatives so that, in future, new species could be developed that are resistant to drastic climate changes. Unfortunately, many of these wild ancestors are already in danger of extinction. For example, it is predicted that a quarter of the wild potato species will disappear in the next 50 years (CBD, 2007). Projections made by the IPCC indicate that agriculture in hot subtropical countries will be more affected than in temperate subtropical countries. In the agriculture sector, rural women in less developed countries are the principal basic food producers. This sector is very exposed to risks of drought and potential rain pattern changes. The Oslo Policy Forum recommends land use, land tenure and legal aspects concerning the poor be taken into consideration when looking at climate change adaptation. In all of these aspects women have specific conditions, which could place them at a disadvantage (Oslo Policy Forum Report, 2008). 4.4.4 Coasts Erosion of coastal zones and an increase in sea level caused by melting ice will produce particularly significant effects: floods in coastal zones and salt water invading freshwater reserves such as estuaries and aquifers. The IPCC emphasizes that developing countries face major challenges in adapting to these changes, above all considering that these densely populated zones will be affected by other phenomena such as tropical storms. Coastal areas are 124 more vulnerable to damage caused by floods and storms, and about 30% of the coastal wetlands may disappear. Women are involved in the fisheries sector, particularly in processing fish, preparing for market, small-scale harvesting, activities that are close to the shore. Due to their focus on activities that are often on the sideline of harvesting, women\u2019s tasks in relation to fisheries have not been prioritized in economic analyses or resource investment. Limited access to and representation in decision making has also led to women\u2019s interests not being included in coastal plans (CIDA, n.d.). 4.4.5 Desertification Climate change accelerates the loss of vegetation and thus desertification. As rainy seasons become shorter and droughts increase, land erosion and infertile soils become the norm. Decreased vegetation cover then reduces rainfall further through increased evapotranspiration. This cycle that is exacerbated by climate change also affects rural livelihoods. In addition to threatening food and water security, rural communities are faced with conflicts over resources and may be forced to migrate. In Africa, droughts and floods have become more intense and more irregular in recent decades. Droughts are the most serious cause of food shortages, causing 60% of food emergencies (GTZ and OSS, 2007). Women\u2019s traditional roles and knowledge in natural resource management and agricultural practices are central to preserving food, water and medicines. Yet in drylands throughout the world, particularly in much of Africa, women are affected by erosion and decreased crop and livestock productivity. A variety of factors contribute to women\u2019s unequal access to services and decision making, including lack of land ownership, illiteracy, political will and gender bias, and cultural restrictions. 4.4.6 Health Most health consequences of climate change will be adverse. It is estimated that in 2000 alone, climate change was responsible for 2.4% of cases of diarrhoea worldwide and 6% of cases of malaria. In general terms, climate change will have three types of health repercussions: 125 Module 4 Direct effects of extreme climate events; 1. Consequences on health caused by environmental disorders due to 2. climate change; and 3. Other consequences on health ( i.e., traumas, infections, psycho- logical diseases and negative effects on food security, among others) caused by populations being displaced due to economic problems, environmental degradation or conflicts arising because of climate change (World Health Organization, 2003). Climate change will lead to increased malnutrition and gastro-intestinal, cardio-respiratory and infectious diseases. Heat waves, floods and droughts will lead to increased mortality and changes in the distribution of some disease vectors. Health services will also be burdened by an increase in patients. Children, particularly girls, and the elderly are most vulnerable to heat stress and the spread of disease. In times of disaster and environmental change, women and girls are expected to care for ill members of the family, which takes time away from income generation and education. Women and girls may have difficulty accessing health services due to high medical costs and cultural restrictions related to mobility (Brody et al., 2008). 4.4.7 Negative effects of adaptation initiatives on gender inequality and possible solutions Below an analysis is made of a series of adaptation measures based on the suggestions made by Aguilar et", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8466ad1a-89e1-4bb7-914d-d574446abd57": {"__data__": {"id_": "8466ad1a-89e1-4bb7-914d-d574446abd57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dda503705ebfab2249795fef7248d2910372771949c901446499b6c8adc79e84"}, "3": {"node_id": "c602edf3-08f4-4d60-9ade-d9b7d417a707", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "179f3995d2297ca83d49cb290d089498a9253db7f079cc63f54b96badcfa399b"}}, "hash": "cec03a613eb5b7dbe768fdd5728754f04ead9b566f13afa9d777b760f2ac2d47", "text": "al. (2008). The possible negative impact of not taking into account gender relations, that is to say, replicating inequality, is shown. Suggestions are also made that may be considered when designing and implementing such measures. 126 Table 1. Gender-sensitive adaptation measures 1 Managing infrastructure and settlements Measures Possible negative impacts Suggestions Promote training and hiring of both women and men. Ensure access to wage-earning productive activities to improve living conditions for families. Include gender criteria in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs).

Involve women in monitoring the effects of climate change, for example in coral ecosystems and in aquaculture. Include women in strategies to adapt to the reduction of marine species, or managing new marine species. Develop initiatives to recover and reforest mangroves. Implement integrated coastal management policies that consider risk management and gender approaches. Include gender criteria in EIAs.

Divert fresh water to areas where there is a water shortage (dikes, water transfer, or irrigation canals) or increase extraction from subterranean water reserves Ignores women\u2019s requirements of fresh water needed for their productive and reproductive activities. May lengthen and intensify women\u2019s productive and reproductive working day by placing water sources in distant zones. Privatizing water means high prices, loss of supply, health problems, corruption, etc., making it harder for poor women and their families to have access to it. 2 Managing ecosystems Measures Possible negative impacts Suggestions Analyze gender relations associated with the use of, access to, management and control of coastal environmental resources. Promote equitable inclusion of women and men when introducing varieties. Create jobs with equitable participation of women and men.

May conceal the active participation of women in productive processes, for example,\ufffdfishing.1 1 Women are often responsible for making nets, collecting bait, fishing in estuaries, on coasts and in intertidal zones, processing and selling, and work on fish farms and in processing plants. From the coast they also support their companions with tasks related to communications, accounts and quality control, or in preparing food for fishing trips. 3 Productive activities Measures Possible negative impacts Suggestions Consider women as water users, both domestically and for production such as growing crops and raising animals. Analyze the use women can make of irrigated land to provide subsistence foods. Promote technologies appropriate to the needs of women and give them the proper training. Encourage equity in access to irrigated land ownership. Change crop irrigation; times, type and uses May remove water sources for domestic use or place them further away. May lengthen or intensify the productive and reproductive working day. Build new capacities for women and create non-traditional job sources. Substitute agriculture May not take account of women\u2019s participation in agricultural activities, excluding them from new processes. Again may raise obstacles to using, having access to, managing and controlling resources (land, credit and training). 130 4 Socio-economic processes Measures Possible negative impacts Suggestions Promote the exercise of women\u2019s rights. Encourage access by women and men to skilled and remunerated jobs. Ensure women and men have access to labour protection systems. Draw attention to the contribution migrant women and men make to their families and communities. Develop support services for communities, families and individuals left behind (who remained in the community of origin) as a result of migration. Migration and community destabilization in areas affected by climate change. Socio-economic and gender inequalities in access to job opportunities, education, health, housing and credit.

While all NAPAs have been completed as of this writing, the implementation and budget are entry points for gender mainstreaming. Prior to implementation, a gender analysis of the NAPA can be undertaken, in order to review how climate change affects women and 131 Module 4 men differently, and to explore scaling up of specific innovations that promote gender equality and women\u2019s participation. Also, to ensure gender targets are being consistently met, a \u201cgender team\u201d can be formed to create processes that monitor gender targets at all stages. Mainstreaming the NAPAs with a gender perspective will not only contribute to successful progression towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), but also alleviate environmental pressures by utilizing an overlooked demographic as innovative and potent agents of change. The following steps for gender mainstreaming were adapted from \u201cMainstreaming Gender into the Climate Change Regime\u201d (COP 10, 14 December, 2004) and were supported by the UNEP Women\u2019s Assembly, held in Nairobi in October 2004: Analyze the effects of climate change from both a male and female \u2022\ufffd perspective; Incorporate a female perspective when designing and implementing \u2022\ufffd projects; Gender-sensitive criteria and indicators should be developed and \u2022\ufffd applied; When collecting and presenting data include women\u2019s statistics as \u2022\ufffd well as men\u2019s; Capitalize on the talents and contributions of both women and \u2022\ufffd men; Set targets for female participation in activities; \u2022\ufffd Ensure that women are represented in 50% of all decision-making \u2022\ufffd processes; Make women\u2019s equality, access to information, economic resources \u2022\ufffd and education a priority; Focus on gender differences in capabilities to cope with climate \u2022\ufffd change adaptation and mitigation; and 132 Undertake a gender analysis of all budget lines and financial \u2022\ufffd instruments. NAPAs must take into consideration economic aspects such as budgeting, not only for mitigation and adaptation initiatives but also for the development of the NAPA. Writing NAPAs implies the use of resources and these should be tied to gender-sensitive processes. NAPAs must also be based on and include local development plans, insuring a bottom-up approach to the whole process, their reviewing and approval and they must guarantee the inclusion of gendered local knowledge. NAPAs must be tied into disaster risk management plans. This implies a coordinated effort on the part of governments and the private sector, and all stakeholders. The links between sustainable development, disaster risk management and climate change mitigation and adaptation should be essential to NAPAS. The Oslo Policy Forum Report clearly states that there should not be \u201cparallel agendas\u201d, and development planning, national budgeting for adaptation, institutional arrangements, public awareness, the poverty issue and peace and conflict issues should all be integrated into the agendas. This process must be construed to guarantee a gender perspective, which many governments have not yet been able to implement. Tying the budgeting process to the inclusion of a gender perspective could help to guarantee success. NAPAs should stress the costs of adaptation. There has to be specific and clear information as to the financing process for adaptation initiatives. These initiatives have to be gender sensitive and the costs for this must be clearly stated (Oslo Policy Forum Report, 2008). 4.5.2 Disaster Risk Reduction plans The UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN/ISDR) has taken steps to include gender in its Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) plans of action under the Hyogo Framework of Action (HFA). In the DRRs, gender is incorporated by ensuring equal access to educational opportunities for vulnerable women, developing early warning systems which take gender and cultural livelihoods into account, and by utilizing a gender perspective in decision-making processes when implementing risk management policies. DRRs are meant to be implemented in national action plans in preparation for natural disasters. UN/ISDR is involved in gender mainstreaming and lessons learned in the field and uses examples of women as powerful agents of 133 Module 4 sustainable change (UN/ISDR, 2008). This can be an example of lessons learned and can be used by development planners to modify projects so that they capitalize on the significance of women\u2019s input and their eminent potential for change. DRRs can be modified to promote more gender-sensitive approaches in guiding countries towards more sustainable practices while reducing the impacts of natural disasters.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29be7082-9cd6-4736-be8b-29708ef58283": {"__data__": {"id_": "29be7082-9cd6-4736-be8b-29708ef58283", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03dd2677ffcc9709d2c6976d2e0b54961b7b6997e054c57bba953e38d4bf7d08"}, "2": {"node_id": "54824657-c15b-4954-aaea-55cf2febbf48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92f4e91c342462d473fccc2809a69d9f9b4f50bab54eb6dfae4e19093d5550e0"}}, "hash": "404f26ee2a25b9568f29e30cf6748234522dff30ada62b40d61effe3a971aee8", "text": "New strategies can be created from a gender perspective, existing projects can be scaled up to ensure the vital participation of women at every level, and women\u2019s networks can be used to lead their communities, not only in times of disaster, but to become regular fixtures on local, national", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a51da7f-a9d8-4e96-be00-39a2efbe28d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a51da7f-a9d8-4e96-be00-39a2efbe28d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d99128e6a593086e9f59df3aee8ec15839b60514dd8535a35e2bd5e38ee34a68"}, "3": {"node_id": "c27a8132-3330-4854-9bf3-f7a756f4a7b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d79ca63c2328c7bc70e2ad75d621a06c4e59981ce5331e16fb24d6beb11c3b4"}}, "hash": "7356f776f207d2a36f9748b8a3abc7361bfd2e401ba260344dd807e42eeaddc4", "text": "and international stages (UN/ISDR, 2008).

The already increasing frequency and impact of disasters in the wider African continent is exacerbated by underlying human vulnerabilities.

The culmination of the project will see the girls designing and hosting a community event where they will share their risk reduction knowledge with the other men, women and children in the community to design a plan for the community to reduce the impact of disasters. Gender is a central focus of the programme and therefore it was essential to integrate a gender approach into the project\u2019s implementation, such as using women facilitators as role models. With this initiative, girls have been empowered and encouraged to voice their opinions, will gain more confidence and respect, and will have more to contribute to their relationships, livelihoods, family and community. Twenty-five girls between the ages of 13 and 18 will be the first 137 Case study 1 / Module 4 direct beneficiaries. The programme is not designed to benefit these girls exclusively, but rather it is based on the premise of using them as facilitators to help promote information and provide \u201csocial services\u201d to the community as a whole. The Sonderwater community of men, women and children (approximately 3,000 households) will be the recipients of the \u201cteam of leaders\u201d and will work with these girls and the local disaster committee to develop an effective localized community-based disaster plan. Local government representatives will gain valuable insight into the risks facing their constituents. This knowledge can lead to better policies and support for future projects, leading to more cost-effective disaster reduction measures. This project addresses the social vulnerability of women and girls in an effective, integrative, cost-effective, participatory, non-technical and easily replicable manner. Poor black girls in South African townships are challenged by cultural and social ideologies, which often rank them as inferior. The initiative\u2019s methods look at why they are vulnerable \u2013 specifically physiology, lack of resources, limitations on access to information and nearly non-existent decision-making power. It acknowledges the complexity of external factors that contribute to vulnerability, but also provides practical, age-appropriate information and builds capacity. This capacity directly encourages and promotes the voices of these girls to be integrated into decision making within disaster planning but also gives them the foundation for building greater respect as equals within their community. The practice does not seek to keep intelligent girls in isolation but to develop them as leaders, role models and facilitators to help improve the conditions of the men, women and children living within their community.

Geneva: ISDR. 138 Case study 2 Gender roles in disasters in Pacific Island countries Community consultations on disaster prevention in Samoa, Solomon Islands, Fiji and Kiribati revealed disparities in how women and men perceive and approach disasters and preparedness. The consultations were part of a study to improve understanding of the relative status, roles and responsibilities of women and men in Pacific Island households and communities, with the objective of designing more gender-inclusive strategies and programmes, and enabling women to be mainstreamed into disaster management programmes at local, national and regional levels. Methodology While the division of labour between men and women varies quite markedly within and between Pacific Island countries, the most significant fact about gendered roles revealed by this study is that a line is drawn in all countries between private versus public, or informal versus formal, authority. In all countries, with few exceptions, women are assigned the domestic sphere, making sure that everyone\u2019s physical needs are met and that children and old people are cared for; that there is enough water, fuel, food, bedding, mats, essential household goods and clothing; and that the house, household belongings and compound are clean. Men make decisions in the public sphere (i.e., about relations between the family and other families, the extended family, the village, the district, the province and the government). In Samoa, women have more public authority than in other countries, although this is confined to decision making within the defined women\u2019s sphere of water, health, hygiene, beautification and hospitality. However the increasing role of the state in providing water and sanitation services, and the growing centralization of health services, means that women\u2019s responsibilities in these areas are decreasing; water supply is gradually becoming incorporated into national infrastructure under the water authority, and these issues have shifted to the National Committee of pulenu\u2019u (village mayors) monthly meetings with government agencies. In Fiji, Solomon Islands and Kiribati, women\u2019s associations don\u2019t have much local authority, but some have considerable influence.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49649361-46c5-45e4-bea2-d074589fa8f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "49649361-46c5-45e4-bea2-d074589fa8f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b638b7f29425b3ed9920535fcc76d05629992e82fea98818c12005def7ed7ed2"}}, "hash": "b638b7f29425b3ed9920535fcc76d05629992e82fea98818c12005def7ed7ed2", "text": "They are typically community-based, linked to churches; often with affiliations to various NGOs. The male monopoly of decision making outside the home is a significant fact to be recognized for disaster management. Disaster prevention will be less effective because it will not address practical measures for household preparation. By including women in disaster management planning and decision making, better results will be achieved. When men and women were formally asked who makes decisions about the use of household resources, such as labour allocation, goods and money, men were most likely to say that decisions were made by the (male) head 139 Case study 2 / Module 4 of the household. Women, in contrast, were most likely to say that husbands and wives made decisions together. In reality, if women\u2019s priorities are different from those of their menfolk, their priorities are less likely to prevail because they have less social and economic power. Most women knew that when a disaster warning was heard it was necessary to store food, fuel and water. However, when it came to the practicalities of how would enough of these commodities be obtained to last a week or two, where and how they could be safely stored, and how household possessions could be best secured, there were few answers. Knowledge of health risks and how to deal with them seemed limited. People in Kiribati died of dysentery, yet a simple and inexpensive treatment of oral rehydration therapy was available and few people had heard of it. As summarized in the figure below, women\u2019s lesser social power increased household vulnerability to disaster. Recommendations based on this study included: \u2022\ufffd Men must be encouraged to recognize the need, and to support shared decision making on disaster preparedness with women; \u2022\ufffd Women and men must both take part in community disaster management planning; \u2022\ufffd National disaster management committees must include senior-level representation from national women\u2019s organizations, in order to increase emphasis on prevention and preparedness.

The cropping pattern is decided in consultation with the women, who always like to have some land for food crops.\u201d \u201cThe food (millet) earlier was more nutritious, we consumed more milk and dairy products, and our diet was more balanced.\u201d Focus Group Discussion with men and women farmers (average land-holding 2 acres, rainfed) Mittamalapalli Village, Madanapalle District, Andhra Pradesh Men and women in rural Andhra Pradesh, India are observing changes in the climate conditions they have come to know through years of farming; they report that temperatures are hotter and rainfall patterns are changing. At the same time and possibly related to this, the food they now eat is not as nutritious as it once was. During conversations with these farmers about how they are coping with climatic changes, it becomes clear that men and women have different stories to tell. Men speak of migrating while women tell of new activities taken on at home. These accounts suggest that gender roles \u2013 the behaviours, tasks and responsibilities a society defines as \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d \u2013 shape the actions of women and men farmers in response to climate shifts. To what extent does a farmer\u2019s gender influence his or her response to a climate shock? Is it possible that the impacts of climatic shifts on food security are different for men and women? Little work has been done to answer these questions about the connection between gender roles and climate change adaptation, despite major international efforts to understand and reduce vulnerability of the poor and especially farmers to the risks of long- term climate change. Methods are needed to document what men and women know about climatic shifts and how they cope to ensure the food security of individuals and households. Tools are needed to incorporate the knowledge and needs of both women and men into strategies for coping with long-term change.

This, combined with analyses of the institutional context and of recorded meteorological trends, is being used to document the climate risks men and women farmers are facing in ensuring food security and the strategies they are developing in order to cope with the new factors that now threaten their livelihoods. The research is designed to develop a methodology for exploring the gender dimensions of coping with climate change impacts as well as to map new knowledge on how livelihoods are adjusted and how new coping strategies are developed for food security.

Between 1990-92 Bangladesh alone was hit by three storms, four floods, one tsunami and two cyclones which killed more than 4000,000 people and affected another 42 million. This study analyses the impact of these disasters on women and children affirming that women and female children are more vulnerable in comparison to men. This study states it is nearly impossible for women belonging to already poor and vulnerable groups to bounce back once hit by extreme events. The result in the worst scenario is often women becoming destitute with their children. There are also many flaws in the legal system, and to make things worse, the majority of women who are illiterate or semi-literate, without financial resources find it nearly impossible to seek legal protection. The high social values of marriage also play a big role in the impact of disasters on women. From the affected women\u2019s view point, their land and houses gradually being washed away by the river has denied or delayed the chances of their marriage. That delay in marriage in an overly suppressed atmosphere of a taboo- ridden society causes many psychological problems for the girls instigating feelings of worthlessness and self pity. It is impressing then how living within these victimizing relationships, women in South Asia display enormous strength and capacity throughout the entire cycle of disasters; in preparation to face hazards, managing once the disaster strikes, and in rebuilding their damaged livelihoods. As observed in other case studies often it is only women, children and the elderly that remain in the villages trapped till the flood waters recede, or managing till the rains come in prolonged droughts. During calamities, taking care of the meagre belongings of the family, ensuring food and water for the family members, looking into the concerns of rebuilding livelihoods, securing the seed and other productive material, taking care of the sick and old are almost entirely done by women.

The gender-based vulnerability of women to hazards is well documented (Wiest et al., 1994; Blaikie et al., 1994) but women\u2019s role in proactive work after disasters is less explored. They have been typecast as helpless victims, giving men the position of instrumental workers in the recovery of disaster. Gender relations in the late 20th century tend to place women in roles central to disaster recovery, based on their traditional community-building roles. Sociologists and social historians have documented women\u2019s history as activists on issues pertaining to the matter.

Women\u2019s voluntary efforts in disaster organizations make them central players in relief agencies, as is the case with the Red Cross. Hurricane Andrew hit the southernmost part of Miami, Florida, on August 23, 1992, displacing over 180,000 people and destroying the supporting infrastructure for a population of 375,000. Every cultural group was affected. Human and social service agencies stretched their resources to assist in disaster recovery. This led to the foundation of We Will Rebuild, an elitist, male dominated, culturally misrepre- senting relief group, which received much criticism for its approach, efficacy and management of funds. As a counterpoint, Women Will Rebuild emerged as a coalition of women\u2019s groups focusing on directing resources to the crisis needs of women and their families. The coalition which included at one point over 50 women\u2019s groups became a force rallying for the improvement of women\u2019s rights in the decision-making process for disaster relief. They achieved a slightly larger representation of women on We Will Rebuild\u2019s roster, as well as the creation of two new committees (Families and Children, and Domestic Violence) among other things. Women Will Rebuild succeeded in uniting a wide range of women\u2019s communities around a single issue in a time of crisis. The coalition was however severely criticized by male- centred organizations as not being able to deliver, and having feminist values as part of the infrastructure which conflicted with their goals.

In Africa, however, a region that has hardly contributed to climate change-its greenhouse gas emissions are negligible when compared with the industrialized world\u2019s-it will be a matter of life and death (Wangari Maathai, 2008). Key messages \u2022\ufffd Women\ufffd are\ufffd mainly\ufffd absent\ufffd from\ufffd the\ufffd international\ufffd dialogue\ufffd on\ufffd mitigation; \u2022\ufffd As\ufffd regards\ufffd clean\ufffd energy\ufffd sources\ufffd and\ufffd technologies,\ufffd women\u2019s\ufffd role\ufffd can not be underestimated as they are main responsibles for ensuring energy supply and security at the household level; \u2022\ufffd Concerning\ufffdcarbon\ufffdcapture,\ufffdfixing\ufffdor\ufffdsequestration,\ufffdit\ufffdis\ufffdessential\ufffdto\ufffd highlight women\u2019s role in forestry; \u2022\ufffd Sustainable\ufffdconsumption\ufffdis\ufffda\ufffdhighly\ufffdgender-sensitive\ufffdissue\ufffdas\ufffdwomen\ufffd make most of the consumer decisions. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol are the foundation of the international climate change governance. The Kyoto Protocol committed industrialized countries to achieving a specific level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions (averaging 5.2%) relative to a baseline (in most cases, 1990 levels) during the first commitment period (2008\u20132012). As pointed out in IUCN\u2019s Climate Change Situation Analysis (Drexhage, 2006), Parties to the Protocol can reduce emissions of GHGs in whichever manner they choose, consistent with the terms of the Kyoto Protocol. They can count carbon sequestration activities in the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector based on specific rules, and are also free to use international market mechanisms such as the Joint Implementation (JI), the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and International Emissions Trading as a means of meeting their Kyoto targets. 152 Over the longer term, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2001) estimates that emissions reductions of more than 60% will be necessary to stabilize GHG concentrations at year 2001 levels. This will require a substantial \u201cdecarbonization\u201d, including carbon capture and storage, of the global economy and a significant transformation of the systems used to produce and distribute energy, manufacture goods and enable transportation. Other responses to the challenges of climate change are present in other international fora. For example the 15th session of the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD), which concluded on May 2007, focused on progress in energy for sustainable development, industrial development, air pollution/atmosphere and climate change. The Chairman\u2019s summary (CSD, 2007) stressed the need to provide energy for all; promote energy efficiency; strengthen the development, use and transfer of cleaner energy technologies; and promote international cooperation on climate change, including through both mitigation and adaptation. The summary also noted \u201cthe importance of mainstreaming gender considerations, in particular the role of women in management and decision making, at all levels, was seen as necessary for implementation of the interlinked issues of energy for sustainable development, industrial development, air pollution/atmosphere and climate change\u201d.1 5.1 Gender and mitigation efforts: establishing the connections In the context of climate change, mitigation is \u201can anthropogenic intervention to reduce the sources of greenhouse gases or enhance their sinks\u201d (IPCC, 2001). It is focused on limiting net emissions so as to slow and eventually reverse the rise in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. There are certain areas in which mitigation actions are being proposed or undertaken, where women have proven over the years (and in some cases centuries) to be crucial players. Such is the case with conservation of forests and reforestation, management of local resources, consumption and energy, among others. In these proposed intervention areas for climate change mitigation, what has been lacking is awareness, recognition and acknowledgement of the role and input that rural and urban women from developed and developing countries have had and are having. While there has already been some exploration of the links between adaptation to climate change and gender equality, the gender aspects of 1 15th session of the CSD, Chairman\u2019s Summary, Point 8. 153 Module 5 mitigation are still at an initial stage.

The integration of women is most likely to succeed at the regional and local levels, but even here, it is the exception rather than the rule. In this respect, there is a need to conduct actions that will empower women to get involved in decision-making processes (i.e., training on climate change, access to information, invitation to participate in national discussion). Actions associated with mitigation are grouped into two areas: reducing GHG emissions; and carbon capture, fixing and sequestration. In each of these cases the solutions or initiatives are different in developed and developing countries and, consequently, so is the way in which gender considerations are articulated. Given their historic responsibility and differentiated economic development, mitigation actions are generally taken in developed countries and adaptation actions in less developed countries, with some notable exceptions. However, it is important to link these two aspects to confront the effects of climate change, as well as to relate them to combating poverty which is often the priority of least developed countries. Fortunately, many elements of the necessary transformation can be accomplished in ways that contribute to broad development goals as well; for example, providing clean energy to women also improves local environmental quality. Approached in this way, the challenge becomes a less narrow and costly pursuit of environmental protection, and a broader effort to re-orient our societies and economies toward a sustainable development path. Box 1 Linking adaptation and mitigation agendas Effective linking of the mitigation and adaptation agendas should fit the best-practice/no-regrets approach \u2013 i.e., actions will reduce emissions while helping countries/regions/ communities to adapt to climate change through the use of best practices (including technology and know-how). Projects that effectively address conservation, sustainable livelihoods and natural resource management (e.g., community forestry, pastoralism) will fit this description and create benefits on both sides. Decentralized renewable energy in rural areas also contributes both to mitigation and adaptation. We can expect to see a lot of activity in these areas in the next decade. Source: Drexhage, 2006. 155 Module 5 5.1.1 Carbon capture, fixing or sequestration Initiatives or projects included in these types of measures are intended to increase storage of GHG by means of \u201csinks\u201d. Sustainable agriculture, forestry (afforestation, reducing deforestation, and reforestation) and the conservation of nature come into play here. Unlike other mitigation strategies, these actions are primarily directed at the less developed countries, many of which have ecosystems that fix or capture carbon, for example, forests, mangroves and peat bogs, among others. Within the complexity of the services that forests provide for climate change mitigation, it is crucial to understand women\u2019s role in these processes. Strategies are now turning towards: understanding and taking into account the different benefits that women and men derive from forestry services; recognizing gender differences in access to, control and knowledge of forest resources; and identifying the significant differences in access of women and men to forest- related decision making, institutions, and economic opportunities. In relation to the management or conservation of forests, it is important first to understand that men and women often have different productive and reproductive roles with regard to forest resource management. They play different parts in planting, protecting or caring for seedlings and small trees, as well as in planting and maintaining homestead wood lots and plantations on public lands. Men are more likely to be involved in extracting timber and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) for commercial purposes. Women typically gather forest products for fuel, fencing, food for the family, fodder for livestock and raw materials to produce natural medicines, all of which help to increase family income.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c7a2d7d-6922-45bd-8ed6-4dadb6360fb1": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c7a2d7d-6922-45bd-8ed6-4dadb6360fb1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a0386c4e07174f41c35ef18677e60367f420a676963a66c4085edb723b9e551d"}, "2": {"node_id": "a95ec240-d198-4191-b32a-1ca94a6e5b32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3193b67f31182c7202bfd1d4eef8750e75e90a89edb949775b46f7914fff64e"}}, "hash": "327b030943e352a6e792c4b63a8c432f5a304e42c2f0de4ddea8555c9dfdcfc4", "text": "For example in south-east Cameroon, when the Baka people discussed their vision of the future, men and women turned out to have different visions.

Women\u2019s groups have also proven to be vital for the conservation of forests all around the world. In the Uttarakhand region of the Himalayas, the Chipko Movement comprises hundreds of decentralized and locally autonomous initiatives. Its leaders and activists are primarily village women. The Movement demonstrated that women can make a difference when protecting forests and developing afforestation projects. Their afforestation programme 156 not only reduced landslides, but also solved the problem of fuel and fodder. Women looked after the trees so carefully that the survival rate was between 60\u201380% (Joshi, 2007). Some of the other major achievements of the Chipko Movement have been: a 15-year ban on green felling in the Himalayan forests in Uttar Pradesh; a ban on clear felling in the Western Ghats and the Vindhyas; and greater pressure for a natural resource policy that is more sensitive to people\u2019s needs and ecological requirements. Innovative agriculture can also play an important role in mitigation, especially, agroforestry. Agroforestry is widely regarded as an important approach to lessening the problems of environmental degradation and promoting rural development through using economic trees. However, agroforestry practices are also divided between women and men according to gender roles. For example, a study carried out in Nigeria shows women do not participate in all practices and perceptual differences concerning agroforesty practices exist between women and men (Aboh and Akpabio, 2008). At the COP-13 meeting in Bali, the Parties recognized there is an urgent need for developing countries to adopt significant measures to reduce emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and undertake afforestation initiatives.2 2 UNFCCC, 2008. Box 2 India: carbon sequestration project An innovative and gender-responsive agroforestry project in Gudibanda Taluk, Karnataka, India (implemented by the NGO Women For Sustainable Development [WSD]), supports local women and men farmers in planting mango, tamarind and jackfruit tree orchards for harvest and carbon sequestration. The project support women\u2019s participation in decision-making processes by taking into account women\u2019s special condition in respect of their cultural constraints and time schedule when establishing public forums. The project established a prototype carbon marketing facility to sell the certified emissions reduction of the global environmental services that the participating poor rural women and men provide. Because farmers have an average annual income of less than US$100, they cannot afford to plant fruit trees without financial assistance. Success also requires expensive irrigation changes and planting tools. Since harvesting the crops is possible only about four years after planting, farmers will live on the carbon sales from their mango plantations until they harvest their crop. When fruit production starts one acre of crop will at least triple their annual income. The project lifetime is 35 years, with an estimated CO2 benefit of 23 tons of carbon sequestration per acre. The project target is 35,000 acres, for a total sequestration of 575,000 tons of carbon. Source: The World Bank, 2009. 157 Module 5 For example, reforestation and afforestation have both been integrated as forestry-based mitigation schemes into the international climate change regime (i.e., the Kyoto Protocol). Both practices entail converting non- forested land to forested land through planting, seeding and/or the promotion of seed banks and sources. Afforestation applies to areas that have not been forested for at least 50 years while reforestation applies to land that used to be forested but was turned over to another land use. Nowadays, there is a debate on the importance of addressing the reduction of emissions from deforestation and land degradation (REDD). Because it is estimated that close to one quarter of all GHG emissions are due to deforestation and similar types of land degradation, effective REDD strategies could be used to promote the protection of current forests. Given that women play such an important role with respect to REDD, international negotiations or regimes that take REDD into account must be vigilant about compliance with international and national commitments on gender equality and equity; they must ensure, from the beginning, women\u2019s full participation and integration in national and international policy making and in the different applications of REDD.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b5a9976-8968-4d2e-bc67-5f33ed142ce2": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b5a9976-8968-4d2e-bc67-5f33ed142ce2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2065e14232d138e3873e76565df70a56aee2cfad3911d87089d70199bea1467"}, "2": {"node_id": "e763fd94-06a6-4b7f-9560-d905174d53f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec1f19ce561ac3fd23bfd42c0723b2ebd19de5cc1fe5028af67a2a38fcb9b017"}}, "hash": "780c057ea4d556ac503e95a83fead2a440a3e76382aaa1d2bacdd179db0cf767", "text": "In relation to payments for environmental services (PES), for carbon storage and new carbon sinks, there should be equitable access to, and distribution of, the economic benefits derived from forest services provided to mitigate climate change.

For example, both women and men must be trained in methods to increase carbon sequestration through new forestry technologies, including nursery techniques, site selection, and selection of species, land preparation, planting, weeding and maintenance. When half of the population is not included or is prevented from participating in decisions, institutions and programmes relating to climate change mitigation, they are unlikely to feel \u201cownership\u201d of forestry sector policies. Mitigation strategies represent a unique opportunity to include women in forestry programmes and acknowledge that gender relations will influence many aspects of forest management and governance proposed for reducing greenhouse gases. 158 Mitigation responses should avoid a narrow criterion that leads to environmentally and socially harmful consequences. These responses should have broad goals that aim to reduce climate change, protect natural resources, improve social wellbeing, promote equality, and recognize that women are key agents in climate change processes. 5.1.2 Reducing emissions through clean energy sources and technologies In developing countries, especially in rural areas, there is a direct connection between energy supplies and gender roles. Currently, overall Box 3 Gender considerations when promoting PES Access and control over resources. Economic, social, cultural, political and legal environments affect the rights of women and men to control forest resources and own land. Even where women have ownership rights to land, their access to forest products and opportunities for forest-generated income may not be ensured. Different members of the community may have established informal rights to use different parts of the forest or even of a tree \u2013 women may have access to the leaves but not to the wood. This differentiation by gender has major implications for the ownership and usufruct rights to the forest and its by-products; it affects the decision-making process and its management. Therefore it is fundamental that PES systems take into account formal and informal land ownership aspects, in order to avoid reproducing traditional roles (giving benefits only to \u201cmale owners\u201d). For example in Costa Rica funds given to the Ministry of Environment for PES were used to support women groups to buy land under their name so that they could benefit from the PES programme. Knowledge base. Gendered knowledge may vary by class, age and ethnicity, underscoring its complexity. For instance, tribal women in India have been found to know medicinal uses for almost 300 forest species. In other parts of the world, an older man from an indigenous group may have different practices for the sustainable use of forest soil and trees than a young man living outside his native community. Understanding the wide spectrum of knowledge possessed by women and men in different socio-economic circumstances helps to determine appropriate and efficient forestry policies. Decision-making structures. There is a need to ensure gender-balanced decision making to include women\u2019s perspectives and concerns in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of policy decisions and outcomes related to PES. In order to achieve this, sometimes women will require the development of skills in order to fully participate (i.e., teaching them how to speak in meetings). Equal access to benefits. It is fundamental to ensure that there is an equitable distribution of the benefits derived from PES. Sex-disaggregated data should be collected in relation to budget allocations in order to identified the distribution of the funds. 159 Module 5 GHG emissions are low in these areas because there is little access to electricity or motorized equipment outside the urban centres. Burning biomass for household cooking, heating and lighting represents a high percentage of many countries\u2019 overall energy use. For example, in Mali, firewood and char- coal account for about 80% of national energy consumption. Similar levels o f reliance on biomass are found in other poor countries in Africa and Asia. In these areas, providing the fuel needed for daily life is viewed as one of women\u2019s responsibilities. Where women are already managing traditional biomass energy supplies, they can also become key players in the adoption of energy technologies that reduce GHG emissions. It is important, however, that women are engaged in designing and implementing energy projects, and that proposed alternatives are affordable, accessible and designed to meet women\u2019s actual energy needs. There are a number of cleaner fuels and/or more efficient energy systems that can provide win-win solutions by cutting emissions as well as indoor air pollution, which is a major source of respiratory diseases for women cooking over smoky fires. New energy alternatives also reduce the time and physical effort women need to expend collecting and transporting traditional biomass fuels, thereby creating new opportunities for education, productive activities and much-needed economic and social advancement.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aea2e3bb-b361-4716-a8b2-4693bebab9a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "aea2e3bb-b361-4716-a8b2-4693bebab9a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a8d9c334a6ce25ee414157be2672e86c2b99d7e9ad4e643e175716aa8086098"}}, "hash": "7a8d9c334a6ce25ee414157be2672e86c2b99d7e9ad4e643e175716aa8086098", "text": "Even in areas where grid-based electricity is available, many households still use wood or charcoal for cooking and heating. An approved methodology has recently been developed that will allow large-scale improved stove projects to access carbon financing through the sale of emission reduction Box 4 Women and men use energy in a different way Although decision makers may view their energy-related choices as gender-neutral, men and women are affected differently by energy policies wherever their home, work and community roles differ. For example, in Lao, energy is consi- dered as dangerous and risky, in terms of the risks of electricity in private households and public facilities. Boys are expected to face and master these dangers. Whereas they are encouraged to get acquainted with electricity step by step, girls are kept away not only from electric power but also from the power of knowledge. Men are primarily considered to be responsible for the technical side and the investments in thermal insulation of homes, boilers, and hot water installations. Electrical installation, plumbing, and installation of heating systems are male domains. Source: ENERGIA, 2007. 160 credits. By increasing the efficiency of fuel combustion, improved stoves have the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emission levels and also conserve increasingly scarce fuel wood. However, some past efforts to introduce new stove technologies have failed because they primarily emphasized environmental benefits and were not well suited to local customs. Engaging women in the design of improved stoves and implementation of projects will greatly increase the chances that the equipment will actually be used, and therefore the expected GHG reductions actually achieved. Biogas digesters and solar cookers are other technologies that offer lower emission options for cooking and potential benefits to women \u2013 if they are compatible with women\u2019s daily routines and workloads, and adapted to the local context. Large-scale biogas digester projects have already been approved for funding under the CDM (see the Case study 3). Biogas digesters capture the methane gas released as agricultural waste, manure and other organic materials decompose; the gas is then piped to homes to be used for cooking and lighting. So far biogas digesters have been most popular in areas where people raise livestock, and there is plenty of water for processing purposes. Solar cookers have been most readily accepted in areas where land degradation and deforestation have made reliance on traditional wood fuels extremely difficult. In areas beyond the reach of grid-based electricity, renewable energy options such as wind, solar and small hydrotechnologies provide alternatives to diesel engines and generators as low-emission sources of electricity and/or motorized power for essential equipment such as water pumps and grain mills. Since much of women\u2019s time in rural areas is spent getting water and preparing food for their families, motorized equipment greatly relieves the drudgery of their daily routines and increases the time they have available for other types of activities. Production of liquid biofuels from plant products and waste materials may also offer new opportunities for women and communities to gain access to energy without adding to global carbon dioxide emissions. There is much controversy about the advisability and sustainability of creating large monoculture biofuel plantations, or using food crops for fuel, and in many cases it is women who will be most impacted by food insecurity and loss of access to land and resources for traditional biomass fuels. There are also questions about whether biofuel operations actually reduce GHG emissions when all the energy inputs required for large-scale operations are taken into account. 161 Module 5 As a result, biofuel production has not yet been approved for carbon emission reduction credits. However, well planned, gender-sensitive policies on biofuel production have the potential to transform women\u2019s current roles as energy suppliers into sustainable livelihoods that trigger new advancements in rural development and self-reliance. When women\u2019s groups are engaged in acquiring and operating new types of energy systems, they also develop new skills and livelihoods as business managers and energy entrepreneurs. In this way they can improve their own lives and economic opportunities while at the same time serving as active participants in the worldwide transition to environmentally sustainable energy production and consumption. So far, however, it has been difficult for the types of small-scale projects that women tend to be involved in to gain access to the CDM and voluntary carbon credit markets, especially in smaller countries. More work is needed to expand women\u2019s participation in these opportunities.

In this context, various organizations committed to promoting equality in these countries have analyzed the gender implications from two substantially dissimilar positions. The first position is that there is little to be gained by taking gender as a basis on which to analyze responsibility for emissions. This group considers that, so far, no critical studies have been made about who is responsible for CO2 and this makes it more urgent for different analyses to be made to identify social, political and planning conditions \u2013 in different ways in regions and countries \u2013 that affect the possible reduction of emissions (Wamukonya and Skutsch, 2002). 3 The discussion on point 5.1.3 draws heavily upon: Aguilar et al. (2008a). Gu\u00eda: Recursos de g\u00e9nero para el cambio clim\u00e1tico. Mexico: UNDP. 162 The second position suggests that there are gender considerations related to emissions. A number of preliminary studies made in Europe, in particular one promoted by the government of Sweden (Johnsson-Latham, 2007), have investigated the differences between the \u201cecological footprint\u201d of women and of men of different socio-economic levels, including their life styles and the contribution they make to GHG emissions. For example, an analysis was made of the gender dimension in politics and transport \u2013 without doubt an important sector in mitigation strategies \u2013 and how emissions related to transport have a quite clear gender differentiation. Present transport systems have been designed with a stereotypical view of \u201cmiddle-aged, full-time working men\u201d, while neglecting women\u2019s much higher dependency on public transport even though more of them use it. For work and recreation, women travel by car less frequently and over shorter distances, use smaller cars with fuel-saving technologies and travel by air much less often than men. Acknowledging the dissimilarity of the above-mentioned positions on emissions and gender, it has been proven that men and women have differing views and perceptions of climate change. In 2007, in Great Britain, a group of organizations launched the \u201cWomen\u2019s Manifesto on Climate Change\u201d in which they suggest that the responsibility for emissions sometimes seems to be linked to the division of labour according to gender, economic power and men\u2019s and women\u2019s different consumption and recreation habits. The study also found that women are more concerned about climate change than men and advocate changes in lifestyles and consumption behaviour, whereas men favoured more technological solutions for mitigating GHG emissions (Women\u2019s Environmental Network and National Federation of Women\u2019s Institutes, 2007). The Manifesto asks the British Government to take environment mitigation and protection measures, and asks that this be done in a way that will ensure gender equality. Carbon capture and development, and access to clean energy alone cannot lead to the reduction of greenhouse gases required to halt and reverse global warming, as regulation remains the form of mitigation with the most significant potential impact, if enforced. As companies produce products and uphold practices that are most responsible for climate change and its gendered impacts, women must be leaders in the movement to set enforceable targets and regulations to curb GHG emissions. 163 Module 5 In spite of the above-mentioned studies and examples, the theme of reducing emissions, and how it is linked to gender, is one of the areas that will need more research and analysis in the next few years. 5.1.4 Consumption: gender matters In recent decades the global consumer class has been rapidly expanding, as the diets, transportation systems, and lifestyles of the world\u2019s wealthier nations spread out around the world. According to the Worldwatch Institute (2008), there are now more than 1.7 billion members of \u201cthe consumer class\u201d \u2013 nearly half of them in the developing world. However, while the consumer class thrives, great disparities remain. The 12% of the world\u2019s population that lives in North America and Western Europe accounts for 60% of private consumer spending, while the one-third living in South Asia and sub- Saharan Africa accounts for only 3.2%.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8902796-80fe-426d-b79d-f39e0ceef986": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8902796-80fe-426d-b79d-f39e0ceef986", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fec9acd18adab62c1cd14753a8a5ad0bb1edc1e6c223a71bcaf036db04b25209"}, "2": {"node_id": "66afc865-0122-4ab3-8965-097ea575fcc3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d077a5c034d4a7062e45e6a16f22804f3de8b081946daa39b127dd87a117738a"}}, "hash": "7afa14491c3e96f843c799e47e2fd6c7b15f14aeae3d6608bac0a2de38796b63", "text": "The fourth Global Environment Outlook: Environment for development (GEO-4) report provided further cause for apprehension, showing that hu- mans are overusing the Earth\u2019s ecosystem services at a rate that is outstripping nature\u2019s ability to to renew and replenish them (UNEP, 2007).

According to studies conducted by the OECD (2008a and 2008b) gender has a huge influence on sustainable consumption (see Box 5), partly due to the differing consumption patterns of men and women: In some OECD countries, women make over 80% of the consumer \u2022\ufffd decisions; \u2022\ufffd Women are more likely to be sustainable consumers, e.g., they tend to buy eco-labelled or organic food, have a higher propensity to recycle and place more value on efficient energy than men; and Women pay closer attention in their purchases to ethical issues such \u2022\ufffd as child labour and fair trade. Box 5 Definition of sustainable consumption Sustainable consumption takes into account the social, economic, environmental and ethical dimensions of products and how they are produced as well as their ecological impacts. 164 Hope to Action is a good example of what can be done by women in developed countries at the household level. This organization targets consumption patterns in the USA, taking into account women\u2019s role in consumer decisions. Their strategy consists of conducting \u201cEcoSalons\u201d which gather together women in their neighbourhoods and communities and provide practical advice on how to mitigate climate change through sustainable consumption (www.hopetoaction.org). Therefore campaigns and education efforts directed at changing consumer patterns and incorporating principles of sustainable consumption, as a mitigation strategy to climate change, must consider women as one of the most important target groups. Additionally, women are still, in many countries, responsible for transmitting education and environmental principles to their children. Further resources Agarwal, B.

Central Maharashtra, in central India, is a drought-prone and landlocked region where natural resources are already largely depleted. The increasing scarcity of water, coupled with erratic monsoon patterns and severe erosion, have forced around 70% of the population into rural exodus, leaving farms abandoned and classrooms empty. Farm holdings are small and up to two-thirds of them are not fit for agricultural production; what arable land there is, is becoming less and less productive. As the agro-climatic and socio-economic situation worsens, more families are acquiring debts that they cannot afford. Over 1,200 desperate farmers have committed suicide in the last two years in this region. According to the communities themselves, they need new livelihood opportunities that provide them with a stable income, are sustainable and can connect them to the fast growing markets.

After two years of trials, the team leaders, in collaboration with experts specializing in Jatropha and Pongamia, and dry-land farming, were able to establish a set of silvicultural practices related to the propagation of oilseed-producing trees, and began testing technological applications for processing the oilseeds into usable biofuels. By 2006, 100,000 trees were planted. Instead of starting a for-profit organization, the group decided to use their knowledge locally to benefit the wider community. Today, CleanStar Trust incubates micro-enterprises at the village level to develop energy solutions by the poor for the poor. The campaign focuses primarily (but not exclusively) on planting biofuel trees (Jatropha and Pongamia) because they are one of the few things that can grow productively on the kind of land available, they do not displace or compete with food 4 The \u201cCCB Standards\u201d identify land-based projects that can simultaneously deliver compelling climate, biodiversity and community benefits. The CCB Standards are primarily designed for climate change mitigation projects. They were developed by the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance (CCBA).

CleanStar Trust creates community platforms where women, organized into Self-Help Groups (SHG), design and implement plans to generate new sources of income from existing resources through better management. These women\u2019s groups are in charge of managing their businesses as well. As a group, they own all the assets obtained during the incubation stage (trees and processing units). Over the last three years, demand for non- edible oilseeds has picked up in the local markets (mandis), allowing the women\u2019s businesses to flourish. Government schemes to promote biofuel processing units have supported these businesses, as have private- sector investments such as a newly built biodiesel refinery in the target area. Most biofuel processors currently face a severe shortage of feedstock (both seeds and oil) for their units and are thus aggressively seeking suppliers. Women are developing businesses to meet these demands. CleanStar Trust provides ongoing technical support to small business owners in the following areas: 1. Wild seed collection, involving training and logistical support for the collection, storage and sale of wild oilseeds to direct buyers. 2. Biofuel tree plantations, involving micro- loans and technical support for tree planting and watershed management while growing the trees. Funds are disbursed regularly until trees mature (three years), after which oilseed sales generate yearly income. 3. Oilseed processing, which involves using CleanStar Trust\u2019s capital and technical expertise to purchase and set up an oilseed processing unit. After processing (30% of the seeds), the oil is sold to local biodiesel processors, and seedcakes (the remaining 70%) are sold to locals as bio-coal briquettes, or bio-fertilizer to boost crop yields and displace fossil fuels like diesel and kerosene. 4. Agroforestry on wasteland, which involves supplying micro-loans for intercropping biofuel trees with fruit trees and hardy leguminous crops or fodder. The project has gained the support of local authorities in the Beed District in central Maharashtra, and established partnerships with two local NGOs. In 2007, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) declared the project to be number one amongst India\u2019s top ten sustainable ventures. The goals for 2008 are to plant one million trees with 15 villages from the Beed District, and set up a nursery with 500,000 saplings to be distributed in the villages.

In May 2007, the United Nations Environ- ment Programme (UNEP) established the Plant for the Planet: Billion Tree Campaign, a world- wide tree planting campaign inspired by the work of activist Wangari Maathai and backed by Prince Albert II of Monaco and the World Agroforestry Centre (the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF)). The Plant for the Planet: Billion Tree Campaign encourages the planting of trees in four key areas, namely: (i) degraded natural forests and wilderness areas; (ii) farms and rural landscapes; (iii) sustainably managed plantations; and (iv) urban environments. Trees have to be well adapted to local conditions, and mixtures of species are preferred over monocultures. Many trees have communal benefits, especially for the poor, and ownership, access and use rights are as important as the number of trees. Carbon in forest biomass decreased in Africa, Asia and South America during the period 1990\u20132005. For the world as a whole, carbon stocks in forest biomass have decreased annually by 1.1 gigatonnes of carbon (equivalent to four billion 25kg sacks of charcoal). The loss of natural forests around the world contributes more to global emissions each year than the transport sector. Therefore, curbing deforestation is a highly cost-effective way to reduce emissions. Other solutions include increased energy efficiency, reduced energy demand, better transport and the use of green energy. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and are vital carbon sinks. It is estimated that the world\u2019s forests store 283 gigatonnes of carbon in their 169 Case study 2 / Module 5 biomass alone, and that carbon stored in forest biomass, deadwood, litter and soil together is roughly 50% more than the carbon in the atmosphere. Prof. Maathai recently stated that \u201cnatural resources will provide a buffer from the effects of climate change, and one of the most important activities we can and should undertake is to prioritize protecting and rehabilitating our forests; in particular, the five forest mountain ecosystems (in Kenya) that determine the flow and volume of our rivers, our rainfall, and our groundwater supplies. Africa\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are negligible compared to those of the industrialized world and the emerging economic giants of China and India. But our responsibility to act should not be equally small. It is we who will pay the price for our inaction. Many of us already are, and the predictions of what is in store are sobering\u201d. Under the Plant for the Planet: Billion Tree Campaign, individuals, children, youth and community groups, schools, non-governmental organizations, business and industry, farmers, local authorities, and national governments are urged to plant trees as a small but practical step to combat what UNEP says is probably the key challenge of the 21st century. Pledges can be entered on the website: www.unep. org/billiontreecampaign. Each pledge can be anything from a single tree to 10 million trees. \u201cWe know the science, we know the data [behind global warming]\u201d said Prof. Maathai. \u201cBut what is really important is what we do.

This was the first GHG emission reduction project in Nepal approved for financing under the Clean Development Mechanism. Developed by the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre, the project is obtaining financing for subsidized distribution of the biogas units by selling a total of one million tons of GHG emission reductions to the Community Development Carbon Fund managed by the World Bank. The project estimates that each household biogas unit will eliminate close to five tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. Selling emissions reduction credits allows the project to generate long-term funding without seeking ongoing assistance from donors. The country\u2019s dependence on fuelwood has contributed greatly to deforestation, so the project will also reduce pressures on the forests. In addition, waste slurry from the biogas digesters can be used as organic fertilizer, boosting food production and avoiding the expense of buying chemical fertilizers.

In order to contribute to the goal of climate change mitigation and adaptation, technologies must be embedded in broader activities related to capacity building for users of the technologies and for decision makers who have to create the institutional environment. This is particularly important regarding women\u2019s technological needs. Additionally, technologies should be properly adapted to women\u2019s needs (Women for Climate Justice, 2007).

During the 20th century, the word \u201ctechnology\u201d evolved from meaning simply a tool or machine to a much broader concept that also includes knowledge, processes, activities and socio-cultural context. Although the word still evokes notions of tools and machines, technology is understood to be a foundation of everyday life and touches most aspects of both women\u2019s and men\u2019s lives. For example, the global growth in the use of information 180 communications technologies, including cell phones, over the past two decades, has changed the way that human beings communicate. Technology is never gender-neutral. Men and women have different attitudes to and relationships with all aspects of technology. Technology in the traditional sense of tools and machines has been considered a \u201cmale domain\u201d and it is only in recent years that girls and women have been encouraged to pursue studies in mathematics and engineering. Despite their ingenuity and ability to improvise with whatever materials they happen to have at hand, women in most parts of the world are highly under-represented in the formal creation of new technologies. However, in all parts of the world, women are active users of technology. Women\u2019s specific needs in technology development, their access to technical information, tools and machines often is very different from that of men. All of this influences how (and if) they will have access to, or make use of, new technologies. Cultural patterns are also important. For example, among some pastoral communities, water points are managed by men (who are mainly concerned with providing water for livestock \u2013 a source of income and prestige for them). These water points often have no taps for women to draw domestic water with the result that women are forced to collect water at the cattle troughs being used (and contaminated) by the animals. 6.2 What does technology have to do with climate change? The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) positioned clean technologies at the centre of global responses to climate change. Clean technologies will help to estimate, monitor and control the environmental and human impact of climate change but to be truly effective, these technologies must be gender-sensitive both in terms of Box 1 Technology is not gender-neutral In many developing countries, girls\u2019 and women\u2019s access to information and communication technology is constrained by: \u2022\ufffd Social and cultural bias. \u2022\ufffd Inadequate technological infrastructure in rural areas. \u2022\ufffd Women\u2019s lower education levels (especially in science and technology) and fear of or lack of interest in technology. \u2022\ufffd Women\u2019s lack of disposable income to purchase technology services.

GEF also has a small grants programme which includes gender equity as a reporting category, but it is usually given minimal attention. To date, the GEF has overlooked the degree of difference in the impact of climate change on women and men. At the 7th Conference of the Parties in Marrakesh in 2001, the UNFCCC adopted a technology framework and established an Expert Group on Technology Transfer. This expert group has responsibility for advancing the development and transfer of technology activities under the Convention. It oversees the development, deployment, adoption, diffusion and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries, taking into consideration differences in accessing and applying technologies for mitigation and adaptation. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which emerged from the Kyoto Protocol, allows industrialized countries to invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries as an alternative to more expensive emission reductions in their own countries. The CDM includes a provision for small-scale activities and offers potential for the transfer of a range of techno- logies to women in the South. It offers a good opportunity to recognize and build on the small-scale technologies that women are already using, in household energy, agricultural and food processing, forest management, water pumping, etc., in rural areas, and energy appliances and processing equipment in peri- urban areas (Wamuknoja and Skrutch, 2001). In addition it is important to point out that innumerable studies have proven the irrefutable fact that equal inclusion of women and men in all aspects of climate change projects pays off. For example, a World Bank review of 121 rural water supply projects found that women\u2019s participation was among the 182 variables strongly associated with project effectiveness. Furthermore, it was found that the failure to take gender differences and inequalities into account could result in failed projects (Narayan, 1995). Based on the information on its website, the CDM appears not to have given any consideration to the gendered nature of technology. Women are not highly visible in climate change technology decision making. In late 2008, two of the 19 members of the UNFCCC Expert Group on Technology Transfer were female and the executive board of the CDM consisted of 10 members, nine of them male. While the participation of women on climate change technology boards and committees will not in and of itself ensure attention to gender equality, it is a necessary starting point. When there are only one or two women on a board, they are unlikely to press for the inclusion of gender equality issues for fear that this would receive little general support, but when a critical mass of 30% or higher is reached, then it is more likely that such issues will be raised. However, it should also be pointed out that not all women are necessarily familiar with gender equality issues, thus efforts should be made to include female board members who can explicitly address gender equality issues and represent an empowerment approach. 6.3 What does climate change technology have to do with gender? Because technology is not gender-neutral, technology-based strategies for both mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change sometimes have different implications for women and men. These differences must be recognized and integrated into our thinking about climate change. If technologies are to be used by both men and women, they must be designed to reflect the circumstances and preferences of both sexes. This is especially true in the case of technologies aimed at tasks most frequently performed by women. While the participation of women in decision making about technologies will not guarantee gender sensitivity, it is an important aspect, and ultimately may help to make the technologies more useful and productive for both men and women. There are many examples, especially in the agricultural sector, of technologies designed specifically to reduce the heavy workloads of rural women but developed without their input and which ultimately were not 183 Module 6 Box 2 Impact of land tenure on the adoption of new technologies in Kabale District, Uganda The NGO Africare in Kabale District recommended practices to reduce run-off on the steeper slopes in the area by improved terracing and planting of bushes and vetifer grass, but women were reluctant to adopt such technologies since they lacked secure tenure to the land. Men had such tenure, but many farm households were de facto female-headed since the men were not present. Meanwhile, the women on their own were unwilling to adopt such technologies. Consequently, the rate of adoption was very low.

Technologies have often been designed without attention to the specific needs of women and their limited access to resources, including capital, labour, time or even the right to make decisions. In developing countries, new technologies are usually trans- ferred through agricultural exten- sion systems staffed by male offi- cers who are more comfortable working with male farmers. In some cases, local cultural norms make it difficult or even impo- ssible for male extension workers to interact with female farmers. Consequently, women farmers often do not receive information about new technologies and men obtain most of the direct benefits from their introduction. This is not only unacceptable from the perspective of gender equality, but it is also highly inefficient, given the significant role played by women in agriculture in most developing countries. Focused efforts must be made to involve women in the processes of developing, testing and implementing new technologies. Women must also be employed in the agricultural extension systems, helping facilitate the transfer of technologies and knowledge to rural women. 6.4 Areas of focus for technological interventions Article 4.5 of the UNFCCC states: The developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in Annex II shall take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other Parties, particularly developing country Parties, to enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention. In this 184 process, the developed country Parties shall support the development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of developing country Parties. Other Parties and organizations in a position to do so may also assist in facilitating the transfer of such technologies. During COP-7, the Parties adopted a framework for meaningful and effective actions to enhance the implementation of this article, identifying the following five areas for attention. Each of them can be implemented in a gender- sensitive manner, as is discussed below: 6.4.1 Technology needs and needs assessment Technology needs assessment exercises should begin from the recognition that the technology needs of men and women are not always identical. For example, in agriculture there is often an emphasis on the development of drought or flood-resistant varieties, to increase food security. However, in many developing countries, processing agricultural products is a time-consuming and laborious task undertaken almost entirely by women. Given the time constraints under which women already operate, it would be appropriate to focus on developing varieties that will be easier to process and to invest in the development of appropriate tools for women such as simple threshing instruments, in addition to the identification of technologies that will lead to an increase in yields. Technology needs assessment should give some consideration to the end users who are often female farmers who face constraints of time, access to credit and information, and poor or marginal land. In industrialized countries, increased attention is being given to the development of more fuel-efficient automobiles. While both men and women own cars, especially in the North, overall car ownership is skewed towards men (Wamukonja and Skrutch, 2001) and women are more dependent on public transport. A women-friendly transportation system may focus more on creating schedules that are convenient for women\u2019s needs or on providing economic incentives to users of public transportation systems. Similarly, in industrialized countries, women typically earn less than men and their technological choices often are constrained by income, especially in the context of female-headed households. For example, women may find it harder to pay the cost of converting home heating systems to cleaner, low-carbon choices and attention should be given to finding low-cost alternatives that will be affordable for lower-income households. 185 Module 6 6.4.2 Technology information Existing traditional channels for the dissemination of technical information, e.g., agricultural extension systems, often bypass women and special efforts may have to be made to reach them. Male family members do not necessarily share newly-acquired technical information with women, especially if women are farming their own rather than their hus-bands\u2019 plots. Thus, it may be necessary for agricultural extension systems to hire female employees who are able to communicate information directly to women, rather than expecting it to reach them through male family mem- bers.

Other media should also be used to impart technology information to women, especially radio and, increasingly, television. In industrialized countries technical information about climate change is often presented in an abstract, highly technical way that is not easily understood by the general public. Research on women\u2019s learning styles has shown that they are more responsive to technical information when it is presented within a social context, making it important that technology information be presented in an accessible, contextual style that resonates with women. 6.4.3 Enabling environments for technology transfer Creating an enabling environment for technology transfer requires adequate technical, business, management and regulatory skills. Participation of all stakeholders including the private sector, public agencies, NGOs and Box 3 Empowering women: promoting skill transfer through ICT Community initiatives that train women in ICT skills can and do change women\u2019s self-perception as well as community perception of women. The critical thing here is to link women\u2019s skills in Information and Communication Technology to community needs \u2013 the M S Swaminathan Research Foundation experience in Pondicherry, and Tilonia Barefoot College that trains men and women to use GIS for water management, testify to how women trained in ICT not only play a useful role as change agents, but are able to spiral into a personal empowerment trajectory. Source: Gurumurthy, 2005. 186 grassroots organizations, is important for effective technology transfer (Sathaye, 2002). Women should be physically present in these groups, and their opinions and input should be actively solicited. In some cases it may be necessary to speak with women separately as it may be culturally inappropriate for them to speak publicly in the presence of men. 6.4.4 Capacity building for technology transfer Similarly, capacity building for technology transfer must provide equal opportunities for both men and women to receive training, information and opportunities for participation in study tours and jobs. Efforts must be made to ensure women have access to credit, training and skills-building opportunities. 6.4.5 Mechanisms for technology transfer Mechanisms should include gender-sensitive methodologies and organizational innovations that are developed after consultation with wide representation from all intended users, and after soliciting user input into all planning and priority-setting processes. 6.5 Mitigation technologies: the gender dimension A key objective of climate change mitigation strategies is the reduction and/or sinking of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels are caused primarily by industry, buildings, transport and agriculture and these are strategic sectors that must be targeted to reduce GHG emissions. Energy is a particularly critical area and renewable energy is often cited as a key mitigation technology. Increased attention is being given to the use of biofuels, although biofuels have long been used as an energy source by women in areas with sparse forest resources. The growing emphasis on biofuels has implications for women in developing countries both because there is increased competition for available biofuels and because agricultural land formerly used for food production is being diverted to growing biofuels (e.g., maize, sugar cane, etc.). Energy crop plantations typically require large amounts of water and often draw on local water sources that are already meagre. As a result, women have to expend even more time and energy in collecting water for household needs while they do not necessarily benefit from the proceeds of plantation energy crops (Rossi and Lambrou, 2008). 187 Module 6 A study of 19 countries in Africa and Asia found that traditional biomass fuels such as wood, charcoal and agricultural residues are usually managed by women and often represent a high proportion of national energy supplies. For example, in Mali, firewood and charcoal, used mostly for cooking, represent 80% of the country\u2019s energy consumption and women spend more than one-third of their time collecting wood (Karlsson, 2008). Thus, identifying appropriate alternative energy sources is not only important for the environment; it is also key to reducing women\u2019s workloads. Numerous energy solutions at the community level already exist, including improved cooking stoves, biogas, low-grade solar energy systems, micro-hydro power and wind energy. These have often not been widely disseminated or have been priced at levels that are too high for poor households. There is an urgent need for further work to be done on these technologies to make them affordable, adaptable and easily accessible for rural women. Sustainable energy development as a response to climate change is a yardstick for the socio-economic advan- cement of women (Makhabane, 2002).

Since women in developing countries usually bear primary responsibility for the collection of water for domestic purposes, technologies aimed at improving water-use efficiency should have a gender component. For exam- ple, if more efficient hand pumps or irrigation systems are being designed it should be considered whether they will be accessible and affordable for rural women. Since women are already key users of natural resources, they should be empowered to participate in wetland restoration as a means to improve water quality and decrease risks of flooding. Similarly, their input should be sought in the development of soil erosion strategies. Box 4 Locally-based sustainable energy production In Ghana, GRATIS (the Ghana Regional Appropriate Technology Industrial Service) has promoted the production and use of jatropha oil to produce biodiesel in the West Mamprusi District. Women\u2019s groups have been encouraged to establish and manage jatropha crops, harvest and process the seeds, and produce biodiesel, which they use for powering shea butter processing machines, grinding corn and in household lanterns (www.gratis-ghana.com). In Tan- zania, KAKUTE Ltd (Kampuni ya Kusambaza Teknolojia) has supported the production of jatropha seeds for sustainable livelihoods and rural bio-enterprises. KAKUTE trained several hundred people to farm jatropha as a cash crop on marginal lands, working with village- based women\u2019s groups to produce seedlings and cuttings for planting. The oil extracted from the seeds is used in hurricane lamps and stoves provided by the project, but less expensive stoves are needed to make this use affordable (www.jatropha.de/tanzania/ Kakute/kakute.htm). Source: Karlsson, 2008. 188 Reforestation projects are also being advocated as a means of mitigating climate change. Since 1977, Kenya\u2019s Green Belt Movement has involved more than 30,000 poor rural women in reforestation activities and has planted more than 30 million trees. Women use the trees as a source of fuelwood and learn skills in forestry, food processing and bee-keeping which have become sources of household income. When mitigation technology projects are designed from a gender equality perspective, they can serve various purposes: contribute to climate change mitigation, lighten women\u2019s workload, become a source of income generation, etc. (see Box 4). To make the case that such community-level energy solutions are environmentally friendly, efficient and economically beneficial for women (and men), it is necessary to develop methodologies and dissemination strategies that specifically address women\u2019s participation, access and derived benefits. It is also important to strengthen the capacity of smallholder farmers to participate in biofuel production through better access to land, capital and technology, for example through the establishment of cooperatives (Rossi and Lambrou, 2008). 6.6 Adaptation technologies: the gender dimension Adaptation involves a range of activities to reduce vulnerability to climate change. Poor women in rural communities are often particularly exposed because they rely on local water, fuelwood and agricultural land for their survival. Most methods of adaptation involve some form of technology. This can include \u201csoft\u201d technologies based on insurance schemes, crop rotation patterns or traditional knowledge. It may also include \u201chard\u201d technologies like irrigation systems, drought-resistant seeds or sea defences. Early warning systems, for example, are usually based on a combination of \u201csoft\u201d and \u201chard\u201d forms of technology (UNFCCC, n.d.). In order to be effective, adaptation technologies need to reach those who are most in need \u2013 the poor and vulnerable. Women are often over-represented in these categories therefore targeted efforts must be made to ensure firstly that it is understood that the situation of women may differ from that of men, secondly that technologies are designed in such a way as to be relevant to their circumstances and thirdly to ensure that they are given full access to knowledge, information and technologies related to adaptation. In the area of agriculture, efforts are being made to produce new crop varieties that will be resistant to increased flooding, drought and salinity. In many countries, women habitually preserve seeds, and their knowledge and expertise should be brought into the crop breeding process. Flood-prone countries are 189 Module 6 focusing on the development of better surveillance systems for improving early warning systems for storm surges and floods.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "481727a2-f53e-4e45-a01d-82927c2a8447": {"__data__": {"id_": "481727a2-f53e-4e45-a01d-82927c2a8447", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa00a5c3a8afb0a6f63220a748be88698e0c419e08ed459675f0e52641110f71"}, "2": {"node_id": "55b2cafb-a771-4082-8c0f-1e3da984fd19", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1db92ef097b60ff05799171f6fc22ccab785b73202179f14e51fbee79f600680"}}, "hash": "a4cbd23f23c3ee782104186f0969486186d2cf663687c0daf348583d13763330", "text": "Again, it is necessary for such systems to be structured in a way that will ensure the poorest receive information in a timely manner and that they are given assistance to develop coping strategies.

For example, nuclear energy is often advocated as an adaptation strategy to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. A Swedish study in the late 1990s found that young men were much more likely than young women to favour the long-term use of nuclear energy. Women against the use of nuclear power identified safety issues as their major concern (Puranen, 2000, cited in Clancy et al., 2004). Men were much less likely to object to nuclear waste being stored in their community. Interestingly, the higher women\u2019s educational level, the more likely they were to object to the use of nuclear energy while the reverse was true for men. European women\u2019s negative attitude towards nuclear energy was highly influenced by the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, which led to fears about both the environmental and the health risks of nuclear power. Similarly, in the USA, Culley and Angelique\u2019s analysis (2003) of the influence of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident on women\u2019s activism, suggested that they were initially spurred towards protests because of their perception of negative health and safety aspects of nuclear energy. Men were more likely to be convinced by the economic arguments in favour of nuclear energy. Overall, it is clear that attitudes are different and it is necessary for governments to recognize this when designing or approving appropriate climate change technologies. In the North, the rising costs of energy, food, transport, health care, etc., have a greater impact on women, especially those in low-income households. There is a need for gender-sensitive research on the consumption patterns and attitudes of men and women, but since women as a whole have lower incomes, it is evident that adaptation technologies for them must be both cost-effective and accessible. Finally, in the area of both adaptation and mitigation strategies, there is a need to recognize, record and value local knowledge and to blend it with scientific research. For example, in many cultures in Africa, Asia and Latin 190 America, women preserve seeds for future use. They have a profound knowledge of local biodiversity and of indigenous strategies for seed management during times of drought or flood. They also have an understanding of medicinal plants and herbal remedies. This knowledge should be seen as an integral part of the solution to climate change and should be valued as such by both scientists and policy makers. Further resources Karlsson, G.

The Ndiass is a plateau with a maximum elevation of 120 m. Surrounded by massifs, the villages and their surroundings are exposed to fast-running surface water because of the steep slopes. Water erosion is a serious problem here and has drastic consequences on the environment (resource degradation, soil acidification, gully erosion, absence of water infiltration) and on the communities (fatal accidents, the collapse of housing, inaccessibility to resources). Women have difficulty accessing water, and also have all sorts of problems with agricultural production. They are unable to grow vegetables out of season. Arable land is being lost due to soil degradation, and the arable land that is available, is often infertile due to surface water flows uprooting vegetation and crops. Therefore, agricultural yields diminish and earnings dwindle. Young people migrate and leave women and the elderly to fend for themselves. In the villages of Landou, for instance, there are about 118 women and only 20 or so men. The steepness of the slopes means that it is very difficult for the surface water to soak into the ground to replenish groundwater supplies. This exacerbates water shortages especially in the areas where wells have already been dry for two months during the winter season. In some places around the massifs, the ground water is 30 m below sea-level (Ndiaye, 2007), thus contributing to the intrusion of salt water and the breakdown of hydraulic equipment such as drilling machines. Some organizations have helped the women control erosion in order to retain water and soil, and to recover arable land to achieve better agricultural yields. They have acquired new techniques and knowledge in combating land degradation by improving the soil quality and its productivity. Seventeen of the 37 villages that make up the Keur Moussa community suffer from erosion and land degradation, which cause inadequate agricultural yields. Three villages (Santhie S\u00e9r\u00e8re, Kessoukhatte and Landou) have been selected as pilot sites for erosion control within the framework of the Agrobio Niayes Programme by ENDA PRONAT (Environment and Development Action in the Third World). The project was initiated by local people, and women in particular, following consultations on the problems of, and solutions to, erosion; the disappearance of arable land; uprooting of crops and trees; water scarcity; and inaccessibility of villages. Committees were established according to priorities. The Anti-erosion Committee, in which women are very active, is one of these. To control the flow of water, they have built barriers and undertaken reforestation. 193 Case study 2 / Module 6 The barriers are built around the edges of pools of captured rainwater, and consist of stone borders, half-moon canals, bundles of brushwood, infiltration ditches, and open trenches that slow the water down and direct it towards infiltration points. Women are interested in solving the erosion problem because in addition to affecting agricultural productivity, it also makes it difficult to access clean drinking water. If they were given a choice, their priority would be to have more water resources. They are very active in building stone barriers. All their hard work has had an immediate effect \u2013 ground water has been recharged, water bodies have been created and soils stabilized, rain water flow has slowed down; the vegetation is regenerating; and the diversity of the surface vegetation is increasing. The president of the organization said, \u201cNow, there is a lot of water in our wells, and this year we are spending less time drawing water, meaning 1 to 1.3 hours to recharge the well compared to 2 to 3 hours last year. We will continue our anti-erosion campaign for better results\u201d.

The Ndiass is a plateau with a maximum elevation of 120 m. Surrounded by massifs, the villages and their surroundings are exposed to fast-running surface water because of the steep slopes. Water erosion is a serious problem here and has drastic consequences on the environment (resource degradation, soil acidification, gully erosion, absence of water infiltration) and on the communities (fatal accidents, the collapse of housing, inaccessibility to resources). Women have difficulty accessing water, and also have all sorts of problems with agricultural production. They are unable to grow vegetables out of season. Arable land is being lost due to soil degradation, and the arable land that is available, is often infertile due to surface water flows uprooting vegetation and crops. Therefore, agricultural yields diminish and earnings dwindle. Young people migrate and leave women and the elderly to fend for themselves. In the villages of Landou, for instance, there are about 118 women and only twenty or so men. The steepness of the slopes means that it is very difficult for the surface water to soak into the ground to replenish ground water supplies. This exacerbates water shortages especially in the areas where wells have already been dry for two months during the winter season.

In the second instance, women\u2019s ability to adapt to the demands of climate change depends on the depth of their control over economic resources and their access to financial resources (Williams, personal communication).

National and international attempts to confront the challenges of climate change have resulted in many actions at all levels of the economy. The goals, targets, modalities, projects and programmes emanating from climate policy around adaptation and mitigation strategies will require significant 206 resources to cover the cost of the goods, services and technologies needed by developing and developed countries in their implementation of climate change measures. It is estimated that the price tag for climate change is about 20% of global GDP. The challenges of financing programmes and projects to adapt to climate change and to implement mitigating strategies have led the global community under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to establish a system of climate change financing with multiple instruments and mechanisms. Climate change financing instruments are highly differentiated in terms of their strategic approach (adaptation versus mitigation and technological transfer) and are supposed to be custom-built to suit the different levels of economic development of the different countries of the global economy. Climate change financing, therefore, encompasses the role and actions of financial institutions and financial decision makers, in the public and private sectors, with regard to mediating between donors and recipient governments, savers and investors, lenders and borrowers. The aim of mediation is to manage the risk of reduction strategies and to address the loss and damages associated with climate change impacts and mitigations. 7.2 What does climate change financing have to do with gender? Many of the factors affecting women\u2019s overall empowerment and women\u2019s control over economic and financial resources, including microfinance, are well known and have become stylized facts. These factors include: gender inequality around differential access to social and physical goods; gender gaps in education, income, time use and leisure; and gender-differentiated roles and responsibilities in the household, community and labour markets. In the Millennium Development Goal (MDG)-oriented literature, these factors can be clustered in terms of their implication for women\u2019s capabilities, access to resources and opportunities, and security. Empirical research has also shown these gender- differentiated dynamics acting across a broad range of human social and economic activities including agriculture, services, manufacturing, water and energy distribution and use, transportation and disaster management.

These complicating factors further compromise women\u2019s ability to function. In some cases, climate change may require new survival skills such as tree climbing and swimming which are not customary activities for women living under certain cultural and religious constraints. Climate change also intensifies the effects of pre-existing gender gaps such as information asymmetry between men and women. While the old forms of asymmetries led to long-term chronic problems such as endemic poverty, the new forms such as asymmetrical information sharing regarding early warning and disaster preparedness are a matter of life and death. Dealing successfully with the challenge of risk management, disaster preparedness and climate change-induced-weather challenges require resources well beyond those that are normally available to meet the day-to-day needs faced by the average individual and household. It may require resources to build permanent or stronger more robust housing for the family; better and stronger water storage units; and investment in energy-efficient technologies such as solar stoves, for example. As noted by the UN, empowering and investing in women is the key to combating the effects of desertification and paving the way for rural poverty alleviation in many of the world\u2019s least developed countries (Srabani, 2008). Women also play an important role in developing energy systems. Yet, under the current climate change financing regime, women do not have easy and sufficient access to funds to cover weather-related losses, or to service adaptation and mitigation technologies. Many activities normally undertaken by women which could count as adaptation and mitigation activities, such as tree planting, are not recognized in the global carbon trade market or are overlooked by various groups of funders. Further, given the complexities of the various climate change funds and their complicated applications processes, women\u2019s and community groups may have difficulties accessing and absorbing 208 funds that are designed for large-scale, well capitalized projects. Ultimately, the delivery mechanisms of climate change financing may not be very conducive to the existing level and scope of operations run by women either in the farming, business or household sector. Empirical verification of these issues can only be determined by closer examination of the operations of the climate change financing architecture, including its instruments and mechanisms. Box 1 Rigidities and challenges in the national and global financial markets There are well known rigidities and challenges in the national and global financial markets that act to block or distort women\u2019s access to economic resources, credit and finance in the credit and money markets. Women are under-represented in climate change decision- making fora. The concerns, priorities and issues of women are marginal to the operations of climate change financing decision makers. Nonetheless, the consequences of decision making in terms of what projects and programmes are financed, and by what means, are also borne by women. It may also be the case that the same types of gender-based constraints (such as inequality in property rights) that create problems for women in the regular financial markets, may also operate in the context of climate change financing. Such constraints are interlinked with discriminatory norms in the financial markets resulting in inefficiency in resource allocation. Though there has been very little research on the gender dynamics of climate change financing, if the gender segmentation that is so common in the regular financial markets persists, then it can be expected that: \u2022\ufffd Women will tend to ask for smaller loans than men (in the area of climate change financing this may be manifested in terms of the predominance of women in small- scale projects); \u2022\ufffd Women tend to give credit to women, so where gender considerations and criteria are not important to the review of project proposals and decision making about approval and disbursement of funds, the ratio of women\u2019s projects selected may be lower; Women will borrow from special programmes, which have smaller lending limits; \u2022\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Women will face higher interest rates or greater transaction costs (due to the size of their projects); \u2022\ufffd Women will tend to have less access to, and excess demand for, credit (in this case, many women and women\u2019s groups may have numerous projects that require climate change financing but face a limited supply of finance). 209 Module 7 7.3 What are the instruments, mechanisms and modalities of climate change financing? The broad objectives of the current climate change financing regime are to promote and ensure activities of adaptation and mitigation. Specific goals include stabilizing or decreasing GHG emissions and engendering the transformation to a low-carbon economy.

The architecture of the climate financing regime is multi-layered and grounded in four complex and intertwined pillars of public finance networks which are complemented by a private-sector network of actors and initiatives. The public elements of the climate change financing architecture include: 1) the United Nations (UNFCCC/ Global Environment Facility (GEF)); 2) the World Bank; 3) other multilateral finance and development institutions; and 4) a host of bilateral donors. The private-sector network includes foundations, venture capital funds, private carbon funds and a network of exchanges. The financial mechanisms consist of national measures (Box 2) and market-based mechanisms (Boxes 4, 5 and 6). On the public supply side, the World Bank, regional development banks and bilateral donors and national governments use a menu of options ranging from tax incentives, domestic investment, insurance schemes, low-interest credit programmes, grants, concessional financing, co-financing, to targeted programmes. They also have access to voluntary and non-voluntary market-based mechanisms. The private sector uses instruments such as foreign direct investment, options, equity and portfolio investments, and a host of market-based schemes. The demand side of climate change financing is primarily based on national, regional and international climate change policy and the set of incentives that are built in to facilitate adaptation and mitigation strategies. The key demands are in sectors such as energy, agriculture, forestry and the health sectors, including weather-related agricultural losses, and finance for mitigation and adaptation technologies. The key demanders of funds for adaptation activities are developing countries, who make their demands primarily through the preparation of National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). 210 Currently, climate chan- ge financing is biased towards mitigation, so funding for adap- tation projects is less readily available than funding for mitigation projects. On the mitigation side, the key actors tend to be developed countries and some emerging market economies such as Brazil, India and China. But increasingly many developing countries are also showing stronger demands for mitigation projects. The Conference of Parties (COP) established the GEF as its financial arm. The GEF is subject to review every four years and is accountable to the COP. GEF projects are managed by three implementing agencies: UNEP, UNDP and the World Bank, and seven executing agencies. Most GEF projects have a co-financing element. Participating countries are expected to prepare a series of national communications vehicles which involve taking stock of their climate change needs and priorities. The COP established three special funds: the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) and Least Developed Country Fund (LDCF) under the UNFCCC; and the Adaptation Fund (AF) under the Kyoto Protocol. The GEF manages the two UNFCCC funds as well as its own Strategic Priority on Adaptation (SPA) Trust Fund. The SCCF is a voluntary fund that relies on donor contributions. It is meant to address issues of adaptation and development, includes transfer of technology, and is in great demand with developing countries. The LDCF is also funded on a voluntary basis. It is supposed to focus on NAPA priority areas (Box 3) including issues of community development and adaptation. There is also the Small Grants Programme (SGP) meant for countries with little capacity. It operates across GEF\u2019s focal areas. This is meant to be a very flexible programme which is responsive to the needs of developing countries. Under the Kyoto Protocol, countries, which are supposed to meet their targets primarily with national measures, can have recourse to three market- based mechanisms. These are emissions trading (or carbon trading/market), the Box 2 National financial instruments (incentives) \u2022\ufffd Direct payments \u2022\ufffd Tax reductions \u2022\ufffd Price supports \u2022\ufffd Tariffs rebates \u2022\ufffd Grant programmes \u2022\ufffd Loan programmes \u2022\ufffd Bonds \u2022\ufffd Production incentives \u2022\ufffd Government purchasing programmes \u2022\ufffd Equity investments, including venture capital Insurance programmes \u2022\ufffd Source: Tirpak et al., 2008. 211 Module 7 Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and joint implementation (JI).

Very little has Box 3 The National Adaptation Programmes of Action The National Adaptation Programmes of Action provide an important way to prioritize urgent adaptation needs for least developed countries (Article 4.9). They draw on existing information and community-level input to identify adaptation projects required now in order to enable these countries to cope with the immediate impacts of climate change. NAPA priority areas include water resources, food security, health, disaster preparedness and risk management. There is a great need for the effective participation of women and the integration of gender analysis into addressing the issues of vulnerability and risk management from a holistic and sustainable development perspective. 212 gone into community-based adaptation. The flow of funds for subsistence issues, which is a key concern of women farmers and critical to the food security needs of all women, is still not adequately addressed. Financing mitigation \u2013 the state of play The focus of financing mitigation is to remove barriers to energy conservation, renewable energy and the transfer of technology. Mitigation activities receive the most funding from the global climate change financial coffers. Mitigation funds are invested in projects that remove barriers to energy conservation, and promote energy efficiency and the adoption of renewable energy. Though sustainable transportation and integrated ecosystem management are also key priority areas, mitigation financing tends to be biased towards energy and many projects that are financed are large-scale capital- intensive projects. This has implications for the access and ownership of land by indigenous people as well as women. In the final analysis, the current approach to financing mitigation does not seem to consider the social and equity costs of the climate change challenge. The two key mitigation funding programmes in the UNFCCC framework are the CDM (see Box 5) and the REDD. The World Bank also leads or runs a whole slew of mitigation sub-funds. REDD (Reducing Emi- ssions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries) is the newest and most significant finance mechanism for climate change. It offers positive incentives in the form of financial transfers to developing countries to slow down their rates of deforestation and forest degradation to reduce emissions of GHGs (mitigation). Policies and measures under REDD include payment for environmental ser- vices (PES), agricultural and forest sustainable management. Box 4 A snapshot of the evolution of some of the World Bank funds The World Bank\u2019s first generation of climate change financing under the Clean Energy for Development and Investment Framework (CEIF) operates a \u201c+50, 3x5 strategy\u201d \u2013 50% of funding to climate change in three areas (energy (for sub-Saharan Africa); low-carbon development trajectory; and adaptation), across five sectors (transport, agriculture, water, energy and urban). Second generation funds are emerging under the Climate Investment Fund (CIF). These are focused on intermixing development finance and climate change finance implemented through the networks of multilateral or regional development banks (the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the European Development Bank). CIF funds are all about mitigation and are spread over two sub-funds: the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) geared towards Brazil, India and China, and the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF). 213 Module 7 7.4 Market-based schemes and private-sector financing of climate change The Kyoto Protocol, in establishing the three parallel implementing mechanisms \u2013 the JI, emissions trading and the CDM \u2013 catalyzed the market for carbon trading. The cap-trading market is meant to facilitate the purchases of emissions from developing countries (see Box 6). This is primarily a voluntary market involving the active participation of private-sector companies from all over the world. The infrastructure of the market is similar to the stock exchange and other capital markets. It is dominated by a network of brokers, exchanges and firms that ultimately seek to generate climate change activities. The market has a number of functions similar to those of traditional money and capital markets.

Thus, a new commodity was created in the form of emission reductions or removals. Since carbon dioxide is the principal greenhouse gas, people speak simply of trading in carbon.

Such projects can earn saleable certified emission reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2, which can be counted towards meeting Kyoto targets. A CDM project activity might involve, for example, a rural electrification project using solar panels or the installation of more energy-efficient boilers. \u2022\ufffd Joint Implementation (JI): The mechanism known as \u201cjoint implementation,\u201d defined in Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol, allows a country with an emission reduction or limitation commitment under the Kyoto Protocol (Annex B Party) to earn emission reduction units (ERUs) from an emission-reduction or emission-removal project in another Annex B Party, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2, which can be counted towards meeting its Kyoto target. JI offers Parties a flexible and cost-efficient means of fulfilling a part of their Kyoto commitments, while the host Party benefits from foreign investment and technology transfer.

The key is accessibility in awareness, knowledge and experience. Beyond these starting points, access and control over capital and other economic resources will become the determining or constraining factors for wider levels of participation. Box 6 The carbon finance market Currently, the carbon market is dominated by Northern companies such the European Climate Exchange\u2122 (ECX). The ECX is a derivatives market for Europe and is the largest exchange; it and smaller firms such as the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) are in a family of global exchanges. The Chicago Climate Futures Exchange\u2122 (CCFE) is a futures exchange of environmental derivatives (carbon financial instrument (CFI)), Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), certified emissions reductions (CER), and European Allowance (EUA). The Tianjin Climate Exchange\u2122 (TCX) is a joint venture with China National Petroleum Corporation and the City of Tianjin. The Montreal Climate Exchange\u2122 (MCeX) is a joint venture with the Montreal Exchange. The India Climate Exchange\u2122 is in development. A project has to meet eligibility standards and undergo independent verification to be traded on the CCX Offsets Program. Verified offset projects that sequester or eliminate GHGs earn CFIs that are marketable to CCX members. Barriers to participation in the CCX Offsets Program include costs (verification, access, transaction) and lack of knowledge of the market (registration, verification, process). Offset aggregators are entities that serve as administrative representatives on behalf of multiple owners of offset-generating projects. When aggregators pool small projects, they are minimizing time and costs, and utilizing their knowledge of the market and its processes. Transaction costs might be too high for a buyer to deal with separate project owners. There are over 75 offset aggregators operating now. Keys to accessing the carbon market are inclusive design and market infrastructure (function of time and awareness).

Public-oriented agencies also participate in the carbon market. For example, the World Bank manages over US$2 billion across 12 funds and facilities. It sources its funds from 16 governments and 66 private companies. Its two new market-based or carbon facilities are the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) and the Carbon Partnership Facility (CPF). While the FCPF focuses on deforestation, the CPF focus on energy and waste management. FCPF seeks to prevent deforestation by building capacity in, and compensating, developing countries for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. CPF activities include promoting energy efficiency, gas flaring, transport and urban development. In the carbon market schemes, the European Union\u2019s Emission Trading scheme (ETS) accounts for over US$60 billion which is approximately 70% of the global carbon market value. 7.5 Social, development and gender issues and the state of play in climate change financing There are many developmental, gender and social challenges around the various climate change funds and sub-funds, the instruments, and delivery mechanisms of the global climate change financing architecture. The climate change financing governance structure seeks to promote an enabling environment for preventing the worst-case scenario of rapid and irreversible deterioration in the earth\u2019s ecological and environmental balances. There are serious concerns about how the actions, projects and policies that are being engendered will impact long-term issues of poverty eradication, and social and gender equity. Will these issues complement each other, or are they competing and potentially clashing agendas? From a development, social and gender perspective, there are at least five broad priority areas of concern in this regard. First, there are concerns about the fragmentary nature of the climate change financing system. Increasingly, there is recognition of the need for greater coordination mechanisms that both simplify and standardize funds, policies and procedures. Greater coherence and simplification of processes will enable poor developing countries to participate more effectively in the system on their own 216 terms. It will further contribute to transparency and accountability in gender and social equity objectives. Second, there are clearly tensions and contradictions between the push for climate-friendly technologies that decrease emissions and the emission- intensive stages of development that many developing countries find themselves at. There is a lopsidedness in the sacrifices to be made in terms of responsibility for the problems of generating climate change itself. Whose economic and growth dynamics are to be slowed versus who will benefit from the progression of market-based and high-tech climate change solutions? This is so whether the financing mechanisms focus on promoting transformation to a low-carbon economy or other forms of emissions reductions. In neither case does the set of solutions, at the heart of the climate change financing regime, focus on compensation for prior damages by the North, or on unearthing and enhancing traditional knowledge, know-how and skills of adaptation and mitigation honed over time in developing countries. Such stores of knowledge are available within communities and households in many areas of the global south. Women in many communities are also the keepers and practitioners of such knowledge. Third, climate change financing mechanisms may also be implicated in the further accumulation of sovereign debts in a context where many developing countries, both low and middle-income, are already highly indebted and operate with questionable debt sustainability ratios. The key culprits here are financial mechanisms that explicitly involve lending as well as those underpinned by the dynamics of co-financing. Another important issue to flag here is the likely threat of the substitution of development financing for climate change financing and the impacts that this may have for social and gender equity. Historically, social development and gender equality interventions in many poor developing countries have been highly dependent on aid and public finance streams. Fourth, there is currently a strong democratic deficit in the climate change financing governance system. Many of the funds and mechanisms do not ensure the voice and participation of key stakeholders in the formulation, design, implementation and monitoring of the projects and programmes financed. More importantly, the funds and mechanisms that would tend to be the most likely processes for development, poverty reduction and gender- friendly inputs and outcomes are the least resourced and the most vulnerable. For example, the Adaptation Fund is quite inadequately resourced, such that it struggles to fulfil its administrative functions. 217 Module 7 Unfortunately, far too few of the more richly endowed financing instruments, particularly those in the strategic area of mitigation, encourage local participation, and themselves rely on a top-down process. For example, as noted by climate justice activists, the World Bank\u2019s climate change financing framework is based on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "819ea9c6-a58e-4d22-a885-cdfe03becc36": {"__data__": {"id_": "819ea9c6-a58e-4d22-a885-cdfe03becc36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ae09cf790ad7b45781211607cb9aa70fb41eb25400224307b6a4f2972c9769c"}}, "hash": "2ae09cf790ad7b45781211607cb9aa70fb41eb25400224307b6a4f2972c9769c", "text": "a percentage of GDP and so inherently ignores the resources of the poor. In addition, the application and review processes of most climate change financing funds are quite complex, and given the high level of segmentation of funds, do not encourage non-governmental access to fund. This is especially relevant for very small and under-resourced NGOs in the developing countries. There is an institutional bias in favour of Northern- based NGOs who operate quite large and well financed operations. Hence it is an understatement to say that within this framework, the voices, priorities and concerns of indigenous people and women are often the last heard and the least responded to. Fifth, as noted above, there is a tendency, given the bias of the system towards mitigation, to marginalize women\u2019s and indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and livelihoods in favour of high-tech and large infrastructure projects. Often this is due not to an intention to discriminate against or to marginalize, but rather an ignorance and unwillingness to take into account the historical situation or the outcome of systemic gender discrimination that has impacted the present status of women and indigenous people with regard to education, land, forests and other economic resources. This is why a gender and a human rights perspective must underlie and be integrated into the strategic approach of multilateral adaptation and mitigation funds implemented by the World Bank and GEF-UN. This pertains as well as to the carbon market. Overall, in order for climate change financing to have positive impacts on indigenous people and to promote women\u2019s economic and social empowerment, the outstanding issues of transparency and accountability at the multilateral, bilateral and national levels; corporate social responsibility; capacity building; and support for advocacy must be addressed. The next section examines these issues in a more gender-focused way. 7.6 Gender and the state of play in climate change financing As identified in the previous section, there are specific biases at work within the operational domain of climate change finance, which are both structural and institutional: 218 1) The public sector and private sector are biased towards, and prioritize, mitigation over adaptation. As a result, there is less money for adaptation; 2) There is a bias towards the energy sector and large-scale projects. As a result of these two biases, community groups, NGOs from the South and, even more so, women\u2019s groups are often found at the margin of climate change financing activities; 3) There is a pervasive male bias permeating the entire climate change financing structure. The male bias springs from the underlying climate change policy complex itself. Climate policy has tended to pursue climate change as a purely scientific, technical, gender and class-neutral endeavour. However, dealing with climate change involves changing and modifying human behaviour, making trade- offs between different types of economic and social activities, and making decisions about what activities are beneficial to the total economic output. These are all based on value judgements which are conditioned, as noted in Module I, on the prevailing gender ideology and gender systems in place at the national, regional and global levels. Gender discrimination and gender myths permeate all these levels and all the institutions of governance. It is no less pervasive within the so- called technical areas whether in macro- economic and financial policies or within the sciences. The financial markets, as discussed in Section one of this module, exhibit the same tendency towards gender subordination \u2013 seemingly holding Box 7 Gender myths underpinning financial markets \u2022\ufffd Women are less capable of economic success than men; Women are risky borrowers; \u2022\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Women borrow for consumption without the capacity for repayment. Yet the reality is that: \u2022\ufffd Women, in developing countries, have higher repayment rates than men (97% higher); \u2022\ufffd Women borrow for short-term liquidity purposes and have long-term cash flows for repayment; \u2022\ufffd Consumer goods are often transformed into capital goods in the household and informal sectors (for example, refrigerators and stoves are often used to make and sell ice to neighbours, and to cook food for sale in the informal sector etc.). 219 Module 7 steadfastly to the gender myths about women, their role and participation in the economy (Box 7). Therefore, it is not surprising that these issues should continue to dominate within climate change finance at all levels. It is not uncommon that the private sector does not pay attention to gender issues at all. Thus the market tends to ignore the impacts of its actions on women\u2019s land-use options, incomes and livelihoods, food affordability and the related cost of living including the price of land.

Invariably, it is the case that climate change financing occurs in a context in which, even when it does consider women, they are still seen as vulnerable groups instead of major environmental and agricultural producers in the world. Unfortunately, the myths of the male farmers, the male business owner and the male head of household continue to dominate the imagination of climate change financing decision makers. So, for example, in the case of financing mechanisms such as REDD, it is important to undertake gender and social impact assessment in order to make sure that women do not lose their ownership and control of land and forests. A key goal built into such projects must be that they, at worse, do no harm by displacing and dispossessing women and indigenous people from their traditional patterns of access and control of these resources. At best, such projects should aim to enhance women\u2019s and men\u2019s economic and social status. In the case of the carbon markets, the inherent assumption is a level playing field in which women and men have the same carbon footprints. So the issue of equity of burden sharing does not arise. But equity of burden sharing is quite a weighty issue as it is well known that women and indigenous people have smaller ecological footprints. Instruments must be devised that take this into account. This could include, for example, governmental incentives such as tax breaks, grants and outright set-aside programmes for women and for indigenous groups. Within the context of the market, the pooling of funds to create women- centred funding instruments would be a step in the right direction. However, such innovations will only arise from greater awareness of, and education and training on, the dynamics of the carbon markets, its functioning and impacts as well as its opportunities and constraints. 220 Outstanding questions and challenges for the way forward include: How financially sustainable are women\u2019s organizations? Most \u2022\ufffd women\u2019s organizations\u2019 budgets are small with an annual income of less than US$50,000 (United Nations, 2007). Inadequate funds for gender and development. How do we ensure \u2022\ufffd that women\u2019s groups have the capacity to engage effectively in policy dialogue in the changing aid environment? How do we ensure that women\u2019s groups have access to information and that their voices, priorities, interests, and knowledge make an impact? How can more climate funds become available to them? Gender-sensitive reform of the GEF. \u2022\ufffd Gender analysis of public finance. \u2022\ufffd While these are very large issues, with the collaboration of experts in the area of gender-responsive budgeting, gender taxation and finance, and the overall area of gender and macro-economics and trade, it may be possible to tackle some of these issues and have substantive input into the reconstruction of the post-2012 financing regime. Box 8 Aggregators and gender The idea of \u201can aggregated market structure\u201d with \u201caggregators\u201d that link small or micro- scale operations to the carbon market presents a possibility for offset projects to achieve environmental and social objectives. For example, in the Indian state of Kerala, an NGO Andhyodaya is promoting methane capture and use with biogas digesters in small rural households. The methane replaces kerosene or fuel wood for cooking. Contracts are issued on the basis of fossil fuel emission displacement. The project is so small on an individual household level that it would not be able to access the carbon market without an aggregator. However, within an aggregated market infrastructure, it becomes an attractive prospect. Phase I of the project included 15,000 poor rural households in South India. About US$1.2 million gross revenue was transferred in aggregate to participants. The challenge here is to ensure that decision making remains in the hands of the gender- sensitized community or the women\u2019s organizations involved.

Decisions will be taken on a shared vision for global climate change, the strategies, targets and actions for future emissions reductions (20% by 2020, or 50% by 2030, or some other formulation around 2050) in the post-2012 period.

At the same time, on a parallel track, there will be scope to rethink instruments such as the CDM, emissions trading and carbon credits, which are due to expire in 2012. After Copenhagen, there is likely to be an infusion of funds into some existing financial instruments (for example, the 5th replenishment of GEF) as well as an impetus towards second or third generation funds for both adaptation and mitigation. It is to be hoped that the same old template will not be automatically relied upon, but rather that new and innovative gender-sensitive templates are created. Undeniably, the period leading up to Copenhagen, as well as the COP-15 deliberations themselves, provide a window of opportunity for building in processes, mechanisms and procedures that are gender-sensitive and which will work to the advantage of women\u2019s economic and social empowerment. With regard to climate change and its financing, the task is to ensure that the concerns and priorities of women, especially poor women, move to centre stage of the financing agenda.

Box 9 The GEF and participation The GEF works with NGOs and CBOs through national steering committees. Steering committee members and national coordinators are provided with tools to incorporate gender into the implementation of programmes. Using training modules developed by GEF, they are asked to conduct national reviews and assessments of how gender-sensitive policies are. After the training, national steering committee members are asked to put in writing what they would do and how they would implement gender mainstreaming. There is a database of how they can follow the process of incorporating gender. Through this training process, every national steering committee member gains a gender dimension, so he or she knows how to mainstream gender. Currently, 103 countries within the GEF programmes have more women as national coordinators and include provisions to access leadership. At the initiation stage, both men and women are included, and they decide what they want to work on, and how to impact assessment.

The main manifestation of climate change is in altered rain pattern and recurrent heavy rains. There are also erratic monsoons that disrupt planting seasons and negatively impact crop yields. These factors pose tremendous problems for the livelihoods and economic security of the women in the affected area. This is compounding an already existing and deepening agrarian crisis linked to under-investment in rural development, trade liberalization in agriculture, and land conversion policies that have eroded rural livelihoods and incomes, causing many women to take up jobs as domestic helpers in cities or migrate overseas, often illegally, in search of economic opportunities. Amihan notes that the climate change crisis disproportionately affects women farmers vis-\u00e0-vis men farmers in at least three ways. First, since women manage, control and own fewer resources \u2013 especially land \u2013 than men, they have fewer assets to sell to cope when harvests collapse either because of floods or droughts. Second, more women than men fall into chronic indebtedness related to climate- induced crop failures because micro-credit is largely targeted at women and because, as managers of production and household expenses, they are under stronger pressure to bridge resource gaps.

Third, when food shortages arise from poor harvests linked to weather problems, women prioritize the food needs of male household members and children over their own. Drawing from a rich body of local and traditional knowledge, people in the countryside have begun to adjust to extreme weather variations using a variety of adaptation and coping strategies. Agricultural adaptation strategies include practising crop diversification, planting crop varieties that are resistant to droughts, floods and pests; cultivating at higher levels; practising contour farming; planting bamboo to prevent soil erosion; and constructing temporary drainage canals. Financial coping strategies include engaging in off-farm work; looking for other sources of income at home and abroad; taking out loans from money-lenders, relatives and friends; selling off livestock; seeking government financial assistance; renting out, selling or pawning farm plots; and reducing food consumption. With limited resources and support, women farmers are organizing and strategizing in 227 Case study 1 / Module 7 order to secure their livelihoods and access to basic needs. In particular, Mahan members in the provinces of Rizal, Pampanga, Quezon and South Cotabato are increasingly engaged in organic farming initiatives, integrated pest management programmes, agro-forestry, and tree-planting projects. Women farmers who are members of Amihan in Montalban and Rizal are beginning to cultivate a traditional, indigenous variety of rice that does not require massive doses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and is more resistant to pests than commercial varieties. The women are also planting fruit trees and vegetables on the borders separating the rice paddies as a form of inter-cropping. While this alternative practice of farming rice yields only one harvest a year, it is respectful of the environment and generates significantly lower GHG emissions than commercial farming. At the same time, it adapts rice farming to the prolonged wet seasons brought about by climate change. From the point of view of the rural poor and women, the protection of their livelihoods and sources of sustenance are paramount, entailing adaptation measures that build climate resilience into agriculture and fisheries, ensure people\u2019s access to potable water and other necessities, and provide social insurance and protection, among others. Amihan also calls for government support and funds directed towards rural communities \u2013 and especially rural women \u2013 for the provision of subsidized organic seeds, fertilizers and pesticides; access to affordable agricultural technologies; dissemination of agro-forestry techniques; and provision of low-interest farm credit and crop-insurance schemes specifically targeted at small farmers. In addition, it is currently lobbying Congress to repeal the 2006 Bio-fuels Act. Amihan notes that plantations of jatropha, a major bio-fuel crop, require high chemical inputs that would cause the soil to dry out. Amihan is also pushing for the passage of an agrarian reform bill aimed at promoting land reform, by establishing certainty of land tenure and encouraging farmers to invest in climate- proofing (as well as addressing basic issues of justice and equity). In addition, Amihan is beginning to conduct advocacy around climate change at the global level. The Philippine government\u2019s policy res- ponse to the climate change challenges of adaptation and mitigation is based on a four- track approach: 1) promoting investments in renewable-energy projects such as mega hydro dams through public subsidies; 2) scaling up CDM projects, and piloting and establishing a carbon trading system; 3) expanding ODA, loans and grants from donor countries as well as regional international and financial institutions; and 4) charging user fees for some environmental services, encouraging public- private sector initiatives and privatizing public enterprises and lands. There were also a couple of adaptation projects focusing on agriculture. For example, the Philippine Climate Change Adaptation 228 Project Phase 1 includes the design of cost- effective adaptation measures in agriculture and natural resource management. While the benefits of pooling risks and of insurance against climate-related hazards in support of adaptation efforts are increasingly appreciated internationally, this remains a rather underdeveloped area in the Philippines largely because of scarce private-sector interest. The government-owned Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation (PCIC) offers weather-related crop-damage insurance, but small farmers have limited access to the fund since they cannot afford the premiums. The World Bank and ProVention Consortium-funded Agriculture Climate Risk Assessment Project will explore the possibility of piloting a weather-based insurance system. There are major problems with the government\u2019s policy response and its financing of mitigation and adaptation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d146a477-8fe6-403b-8ad6-3d71861da20a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d146a477-8fe6-403b-8ad6-3d71861da20a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Training manual on gender and climate change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fd15764db02d9d15068188f231c2fa8e978d11994f35299bba375025a189669b"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa097436-a485-413d-b80a-896468a9a744", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/training-manual-gender-and-climate-change", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae247a46daf4a4c57bad42d98f6295850dbd031311607e73060a874a82a7a5af"}}, "hash": "7dab95a9e91c60c1e9ca930f9b3ba64b951ad9daa376399f0fdd1c14a050e4e1", "text": "Firstly, its reliance on more debt instruments to finance climate change challenges will add to its already high debt burden.

In making this choice, the government has ignored other GHG abatement projects such as community forest management and agro-forestry schemes, with potentially strong poverty alleviation outcomes. It has also neglected to focus on adaptation measures that could build climate resilience into agriculture and fisheries, and hence ensure people\u2019s access to water and other necessities. Secondly, the government has opted to establish a carbon trading system instead of imposing a national carbon tax and other forms of pollution taxes which could have both reduced GHG emissions and raised public funds for adaptation. Research shows that a national carbon tax in the Philippines could not only reduce poverty and increase welfare but would also raise revenues for adaptation that could enhance gender equality, especially if adaptation financing was used to support rural development. Lastly, imposing user fees for environmental services could have a regressive distributional impact and prevent rural women from accessing such services. Source: Perlata, A. (2008).

Materials: Marker pens, masking tape, flip charts and pins Procedure: Briefly explain what you understand by the phrase \u201cclimate 1. change financing\u201d. Each person in the group should say aloud a word or phrase or an expression that embodies or clarifies the term\u2019s meaning to her or him. 230 Ask the group to think about a climate change issue in their 2. community or nation (identity what approach to take \u2013 adaptation or mitigation). What would a project to address this problem look like? Discuss this for 15 minutes. Now ask the participants to review the discussion: What are the 3. instruments, mechanisms and modalities of climate change financing? (Section 7.3). Divide the group into groups of males only and females only. 4. Let them draft a mini proposal for funding to implement the project they discussed in (2) above. Have them discuss to which funding mechanisms they would 5. submit the project, and what they think the likely response to the proposal might be. 231 Instruments and techniques / Module 7 Analysis of a case study Instruments and techniques II.
