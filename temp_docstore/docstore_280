These can undermine the affirmative provisions accorded under the relevant policies. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) has no specific safeguard policy pertaining to indigenous peoples. However, in the Guidelines for Confirmation of Environmental and Social Considerations (April 2002), the sole provision specifically pertaining to indigenous peoples quoted below, provides a clearer perspective on land rights: When a project may have adverse impact on indigenous peoples, all of their rights in relation to land and resources must be respected in accordance with the spirit of the relevant international declarations and treaties. Efforts must be made to obtain the consent of indigenous peoples after they have been fully informed. (footnote) It is worthy to acknowledge this affirmative provision of JBIC with respect to land and resource rights which is with reference to international declarations and treaties. Equally important to underscore is the absence of linking the JBIC policy with domestic laws and policies which could be theoretically advantageous to indigenous peoples. However, JBIC does not require project proponents to obtain free and prior consent of indigenous peoples, but only to make efforts to do so after indigenous peoples have been fully informed of project impacts. Indigenous peoples all over the world have been asserting that at the crux of their development in all spheres \u2013 economic, social, cultural and political \u2013 is the recognition of their inherent right to their lands, territories and resources and the right to self- determination. For the indigenous peoples, development means liberation from centuries of exploitation of their resources and liberation from discrimination and oppression. Recognizing the right to ancestral lands, territories and the right to self-determination will pave the way towards the full realization of human dignity both as individuals and as collectivities. These are the major concerns with which indigenous peoples would like to be incorporated in Safeguard Policies if these are to fully protect the interests and rights of indigenous peoples.

In 2001 UNDP adopted a Policy of Engagement with Indigenous Peoples. The Policy is in direct response to the disproportionately vulnerable situations facing many indigenous peoples, and the need for constructive dialogue with indigenous peoples when devising development activities affecting them. This Policy of Engagement provides the framework to guide UNDP\u2019s work in the area of indigenous issues. It is built on the recognition that indigenous peoples must be engaged in, and in ownership of activities concerning their rights and development.

This will help catalyse new regional prominence for indigenous voices in Asia-Pacific. v The current report presents the highlights of five country assessments that were undertaken to identify the communication and information needs of indigenous peoples. The starting point for this regional initiative was that access to information and communication avenues have an empowering element, and play a significant role in strengthening democratic governance, making it more inclusive, responsive and accountable. Given that approximately 70 percent of the world\u2019s 370 million indigenous peoples live in Asia-Pacific, and that, to a large extent, are often the most vulnerable groups, it was deemed relevant to focus on their information and communication needs. Moreover, with the adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007, it became even more relevant to recognise the importance of access to information, both indigenous and non-indigenous for the full realisation of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. This regional initiative, called the Indigenous People\u2019s Initiative, began in Borneo in December 2007. Five assessments followed (between 2009-2011), culminating in regional and national interventions to increase the participation of indigenous peoples in decisions affecting them. The initiative builds on an assessment approach developed by the UNDP Oslo Governance Centre, while elaborating the importance of communication for poverty reduction and democratic governance. The assessments used a participatory and inclusive approach to produce findings and recommendations, and strengthen the capacities of researchers and participating organizations. The methodology was piloted in Lao PDR and Nepal, and later updated to include indicators from the Media Development Indicators devised by the International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). All findings were validated at national consultation workshops. The assessments focused on a systematic analysis of major development issues faced by indigenous peoples, including in terms of representation in state agencies. They considered media and communication landscapes\u2013encompassing freedom of expression and information, the safety of journalists, and community media, particularly radio\u2013and how different factors facilitate or hinder information and communication for indigenous peoples, including the potential of new modes of digital communication and information and communication technology (ICT). In identifying the main challenges and opportunities for indigenous peoples and their development, the assessments provided a basis for recommendations on priority interventions for each participating country and for a regional strategy. Executive Summary 01 The recommendations span a wide range of issues, covering interventions to expand democratic space, to pilot and/or scale up on-going indigenous media initiatives, to improve media literacy, to share experiences through South-South exchanges, to enhance indigenous peoples\u2019 capacities for producing media content, and to use new media platforms for democratizing communication production and distribution. The overall process resulted on an agreement to take the recommendations forward through close collaboration with regional organizations such as the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact (AIPP), the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters (Asia- Pacific) (AMARC), and UNDP APRC and its national partners, including indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations and UNDP Country Offices. The objective of the next phase of the initiative is to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples to have access to all forms of non-indigenous media, without discrimination, and to strengthen the role of indigenous media in enhancing indigenous voices, culture, language and identity, as enshrined in Article 16 of UNDRIP.1 It is expected that the results achieved under the first phase will contribute to enhancing indigenous peoples\u2019 participation and representation in democratic and political processes. This will also ensure that governments are held more accountable for actions and promises related to international norms on the rights of indigenous peoples. It is hoped that development practitioners, policy-makers, indigenous peoples\u2019 organisations, and others who are interested on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights will find this a useful publication for reference. Executive Summary 02 Of the estimated 370 million indigenous people in the world,2 around two thirds live in Asia-Pacifi c.3 Indigenous peoples account for about fi ve percent of the global population and almost 15 percent of the world\u2019s poor. They suff er from a diverse range of problems associated with marginalized socioeconomic status, their interaction with other cultural groups and changes in their environments. The challenges they face touch upon cultural and linguistic preservation, land rights, ownership and exploitation of natural resources, political determination and autonomy, environmental degradation and incursion, ill health, substandard education and discrimination. Against this background, the United Nations General Assembly in 2007 adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)4, which acknowledges that indigenous peoples have suff ered from historic injustices as a result of colonization and dispossession of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8c6f463-6851-4ccd-a3ba-d8085993c9eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8c6f463-6851-4ccd-a3ba-d8085993c9eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-voices-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Voices in Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-voices-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "721709be77227d69408d0c31ebffde4c04a56a84765a3ef2160700214ca1dc32"}}, "hash": "721709be77227d69408d0c31ebffde4c04a56a84765a3ef2160700214ca1dc32", "text": "their lands, territories and resources, and that this has prevented them from exercising their right to development in accordance with their own needs and interests. n Indigenous peoples have the right to establish their own media in their own languages and to have access to all forms of non-indigenous media without discrimination. n States shall take eff ective measures to ensure that State-owned media duly refl ect indigenous cultural diversity.

Chapter 1 The Indigenous Voices Initiative 03 Indigenous Voices in Asia UNDP\u2019s Indigenous Voices initiative focuses on how media environments and communication interventions can empower indigenous peoples by enhancing inclusive participation, voice and governance accountability on indigenous issues. Rationale The Indigenous Voices initiative is based on the premise that some of the most serious problems faced by new and fragile democratic systems are social exclusion and the low participation of poor and vulnerable groups. In Asia-Pacific, a significant percentage of the poor and vulnerable are indigenous peoples. Factors that hinder their inclusion and participation include a lack of information and inadequate communication channels for them to express their perspectives and influence public opinion. Indigenous peoples often have limited awareness of how to exercise their rights, communicate their grievances and participate in public debates. The media \u2013 both traditional forms as well as new digital media channels \u2013 have so far failed to fully support the inclusive participation of indigenous peoples, both in terms of diversity in their staffs and in the content they produce. Indigenous peoples and their representative organizations need a plurality of channels for their voices, but they have largely depended on the mainstream media to report their concerns. This has been far from ideal. For example, while environmental damage, infringements on land rights and transgressions of cultural norms are issues that have often been covered, the points-of- view of indigenous peoples have largely been missing. Frequently, media outlets use languages that indigenous peoples do not understand. Today, new media and mobile communication technologies promise renewed potential for reaching more people, including in remote areas. More people than ever before have access to ready-made, global, mobile, or Web-enabled platforms for accessing information and sharing their opinions. These developments provide opportunities for democratizing media and fostering action on the concerns of indigenous peoples, such as land rights, language preservation, environmental conservation and social protection. They offer unprecedented opportunities for \u201ccitizen reporting,\u201d and have created new ways for media to interact with readers and audiences through blogs, text messaging and video- sharing services. Citizens have moved from being passive recipients of information to acting as producers of content, including through instant feedback on issues covered by the media. New media and information technology also benefit existing media channels, such as community radio stations. Local radio is the most widespread form of community media\u2013including for indigenous peoples\u2013because it is cheap to produce and access, and can cover large areas and overcome illiteracy.5 Community media programmes can now tap the advantages of the Internet and mobile phone to disseminate their programmes. Both new and traditional community media can lend themselves to ending the isolation and lack of voice among indigenous peoples. Successful initiatives, especially in developed countries, use these media for enhancing communication and information exchange. Examples come from the Aboriginals in Australia, the First Nation Peoples in 04 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 1 Northern Canada, the Maoris in New Zealand and the Samis in Northern Scandinavia. These successes are rarely replicated in developing countries, however. Access to information, and freedom of expression and communication remain major demands of indigenous peoples in Asia-Pacific. Indigenous media in developing countries in the region do not compare with those in developed countries largely because of socioeconomic and political factors. While the Aboriginals in Australia and New Zealand continue to suffer from the legacies of a colonial past, they have also made great strides in recognizing their rights, with media and technology being part of the improvements. These media initiatives were in some cases facilitated and subsidized by their governments. Poor indigenous peoples of the developing countries in Asia-Pacific have not had these opportunities. This has major consequences, because without access to media and information technology, they could remain marginalized from development. Even though indigenous peoples are disproportionately represented among underserved sections of society, they are still largely left out of formal poverty reduction and governance processes. Fortunately, the first steps towards change have started, as this report will show. The examples provided below illustrate some ways to address the challenges.

Held in the remote village of Bario, in the Kelabit Highlands of Sarawak, East Malaysia, the meeting helped create momentum. Bario is the traditional home of the Kelabit people, one of Malaysia\u2019s smallest indigenous minority groups. It is also the home of the multi-award winning e-Bario project that Sending Aboriginal Voices Across Australia Around 1978, in Alice Springs in central Australia, two Aboriginal people and their non-Aboriginal associate \u2013 John Macumba, Freda Glynn and Phillip Batty \u2013 helped to lay the foundation for the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA). Their goal was to ensure that Aboriginal voices are heard throughout the world, and to enable Aboriginal people to take ownership and control of their own future through a strong, vibrant media centre. That goal became a reality in 1980 when CAAMA was established. The CAAMA radio network (8 KIN FM) broadcasts Aboriginal radio across one-third of Australia, from remote deserts to the sea, and from the outback to the city. The association now operates a recording studio and a record label producing indigenous music, and issues world-class television programmes about Aboriginal peoples, and their culture, lifestyles and issues. CAAMA is also a major shareholder and active manager of Imparja Television, a commercial television station that broadcasts via satellite to one of the largest television service areas in the world.

Its network supports the development of online applications that combine video, voice and data services for the Keewaytinook Okimakanak communities, which are part of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, located across an area roughly the size of France. The Nishnawbe Aski Nation has a population of about 25,000 people, the majority of whom live in remote communities with 300 to 900 inhabitants. For many communities, the only year-round access in or out of their area is by small airplane. Roughly 2,800 people live in the Keewaytinook Okimakanak communities. Community members recognize and use the K-Net network as a tool for local and cultural issues, education, health and economic development. Tele-health and tele-psychiatry are among new services. A pilot project has demonstrated that one-quarter of all medical consultations can be carried out using the network. This makes it easier, especially for elderly people, to get quality medical care without the discomfort and high expense of flying out of the community. K-Net is having significant impacts on education. Until recently, children had to attend secondary school hundreds of kilometres away from their families. For many young people, this involved major culture shock and a loss of social support, and often resulted in students quitting school. They now have the choice to stay in their communities to attend Grades 9 and 10 online, using the Keewaytinook Internet High School. Another benefit: The technology also allows the global community to access the Keewaytinook Okimakanak \u2013 local handicrafts and eco-tourism opportunities can now be offered online.

The workshop brought together 17 indigenous participants from 15 countries working in the fields of media and information technology, plus academics and development practitioners. The objective was to raise awareness by sharing good practices, and to develop proposals and mechanisms for increasing e-inclusion6 and media access. At the workshop, it became apparent that indigenous peoples in Asia-Pacific face immediate and long-term challenges when it comes to media and information technology. Some of the findings were: n A lack of awareness and understanding among policy makers and civil society organizations of the importance of indigenous peoples\u2019 right to information and their freedom of expression, which are required for them to exercise their rights under UNDRIP and Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,7 on freedom of expression. n Many indigenous journalists and media practitioners lack the professional skills to report on indigenous peoples\u2019 issues in mainstream media, and to use traditional and new media channels for research and information dissemination. n Only a few indigenous media initiatives exist among developing countries in Asia- Pacific, so lessons learned are scarce.

Realizing that media and ICT offer considerable potential for alleviating many of the problems that indigenous peoples face, participants formulated proposals for improving indigenous media, and using ICT to accelerate e-inclusion and serve the social and economic interests of marginalized sections of society.8 Communication for Empowerment Practical Guidance Note The Indigenous Voices initiative was inspired by a UNDP Oslo Governance Centre programme called Communication for Empowerment (C4E). In 2006, the centre released a practical guidance note on C4E that explained the importance of communication for poverty reduction and democratic governance. It outlined a range of ways to enhance C4E that UNDP and other development practitioners can apply,9 based on the understanding that opportunities for poor and vulnerable groups to voice their concerns through effective communication channels have not been sufficiently identified and documented, particularly at local levels. Assessment of communication needs and opportunities was seen as the first critical step, which had largely been ignored by national development planning processes and policy makers. For the Indigenous Voices initiative, close collaboration with the Oslo Governance Centre assisted with C4E assessments in Lao PDR and Nepal. The intended outcome was to identify key challenges and opportunities for empowering poor, marginalized and vulnerable groups through better access to information, and enhancement of the skills necessary to engage with the media and take advantage of communication facilities. In doing so, people could exercise their voices, and participate more inclusively and meaningfully in decision-making and development. The strategic intent of the assessments was to establish the development context for indigenous peoples and ethnic groups, with particular reference to media, information and communication. They aimed to propose specific interventions to improve communication channels for indigenous peoples, including through the effective use of media and ICT for development. Proposals arising from the studies were expected to help formulate inputs for a subsequent regional programme to implement them. Three more countries \u2013 Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2013 later joined the initiative. A larger number of participating countries was expected to create momentum for regional implementation of UNDRIP, particularly in terms of the use of media and ICT. Through global and regional partnerships, established with the Asia Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Pact (AIPP) and the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters (AMARC), the initiative sought to leverage knowledge and experiences from a variety of countries, strengthening South-South cooperation, and bringing indigenous peoples together to address common concerns. 07 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 1 A Participatory Method of Assessment As part of the assessment process, the Indigenous Voices initiative developed a research guide10 based on experiences in Lao PDR and Nepal. It served as a manual for carrying out the studies in other countries. The methodology for the assessments was grounded in field research, combining national data and analysis with more focused study of the realities facing Indigenous communities in at least three locations. This \u2018T-shaped\u2019 research approach was characterized by a broad investigation and review of information at the national level, followed by a narrow but deep analysis at the local level. A national framework served as a reference point for researchers, while they also used first-hand evidence and direct experience at the local level to draw conclusions and propose interventions.11 The C4E assessments provided findings and recommendations, but also helped develop capacities. Rather than pursuing stand-alone assessments, which could have easily been done by external consultants, UNDP APRC called on indigenous researchers and indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations to take the lead in all five countries. Research expertise was provided as needed. The idea was to continuously discuss and expand understanding of the provisions in International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 16912 and UNDRIP, within national contexts, while also fine-tuning the research to match local specificities.

As importantly, they now had a grounded analysis of their information and communication needs. This can provide a basis for planning and implementing programmes to bridge the divide in access to information and communication, and empower poor and vulnerable groups. \u201cThe C4E assessment process allowed indigenous peoples to generate knowledge from their perspective, while using standard research tools and methodologies.\u201d 08 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 1 The C4E assessments drew on a participatory research model to help set priorities for actions and make recommendations that would be nationally owned and implemented. Without these baseline assessments, the C4E initiative could have resulted in interventions poorly attuned to local needs. The assessments provided a systematic analysis of communication and media in consultation with relevant stakeholders. They were designed to offer an entry point for governments and citizens to engage on issues faced by indigenous peoples in terms of media and communication. All of the assessments provided evidence-based recommendations for national and local decision-making. The C4E assessment framework was first prepared for a 2010 training workshop for research teams in Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines. The framework and its indicators built on the Practical Guidance Note on Communication for Empowerment by UNDP\u2019s Oslo Governance Centre, the Media Development Indicators developed by IPDC/UNESCO, UNDRIP and ILO Convention 169. Combined, these resources provide a set of indicators based on internationally agreed norms and standards that can assist in indentifying gaps in media and communication, especially for poor and disadvantaged groups. Chapter 2 The Communication for Empowerment Assessment Framework 09 Indigenous Voices in Asia The C4E Assessment Framework This section introduces the C4E framework for the different categories covered by the country assessments. The following section goes into greater detail on each category. Category Content Areas 1. The context for indigenous peoples 1.1. Government policy and international laws adopted on indigenous peoples 1.2. Development, rights and participation of indigenous peoples 2. The media and access to information 2.1. Access to information for indigenous peoples 2.2. Freedom of expression and media freedom 2.3. Community media 2.4. Media access 2.5 Media content and coverage of indigenous peoples\u2019 issues 3. The digital communication environment 3.1. Legal and policy framework for telecommunication and ICT 3.2. Telecom and ICT landscape and diversity 3.3. Content and applications 4. Indigenous peoples\u2019 participation, access to media, and local information and communication needs 4.1. Indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and development at local level 4. 2. Indigenous peoples\u2019 representation and participation in local governance 4.3. Media, access to information and ICT landscape at the local level 4.4. Existing community media initiatives 4.5. Local information and communication usage and needs Category 1. The Context of Indigenous Peoples Under this category, the assessment conducts a situation analysis, based mainly on desk research using secondary and primary sources, to describe the development context for indigenous peoples. It gathers information on: n The national socio-political context as it relates to indigenous peoples; n The nation\u2019s population of indigenous peoples, their geographical distribution and socioeconomic demography; n The status of indigenous cultures, traditions, languages, etc., along with efforts to conserve and promote them; n The status of representative indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations; n The policy and legislative environment for indigenous peoples; n The communication context, with reference to UNDRIP, UN development assistance frameworks, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), etc., and the extent to which media and communication facilities are integrated with development activities; and n Problems and challenges for the further development of indigenous peoples, according to the principles in UNDRIP and other international instruments. 10 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 2 Category 2. The Media and Access to Information This part of the assessment broadly surveys the current media and communication environment. It builds on a review of the country\u2019s media environment, with a specific focus on indigenous peoples, using a research approach similar to that in Category 1. It incorporates information on the context (traditional and alternative media and communication, including ICT), and on the access, voice and participation of indigenous peoples. The IPDC/UNESCO Media Development Indicators can be considered here, depending on their relevance to the country concerned, and taking into consideration the focus on indigenous people. Some examples of how these indicators have been adapted by the C4E assessments include:14 Freedom of expression, media freedom n Freedom of expression is guaranteed in law and respected in practice. Key indicator: National law or constitutional guarantees, and the public and indigenous peoples are aware of freedom of expression, and the existence of bodies and tools to guarantee concrete application. n The right to information is guaranteed in law and respected in practice.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89840239-7c5d-4ea5-bdf3-d4530a3010ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "89840239-7c5d-4ea5-bdf3-d4530a3010ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-voices-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Voices in Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-voices-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "86a1ccccf24ffce91994b189fb9c6cf444f21b80add603e69a91a7c230360d70"}}, "hash": "86a1ccccf24ffce91994b189fb9c6cf444f21b80add603e69a91a7c230360d70", "text": "Key indicator: The public and indigenous peoples are aware of and exercise the right to access official information. n Editorial independence is guaranteed in law and respected in practice. Key indicator: Government, regulatory bodies and commercial interests do not influence or seek to influence editorial content of broadcasters or the press. n The media is not subject to prior censorship as a matter of both law and practice. Key indicator: Broadcasting or print content is not subject to prior censorship, either by government or regulatory bodies. Media diversity n The State actively promotes a diverse mix of public, private and community media. Key indicators: The State does not discriminate between public, private and community (and indigenous) media in the granting of access to information; the regulatory system ensures equitable access to the frequency spectrum for a plurality of media, including community (and indigenous) broadcasters. n Media organizations reflect social diversity through employment practices. Key indicators: Female journalists are fairly represented across the media industry or sector, including at senior levels; journalists from minority ethnic, linguistic and/or religious groups are fairly represented across the media industry or sector, including at senior levels. Democratic platform n The media \u2013 public, private and community-based \u2013 serve the needs of all groups in society. Key indicators: The Media use language/s relied upon by marginalized groups (indigenous peoples); community media (print and 11 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 2 broadcast) are produced for specific groups, such as indigenous and tribal peoples, and refugees; and information presented by the media is accessible to women and marginalized groups (including by taking into account how these groups access information, and levels of literacy). n Marginalized groups have access to forms of communication they can use. Key indicators: The public broadcaster is technically accessible nationwide; the state takes positive steps to ensure maximum geographical reach of all broadcasters; non-print media are accessible in communities with high levels of illiteracy; community-based broadcasters or publications have high or growing levels of penetration in their target areas. n The country has a coherent ICT policy, which aims to meet the information needs of marginalized communities. Key indicators: Civil society organizations, media, government and commercial entities work together to make ICT accessible; the pricing policy does not exclude marginalized communities. Category 3. The Digital Communication Environment This part of the assessment summarizes the digital communication environment and ICT infrastructure, and the opportunities for indigenous peoples. As in Category 2, it considers the legal and overall policy environment for ICT and development, including dimensions such as mobile technology and digital content. It attempts to answer the following questions: n Is the legal and policy framework for telecommunication and ICT meeting the needs of people in rural areas? n Are telecom and ICT services reaching/covering areas where indigenous peoples live? n Do people have affordable and equitable access to means for receiving and disseminating opinions and information, including those linked to culture, using digital communication channels? n Is the range of content diverse and representative of the whole spectrum of cultures, interests and knowledge, including those of indigenous peoples? Are they able to generate their own content in local languages? 12 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 2 Category 4. Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Participation, Access to Media, and Local Information and Communication Needs This component of the assessment is based on field studies within specific communities that delve into the issues identified in Categories 1 and 2. It validated findings from the desk studies on the context of indigenous peoples, and the current status of media and digital communication. The process involves collecting locally available socioeconomic information and preparing case studies, using data collected through different methods. The field research looks for the following information to profile the community and its development challenges, as well as its access to, and voice and participation in media and communication: Demographics (population of community, male, female); n Literacy (male, female), in national language and indigenous peoples\u2019 languages; n Media penetration, encompassing newspapers, magazines, radio, television, telephone (fixed line and mobile), VCR/DVD, computer and Internet; n Local media outlets, and coverage of indigenous issues; n Responsiveness of the media to demands for development by indigenous peoples; n Media help in addressing development needs, with details on how; n Indigenous-owned media outlets; and n Alternative media, and their responsiveness to indigenous peoples\u2019 issues. 13 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 2 This chapter summarizes findings from the country assessments in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Nepal and the Philippines.

Chapter 3 Country Assessments 15 Indigenous Voices in Asia Cambodiaa Cambodia15 is still affected by the legacy of turbulent history and effects of conflict. Regular elections have been held since 1993, but true participatory democracy has yet to take firm root. The Cambodia People\u2019s Party (CPP) won 58 percent of the popular vote and almost three-fourths of the National Assembly seats in the 2008 election. Since then, the Government and the CPP have been \u201ctightening their grip on power and resources.\u201d16 Rapid growth has come from Cambodia\u2019s transition to a market-based economy. Private investment has risen dramatically, as has foreign aid, including from China, the Republic of Korea and Vietnam. Amidst these changes are growing concerns over human rights abuses, especially those related to land and natural resources. In 2008, about 1.34 percent of Cambodia\u2019s population of 13.5 million people reported an indigenous language as their mother tongue.17 The real number could be higher because many people are not confident in identifying as indigenous. The NGO Forum on Cambodia mapped indigenous people in 15 provinces. Context: Poor, marginalized and voiceless18 Legal and regulatory framework: In Cambodia, indigenous peoples19 are recognized as a separate group. Peoples such as the ethnic Lao living in the north-east, the Cham and the Vietnamese are not considered \u201cindigenous.\u201d The Cambodian Constitution (1993) guarantees equal rights to all citizens regardless of race, colour, language or religious belief. Article 31 commits to recognizing and respecting UN covenants, which extends the rights therein to all citizens. Cambodia is a signatory to a number of international instruments that protect the rights of indigenous peoples,20 as well as the Convention on Biological Diversity (1992), which recognizes their role in protecting biodiversity. In 1992, Cambodia ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). This includes the right to practice specific cultures and the right to means of livelihoods. Cambodia voted in favour of UNDRIP in the UN General Assembly, and has been a party to the International Covenant on Elimination of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) since December 1983. Cambodia has not ratified ILO Convention 169. Major development issues facing indigenous peoples: A struggle for rights Rights over forest resources and land: The Forestry Law (2002) deprives indigenous peoples of rights to their territories21 by stating that all forests are state property. The Land Law (2001) excludes forested areas traditionally managed by indigenous peoples from communal land ownership titles. The Protected Area Law (2008) grants them only user rights as opposed to ownership. It allows customary user rights in zones determined by the Ministry of Environment, but large tracts of land are being excised from \u201cprotected areas\u201d for agro-industrial concessions.22 The Land Law provides for collective titling of indigenous lands. But an additional sub- decree needed for issuing titles was not adopted until 2009. The law specifies protection against violations of the agricultural lands of indigenous minorities before titling, but a Research conducted by Graeme Brown and Naung S.O., in collaboration with indigenous communities. 16 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 this has not stopped land acquisitions and the issuance of concessions. These land grabs have resulted in evictions of indigenous people, with some involving coercion.23 Generally, the people obtaining lands are connected with government officials, the military or police. Nearly 100 known mining concessions have been issued, many in protected areas or infringing on indigenous peoples\u2019 lands.24 An exploration or mining license that impedes an indigenous community\u2019s ability to manage land according to their customs could be considered a violation of the Land Law, particularly if consultation with the community has not taken place.25 \u201cDevelopment\u201d: The situation of indigenous peoples in Cambodia is, to large extent, the result of the country\u2019s political history and dominant economic development paradigms. In an environment of weak rule of law, market-based, neo-liberal development models threaten indigenous peoples\u2019 resources. Examples are regional development plans that support major projects in an environment of corruption, poor governance, and low land and resource tenure security. Many proposed hydropower projects in areas inhabited by indigenous peoples pose a direct threat to their culture and livelihoods.

Government- appointed village chiefs are often selected through community processes. Such appointees need to be literate. The commune councils, the next level of government, are elected bodies. Indigenous representation in district and provincial governments, where commune councillors elect the representatives, is low. Ratanakiri and Mondolkiri provinces have one indigenous elected member each in the national assembly, both from the CPP. Indigenous civil society in Cambodia is weak, and there are no fully representative bodies at the provincial and national levels. Formal government recognition of village level community representation has begun, primarily for land titling. Indigenous communities can own land collectively, but only if they have been registered as legal entities by the Government, a process that has been very slow. \u201cThrough the Indigenous Rights Active Members, indigenous peoples have been involved in UN treaty reporting and advocacy.\u201d 17 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 There is one nascent provincial association \u2013 the Highlanders Association \u2013 in Ratanakiri. At the national level, the Indigenous Rights Active Members and the Indigenous Peoples Working Group bring together indigenous leaders from 15 provinces. They support networking among indigenous communities, helping them to understand their rights and how to claim them, with a focus on land and natural resources management. Through the Indigenous Rights Active Members, indigenous peoples have been involved in UN treaty reporting and advocacy. Generally, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Cambodia are assumed to represent civil society. The majority of them are non-representational, however, and tend to dominate the development agenda, as opposed to operating under the direction of peoples\u2019 organizations or grass-roots civil society. Indigenous peoples lead very few NGOs, primarily because their education does not match the administrative and reporting demands of the aid system, although many are hired as employees by NGOs. Media and communication landscape: Low access to information and community media In 2009, Cambodia had eight television broadcasters and many radio stations, including 22 national, 5 international (Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, among others) and 40 provincial services (relayed from Phnom Penh). There are 27 newspapers, three of which are foreign.28 Generally, non-contentious issues can be written about or broadcast freely. Cambodia does not have a diverse mix of public, private and community media,29 and there were no indigenous journalists in mainstream media in Cambodia in 2010. Indigenous peoples rely heavily on information provided by local authorities, NGOs or the primarily partisan media. Consultations for this study revealed that most indigenous peoples generally accept media content with little or no critical analysis, often as a result of a lack of diversity in media and opinion. Besides the mass media, word-of-mouth is still very important. NGOs conduct extensive meetings, trainings and forums, though there are some recent controls on NGO activities.30 Freedom of expression: There are constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression (Article 41), but in practice restrictions continue and are cause for growing concern.31 Mechanisms for intimidation comprise the imprisonment of community activists, violent suppression of protests, shootings and killings. A report by the NGO Forum on Cambodia (2008) said that people expressing dissatisfaction and complaints about land alienation have been threatened.32 Right to Information: Cambodia does not have a Freedom of Information law; information is primarily accessed through personal contacts, or what is made available in the official press.33 The Press Law provides rights to journalists to access certain information, but a similar right does not exist for the general public. Accessing information is difficult even for the press, however.34 The existing law is said to concern only print publications; a Law on Public Electronic Broadcasting Service Management is being developed to cover both cable and satellite broadcasting, but may be used to impose restrictions on broadcasting and online content.35 Almost all media agencies are aligned to political parties, most favouring the CPP.36 18 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 Attacks on journalists: A report by the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights (CCHR 2010) blamed the Government for using the judiciary to repress and silence dissent and critical opinion. In this environment, Cambodian journalists reporting sensitive issues face routine threats.

Community radio is constrained by the fact that radio transmitters are very difficult to import without an alignment to government interests. Non-broadcast media, such as audio or video \u201cnewsletters,\u201d operate informally and have generated much interest in indigenous communities. NGOs in Cambodia have been organizing a national community media fair since 2008. The fair allows communities to share media products they have made \u2013 including songs, dances, posters, photos, drawings and videos on local issues. The third fair took place in Kompong Thom province in 2010 and brought together 300 people from 24 provinces. Digital communication: Cambodia has no regulations that apply to the Internet. Even though a government plan to channel all Internet traffic through a single state-owned hub was aborted, there have been attempts to control \u201cimmoral\u201d sites.40 Internet use is very low (44,000 users in 2009), owing to low access and illiteracy.41 In the early 2000s, a US Agency for International Development programme funded the establishment of community information centre in all provinces. Despite a US $1.2 million investment, the centres only reached predominantly non-indigenous residents in provincial capitals. Their use declined after charges for services were introduced. In 2004, 96 percent of telephones were mobile (Miyata 2006). People use mobile phones as listening and viewing devices. Consultations in villages suggested that about 80 percent of indigenous peoples have access to mobile phones. This could offer an opportunity for using 2G or 3G mobile Internet connections for producing and distributing content on cultural and other issues, while avoiding the restrictions on traditional broadcast media. Media content on indigenous peoples: Generally, there is relatively low coverage of indigenous issues, except on international stations such as Radio Free Asia. While indigenous peoples make up only 1.5 percent of the population, news relating to them is often more than 1.5 percent of coverage on these stations, possibly due to the disproportionately high impact of land rights abuses in indigenous peoples\u2019 areas. English and French language newspapers, many of which also have Khmer translations, carry a significant amount of information on indigenous issues, but with much smaller reach compared to radio. In much of the media, the portrayal of indigenous peoples is paternalistic and stereotyped. Many reporters have a limited understanding of legal issues related to indigenous 19 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 peoples\u2019 lands. They focus on conflicts between residents and powerful people and concessionaires, but often miss the illegality of the land acquisitions and concessions. Only one media service, the government radio in Ratanakiri, uses indigenous peoples\u2019 languages, albeit only in a small time slot. The station was supported by UNESCO, which also helped train members of three ethnic groups (the Tampuen, Jarai and Brao) on community broadcasting. Some trainees went on to be producers of educational programmes. The station also carries translations of national news. There have been other efforts to raise indigenous peoples\u2019 issues in the mainstream media. In 2010, the Indigenous Community Support Organizations began preparing and broadcasting two-minute spots on TV stations with messages about the way in which the destruction of forests was impacting on indigenous culture and livelihoods, and compromising their rights. Open forums organized by the CCHR have been broadcast on five radio stations.42 Main challenges and opportunities: Low access, low rights and low participation Challenges: Access to media is a major challenge for Cambodia\u2019s indigenous peoples. They live in remote areas, and some groups are very small. Many indigenous peoples are also largely unaware of their rights, which makes them susceptible to exploitation. For their part, government officials have little or no exposure to community media and therefore are hesitant to permit them. Freedom of assembly, expression and information in general are said to be under threat. The capacity of indigenous communities to produce their own media is very low. Recent advances in media production technology have made equipment more easily available, but barriers persist, especially for low-literacy groups. Limited access to production software is mainly due to language differences. Community capacities to manage media are constrained, and indigenous people do not own and operate media. Editorial control and ownership remain major hindrances to balanced reporting on indigenous issues. Most media do not reach indigenous communities. Even where the media do reach them, very little content is relevant to their needs or delivered in their languages. Low literacy and limited access to electricity are other obstacles.

A large amount of outside support fuels rapid economic and industrial development in Cambodia, even at the cost of disenfranchising indigenous peoples. The majority of social development funding is directed through processes high in administrative and reporting requirements, in a manner not suited to indigenous peoples\u2019 systems and capacities. Opportunities: Despite tremendous challenges, there are many opportunities for new directions in content production and distribution, and in assisting indigenous peoples to critically analyse media. Supporting indigenous peoples with media literacy efforts could improve their ability to evaluate media messages, both explicit and hidden. There have been a number of pilot programmes for community and local language media. Video produced by indigenous peoples has been used to provide relevant \u201cVideo produced by indigenous peoples has been used to provide relevant information in local languages and to support cultural identity and community pride.\u201d 20 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 information in local languages and to support cultural identity and community pride. These programmes have helped to slow down land and forest grabs by enhancing information flows and community solidarity. Opportunities exist for distributing audio media using memory cards, and for mobile phone-based information and entertainment programmes. There is a strong interest in community radio, where all of these initiatives could converge. Establishing local content production units could increase material for community radio broadcasts. The government radio in Ratanakiri could broadcast community-produced content, and provincial radios could be encouraged to carry local language services. A studio for local content could both produce programmes, and dub audio and video products from outside Cambodia into different indigenous languages. The studio could also serve as a hub for gathering experiences and perspectives on indigenous media movements around the world, and as a resource centre for building networks. There have been efforts to buy timeslots on national radio and some TV stations for programmes raising and discussing indigenous issues. This work could be expanded to community-produced media. Radio ownership by indigenous groups could further promote content relevant to local concerns, while listening possibilities on mobile phones could increase accessibility. The CCHR open forum is one model for helping to increase local content on radio. The community media advisory groups in Ratanakiri offer a good starting point for increasing community-produced video, in collaboration with other associations and working groups. With video production capabilities, indigenous peoples could make content for mainstream television, a process that has begun with the production of a few short \u201cspots\u201d for broadcast. Community media fairs can provide opportunities for indigenous peoples to share media \u2013 songs, dances, poems, pictures, photos, audio recordings and video. These could be expanded to all communities and eventually scaled up into a national indigenous community media fair. Increasing and improving the coverage of indigenous peoples\u2019 issues in mainstream media could come from enhancing the understanding of journalists through training and exposure visits. Support for community-based media institutions, and indigenous NGOs and groups could cultivate skills for interacting with the media. The international media in Cambodia cover issues not taken up by national media, such as corruption and exploitation of natural resources. Their presence also affords an opportunity for producing and broadcasting documentaries on challenges faced by indigenous peoples. The Internet and social media offer potential for increasing user-generated independent content, especially in the face of restrictions on free expression and the press. Indigenous peoples can develop capacities for using different social media, and producing and distributing content for the Internet and mobile phones. These platforms would allow the distribution of multimedia content \u2013 as opposed to text-based media only \u2013 in areas with low literacy. \u201cThe Internet and social media offer potential for increasing user-generated independent content, especially in the face of restrictions on free expression and the press.\u201d 21 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 Major recommendations Indigenous peoples in Cambodia are losing their rights to natural resources and are experiencing a rapid erosion of their identities, while having little or no access to media to voice their concerns. A key challenge is the inadequacy of media in highlighting indigenous peoples\u2019 issues. An immediate priority is to tap into existing and new opportunities for widening room for empowering indigenous peoples. Recommendations are to: Democratic space n Closely monitor the shrinking democratic space in Cambodia to ensure adequate room for indigenous peoples to participate in building an inclusive democracy. n Support advocacy for free expression, a right-to-information law and enabling broadcasting laws, in collaboration with national and international networks of human rights and media rights organizations.

Bahasa Indonesia, the official language, is the lingua franca. Context: Efforts to assert identity Indonesia has 365 ethnic groups, or msayarakat adat, but a number of indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations say the number is an underestimate. No Indonesian Census has counted indigenous peoples separately. Estimates suggest there could be over 500 groups with a population of 50 million to 70 million people. The seven largest ethnic groups in the country are the Java, Sunda, Madura, Minangkabau, Bugis, Batak and Bali. President Soeharto\u2019s New Order of 1966 to 1998 sought to develop a modern, non-ethnic Indonesia, and avoided mentioning anything \u201cethnic.\u201d45 The state emphasized \u201cunity in diversity,\u201d but at the same time chose to undermine and ignore bhinneka (diversity) through policies and programmes to limit the expression of identity. Discussing ethnic identity was considered dangerous to state unity.46 When the Soeharto regime ended, a general expansion of democratic space allowed indigenous peoples to demand their rights. But the democratic transition has not been easy for an \u201cexceedingly diverse country\u201d faced with \u201cnot just promoting multiparty democracy but also building a multi-ethnic democracy, and one that guarantees freedom of religion to all.\u201d47 The country has since experienced not just the secession of Timor Leste, but also a general rise of ethnic expression, even violence. Indonesia has a strong indigenous peoples\u2019 organization \u2013 Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara, (AMAN), which represents over 1,160 indigenous communities. It was instrumental in placing 20 leaders of these communities as representatives in Parliament. Legal and regulatory framework: The legal and regulatory framework relating to indigenous peoples comprises seven laws that recognize their rights. It includes the Constitution (1945, amended in 2000), which recognizes communities living under customary law, and respects cultural identity and traditional community rights as long as they do not conflict with the \u201cunity of the Indonesian Republic.\u201d48 Constitutional provisions use two different terms for indigenous communities: \u201ccustomary law societies\u201d (Article 18b) and \u201ctraditional community\u201d (Article 28i). Many new laws relating to indigenous peoples are not yet effectively enforced,49 while some laws, such as Act No 5/1990 on the Conservation of Biological Resources and the Ecosystem, conflict with the demands of indigenous peoples, in this case for greater control over traditional resources. Indonesia has endorsed UNDRIP but has not ratified ILO Convention 169. b Research conducted by Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara (AMAN) and Harry Surdarji 23 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 Major development issues facing indigenous peoples: Limited rights over resources Rights over forest resources and land: More than two-thirds of Indonesia\u2019s total land area has been declared as national forests, including almost the whole of Papua.

A few local governments have responded positively to the demands of indigenous peoples and re-instituted traditional institutions, but their roles remain undefined. In 2001, West Sumatera\u2019s provincial legislature enacted Provincial Regulation No 9/2000 re-establishing nagari, or customary territories, as self-governing entities. Other local governments have taken steps to recognize indigenous rights over traditional lands and forests. Examples include the Lebak District Regulation No. 32/2001 on the protection of the ulayat (a territory, realm or jurisdiction, but commonly translated as right of disposal) rights of the Baduy indigenous peoples; West Lampung District Regulation No. 18/2004 recognizing community-based natural resources and environmental management; and Maluku Province\u2019s Local Government Regulation No. 14/2005, which reinstated customary law. Access to basic services: Indigenous peoples traditionally live in remote forests or on marginal lands near plantations and mining industries, when they are forced out of their territories. These settlements lack basic services such as education, clean drinking water and sanitation, and health facilities. Indigenous peoples\u2019 health systems are hardly recognized by the state, while their participation in the formal health care systems is not meaningful. A lack of communication and transport linkages reduces livelihood opportunities. Almost 31 million or about 13.3 percent of Indonesians lived below the poverty line in 2010,54 defined in terms of income \u2013 Rp 192,354 (around US $20) in rural areas and Rp 232,989 (around US $25) in urban areas. There are about 20 million rural poor and 11 million urban poor people.55 Displacement from their lands has caused many poor indigenous peoples to move to urban areas. Specific data on the poverty of indigenous peoples is not available, but national statistics show that provinces rich in natural resources such as Kalimantan and Papua \u2013 which have the largest indigenous populations \u2013 are among the poorest. 24 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 Media and communication landscape: High penetration, low access and low participation Indonesia has among the most vibrant media and communication spaces in Asia-Pacific. National media have large audiences, but there are issues of access and participation for indigenous peoples, as well as continued violence against the media.56 Indonesia has a large number of local radio stations, including those run by indigenous organizations, but many are not licensed and are under-resourced, and could face closure if licensing laws were strictly enforced. Limits to free expression: Indonesia\u2019s Constitution guarantees freedom of expression in Article 28e, and Article 28f guarantees \u201cevery person the right to communicate and to obtain information\u2026to seek, to obtain, to possess, to keep, to process, and to convey information\u2026\u201d The Press Law (No. 40/1999) bars censorship, and the Soeharto era rule requiring all media to obtain permits (Surat Izin Usaha Penerbitan Pers) has been revoked. Nonetheless, there are at least 37 clauses in the Penal Code, two in the Pornography Law, one in the Freedom of Information Law, three in the Information and Electronic Transactions law and 10 in election laws that give the Government powers to imprison journalists. There have been some attempts to control Internet content. An old law allows the Attorney General to ban books with court permission. And the broadcasting law is not conducive for licensing and operating community radio stations. Freedom of information: Indonesia has an Open Access to Public Information Law (No. 14/2008) that took effect in April 2010. All information requests and denial disputes are adjudicated by the Central Information Commission, and two regional offices it established in 2010 in Central Java and East Java provinces. But accessing information remains difficult. According to the Forum for Budget Transparency, most of its requests for budget information from public agencies have been denied. It filed requests at 69 state institutions, of which 28 responded to the queries, and only 15 provided the requested information. Those providing information were 5 out of 34 ministries, among others.57 In August 2010, there were 22 complaints at the Central Information Commission.58 A draft State Secret Law could further restrict information access. Attacks on journalists: The Alliance of Independent Journalists Indonesia recorded 47 violent attacks against journalists in 2010, up from 37 in 2009. One journalist was killed while reporting a riot; it was not clear if other deaths were also work related. Violence against journalists has included physical attacks, intimidation and damage of property. Impunity for those attacking journalists has produced a climate of fear resulting in increased self-censorship.59 Media reach and coverage: Television has the highest penetration.

Even large media organizations have had no policies on terms to use in referring to indigenous peoples.62 Many journalists are unaware of the meaning of \u201cmasyarakat adat,\u201d the phrase indigenous peoples use to describe themselves.63 There is generally low coverage of the rights and demands of indigenous peoples, while violence does get reported.64 Community media: Indonesia has a vibrant, though illegal, radio movement, including community stations. Out of around 10,000 community broadcasters, only one has a permanent license, and about 500 have temporary licenses.65 Community media are expected to provide a platform for local expression and debate, while also informing, educating and entertaining audiences.66 But most local radio stations, especially those without licenses, generally avoid controversial issues, fearing closure by the Government, thereby often excluding content that could be highly relevant. There are some established media run by indigenous peoples, such as the Kalimantan Review, a magazine serving the Dayak peoples that was published because the commercial media did not adequately cover indigenous issues.67 Another indigenous group, the Ciptagelar Kasepuhan, has its own radio and television stations, with very basic, locally fabricated equipment. It has offered some local language programming, but mainly entertainment, and some programmes aimed at being informative (documentaries, current affairs, etc.), due to low capacity, among other factors. Indonesia has organizations that seek to promote community television. The Association of Community Television Indonesia (Asosiasi Televisi Komunitas Indonesia) has 29 members,68 but many do not have proper licenses. The Association of People Centred Television Indonesia has 10 members;69 most are licensed as local stations. Digital communication: Indonesia has the largest and fastest growing Internet market in South-east Asia. Recently, it had a more than two-fold increase in the penetration rate \u2013 from 22 percent in 2009 to 48 percent in 2010. Mobile phone penetration was 68 percent in 2009; phones are gaining ground as Internet access points. The Boston Consulting Group70 estimates that Indonesian Internet users will number 80 million in 2014, from around 43 million in 2010, but with only 5 percent of users accessing the Web on personal computers. Internet penetration in 2010 was about 17.8 users per 100 people, almost 70 percent of whom live in and around Jakarta. Access and use by indigenous peoples in rural areas is low. Indonesia has 7,602 Internet kiosks across the country. Only 0.3 percent of the population subscribes to broadband Internet, and only 5 percent of villages had Internet access in July 2010.71 In 2009, Indonesia had an estimated 16 fixed telephone lines per 100 people. Nationwide, 220,000 telephone kiosks provide services to people who cannot afford private lines. This infrastructure can be used to expand Internet reach in rural communities. 26 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 Main challenges and opportunities: Low access to media, limited capacity Challenges: Indonesia\u2019s large and dynamic media environment has not been particularly useful in serving the voice, participation and communication needs of indigenous and marginalized communities, particularly with respect to their rights to land and customary territories, self-rule, participation and free prior informed consent to decisions that affect them, although UNDRIP recognises these rights. The main challenges for indigenous peoples are low access to existing media \u2013 for financial and other reasons, including language \u2013 and limited capacities for producing media and sustaining media operations. This applies to both print and broadcast media. Even though Indonesia has some exemplary indigenous media, such as the Kalimantan Review, replicating such examples remains difficult. Indonesia also has successful community radio stations, but they face sustainability issues related to financing, and the ability to continuously produce and distribute content relevant to the communities they serve. Another major challenge involves generating informed debate in the mainstream media to build public support for the rights of indigenous peoples. This can be particularly difficult where the rights of indigenous communities conflict with the interests of big businesses that have government support and the financial clout to influence mass media. Challenges within the regulatory framework include those related to community broadcasting, complex licensing procedures and high fees that poor communities cannot pay.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68f09254-ef70-4783-bda9-1fa81f288094": {"__data__": {"id_": "68f09254-ef70-4783-bda9-1fa81f288094", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-voices-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Voices in Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-voices-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b42938d029a55298162e4151cf40b86b0799e3d9ab7c6e88d3604c25421a345"}}, "hash": "9b42938d029a55298162e4151cf40b86b0799e3d9ab7c6e88d3604c25421a345", "text": "Opportunities: Indonesia\u2019s expansive media environment affords opportunities for building sustainable networks for producing and sharing media among marginalized communities with common concerns and interests.

Some suggested interventions are: Legal and policy framework n Review laws and regulations to identify gaps in upholding indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, as defined in international conventions, and build an advocacy programme for change. n Design and implement an advocacy programme seeking government ratification of ILO Convention 169 and implementation of UNDRIP. Access to Information n Review broadcasting laws to identify and address gaps related to community media, and to make the regulatory framework more supportive. n Review provisions in the Penal Code and other media-related laws to identify interventions for change, including the decriminalization of media offenses. n Initiate support networks for indigenous media organizations for producing and sharing content. n Strengthen civil society monitoring in support of media freedoms. Community media and media content n Support networks for producing and sharing media content on indigenous issues on existing community media. n Strengthen advocacy on indigenous peoples\u2019 issues. n Support capacity development for journalists to enhance their understanding of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and issues. n Initiate content generation, using applicable new media platforms for sharing information among indigenous communities. 28 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 Lao PDRc Lao PDR is a one-party state. Authority is concentrated in the Lao People\u2019s Revolutionary Party, which took power in 1975. It asserts itself primarily through four institutions: the Government, military, bureaucracy and mass organizations. In 1986, the Government initiated the New Economic Mechanism, a process of reform and liberalization that abolished the socialist command economy, increased the role of market forces and encouraged foreign investment, while maintaining stability and political order. Ranking 133 on UNDP\u2019s global Human Development Index (2009), Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in Asia-Pacific, with limited physical infrastructure and high rural poverty. Public services do not extend to remote areas, leaving rural populations \u2013 largely ethnic minority groups \u2013 with inadequate access to health care and education. Context: Low access to development and basic services Lao PDR is diverse in geography, ethnicity and languages. Out of a population of 6.5 million people in 2009, ethnic or indigenous peoplesd made up approximately 44 percent. The 2000 census designated 47 ethnic groups (later increased to 49) with more than 160 sub-branches. Independent estimates, however, have suggested there are over 240 ethno-linguistic groups. One population, the Lao Loum (Lowland Lao), dominates culture, politics and the economy. Ethnic classification in Lao PDR is highly debated. The groups are very diverse in cultural and linguistic terms, as well as in their adaptive responses to the natural and social environment, and their livelihood systems. There are four major ethno-linguistic groups: Tai-Kadai, Mon-Khmer (Austroasiatic), Hmong-Mein and Tibeto-Burmese. They are officially referred to as \u201cethnic groups\u201d or \u201cethnic peoples,\u201d or by the name of the group to which they belong. Indigenous peoples in Lao PDR are marginalized and vulnerable, and largely excluded from mainstream development processes, including basic social services. One reason for their isolation is illiteracy, including in their own languages. Many ethnic peoples live in remote locations with poor or non-existent communication and transportation. A number of people who participated in the C4E study had rarely left their villages.

The 1992 Resolution of the Party Central Organization Concerning Ethnic Minority Affairs in the New Era is the basis of the policy on ethnic minorities. It emphasizes livelihood improvement and protection of the identities and cultures of ethnic peoples. The Lao People\u2019s Revolutionary Party\u2019s policy on ethnic peoples focuses on increasing solidarity among ethnic groups as members of the greater Lao family, improving their living conditions, expanding the heritage and identity of each group, and increasing their capacities to participate in state affairs. c Research conducted by Dr. Roger Harris, in collaboration with a national research team and UNDP Lao PDR d The preferred terminology in the context of Lao PDR is \u201cethnic\u201d, rather than indigenous. 29 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 The Lao Front for National Construction is the designated advisor to the central party committee on matters related to ethnic peoples. It is responsible for implementing programmes on ethnic peoples\u2019 affairs, including health, education and basic services, and for promoting cultural activities and participation in public life. The National Assembly has an Ethnic Affairs Committee. Lao PDR adopted UNDRIP in 2007 and is a party to most UN conventions on human rights,72 but not ILO Convention 169. A 2000 review by the ILO said that the country\u2019s ethnic minority policy \u201cis adequate and in accordance with the spirit of ILO Convention 169.\u201d Major development issues: Low literacy, high infant mortality and exclusion from development There are three main factors that influence development in Lao PDR, which are high ethnic diversity, a large rural population (approximately 77 percent), and a concentration of ethnic population in the rural areas. There is general recognition that many ethnic groups suffer unacceptable disadvantages in development, even though the Government generally favours \u201cnon-discriminatory\u201d approaches, and comparisons along ethnic lines are discouraged. As a consequence, while national laws and policies acknowledge the presence of multiple ethnicities, the development process has not been very successful in promoting inclusive participation. Fallout from ethnic divisions and insurgency during decades of armed conflict in Lao PDR continue to resonate today. Although the level of disaggregated data is improving, it is still insufficient to support adequate analysis and policy formulation, particularly with regard to ethnicity. Studies have shown that rates of literacy, infant mortality, immunization, and HIV and AIDS awareness are worse among the smaller ethnic groups than among the Lao Loum people. Ethnic groups are among the poorest people in the country. Meaningful participation: Political participation is possible through the Party, the Army, the Government and mass organizations, but Lao PDR continues to be a highly centralized state. Currently, a woman is the sole ethnic minority in the nine-member Politburo. NGO registration began in 2011, but they are still in the very early stages of development, and few are devoted specifically to ethnic issues. A 2009 Decree on Associations requires applicants for registration to have a supporting document from relevant government sectors before they can apply. Attempts to set up cultural and historical associations failed to receive permission from the Ministry of Information and Culture, presumably because these groups were potentially political.73 Ethnic groups lack opportunities for meaningful participation in policy processes and decision-making due to the high degree of centralization and narrow representation in governance institutions. As a result, the issues affecting ethnic communities, including their views and interests, are not equally represented at the national level. Land rights: Recognition of land and natural resource rights is critical for indigenous peoples. Many have been relocated from their traditional homelands to \u201cmore accessible\u201d areas. The government policy of resettling ethnic communities from the highlands to the 30 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 lowland and along roads has resulted in serious problems. Nevertheless, some internal resettlement is still continuing, and more is planned. The National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy points out that ethnicity and vulnerability are directly related, as certain ethnic groups have limited assets and mechanisms to manage them. Regional disparities: There are wide regional disparities in farming systems and socioeconomic patterns. Most poor districts are mountainous, with a high proportion of ethnic peoples. Their farming systems do not produce marketable surpluses, and they are isolated from the national economy and have limited social service infrastructure. Despite these challenges, ethnic diversity has been increasingly recognized as a strength. Ethnic knowledge has an intrinsic value for the development of Lao PDR, particularly with regard to environmental sustainability and natural resource conservation. Different ethnic groups are known to have specific skills, such as, for example, the Tai Dam specialize in silk farming; the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f063458-b21e-477f-848f-0fbf1787eba9": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f063458-b21e-477f-848f-0fbf1787eba9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-voices-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Voices in Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-voices-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a0dca7c3f41743666770694eaa43dbacb9ffa9869171bf39afeb907fd5818be5"}}, "hash": "a0dca7c3f41743666770694eaa43dbacb9ffa9869171bf39afeb907fd5818be5", "text": "Hmong have vast knowledge of cattle raising; the Khmou have a remarkable understanding of forests; and the Akha are experts in herbal medicines. Education and health: The net enrolment rate for primary schools in Lao PDR was about 86 percent in 2007, but ethnic peoples have lower net enrolment rates, and higher dropout and repetition rates compared to other citizens. About 15 percent of villages have no primary schools, and many existing schools do not have all five grades. Expansion of education in isolated, ethnic and highland areas is very slow, hindered by a shortage of both qualified teachers and schooling materials. Children may be kept out of school\u2013including many girls\u2013because families cannot afford schooling or need children to help out at home. Language is a serious barrier to enrolment. Ethnic groups have limited access to health services, and quality is often poor. For many ethnic groups, their remote location is a barrier to reaching health services, and they face further impoverishment due to the shortage of essential medicine and health workers. Many ethnic peoples still rely on shamans for cures. Media and communication landscape: Limited independent voice The media in Lao PDR is largely government-owned and managed. Some recent changes have widened the communication space, with more information available through Internet caf\u00e9s, mobile phones, and satellite and cable TV broadcasting networks. But these new information sources are concentrated in urban areas. Outside national radio, rural populations, including ethnic peoples, lack access to information. This stems from limited media outreach in their languages, and a lack of infrastructure and resources. Print media circulation is small, with a largely elite, urban readership. Radio is one of the most influential media \u2013 over 80 percent of the population has access to radio. There are 32 radio stations, with Lao National Radio the main service provider. Other regional and provincial stations do not reach all districts, especially remote communities. Although there are some local programmes in major ethnic languages, they do not necessarily respond to the information or communication needs of people in rural areas. Television access is limited to urban areas; Thai TV has sizeable audiences. 31 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 Despite the restrictive communication environment, Lao PDR has some innovative community media projects. One is the UNDP-supported Khoun Community Radio, which began broadcasting in October 2007. The station has received tremendous feedback from listeners, including through letters, phone calls, and hundreds of poems and community announcements, primarily in ethnic languages. Media policy and regulations: Media in Lao PDR have a role in promoting public policies and enhancing national unity. Diversity has begun to appear as an issue, particularly with the growing openness in the Government. The overall framework for the governance reform agenda in Lao PDR, the Policy Paper of the Government of Lao PDR on Government Issues, recognizes that access to information and professional media are critical for improving accountability and transparency in governance. The creation of \u201cfora to permit a participatory debate on transparent and accountable government and the promotion of ethics in the public service, involving participants from civil society, the media and the private sector\u201d is mentioned as a priority governance initiative.74 In 2005, the Ministry of Information and Culture adopted a strategy to bring radio to the 47 poorest districts. Despite such developments, Lao PDR still ranks low on the accountability and public voice index of Freedom House,75 however, indicating a restrictive environment. Mass media law: The 1991 Constitution is the basic legal framework for developing participatory media practices. The National Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006-2010 provided a basis for collaboration with the Government in designing and implementing interactive development-oriented media channels. The plan also committed to assisting ethnic peoples in accessing information, and recognized the need for media in applicable languages. The Government adopted a media law in 2008 that specifies \u201cthe roles, principles, responsibilities, duties and activities\u201d of media. It provides journalists with a formal mandate and protection to report on and criticize corruption, low morals and drug abuse. It also allows private ownership of media. While the Government retains the authority to monitor, audit and discipline journalists and media outlets for misconduct, media are becoming more assertive and active in scrutinizing government activities, including implementation of the annual budget. Former taboos, previously referred to as \u201cnegative social phenomena\u201d (for example, illegal logging, land concessions and corruption) are increasingly debated in public media. Media capacity: Despite positive trends, media in Lao PDR still face serious resource and capacity constraints in delivering quality information, particularly in provinces and districts.

Government control, a top-down approach among editors and media managers, and limited journalism skills are major obstacles hindering media from empowering wider audiences. Access to media: Media access is generally low, and lower for rural residents and ethnic peoples. They feel that they are generally unable to respond to anything they see or hear in the media. All types of media could serve ethnic issues better, but, given the varying levels of access to different media, radio is the most promising format. Ethnic 32 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 peoples have urgent needs for more information, particularly on education, health care, sanitation, agriculture, natural resource management, pest control, animal husbandry, enterprise development (for women), family planning and irrigation. They also want more local news and ethnically specific entertainment. Ethnic peoples in the media: Mainstream media reporting predominantly focuses on events and issues in the national capital. Though print media have done some investigative reporting, according to Lao journalists, there is very limited coverage of issues concerning ethnic peoples. Media reporting mostly targets the information needs of government officials and urban elites, who are the main audiences and subscribers. Lao National Radio is an exception because it has ethnic language windows that enjoy considerable popularity. They are in essence translations of mainstream programming, however; resources for community-based programming are still very scarce. Digital communication: Lao PDR has a relatively advanced backbone infrastructure for ICT that could provide opportunities for extending communication outreach in remote rural areas. Still, the country faces numerous challenges in expanding ICT and telecommunication services, particularly in remote rural areas. Few Laotians have access to computers or the Internet, and less than two percent of households had a fixed telephone when the assessment was done. The use of mobile phones has been expanding rapidly since 2000, but only 12.8 percent of Laotians had a mobile phone by 2007-2008. At least 15 out of 17 provinces are connected via optical fibre, but existing services have little relevance to rural populations, including ethnic groups, mainly because applications useful for remote rural users have not been developed. Lao PDR has had Internet connectivity since 1996, but use remains low, although it is increasing. Most young Laotians and students access the Internet at caf\u00e9s, which are mostly located in the major cities. Compared to the mass media, the Internet is still relatively unregulated. The Government monitors emails, and \u201crequests\u201d Internet service providers to submit quarterly reports and connect to governmental gateways to accommodate the monitoring system, but its ability to control Internet information and communication flows remains limited. The National Authority of Science and Technology, set up in 2007 under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office,76 is in charge of long-term policies and plans for telecommunication and ICT. Its functions include overseeing and coordinating radio licenses. Lao PDR has developed an ICT Master Plan. There are emerging opportunities for using ICT to facilitate horizontal communication and community empowerment, including some ICT initiatives in remote rural areas. The Jhai Foundation, for example, launched a pilot project to establish Internet learning centres and the Remote IT Villages project, where a computer runs on pedal power and Internet access is via satellite. This project primarily focused on bringing the Internet to the poor and ICT training, as opposed to applying ICT to accelerate development. One Jhai Foundation initiative used the Internet for linking coffee farmers with business opportunities abroad. \u201cThere are emerging opportunities for using ICT to facilitate horizontal communication and community empowerment.\u201d 33 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 Main challenges and opportunities: Low coverage of ethnic issues Challenges: Widening the space for communication remains challenging in Lao PDR, which has a major impact on using media for empowering indigenous peoples. There are serious gaps in information and media content for ethnic groups, with the low representation of ethnic issues and the quality of coverage limited. A few media reach ethnic populations; fewer have content in indigenous languages. Much of the \u201cinformation poverty\u201d observed in the C4E assessment could be alleviated by focusing media content on unreached audiences. Radio remains the single most important contact that many people have with the rest of the world, and is a trusted source of information. But it currently does not allow two-way communication or enable ethnic peoples to express their voices. Other types of media have little presence in rural villages. Among villagers, word-of-mouth remains the main form of communication. Despite positive changes in the overall media landscape, new information and communication channels are largely concentrated in larger cities.

Opportunities: New legal provisions for registering NGOs, a new media law and the launch of a number of participatory communication initiatives are signs that communication opportunities are beginning to open up. Efforts to expand these are vital for enabling ethnic peoples to use and participate in the media. Lao PDR\u2019s relatively advanced backbone of ICT infrastructure provides opportunities for extending communication outreach in remote rural areas. With more relevant content and applications, new media and networked communication, including through mobile telephones, can help bring about greater inclusion of ethnic peoples. Community radio could be an effective medium of communication, especially among people with limited literacy skills. It could also help promote access to information in remote rural areas through the integration of traditional and new media in new community-based, interactive radio programmes. The young urban generation of Lao PDR have the potential to drive the ICT development due to their experiences with new technologies and their increasing exposure to information from other countries, such as Thailand, and the Laotian Diaspora. Lao PDR can benefit greatly from this presently underused human resource base by supporting youth, including ethnic youth in rural and remote areas, to attain better ICT access and become more involved in media.

Efforts are underway to address inequalities of traditional social and political order based on high caste dominance with a more socially inclusive democratic system. The political changes have widened space for communication, making it possible for various excluded groups, including indigenous peoples, to assert their demands. Nepal\u2019s population comprises caste-stratified Hindus with an Indo-Aryan language, and indigenous peoples, many of whom speak Tibeto-Burman languages.79 Among the different caste or ethnic identities, some were historically prescribed by the state. Nepal\u2019s indigenous peoples began demanding recognition of their own identities in the early 1990s. The 2001 Census reported about 100 caste, ethnic and religious groups.

The proposal approved by the State Restructuring and Distribution of Power Committee of the Constituent Assembly recommends having 14 federal units delineated on the basis of identity and capability.84 The indigenous peoples believe identity-based federal provinces and autonomous areas will guarantee them their rights in accordance with two UN instruments, ILO Convention 169 and UNDRIP. Some indigenous groups have even resorted to violent activities to press their demands for a federal unit of their own. This is an issue that has to be settled as part of the Constitution drafting process. Legal and regulatory framework: Nepal\u2019s interim Constitution of 2007 commits to establishing a federal state. While this basic principle is widely accepted, the demarcation e Research conducted by Dr. Chaitnya Subba and the Association of Nepalese Indigenous Journalists (ANIJ). 36 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 of autonomous units/provinces remains complicated by the conflicting claims and ideological perspectives of different groups.85 Nepal became a secular state in 2007, and since then, one of the changes that have been introduced is the abolition of the state\u2019s single language policy, though it retains Nepali as the official language of the central Government. The use of local languages in local government offices is permitted, and education in the various indigenous mother tongues are supported. Affirmative action for excluded groups, including indigenous peoples, was established in government services, and the representation of indigenous peoples in proportion to their population in the Constituent Assembly was guaranteed.86 The Civil Service Act (2007) and the Constituent Assembly Member Election Act (2007) spell out reservations for excluded groups in the civil service and Parliament.87 Forty- five percent of vacant positions in the civil service have been reserved for competition between candidates from excluded groups, including women, with certain seats reserved for each group. Twenty-seven percent of those positions have been reserved for candidates from indigenous communities. Otherwise, the representation of indigenous peoples in public offices has been very low. 88 Civil service records of 2006 showed that indigenous peoples other than the Newar made up just 3.3 percent of all officer- level employees. Major development issues: Equal access to basic rights Education and health: There are large disparities in literacy between dominant groups and indigenous peoples, and also among the indigenous peoples. Even though most groups have access to primary schools, most children cannot learn in their mother tongues, though the Government has begun making that facility available at some schools. One community where the C4E field study was undertaken was very dissatisfied with the Government\u2019s inability to appoint local language teachers despite their demands. Illiteracy is very high for some indigenous peoples, particularly the Santhal, Jhangad and Kusbadiya at 73 percent. The Newar and Thakali have the highest literacy rates among indigenous groups. The literacy of 10 groups is above the national average of 53.7 percent.94 Access to higher education is more restricted for indigenous peoples. The proportion of high-caste people with bachelor\u2019s degrees was 3.62 percent, seven times higher than that of indigenous peoples at 0.49 percent, outside the Newar and Thakali. Substantial health gaps exist along the lines of gender, caste and ethnicity. Access to health care and child nutrition tends to worsen among excluded groups. The under-five mortality rate among groups such as the Gurung, Rai, Limbu, Magar and Tamang is about 133 per 1,000 live births, which his higher than the national average of 105 per 1,000 live births.95 Social and political exclusion: Nepal\u2019s indigenous cultures have eroded under rules imposed by dominant groups. The Country Code of 1854 transformed Nepali society into a hierarchical structure of high-, medium- and low-status groups. The caste system was formally abolished in 1963, but it remains in practice, and it has had a profound 37 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 impact on the socialization and development of indigenous peoples. They began debating political exclusion in the early 1990s, when they started seeking greater voice and participation in state affairs. Many individuals from these communities also joined the Maoists,96 who first came up with the idea of establishing ethnic federations.97 The political environment after 2006 resulted in the formulation of the Three-Year Interim Plan, with separate sections and quantifiable indicators for the advancement of excluded groups. The social and political transformation underway in Nepal provides a unique opportunity for empowering and mobilizing indigenous peoples. The 218 representatives from indigenous groups (the highest number ever) in the 601-member Constituent Assembly have an informal caucus for lobbying for their rights.

Media and communication landscape: Low access to content production and relevant information In March 2009, Nepal had 5,258 registered newspapers and periodicals.99 Of these, 2,601 were registered at the Press Council Nepal, but only 754 were actually published, and only 553 came out regularly. Most of these publications were weeklies supporting a given political party. The broadcast media comprised 323 licensed FM radio stations and 12 television channels in July 2009. Among the FM stations, 195 claimed to be community radios concerns, of which over 160 were broadcasting. These included stations owned and operated by NGOs, cooperatives and local government bodies.100 Nepal also has state-run radio, television and newspapers. There is no independent regulation of broadcasting. Freedom of expression and media: Nepal has basic guarantees for freedom of expression and media rights. However, given the complex political transition underway, together with a weak state, the environment is not conducive to free media. Impunity for perpetrators of violence is a major challenge. The interim Constitution, which will remain in effect until a new one is promulgated, guarantees both media freedoms and freedom of expression,101 but also includes vaguely defined restrictions. Right to information: The right to Information is guaranteed by the Constitution. Nepal also has a right-to-information law, although with some inadequacies.102 Nepal\u2019s Information Commission was established in 2008 and can require public officials to provide requested information. None of its decisions until early 2010 were related to demands for information in indigenous peoples\u2019 languages.103 Attacks on journalists: At least five journalists have been killed or have disappeared since April 2006. In most cases, the alleged attackers were close to or affiliated with political parties or newly formed armed groups. The cases have not been thoroughly investigated, and the main suspects have not been punished. Trade unions supported by the Maoists have resorted to industrial actions resulting in closure and disruption of media services.104 Nepal ranked eighth in terms of countries with the most dangerous workplaces for journalists in 2008.105 \u201cOver 30 radio stations have programming in the languages of indigenous peoples.\u201d 38 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 Community media: Nepal\u2019s community radio movement has served as a model for local broadcasting in South Asia. There are many FM stations run by indigenous peoples.106 Communities surveyed for the C4E assessment found these more responsive to their information needs, but they also suggested the need for improvements in programming and content. Media ownership: Nepal has no restrictions on media ownership by citizens. Generally, media remain controlled by members of dominant social groups \u2013 not necessarily in terms of ownership, but in terms of control of content production.107 Nepali is the language of most media. There are a few journalists from indigenous groups in the mainstream media, and while various individuals from indigenous groups own and run media, only a few of these companies have been commercially successful. Some indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations publish newspapers and newsletters in their mother tongues. According to people interviewed for the C4E assessment, media owned by members of indigenous communities have been more open to covering their events, demands and concerns. But these media are also often accused of taking sides, a practice that reduces their professional image and credibility. Access to media: Most of Nepal\u2019s media are based in the capital city and other urban centres, although radio, especially FM, reaches large parts of the country. The language used \u2013 mainly Nepali \u2013 remains a barrier for many indigenous peoples, especially the elderly. Over 30 radio stations have programming in the languages of indigenous peoples. But most of this content is either on the air outside prime listening hours or comprises musical programmes. Government-run Radio Nepal broadcasts news in 20 languages other than Nepali. A local station in Tehrathum District not only has considerable local programming, but also a programme to teach listeners the local language. Nepal Television has some indigenous language programmes, but no newscasts. Gorkhapatra, a state-run Nepali language daily, has been publishing a two-page supplement in 26 indigenous languages (one language a day) since 2006.108 But its reach is limited \u2013 it could not be found in the villages where the field research for the C4E assessment was done. In one field study location in Kailali District, Indian TV stations were more readily available than Nepali channels.

The Indigenous Film Archive was established in November 2006 to promote films by indigenous filmmakers, and on indigenous cultures, cultural practices, knowledge, skills and values. Many donors have backed media development in Nepal, but their support has not been focussed on the capacity development of candidates from excluded communities, including indigenous peoples. \u201cNepal\u2019s community radio movement has served as a model for local broadcasting in South Asia.\u201d 39 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 Indigenous peoples in the media: Generally, the coverage of indigenous issues is limited and shallow, largely focusing on events, lifestyles, entertainment etc. There have been opinion pieces in the mainstream media that have discussed issues related to ethnic self-rule, the right to self-determination, types of self-rule (unitary or federal), etc. But overall coverage remains low,109 as confirmed by a brief content study for the C4E assessment. Digital communication: Nepal has a growing mobile network, and some advances have been made in the use of the Internet, including 3G systems. The access of indigenous peoples is limited, however, because most services are centred in urban areas and expensive. In mid-July 2009, the Government said CDMA mobile110 coverage had been extended to all 75 districts of the country, and GSM mobile coverage to 72 districts.111 The telephone penetration rate \u2013 both fixed-line and mobile \u2013 was 26.7 percent in December 2009.112 There were about 700,000 Internet users. Nepal has a High-Level Commission for Information Technology and an IT policy and strategy. It has made efforts to use ICT for rural communication with limited success. Main challenges and opportunities: Low access and low participation Challenges: Nepal is formulating new laws and building new state institutions whose structures will be clear only after the new Constitution is promulgated. A key challenge is to ensure that the new Constitution and laws will protect and expand democratic space, which is vital for empowering indigenous people and other excluded groups. Their minimal representation in the media and low capacities have affected their ability to influence content. As a result, coverage of indigenous issues in the media remains limited and superficial. Access to media is a major issue in indigenous villages, compounded by the fact that there is little content in local languages. FM radio has reached many districts, but a few do not have local stations. Stations operate with meagre resources and largely untrained staff. Government-owned media have more content in indigenous languages than privately run media, with some exceptions (like a Tharu language radio station in Bardia and the radio station in Tehrathum). But generally, for both public and private media, indigenous communities have little influence on the content. Otherwise, the reach of local language publications is limited, as is the use of new media and ICT. Despite relative openness, Nepal\u2019s democratic space has been shrinking owing to a weak state and increasing lawlessness. Attacks on the media have increased, leading to greater self-censorship, and restrictions on open debate. Opportunities: Drafting the Constitution provides possibilities for advocating measures for protecting and widening democratic space to empower excluded groups and indigenous peoples. There are opportunities for increasing the representation of \u201cThe media can assist this dialogue towards the settlement of claims, and the establishment of democracy and lasting peace.\u201d 40 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 journalists from indigenous communities in the media through targeted capacity- building interventions. Qualified and trained journalists will have easier access to jobs, and once inside different media outlets, they will have more influence on content. Nepal has a basic fibre optic backbone and plans to connect all districts in five years. This network provides opportunities for high-speed data and information exchanges. It could become a platform for media convergence and networking among FM stations to share programmes. Linking community information centres with FM stations in many districts could create space for people to interact and participate. Within the existing community radio network in Nepal, one initiative could focus on local language programming and exchanges between different stations (due to migration, there are a few areas where only one language is spoken and understood). There are also opportunities for selecting FM stations with indigenous ownership and developing them as model community radios stations113 for replication. In areas where television is accessible, it has large audiences. Producing content in local languages for special audiences could entail the participation of indigenous producers.

Yet except for a few groups, they lag behind others in terms of poverty outcomes and other development indicators. The political transformation in Nepal provides opportunities for improving the situation of indigenous peoples, and other excluded groups.

Such a fund could also aid pilot initiatives to develop innovative programmes for community media, particularly radio. Knowledge creation and sharing n Promote greater understanding of the claims and demands of indigenous peoples to avoid misrepresentations and misinterpretations, and to bridge conflicting ideas among indigenous peoples, the general public and policy makers on the benefits and challenges of federalism. n Support the production and dissemination of knowledge on indigenous peoples, as well as their claims and demands, to improve media coverage, and support indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations in building capacities for interacting with the media, and for media management. n Focus awareness programmes on youth from indigenous communities and other groups, and encourage them to participate in discussions on indigenous issues. Undertake media literacy initiatives to prepare indigenous groups for better understanding the media. Capacity-building of indigenous peoples n Support training programmes (basic, mid-career and specialization) for journalists from indigenous groups, particularly women, to prepare them to seek and obtain media jobs.

Poverty remains its main development challenge. This is manifested and even exacerbated by the long-running insurgency waged by the Communist New People\u2019s Army in many parts of the country and the simmering secessionist movement in Mindanao. These conflicts have serious implications for the estimated 14 million to 17 million115 people belonging to indigenous groups. Most are concentrated in the rugged upland areas of the Cordillera Administrative Region in North Luzon (33 percent) and in many of the remote regions of Mindanao (61 percent). They are organized in various national, regional and local coalitions. The largest national group, the Koalisyon ng Katutubong Samahan ng Pilipinas (Coalition of Indigenous Alliance of the Philippines), comprises more than 15 regional organizations throughout the country. Context: Efforts underway to recognize indigenous rights Indigenous groups can be referred to by their ethnicity or tribal origin \u2013 such as Tausug or Maranao in Mindanao, or Igorot in Cordillera in Northern Luzon. In Mindanao, indigenous peoples are also loosely referred to as lumad, meaning people of the land. The media generally use the term \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d to refer to them in news stories, but sometimes resort to identifying them by their ethnic origin when reporting tribal feuds. Some of the key issues raised by indigenous peoples\u2019 groups and their organizations are: the self-delineation of ancestral domains, sustainable development planning for these domains, indigenous peoples-led advocacy for recognition of traditional justice systems, establishment of pilot prototype tribal barangays (villages) and support to community-initiated projects on cultural integrity.

The Constitution recognizes the country\u2019s cultural diversity, and the need for the state to recognize, protect, promote and fulfil the rights of indigenous peoples. The 1997 Indigenous Peoples Rights Act, otherwise known as Republic Act 8371, recognizes and promotes: the human rights of indigenous cultural communities; their rights to their ancestral domains to ensure their economic, social and cultural well-being; the applicability of customary laws governing property rights or relations in determining the ownership and extent of ancestral domain; their rights to preserve and develop their cultures, traditions and institutions; and their \u201cmaximum\u201d participation in education, health and other services so these are responsive to their needs and desires.117 f Research conducted by Red Batario, A. Alvarex, J. Benitez, Y. Arquiza and R. Dela Paz. 43 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act and its regulations and guidelines have specific procedures for seeking the free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous peoples. Communities and indigenous advocates said that the 2006 guidelines on free, prior, and informed consent issued by the National Commission for Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), which requires the process to be completed within 70 working days, is a watered- down version to suit business interests, particularly in mining. There are concerns that asking for the process to be expedited could risk bypassing traditional consultation and consensus-building approaches. In October 2010, the Government issued a policy on the representation and participation of indigenous peoples in local legislative councils. The Department of Interior and Local Government circular requires \u201cMandatory representation of Indigenous Peoples in Policy-Making Bodies and other Legislative Councils.\u201d118 Implementation by different state agencies, especially consultations with indigenous peoples\u2019 groups, has been lacking or shallow. Their representation in local development councils is poor, and even where they are represented, their participation in discussions has been marginal. This is due to limits on their confidence and capacity to engage, especially when meetings take place in a language that is not their own. Major development issues: Loss of ancestral domains, environmental degradation Traditionally and historically, indigenous peoples in the Philippines have largely been excluded from economic benefits and political processes. They have faced discrimination, ancestral domain loss, dilution of culture and identity, and environmental degradation. Another key issue is the encroachment that has resulted from the dominant, mainstream approach to development and modernization, which indigenous peoples\u2019 groups in the Philippines referred to as \u201cdevelopment aggression\u201d as early as the 1980s. This was a reference to \u201cmodernization\u201d projects that ignored indigenous views and consent. Land rights: For indigenous peoples, land rights are rooted in customary concepts and practices of collective land use and ownership that predate the Spanish colonization of the Philippines. This remains a major development issue for indigenous peoples, since their ability to use their ancestral domains is hindered by conflicting laws or laws favouring commercial interests. Mining and logging concessions, for instance, have encroached on ancestral lands abetted in part by laws that contradict the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act, such as the Mining Act. Indigenous peoples say that their right to free prior informed consent, a provision of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act, has often been manipulated to favour powerful business and political interests. Participation in local governance: Even though a number of indigenous representatives have been elected to public office or are holding key government positions, their participation in local governance is low. Some groups, especially from Northern Luzon, have long held elected local positions at the regional, provincial, municipal, city and barangay levels, but representation in general is still limited. Informally, communities still turn to traditional leaders as well as elected barangay leaders to address or resolve problems. Barangay officials conduct public consultations on government projects, followed by another set of consultations among tribal elders and leaders. Indigenous communities wish to preserve and promote their cultural traditions and strengthen indigenous governance systems to assert their autonomy and lessen their dependence on politicians. \u201cThe Philippines media is said to be among the freest in Asia-Pacific, with adequate guarantees for freedom of speech and the press.\u201d 44 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 Education and health: Access to basic services is low because indigenous communities are often isolated.

Some key demands of indigenous peoples with regard to education are the right to select teachers and involve families in determining the school calendar and curricula, and to oversee school management, including the removal of teachers who are unable to serve the community\u2019s educational and cultural interests. Participants in interviews for the C4E assessment said that health centres are located away from their villages, and they face constraints in paying for transport. Many groups resort to using traditional herbs instead of modern medicines. Media and communication landscape: No guarantees to official information In 2007, metro Manila had 30 dailies: 12 broadsheets in English and three in Chinese, and 18 tabloids. Radio broadcasts reach 98 percent of the population. According to the National Telecommunications Commission, in 2007, there were 993 radio stations nationwide. Household TV ownership in metro Manila as reported by 4As Media Factbook 2004 was 94 percent, with Luzon at 77 percent, Visayas at 86 percent and Mindanao at 83 percent. Freedom of expression: The Philippines media is said to be among the freest in Asia- Pacific, with adequate guarantees for freedom of speech and the press. The country has laws and regulations on radio broadcasting; Congress approves franchises, after which licenses are issued. The Philippines also has a mix of private, community and state- run media. Right to information: The Philippines does not have a Right to Information Act. Article III, Section 4 of the Constitution guarantees the right to information on matters of public concern. It says access \u201cto official records, and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions or decisions, as well as to government research data used as a basis for policy development, shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitation as may be provided by law.\u201d Both the Constitution and the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (Section 45) guarantee all citizens the right to access official information and government records. There is a clause related to the NCIP that says, \u201call official records, documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions or decisions, as well as research data used as a basis for policy development of the Commission shall be made accessible to the public.\u201d However, the absence of uniform, simple and speedy access to information presents serious problems, however, especially for indigenous peoples. In principle, all citizens have a right to appeal the denial of access to government records, but since there is no uniform process for access, no penalties are meted out to offenders. The proposed Freedom of Information Bill seeks to address these gaps and introduce stringent penalties for denial of information. But Congress has not yet approved the bill. 45 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 Another challenge is that most government information and communication are in English, except at the local level, where there is information either in Tagalog or Binisaya, two other major languages. The proposed Freedom of Information Bill contains a provision on the Promotion of Openness in Government (Section 14) that covers accessibility of language and form. It requires every government agency to \u201cendeavour to translate key information into major Filipino language and present them in popular forms and means.\u201d Freedom of the press: The Bill of Rights in the Constitution guarantees press freedom. Article III (8) says, \u201cNo law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\u2026\u201d. However, there is a pending legislation in Congress called the Right of Reply Bill which has provisions that will impose restraints. Though the Constitution guarantees a plurality of voices, there is no specific law that ensures that the media will reflect indigenous issues and cultures. There are no restrictions on ownership of media by citizens. Attacks on media: The Philippines has among the highest reported cases of killings of journalists. The Government has not thoroughly investigated all cases, and in some instances, it has been accused of harassing and putting journalists under surveillance. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, the Philippines ranks third among countries on its Impunity Index, \u201creflecting one of the world\u2019s worst records in solving press murders.\u201d The worst attack to date is the murder of 32 journalists and media workers in Maguindanao province in 2009 (Freedom House put the number at 27). According to the Freedom House annual survey of press freedom, the Philippines has experienced a continuous decline in freedoms since 2004, when it was dropped from its \u201cfree\u201d to \u201cpartly free\u201d ranking. Access to media: Only indigenous peoples\u2019 groups located near urban areas have access to all forms of media.

Several local stations and newspapers have some reporters and editors from indigenous groups, but staffing is still skewed in favour of non-indigenous journalists. Radio is most accessible to indigenous peoples. About 60 percent of the people in indigenous communities interviewed for the C4E assessment owned radio sets, while only a very small percentage owned TV sets. Mobile phone ownership is increasing in some indigenous communities, such as in Palawan, but the cost has remained prohibitive for others, including groups in North and South Upi in Mindanao. Movie screenings are often held in communities. Many indigenous communities still rely on word-of-mouth for communication and for making collective decisions. Alternative media are run by NGOs and church-based groups. In North and South Upi, for example, indigenous communities rely on news stories generated by the media cooperative MindaNews, which faces major resource shortages. Indigenous people in media: The mainstream media, especially those based in Manila, often carry news about indigenous peoples. These reports typically appear in the context of conflicts over land, feuds, environmental degradation, mining exploration and extraction, or the building of dams in tribal areas. Articles on indigenous peoples\u2019 rights 46 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 and demands are rare, and existing coverage of indigenous peoples\u2019 issues, especially land rights, is below the expectations of indigenous peoples. Many people interviewed for the assessment said journalists do not understand the issues well enough to be able to report on them. Community media: The Philippines has a long history of community media, dating back to the \u201cguerrilla radio\u201d that appeared during its war with Japan, the \u201cmimeo press\u201d that came with the well-known lines ipa-kopya at i-pasa (copy and pass it on) and the \u201cblackboard newspaper,\u201d among others.119 Present day community newspapers and radio programmes, such as those in Palawan and Upi, usually carry regular stories about indigenous peoples. But only a few broadcast programmes specifically cater to these groups. Community media tend to cover indigenous peoples in places only where reporters can easily reach them. It is difficult for communities of indigenous peoples to set up broadcast stations due to the costs and limited abilities to secure franchises. The DXUP Peace Radio in Upi with programming in the Teduray language and the long-running Midland Courier in the Cordillera published in the Ibaloy and Ilocano languages are two examples of indigenous community news media. Digital communication: Government ICT regulations are fairly free, and the National Telecommunications Commission has been quite liberal. The Commission on Information and Communications Technology has been working to provide universal access to information and communication services through 755 community e-centres. The services include basic Internet access, business services, and hands-on computer literacy and skills development trainings. Data on the use of these services by indigenous peoples were not available. Republic Act 8792 or the e-Commerce Act recognizes the role of ICT in nation-building and giving voice to citizens. A proposed Department of Information and Communication Technology Bill that seeks to promote fairness and private sector participation is still pending in Congress. The Medium Term Philippine Development Plan (2004-2010) considers ICT a driver of growth and participation. Three major telecommunication companies offer competitive wireless broadband rates. Urban residents enjoy both affordable and easy access to information sharing through various technologies. But many remote localities do not have electricity for accessing these services. The Philippines had 32.5 million mobile phone subscribers in 2008 and non-voice services, such as SMS, accounted for approximately 40 percent of mobile carrier revenues. Indigenous peoples have access to both Internet and mobile telephones mainly in areas near urban centres. Main challenges and opportunities: Safety of journalists, high impunity Challenges: Despite having one of the freest spaces for communication in Asia-Pacific, the Philippines also faces very high impunity for people who have attacked journalists and media freedoms. This creates a climate of fear that can dampen initiatives for setting up media to enhance voice and participation, including for indigenous peoples. 47 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 The Freedom of Information Bill has been languishing in Congress for more than 12 years. Even though it does not have specific provisions on improving access for indigenous peoples, it could provide a basis for all citizens, including journalists, to obtain information they need. While radio remains the media format with the widest reach, most stations do not carry content in indigenous languages, except for DXUP radio in Upi, which broadcasts in Teduray, Visayan and English.

Television is still centred on urban areas. Programming often excludes content relevant to indigenous peoples, except for the occasional special report or stories on mining controversies and conflict. This is also true for state-run broadcasters. Print media have the lowest reach among indigenous communities, with exceptions such as Baguio City, which has a number of community papers with large local readerships. For the most part, high illiteracy rates among indigenous peoples exclude them from accessing written information and news. They therefore rely on radio, storytelling by elders and word-of-mouth for obtaining information. Indigenous peoples have limited capacities to produce content, manage their own media and access media jobs. Opportunities: Indigenous peoples are interested in establishing their own media, preferably radio stations, as means to voice their concerns related to development and political participation. There are opportunities to initiate pilot initiatives, particularly with the Teduray-Lambangian people in Mindanao, and to a lesser extent, with the Tagbanua of Palawan, who articulated this need. An attempt to establish local radio stations has to be accompanied by capacity-building in content production and management. The same applies to helping indigenous communities in increasing their representation and voice in mainstream media. While radio remains the media of choice in remote areas, there are opportunities for using ICT and digital communication where services are available. Indigenous peoples in the Philippines maintain collective decision-making practices to articulate local demands and communicate relevant information. These could be geared toward collective ownership of community media, particularly radio, and toward sustainable production and management systems. Some NGOs run by indigenous peoples have produced videos in the Tagalog and Visayan languages on the opposition to mining and logging activities by different groups. They organize public screenings and discussions in local communities. This process could advance through the translation of videos into local languages and more frequent screenings. Tribal councils could be mobilized around this activity. \u201cIndigenous peoples are interested in establishing their own media, preferably radio stations, as means to voice their concerns related to development and political participation.\u201d 48 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 Major recommendations Proposed steps comprise the following: Democratic space n Monitor and report on attacks on journalists and media, and advocate for an end to impunity for perpetrators to prevent democratic space from shrinking further n Undertake a strong and focused advocacy campaign for galvanizing public support to pass the Freedom of Information Bill and stop the Right of Reply Bill. n Initiate advocacy for simplifying licensing and franchising requirements for community radio locally, nationally and internationally, using AMARC\u2019s good offices for sustaining the campaign. Capacity-building n Design and implement a capacity development programme in media and communication for members of indigenous communities with the least access to media and information, and build support systems to enable them to produce their own media (community newspapers, radio stations and ICT-enabled media). n Carry out media literacy programmes, and encourage indigenous peoples to use feedback systems in media (including call-in programmes) to express their concerns and challenge inaccurate reporting. n Support indigenous organizations (national and regional groups, and tribal councils) to initiate dialogues with mainstream and community media on indigenous peoples\u2019 concerns, providing training, as required, on dealing effectively with the media. Access to media and information n Encourage and support local community groups to produce programmes and content in local languages for radio broadcasts, publication in community media or for sharing through ICT platforms, especially in areas with large indigenous populations. n Promote indigenous media initiatives such as radio programmes, community billboards and blogging, drawing expertise from the increasing numbers of indigenous peoples from the Cordillera in Northern Luzon (Igorot) who have gone abroad as a strategy to continuously share concerns and issues. n Support tribal councils and indigenous organizations to lobby and encourage local government information offices to make information and communication services more accessible to underserved indigenous communities, including through e-libraries and mobile media platforms, and to engage indigenous youth in these initiatives. 49 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Strategy for the Way Forward ILO Convention 169 and UNDRIP provide a rationale for supporting rights-based development programmes for indigenous peoples. It is imperative that indigenous people have a voice in influencing development decisions and decision-making processes that affect them.

Bridging these gaps can be key to enhancing development outcomes for indigenous peoples as well as other marginalized groups in the region. 51 Indigenous Voices in Asia Regional Interventions The five C4E assessments and the national consultations held in conjunction with them have pointed out a number of common challenges and opportunities for indigenous peoples of the region, particularly those related to media (traditional, community and new media) and communication. There are similar structural challenges that, irrespective of different socio-political contexts, have to be overcome to address the information and communication needs of indigenous populations, and enhance development effectiveness. The assessments culminated in a regional consultation in Bangkok in May 2011. The meeting discussed the challenges and opportunities faced by indigenous peoples in the participating countries in order to develop recommendations to address them, both at the national and regional levels. UNDP APRC invited AIPP and AMARC Asia-Pacific to co- host the meeting, since these groups will lead implementation of the recommendations. The regional consultation focused on developing a strategic framework for the way forward based on findings in the five countries. Key recommendations can be summarized under the following categories: 1. Support and advocacy for an enabling policy environment; 2. Capacity enhancement for the media, indigenous-owned and mainstream; 3. Innovations and pilot interventions to enhance the voice and participation of indigenous people; and 4. Knowledge codification and regional networking. These recommendations are to be implemented through partnerships, based on the evidence gained through research and consultation. While some interventions require a regional or multi-country approach, others will be more appropriately implemented at the national level through civil society organizations, including in collaboration with UNDP country offices. Objectives and Outcome The first phase of the Indigenous Voices initiative focused on carrying out baseline assessments. The next phase will address the recommendations to achieve changes at the national, regional and global levels. The overall objective of this phase will be to promote and protect the rights of indigenous people, as enshrined in Article 16 of UNDRIP, to have access to all forms of non-indigenous media, without discrimination, and to strengthen the role of indigenous media in enhancing indigenous voices, cultures, languages and identities. It is expected that the results of this initiative will enhance indigenous peoples\u2019 participation and representation in democratic and political processes, and that governments will be more accountable for their actions and promises with respect to international norms on the rights of indigenous peoples. \u201cThe overall objective of this [new] phase will be to promote and protect the rights of indigenous people, as enshrined in Article 16 of UNDRIP, to have access to all forms of non-indigenous media, without discrimination, and to strengthen the role of indigenous media in enhancing indigenous voices, cultures, languages and identities.\u201d 52 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 4 Expected Outputs and Activities Envisioned outputs and activities include the following: 1.

Establish a mechanism for sharing experiences and lessons learned between Asia-Pacific and Latin America. e. Provide financial and technical support for the establishment of community media and other information dissemination initiatives by indigenous organizations. Partnership Approach and Resources AIPP is best positioned to lead implementation of the Indigenous Voices initiative on the regional level, together with a compact of national indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations, community radio broadcasters and media organizations. UNDP APRC and AMARC Asia- Pacific can provide technical support and assist implementation. The AIPP will continue the dialogue with national partners (ANIJ, UNDP and NEFIN in Nepal; AMAN and UNDP in Indonesia; the Centre for Community Journalism and Development and UNDP in Philippines, etc.) to shape national agendas for change along the lines of the priorities formulated at the regional consultation. Collaboration with UNDP country offices can happen on a case-by-case basis, where relevant and appropriate. Project management, including implementation and monitoring, can be carried out by the lead organization, depending on the arrangement for seeking funding. Funding may be sought from a number of donors including UNDEF, the European Union, and private trusts and foundations, such as the Open Society Foundations. National Interventionsg While the regional consultation developed a strategic approach to enhancing indigenous voices at the regional level, it also resulted in the formulation of national interventions tailored to specific contexts. These could be implemented by national stakeholders, including UNDP Country Offices, in coordination with the regional strategy. The following sections briefly outline the overall recommendations for each country. More specific strategies, outputs and activities appear in Annex 2. Cambodia The overall outcome is the growth in indigenous peoples\u2019 capacities to communicate through their own initiatives, and with the support of the non-indigenous community, NGOs, donors, the Government and regional groups. The outputs include: n Raise awareness on C4E and community media among all stakeholders, including indigenous communities, non-indigenous communities, NGOs, UN agencies, donors and governments. n Develop the capacities of indigenous peoples through engagement with community media. g Detailed information about strategies, outputs, and activities can be sought from the UNDP APRC. 54 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 4 n Increase the coverage of indigenous peoples and their issues in mainstream media. n Work towards a legal and policy framework conducive to C4E. n Establish a funding mechanism to support indigenous media initiatives, with flexibility for community decision-making and learning. Indonesia The overall outcome is an environment where indigenous peoples use different means of communication to voice their concerns and participate in decisions that affect them. The outputs convene: n Establish a system for the free flow of information among indigenous communities, using the concept of citizen journalism. n Prepare a strategic communication plan for AMAN. n Build the capacities of all information and communication officers of AMAN\u2019s provincial and district chapters for managing the system that supports a free flow of information. n Launch a national communication campaign for mainstreaming indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. n Use mobile phones to deliver and collect information from indigenous peoples and the general public, and integrate it with a communication platform on the Internet. Lao PDR The intended outcome is improved public service delivery to the poor and vulnerable, particularly ethnic groups, the effective protection of their rights and greater participation in decision-making. The outputs include: n Encourage the Government to acknowledge the right of ethnic peoples to establish their own media in their own languages, and have greater access to information about their concerns. n Raise awareness of ethnic peoples on their right to establish media in their own languages and have greater access to official information. n Enable ethnic peoples to manage media interactions, produce news products and programmes in their own languages, and participate voluntarily in activities organized by local and central bodies at the local, national and international levels. 55 Indigenous Voices in Asia Chapter 4 n Develop networks of ethnic peoples\u2019 media organizations, and facilitate sharing of information, lessons learned and knowledge.

States, without prejudice to ensuring full freedom of expression, should encourage privately owned media to adequately reflect indigenous cultural diversity. 2 www.indigenouspeople.net, accessed 22 November 2011. 3 Meir 2008, p. 10. 4 www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/drip.html. 5 UNESCO 2008. 6 e-Inclusion uses information technology to deliver material benefits to all members of society, emphasizing that disadvantaged people should not be left out. 7 See www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/. 8 The workshop also formulated the \u201ce-Bario Vision for Indigenous Peoples and ICTs,\u201d which recognizes the need for widespread development and deployment of ICT to provide creative and effective solutions to the problems faced by indigenous peoples. The paper was presented at the 3rd Global Knowledge Conference in Kuala Lumpur in December 2007. 9 The Practical Guidance Note aims to demonstrate that media can play a crucial role in empowering vulnerable and marginalized groups. This can best be achieved if media support and capacity development enable the media to better respond to and reflect the information and communication needs of these groups. The note underscores the particular importance of radio in C4E strategies because of its reach, accessibility to the poor and increasingly interactive character. It further explains that the media landscape in most developing countries has undergone a revolution over the last 15 years. This has been marked by increased democratization; an ensuing liberalization of media, particularly of broadcasting; a subsequent decline in government support to former monopoly broadcasting; and greater availability of new and more cost-effective ICT. Media in many countries are no longer monopolistic and government-dominated, and are increasingly diverse. 10 UNDP 2009. 11 See Annex 1 for further information. 12 Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 is an ILO Convention, also known as ILO Convention 169.

This is grounded in the fear that attempts by indigenous peoples to control their resources could result in the disintegration of the country.

Preface Disparities in the power relations between women and men in cultures and societies throughout the world have demonstrable negative eff ects on both the experience of daily life, through violence against women, and the development of communities and societies - through marginalization of half the members of a given community from decision making. The forms of marginalization and disparities vary widely, and approaches to dealing with or overcoming such disadvantages need to be specifi c to both the context and the culture. For indigenous women, the experience of gender inequality is exacerbated by the simultaneous experience of ethnic discrimination and of economic disadvantage. This training manual has been developed to address the power relationships that infl uence the daily lives of indigenous women at a community level. It focuses on the decision making roles and responsibilities that are an integral part of an indigenous woman\u2019s daily or regular life experience, and has been designed to be contextualized in the community in which it is being applied. The manual aims to provide participants with an understanding of gendered roles in their community/ society and what these roles imply for decision making responsibility. The training manual also provides an opportunity for women to learn of the relevant national legislation and international laws regarding the rights of women, with specifi c focus on the cultural context in which these laws would be applied. Finally the trainings also provide all participants with an opportunity to share and exchange experiences, and the space to establish partnerships and learn from each other on how to enhance their decision making roles at the household and community level. The training manual has been developed over the period of a number of years, with modules and sessions given sharper focus through the insight and practical experience of indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations throughout Asia. It has been translated into Bengali, Malaysian, Thai and Burmese, with further translations planned for future use. The Asia Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Pact Foundation (AIPP) is a network of indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations in Asia, with a secretariat based in Chiang Mai, Thailand. It provides a forum for exchange and mutual support for indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations throughout the region, and advocates regionally and globally to meet the stated needs and aspirations of its membership. Gender-related work has formed a large part of its work over the past years, with strong involvement of the Cordillera Women\u2019s Education and Research Centre \u2013 also involved in the drafting of this manual. UNDP has supported the implementation of these trainings in the region, and assisted in the development of the manual. UNDP, through the tool of its policy of engagement with indigenous peoples, has the mandate to provide assistance and support to indigenous peoples. In line with this, UNDP established a Regional Initiative on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights and Development in Asia-Pacifi c in 2004 which is specifi cally intended to provide capacity development and training for indigenous peoples, and to foster policy dialogue to improve indigenous peoples\u2019 involvement in decision making at all levels. UNDP has also re-stated its commitment towards gender equality by establishing the Asia-Pacifi c Gender Mainstreaming Programme which is mandated to provide technical assistance to ensure gender issues are taken into account in development programming and to create a conducive environment for the progressive realization of women\u2019s economic and political rights through its programme interventions. Both of these programmes have been involved in the development of this training manual, and support the work of indigenous women to strengthen their capacity and potential to play decisive roles in their communities. 4 UNDP\u2019s regional programmes channel their work through capacity building initiatives (including trainings, sensitivity and knowledge sharing platforms), research oriented projects and pilots and creating alliances through networks in the region. UNDP is excited and inspired to make a small contribution to the indigenous women\u2019s movement by supporting this series of trainings and the publication of this manual.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "010b2d76-df40-4749-a884-42fa1874c2fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "010b2d76-df40-4749-a884-42fa1874c2fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and Decision-Making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b61a62101d61c357215cd3f5d59214fea734af40ea5522f4072a4e4e72e20fe"}, "2": {"node_id": "6065c4d0-b449-4bb0-ad51-0a63355f1e18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "213d80bbf4745129964a2891d4e1cb0c691b4a0157554512fdf27f360eb59f64"}}, "hash": "06d252ed70fe98b8dc49f722248a6bace7b34f124a62f52fb7d5f7fb447dd9f4", "text": "Jannie Lasimbang AIPP General Secretary Radhika Behuria Asia Pacifi c Gender Mainstreaming Programme Chandra Roy RIPP Programme Coordinator 5 Contents INTRODUCTION 7 SESSION 1 : Trends in Decision-making 13 SESSION 2 : HISTORY - Indigenous Women\u2019s Role in Society 19 SESSION 3 : Capability in Decision-making 25 SESSION 4 :", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51f3e2e7-e3f4-4258-85af-6fa69ff980e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "51f3e2e7-e3f4-4258-85af-6fa69ff980e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and Decision-Making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa1f39249a8bec4df128a26a6a90f3227c88ae3c3eaf53117a8e9dfbcbb16262"}}, "hash": "aa1f39249a8bec4df128a26a6a90f3227c88ae3c3eaf53117a8e9dfbcbb16262", "text": "HIV/AIDS and Decision-making Process 31 SESSION 5 : Field Study 39 SESSION 5.1 : Indigenous Women and Development 43 SESSION 5.2 : Indigenous Women\u2019s Access to Inheritance 49 SESSION 5.3 : Violence Against Women 55 SESSION 5.4 : Division of Domestic Work 61 SESSION 6 : International Instruments on Indigenous Women and Decision-Making 67 SESSION 7 : National Laws and Policies on Women and Women\u2019s Participation in Decision-Making at the National Level 75 SESSION 8 : Strategies for Placing Women in Decision-Making Positions 81 SESSION 9 : Follow Up Plans 87 SESSION 10 : Evaluation 91 Annex 1 : Organization of Activities 97 Annex 2 : Recap Session \u2013 Assessment 103 8 Objectives: 1.

After everybody has fi nished writing, each participant introduces herself and her expectations in front of the group for about 3 minutes, then pastes her cards on a designated area of the wall. The cards can be pasted in 2 columns \u2013 one column for names, origin and meanings, and another column for expectations. 5. The facilitator then summarizes the major and common expectations of all the participants and relates these to the objectives of the training. This summary can be presented the next day. ACTIVITY II: Orientation Objectives, programme and methodologies of the training Time: 1 hour Presentation: General Objectives of the Training: 1. The participants are able to discuss the various perceptions, concepts and roles of indigenous women in decision-making; 2. The participants are able to explore and understand some relevant issues faced by indigenous women in the community and are challenged to resolve such issues; 3. The participants are able to formulate strategies on how to place women in decision-making positions; and 4. Indigenous women participants are provided a space to share ideas and experiences in relation to decision-making. Programme: The training programme starts by looking at the present trends in decision-making in our society. In Session 1, we will examine the global scenario as far as women and men decision-makers and leaders are concerned. We will to look into the stereotypes that many of us have about decisions made by men and women. We then start to challenge these stereotypes by looking at the important roles of women in our own community and then linking this to the wider arena. We do this in Session 2 by telling stories of women over history \u2013 a group session we call \u201cHerStory\u201d as opposed to \u201cHistory\u201d. 10 A Community Training Manual 10 A Community Training Manual In Session 3, we deepen the challenge by looking at women\u2019s capabilities in decision-making. We are not proving that women are capable of making decisions. Rather, we look at the role and knowledge of women, which are important in making wise decisions in indigenous communities. The session is about realizing and asserting to ourselves our own capabilities to make wise decisions. Through the session, we would also look at the important concepts and needs in order to make wise decisions. In Session 4 we look at one of the major emerging challenges that is facing indigenous women in communities in Asia, the spreading impact of HIV/AIDS. We look at the strategies that women have available to them to protect themselves from becoming infected with the virus, and the decisions about our own bodies that we take as women. The session also looks into the family- centred decisions that face women around the issue of HIV/AIDS \u2013 decisions that include our responses to people who are living with", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71b94189-d74a-4f61-bb6b-1e8020334e5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "71b94189-d74a-4f61-bb6b-1e8020334e5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and Decision-Making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20545687dd00b0640d455d67da218922a3f807d60b47355706600e89d3a8febc"}}, "hash": "20545687dd00b0640d455d67da218922a3f807d60b47355706600e89d3a8febc", "text": "the virus, and care of infected family members. In Session 5, we will consider specifi c case studies to examine what are the contemporary issues that indigenous women continue to face. We look at four issues \u2013 women and development, access to inheritance, domestic violence/sexual harassment and division of domestic work or housework. Other issues can also be considered, depending on the situation in the community. For instance, militarization can be one case study. In each case, we look at why such issues emerge, some of the constraints to discuss and address these case, and what kind of decisions would be wise to make in relation to these issues. We try to put ourselves as decision-makers in the community and see what we can realistically achieve. Participants will also be given a chance to share about their work, their communities, their organizations and particular decisions that they have made that they are proud of. This will be done through informal Sharing Sessions at the end of the fi rst and second days. On the third day, we go on a Field Study by going out and interacting with people in the community. We hope to talk to women and men in the community about how decisions are made in their community regarding the issues discussed in Session 5. We will divide ourselves into groups, with each group going to a diff erent community or focusing on a diff erent issue. We will go to the community and learn from the people about their viewpoints on these issues. In the evening, we hope to come back together and share experiences and refl ect on the lessons that we have learned. On the fourth day in Sessions 6 and 7, we will look at international instruments and national policies that support indigenous women in decision-making. We will also look at possible roles that women could play eff ectively at both the national and international arena and share some experiences or stories of indigenous women who have experiences in this fi eld. This is so that we can realize that we also have a role to play and that we can also be eff ective decision-makers even at the national and international level. In Session 8, we will look at our own position in our own community and draw some appropriate strategies to improve our decision-making position so that we can better implement the decisions that we have set on many of the issues that we have examined. Some of us may already be in a position to infl uence the elders or village committees, but others may yet have to struggle to this position. Whichever position we are in, there is always room for improvements. This session will attempt to strategize and tacticize on how to arrive at a few mechanisms to improve indigenous women\u2019s positions in decision-making. We will also look at how to widen the scope of what we have learned so that it can be applied to infl uence other decision-makers in the community and local government. We will look at the concept of position in society, examine the pros and cons of taking roles and responsibilities in the public sphere and look into what kind of hurdles we will have to face. Session 9 on follow-up will look at what we need to do to achieve our strategies, based on the hurdles that we identifi ed. If we need funds, where do we get it? If we need further training, what kind of training and how do we get resource persons? If we want to conduct our own community training, how do we go about organizing it? The possibilities are up to you. Many of you have been 11 11 Introduction working to build an indigenous women\u2019s network. What is a network and how do we strengthen networks to assist us in our work? We will also look at some concepts of networking. Finally for Session 10, we come together to evaluate the training. We have prepared two questions about what you have learned and how you will use what you have learned in the training. We have also prepared a simple evaluation form where you can write your comments on each of the training sessions. We hope to organize two in-country trainings a year and your feedback will be very useful for us to improve ourselves. Methodology: The methodology of the training will stress on active participation and on making decisions in every step of the programme.

Time: 2 hours 15 SESSION 1: Trends in Decision-making Exercise I - Picturing Decision-Makers: (10 minutes) Input and Discussion: (10 minutes) Trends in Decision-Making Everyday, we are shown that men are the decision-makers. On TV, we see male politicians dominating the scene. What type of decisions do they make? Invariably these are about politics, policies, development and businesses. Where do these decisions tend to lead? We mainly hear about decisions to wage war, infrastructure and personal wealth for the country or individual but hardly anything about alleviating poverty and hardship of people. We seldom hear about real concern for the well-being and social upliftment of the poor, or land rights of indigenous peoples. Even world-famous women leaders think the same way as men leaders. The trend in decision- making is very masculine, i.e., it follows the trend of thinking of men and thus tends to alienate women. Exercise II \u2013 Workshop on Decision-Making Stereotypes (1 hour) An exercise to open up the participants and start the discussion. 1. Prepare 3 - 4 pictures of famous local, national or international male and female leaders in politics and business, e.g. Zia, Khaleda, S. Hasina, Bush, Corazon Aquino, Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo, etc. and paste them on the board 2. Ask the participants: What type of decisions do these leaders make? 3. Discuss for 10 minutes 4. Note the answers on the board, next to the pictures 1. Divide the participants into 4 workshop groups to discuss the following questions (30 minutes): u What kinds of decisions do women/men make in the household? u What kind of decisions can women/men make for the community? 2.

(20 minutes) 4. Draw out the reasons why these roles are assigned to women or how these roles are acquired. Visualize by writing the answers on cards and posting them on the board. (10 minutes) 16 A Community Training Manual Input and Discussion: (15 minutes) Stereotyping roles of women and men If we look in our own society, it is actually a microcosm of the world situation. Decisions are made mostly by men and the issues are very much on issues in the community, even when these issues involve women too. Men dominate village committees, institutions, and if there are women, they are often stereotyped for certain roles. Men make much of the decisions on community issues such as land security, development projects and community activities while women stay on the sidelines or play supportive roles. Women get the task of preparing food and looking after children while men discuss during meetings. The same goes for the household. Most men decide on the number of children or whether to opt for contraception. Also, men decide that they will continue working, while women usually resign from their jobs, once they have children. Men also decide on the cash crops to be grown and other business dealings. In many rural indigenous societies, these issues may not be discussed but are taken for granted as norms of society. However, some issues in the household may be left to women such as deciding on the education of the children, everyday food for family, health and deciding on type of crops for subsistence. Exercise III \u2013 Buzz Session: Women and Decision-Making in the Community (15 minutes.) To look at why women are not willing or able to take up decision-making positions in society 1. Buzz sessions: 2 \u2013 3 people seated next to each other discuss quickly on why women in communities are not willing or not able to take up decision-making positions. 2. Ask for the responses in plenary and visualize their answers. One facilitator asks and another writes the answers on manila cards and pastes them on the wall/board. 3. Give additional answers, visualizing your points on manila cards, if there are issues that are not covered in the buzz session. Cluster the answers, e.g. culture, perception, physical burden, etc. Note: This exercise will be referred to again in Session 7, so keep the answers up. Input and Synthesis: (10 minutes) There may be various reasons why women do not take up decision-making positions in society. Many may be due to discrimination that has become a norm in society. Discrimination perpetuates women\u2019s lack of confi dence, lack of experience and lack of knowledge on many issues. Another reason can also be the women\u2019s overburden in the household, depriving her the time to participate in meetings. Many women may also be uninterested to make decisions because the solutions expected or acceptable for many of the issues in many communities today are not what a woman wants to pursue, e.g. confrontation or war versus peace and reconciliation. These are the trends and stereotypes in decision-making in society today, the decisions that men and women make, and the reasons why women are usually not in positions of decision-making. 19 SESSION 2 : HERSTORY - Indigenous Women\u2019s Role in Society HERSTORY - Indigenous Women's Role in Society2 SESSION 20 A Community Training Manual Objectives: 1. For the women to appreciate their contribution to the family and society. 2. To learn about what other indigenous women have done to help their family and community. Time: 1 hour 30 minutes 21 SESSION 2 : HERSTORY - Indigenous Women\u2019s Role in Society Exercise I - Group Work: Herstory (1 hour) 1. The participants can work alone, in pairs or in a group, to make a story about the women\u2019s role in the family and in society. Women who cannot write can tell a story to another one who writes. Another option is to use drawings to tell her story. 2. After the women have fi nished making their stories, they will present it to the whole group. Note: If there is not enough time, presentations can continue in the evenings during the Sharing Sessions. Discussion: (30 minutes) From the \u201cherstories\u201d of the participants, we can identify some of the important roles that women play in the family and community such as the following: Some Roles of Women within the Family 1.

Supporting other women who are in need, e.g. victims of domestic violence, women who have to go through mourning rituals 4. In some communities, the women are also expected to contribute labor to the shamans and blacksmiths in their community as a form of respect for their services to the community Some Untold Stories There are many women who have become legends or heroes in storybooks such as Mulan, Joan of Arc and Pocahontas. There are also simple, untold stories of indigenous women who have made either collective or individual decisions for the good of the whole community. The following \u201cherstories\u201d of these indigenous women can be shared to the participants: 22 A Community Training Manual The Khasis in Meghalaya, Northeast India were not always a matrilineal society. In the olden days, men used to organize hunting parties, leaving only women and children in the village. During one hunting party, intruders attacked the village, burning down houses and killing any villager they encountered. Without the men, the Khasi women had to stand up and fi ght the attackers. The women fought bravely and with all their might. When the men who were out hunting saw the smoke from their village, they rushed home fearing the worst. When they arrived, they found that the women had slain many of the attackers and had driven the others off . Because of this incident, the community decided to pay tribute to the women by changing and passing the clan names to the female side as well as passing down properties through the youngest female child in the family. Source: Mr. Julius, Khasi Leader Meeju, is an Akha, one of the indigenous groups of Thailand. For the past 10 years, she has been mobilizing members of the Akha community to help fi ll up complicated citizenship application forms to be submitted to the government. She trained groups of young Akhas to fi ll up forms not just for Akha people but for other indigenous peoples of Thailand. In fact, they have given priority to other indigenous groups. The groups have unselfi shly been working late at night when most people are already asleep. Between the months of March \u2013 August 2002, they completed and submitted about 30,000 forms. Meeju knows that without citizenship, indigenous peoples of Thailand will not have the opportunity to get an education, jobs and most importantly rights to their traditional lands and territories. Despite threats of arrests, she continues to be committed to the work and continues to ensure the rights to citizenship of indigenous peoples of Thailand. Source: IMPECT Volunteer When an oil palm company started to open a huge plantation in Ulu Niah, Sarawak in 1996, two longhouse communities had to face constant threats by thugs employed by the company. The Iban communities did everything to petition the government to intervene but to no avail. As the company started to bulldoze the Iban customary rights land, anger and frustration led to a violent encounter between members of the community and company thugs in 1999. Three people were killed, leading to an arrest of 19 Iban men. Elam, mother of 3 and daughter of the headman (one of those detained) worked tirelessly for about three years to seek redress for those who were arrested and to continue the campaign for the community\u2019s rights to land. Elam also performed ceremonies and rituals to keep the morale and spiritual well-being of the community. Her eff orts, together with many other women, fi nally paid off when all those accused were acquitted by the Sarawak court and upheld their rights over their customary lands. Though Elam faced numerous hurdles both within the community and the wider male-dominated society, she gained the trust and respect for the leadership she has shown in their struggle.

Choose the statements to be debated on. 2. Divide the participants into two groups by letting them choose which group they want to join. Group 1: Agree or Group 2: Disagree 3. Each group gives the reasons why they agree or disagree, and the participants discuss and debate on the reasons. Input and Discussion: (20 minutes) Traditional Decision-Making Process In traditional societies, decision-making is an open process. Elders tend to play a bigger role because of the experiences and knowledge that they have. Thus, decision-making is often left to those who are considered knowledgeable and wise, and not just by age. For example, the decision on the varieties of rice to be planted is normally left to the women to decide because she knows what the family enjoys eating and whether certain varieties store well. When a tribe decides to go to war, the elders ponder over it for days and because the men are the ones who know the terrain, they are the ones who decide on the strategies. With decisions comes responsibility. Courage is also necessary to ensure that the decisions are carried through. Women make decisions daily in their lives in order to survive. Knowledge, wisdom and responsibility are necessary for capable decision-making. We can clearly see that women have these, as seen in their making crafts, healing, embroidering, maintaining traditional songs, folklore, moral values, keeping her family together, resolving confl icts within the family and the community, and using land and resources responsibly and sustainably. Women are also accustomed to sharing their knowledge and experiences with each other through talking and discussions as they carry out specifi c work. This openness to express her ideas or feelings is important in fostering understanding, transparency and confi dence among the people. Wise and Unwise Decisions on Gender Issues While the family\u2019s survival depends on the women\u2019s decision-making, it is still not socially acceptable for women to make decisions on community matters. In many indigenous groups, there is no clear opportunity for women to participate in decision-making, particularly in the community\u2019s activities, ceremonies, festivals or the hearing of the cases. It seems that few women participate in the administration of the community. The women\u2019s role in decision-making is blocked by customs that give power to the men, which many justify as \u201ctradition and culture\u201d. As the result, women have little experience or skill on matters regarding the administration of the community. Society\u2019s norms and customs sometimes supersede the sense of justice and fairness of the 28 A Community Training Manual community, and women also contribute to perpetuating such norms. It is therefore very important to subject each issue to a process of refl ection. For example, in some societies, a woman who is raped or taken advantage of by her suitor and becomes pregnant is forced to marry the person. The main concern of the family is to avoid society\u2019s disapproval of children born out of wedlock or sex outside marriage, even though the marriage may not be a suitable match. Discuss other examples of unwise decisions on gender issues such as \u201cwitches\u201d, polygamy, others. \u201cEvery society needs to challenge its norms on women and review unwise decisions on gender issues\u201d.

To provide participants with a basic understanding of HIV and AIDS, including methods of transmission 2. To provide participants with knowledge of eff ective measures that can be taken to protect yourself and to prevent transmission of HIV 3. To explore together the attitudes and values that we have about HIV and people living with HIV 4. To look at the decisions that we can take about our own risks towards HIV, and our relations with people living with HIV Time: 2 hours 33 SESSION 4 : HIV/AIDS and Decision-making Process This session is designed to draw participants into discussions on risk factors in their own lives for HIV transmission, factors of transmission, and the decision-making roles that they play with regards to the spread of, and care for people living with HIV/AIDS. Detailed instructions are contained here for a role play and a series of refl ection exercises & discussion. Input and Discussions: (10 minutes) Some Figures: The latest estimates show that 8.3 million people (2.4 million among them adult women) were living with HIV in Asia at the end of 2005. More than two thirds of them live in one country, India. In Asia, about one in six people (16%) in need of antiretroviral treatment are now receiving it. While progress has been strongest in Thailand, coverage still remains well below 10% in India (which has more than 70% of the region\u2019s total treatment needed) [\u2026] 1 The simulation exercise presented below should be done following the instructions provided. The rest of the refl ection sessions can be contextualized. The instructions should be written on fl ip charts for the participants. There are three sets of refl ection cases, which involve facilitated discussions among participants. Exercise I \u2013 Simulation (20 Minutes) 1. Arrange for participants to sit in a semi circle. 2. Prepare one bag per participant containing 20 beans. All bags should contain white beans except for two which will contain red beans 3. Place the bags of beans under the participant\u2019s chairs before the session, and instruct them not to look into the bags. u Ask participants to take their bags (without looking into them) and to walk around the room u The facilitator should ask the participants to begin the exercise upon hearing the word \u201cGREET\u201d. u The participants should introduce themselves to one other person in the room and exchange beans (without looking into the bag). u This mingling and moving around should be continued till each participant has exchanged beans with three diff erent people. 4. Ask participants to come back to their seats. 5. Explain to participants that everyone began the exercise with a bag of white beans, except for two persons who had a bag of red beans. Ask participants if anyone knows what this may mean, if no one guesses, explain that red beans represent HIV infection. 6. Participants still don\u2019t look at their bags at this stage. 1 UNAIDS 2006 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic, Executive Summary pg 8 Re\ufb02 ection One: HIV positive, our feelings and behaviours Lead the participants in discussing the following questions while they still have their bags and have not yet looked inside them. 1. What does it mean to be HIV positive? What are you feeling right now? (at this point no one knows they are infected so the WHOLE group can experience anxiety etc) Do you know who among you are positive? (like in real life, you cant tell a positive person from a healthy one) What behavior did you indulge in that could put you at risk of being positive. 34 A Community Training Manual 2. Participants could give many diff erent replies including hugging, shaking hands etc; write them all down on fl ip charts. The facilitator has to structure the replies as risky behavior and non risky behavior (20 minutes) 3. Stimulate participants to think of other behaviors that they did not indulge in during the game, that can be considered risky behavior in the transmission of HIV Input and Discussion: (10 minutes) The facilitator should write out answers in a structured way on a fl ip chart, separating ways of transmission from non transmission.

The sheet with risky behavior should be clearly understood by all. It will be visited again when discussing prevention. Some of the answers are: Flip Chart 1: How is HIV transmitted: Only 4 fl uids in the body can transmit HIV: Blood, semen, vaginal fl uids and breastfeeding milk, therefore HIV can be transmitted through: blood borne (Sharing needles, Contact with blood of an HIV-infected person); unprotected sex (vaginal sex, anal sex) or mother to child transmission (Breastfeeding, Mother to child during pregnancy, during delivery) Flip Chart 2: How is HIV not transmitted The rest of body fl uids cannot transmit HIV: sweat, saliva, tears, urine, feces, and vomit. There is not enough HIV in them. Therefore the HIV will not be transmitted through: Working or living with a person living with HIV; eating or drinking from the same dish; hugging, shaking hands or kissing a person living with HIV; by proper use of a condom during sex; by letting someone cry on your shoulder or by mosquito\u2019s bites. Re\ufb02 ection Two: Infection and our responses to others While all the participants still have the bags with them, explain that in the role-play they have been exchanging beans \u2013 and some of these exchanges have been (unknowingly) with people living with HIV. They may now have been exposed. Walk the whole group together through the steps described below to bring up our feelings and responses to exposure, possible infection, testing, and test results. Exercise II \u2013 our responses (20 Minutes) 1. Ask participants what they would like to do at this point. Some might simply return their bags to the facilitator without looking inside; some may want to take a look at the beans in their bag. 2. Prepare around envelopes with test results for each participant (Four or fi ve of these should be positive and the rest negative). 3. At this stage suggest to them the possibility of going for a test. If they would opt for testing address some the following questions: u Where can you get tested? u Apart from physical testing is there anything else you may need? (Link it to the previous feelings of anxiety and then bring up depression and suicide \u2013 hence the need for counseling. No testing without consent and counseling) 35 SESSION 4 : HIV/AIDS and Decision-making Process 4. Invite the rest of the participants to look into their bags. Remind them that even if they have one red bean in their bag they have been exposed to HIV. Allow a few quiet moments for participants to absorb their feeling. 5. Invite those who have been exposed (have one or more red beans) and have decided to go for an HIV test to move their chairs into the centre of the circle. 6. Give envelopes containing the test results and ask them to wait a few minutes before opening the test results. Once they have seen the results, address those who have tested positive. Ask them: u Describe your feelings right now. How do you feel about the result? u What do you intend to do next? Will you tell some one in your life? Who would you tell? And how? Be sure to use the answers to begin a discussion about some of the typical reactions to testing positive, such as shock, denial, anger, fear and so on. 7. Then address those who tested negative. Ask them how they felt about their test results. Ask what they intend to do now. And what is their feeling towards those HIV positive? Those who have tested negative will ask you \u201chow come\u201d start a discussion around this issue. Be sure to give accurate information \u2013 simple non confusing messages. 8. Don\u2019t forget those who returned in their bags! Now ask them if they would like to check their bags and if anyone has changed their minds. If yes, let them come up and take their bags. (you can be tested anytime you want) If they still do no want to be tested (i.e see what\u2019s in the bags), make them aware that they could be infecting the next person through indulging in risky behavior. The aim here is also to encourage testing and access to treatment. Input and Discussion: (20 minutes) Testing To go for an HIV test is a very courageous exercise that may change the course of one\u2019s life, however it is very important to know one\u2019s status to protect one\u2019s self and others. In some parts of the world, like Asia and Africa 90 % of those infected don\u2019t know they are infected, which", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6952ed18-597a-41d3-adb4-88a37d51587d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6952ed18-597a-41d3-adb4-88a37d51587d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and Decision-Making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4f972ecf9eebec214cedeaedd6cc597cc110842ac7d763872a8d4cea8140da4"}}, "hash": "a4f972ecf9eebec214cedeaedd6cc597cc110842ac7d763872a8d4cea8140da4", "text": "is leading to a wider spread of the epidemic. It\u2019s also important to add that the global scaling up of the response to AIDS, particularly in relation to HIV testing as a prerequisite to expanded access to treatment, must be grounded in sound public health practice and also respect, protection, and fulfi llment of human rights norms and standards. The voluntary nature of testing must remain at the heart of all HIV policies and programmes, both to comply with human rights principles and to ensure sustained public health benefi ts2. To tell or not to tell Generally it takes a long time for those who have tested positive to disclose their status. In order to help them build the skills and inner strength to disclose their status, it is important to provide them with help through hotlines, counseling, PLHIV groups, etc. that will also build their capacity to gradually prepare their environment. It is important to emphasize that they don\u2019t need to disclose their status, unless they are ready and the environment they live in has been sensitized, several people living with HIV have told their status to support groups or external organizations but not to their families. 2 UNAIDS Global Reference Group on HIV/AIDS and Human Right may help supporting the discussion. 36 A Community Training Manual Re\ufb02 ection Three: Our decisions about HIV 1. Ask participants what they intend to do now. How can they prevent transmission? Go back to the fl ip chart that has listed risky behavior and address HIV prevention methods for each of those behaviors. For example: u When engaging in sexual intercourse (which could have risks); being faithful and using a condom could be two ways of prevention. u When going to the hospital (which could involve risks); one should ask for sterilized needles and screened blood as ways of prevention. 2. Emphasize that the inner circle was made to show that People living with HIV should not be excluded but rather supported by colleagues, friends and family. 3. Discuss the various manifestations of stigma at diff erent points of the exercise. Keep a close eye on body language. 4. Explain that you will spend the next moments to explore those feelings of loss associated with a positive result, which also introduce us in more depth to issues around stigma and discrimination. 5. While exploring these feelings, it will be important to steer the refl ection towards how women as principal care takers of the family have an important role to play, by caring and supporting those infected and not pushing them away. Who will look after them if they are infected? Bring the discussion towards how women as \u2018decision makers\u2019 can decide to care and support each other and advocate against discrimination in their communities. Inputs and Discussion (20 minutes) Some Prevention methods 1. Blood borne: ensure that if you are getting a blood transfusion the blood has been screened, do not share needles 2. Sex: use a condom if you don\u2019t know the status of your partner 3. Parent to child: do not breastfeed (when possible), provide specifi c medicines to avoid MTCT (prophylaxis with Nevirapine), and avoid natural delivery (Caesarian section) 4. ARVs Women as decision makers in the context of HIV Throughout the exercise women were confronted with four decisions to take exemplifying the type of decisions they could be engaging with in their communities: 1. Testing: to get tested or not (look or not into the envelopes) 2. If results were positive if to tell anyone or not \u2013 disclosure, confi dentiality 3. Prevention: To protect themselves or not and how 4. Attitude towards those infected: if to judge them and condemn or accept them with care and compassion Prevention To date 95% of HIV new cases worldwide are through unprotected sex, therefore even though condoms may be a source of discomfort for many of us, is important to discuss them and understand basic facts. Sexually active people that don\u2019t know the status of their partners should protect themselves by using condoms. In Asia however, with the increasing feminization of the epidemic and with near to 90% (in some places) of new female infections being faithful married women, this poses several challenges with complex solutions that can only be addressed with a longer term vision, that would focus on women\u2019s empowerment through education and economic contribution to the family. In the context of parent to child transmission, when women know their status they should take all precautionary measures during pregnancy and delivery, and avoid (if possible) breast feeding. For injecting drug users, don\u2019t use contaminated injecting", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "345bb020-43e1-4280-aa64-24dbdc3800ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "345bb020-43e1-4280-aa64-24dbdc3800ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and Decision-Making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c59e5a26ce08d641fb9039e256e20ff9c1d1270e36b5250f3dda8e7f2282720d"}}, "hash": "c59e5a26ce08d641fb9039e256e20ff9c1d1270e36b5250f3dda8e7f2282720d", "text": "equipment 37 SESSION 4 : HIV/AIDS and Decision-making Process (syringes and needles) and fi nally if you are in a hospital for blood transfusion ensure that the blood has been screened and is safe. All these measures put women at the conjunction of having to take decisions of protecting themselves or not, in some circumstances will be easier to take these decisions because the environment and circumstances will be more favorable than others. However it\u2019s important to explore them and give the space for women to express themselves and discuss challenges and opportunities. Stigma and discrimination Stigmatization and discriminatory attitudes are often associated with fear of the unknown. By exploring the fear and addressing what is not known, for example, by making very clear how HIV is transmitted and how HIV is not transmitted and that even if living with the virus what can live a healthy and productive life for ten to twenty years, some of these attitudes may gradually diminish. It is also important to make the refl ection that women as principal care takers of the family have an important role to play, by caring and supporting those infected and not pushing them away. The \u2018Beans\u2019 game will have brought up several feelings associated with discrimination and at the same time care. As illustrated repeatedly in earlier sessions in the manual, women as \u2018decision makers\u2019 can decide to care and support and advocate against discrimination in their communities, generating an extraordinary change and promoting respect and care in their environment. 39 SESSION 5 : Field Study Field Study5 SESSION SESSION 5.1 : Indigenous Women and Development SESSION 5.2 : Indigenous Women\u2019s Access to Inheritance SESSION 5.3 : Violence Against Women SESSION 5.4 : Division of Domestic Work 40 A Community Training Manual Objectives: 1.

Development means diff erent things to diff erent people. For indigenous peoples, development is the maintenance of traditional values and principles that are holistic and interlinked. Development encompasses social and cultural beliefs, health, education, economy, technology, politics, governance and judicial matters. For governments, development is often equated to modernization and thus, the need to ensure that \u201cmodern\u201d culture replaces \u201ctraditional\u201d culture, which is seen as an obstacle to development. Policies and Realities The modernization theory of development explains the development model of production, marketing, consumption, assimilation, acquiring technology and control over lands and resources. Policies and programmes are therefore being made to refl ect this model. For instance, development programs encourage large-scale cash crop plantations for export and import businesses, advertising and food processing. Perceptions of people are changing leading them to leave small-scale production and enter into regimented cash crop production using sophisticated technologies. Lands and resources are being acquired for centralized production such as plantations, building infrastructure and urban centres. These have brought rapid changes to many indigenous communities, resulting in many negative impacts such as social decay (decline in traditional values and principles), massive rural-urban migration, decline in traditional market economy and other traditional ways of life, and even prostitution. Many men leave families in search for work and women are forced to fend for the family. Many families have either abandoned their traditional subsistence way of life in favour of cash crop cultivation or are forced into it when their traditional lands were taken from them. Family roles have also been disrupted. Indigenous peoples suff er from severe handicaps of social and economic underdevelopment, which render them vulnerable to exploitation, discrimination or neglect. Nevertheless, indigenous women particularly those in the rural areas, have continued to bring food for the family on a daily basis, realizing that income from the outside does not suffi ce. They continue to tend their vegetable plots, rear poultry and other farm animals, gather food, fodder and fuel from nearby forests or fallow fi elds, fi sh from rivers, streams or paddy fi elds, and produce handicrafts. Surplus produce is sold at local markets and the income is used to buy needed supplies that are not produced. Women also have special knowledge on medicinal plants and natural 46 A Community Training Manual resource management, which is related to their practices in agriculture, healing and ceremonies and their foraging from the forest for food and materials for handicrafts. Challenges Women are in a constant dilemma whether to venture fully into modern economic development programmes or maintain part of their subsistence economy. They are constantly being pulled away from their traditional values, principles and way of life into a diff erent set of values and systems. Often these are beyond their own control, particularly in the fi eld of education and health of the family. Thus far, women have succeeded to some extent in passing down their mother tongue and indigenous practices to the present generation. However, these practices and use of the languages are slowly eroding. It is important to note that women\u2019s knowledge on biodiversity conservation and on sustainable development is getting global recognition and respect. However, there is still much to be done in order to translate such recognition into action. In the face of development and modernization, women have to seriously refl ect on the type of decisions and interventions that are needed with respect to development of the community as a whole. There is also a need to explore how women can infl uence community leaders once there is an understanding about the roles and path they need to take. Infl uencing leaders will depend again on the present position of women in the community \u2013 the lower the position, the more eff ort is needed to exert infl uence. It will also depend on how open the leaders are. The type of action is also important. This exercise provides an opportunity for participants to refl ect on the reality of the situation in the community and to decide on the path that the women need to take. 1. The participants go back to the small groups to discuss the following questions. They write their answers using key words in manila cards: (20 minutes) u What type of development is benefi cial for your community as a whole? u What kind of development do indigenous, rural women need? u What roles can women play concerning the development of the community? u How can women infl uence or change the perception of policy makers? u What kind action is needed to infl uence community leaders? 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0181e72-57d3-426a-955f-8aa489eeb65e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0181e72-57d3-426a-955f-8aa489eeb65e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and Decision-Making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7322ff257caeecb71d2c196bc9062756081aa386461db8c72e8a16b9fe6235f6"}}, "hash": "7322ff257caeecb71d2c196bc9062756081aa386461db8c72e8a16b9fe6235f6", "text": "Each group reports the results of the discussion by reading and submitting the cards.

To refl ect on whether there is any gender-bias in the customary laws and practices of the community. 2. To fi nd out, in the situation of women in indigenous societies today, whether there are weaknesses in the customary practices or cultural norms on women, particularly in relation to women\u2019s access to inheritance. 3. To consider possible changes that are needed, both in community perception and practice, with respect to women and inheritance. Time: 1 hour 30 minutes 51 SESSION 5.2 Indigenous Women\u2019s Access to Inheritance Input and Discussion: Village Powerpoint (10 minutes) Customary Practices In many indigenous societies, traditionally indigenous women do not inherit properties. In some communities, the eldest male child inherits all the family assets, especially traditional family land as he is expected to look after all his younger siblings and parents/grandparents. In cases where there are no sons, the eldest daughter normally inherits. Although the family plot is passed down to the next generation, the whole family continues to cultivate it together and share the produce between the siblings. In many communities, even if assets are divided among family members, often women inherit less or do not inherit anything. The rationale is that women are expected to marry and that she will share in the inheritance of her husband. There is also fear that women may marry outside the community and if they inherit properties, it would go to the hands of outsiders. 1. Before the session, the facilitator asks 6 participants to volunteer to show a short skit on women and inheritance based on the following situation: In a family of fi ve, the eldest son inherited all 3 pieces of land. After some time, their mother grew old and sick. The fi ve children met and it was revealed that the eldest brother was too busy to look after their mother. Finally, one of the younger daughters agreed to look after her in her house. It was also revealed that the brother used the land for his own benefi t and did not off er any assistance to his younger siblings. 2. The volunteers present the short skit that they have prepared to the other participants. (10 minutes) 3. A short discussion follows about the issues arising from the situation presented. (10 minutes) 1. Depending on the composition of the group, participants can divide themselves into smaller workshop groups or have the discussion in one big group. 2. The discussion will answer the following questions: (20 minutes) u Under customary law, who inherits family properties and what is the rationale behind it? u What are the consequences of these customary practices on the women in the family? u How have these practices changed through time until the present? u What can be done to make the situation fair? 3. The groups report the results and the facilitator summarizes the main points of the discussion. (20 minutes) Exercise II - Workshop Discussion: Issues Related to Customary Practices on Inheritance (40 minutes) Exercise I \u2013 Role-Playing (20 minutes) 52 A Community Training Manual Present Context and Problems Although traditionally the rationale may have been a pragmatic one, in the present context, it is no longer viable. Most communities are no longer cohesive and there are many cases where the eldest male does not look after the welfare of his siblings or even his own parents. Many aging parents are looked after by their daughters. Many communities are also no longer cohesive and the customary laws that govern and ensure that these unwritten agreements are adhered to are no longer respected. Families and communities have become more individualistic and parents do not stress the conditions with the handing down of the family assets to their sons. Also in the present situation, we fi nd more indigenous women not getting married, getting divorced or left by their husbands for various reasons. After a divorce or after a woman fi nds that her husband left her, she is left to fend for herself and her children. She may return to her parents, live with relatives or continue to live by herself.

One misunderstanding that usually comes out about indigenous women\u2019s access to inheritance is the question of claims on communal lands. It has been made clear by indigenous women that they are not referring to communal lands, only family lands. Such family lands may have private titled ownership or may be part of communal lands that have been allocated to all families in the community through a common agreement and could be passed down from generation to generation. It must be stressed that the situation of women today is a social ill, a result of the social system, and is not brought about by the men only or by the indigenous women themselves. Exercise IV - Plenary Group Discussion: Ways Forward (20 minutes) 1. What can women leaders do to make some changes in the community perception and practice in relation to women and inheritance? Possible options to be considered are the following: u Addressing past wrongs, e.g., if women have been disinherited, what can be done in the present-day situation for women without land? u Instituting change in the customary laws? u Instituting change within families? 2. How can community leaders/elders be encouraged to make a fair decision on women\u2019s access to inheritance? Some communities have been facing the problem of appointment of community leaders and replacement of traditional councils or institutions by government. As such, these would be a barrier to convincing new community leaders on any issue. In addition, some community leaders may be open to suggestions about changes in customary laws, arguing that customary laws are dynamic and changes with time, while others may insist that it is static and resist any kind of change. Some possibility to convince leaders could be by compiling cases or conducting studies on women owning land and to demonstrate the responsibility to which they have held and developed the land. 53 SESSION 5.2 Indigenous Women\u2019s Access to Inheritance 3. New Ways Forward Many Maoris in New Zealand have established a Family Land Trust. Lands that used to be handed down to one person are now put in a trust so that the whole family has a right to the land and decisions are made collectively on the use of the land. Many families elsewhere have also adopted this mix of traditional concept of collective ownership employing a modern concept of trusteeship. How possible are these new ways in your communities? 56 A Community Training Manual Objectives: 1. To provide a venue for indigenous women to discuss the issue of violence against women, particularly domestic violence, sexual harassment and/or militarization 2. To identify the root causes of violence against women Time: 1 hr 30 minutes 57 SESSION 5.3 Violence Against Women Input, Discussion and Synthesis: (20 minutes) Forms of Violence Against Women and Children Women and children suff er violence in three main forms: physical violence (use of physical force or weapons), psychological violence (actions or negligence resulting in psychological suff ering, cruelty or the restriction of freedom of women and children) and sexual violence (actions which take liberties with or violate the sexual rights of women). It is clear that women and children experience all three forms of violence in many diff erent places. In the home, many women and children are victims of abuse by members of their families. The family is usually considered a place of love, warmth, safety, mutual support and understanding for women and children. However, the reality is that many women and children are victims of domestic violence within the family home. Violence occurring in the community includes rape, sexual injury, sexual harassment, intimidation in the workplace, school or other public place. It includes seeking gain from the selling of the sexual services of women and children. Government accountability with regards to violence against women is seen in cases of state violence such as rape, arrest and harassment of women by the military. This can also be seen in the policies and projects of the government, which impact heavily on the lives of basic sectors of the population, particularly on the lives of women. Impact of Violence against Women Violence against women and children, whether in their homes, in communities, or from the government, directly aff ects the victims, physically, psychologically and sexually. It causes injury and pain, from small injuries to permanent disability and death. Public health and medical research shows that sexual harassment and rape by people known to the victim, and physical or psychological injury from people known to the victim are far more common than injuries sustained from strangers.

Women and children who have experienced such violence carry emotional and psychological burdens, losing confi dence. In the case of sexual harassment against women, the threat of HIV/AIDS is of serious concern. Spread of HIV through forced sexual encounters results in women facing a life time of increased need to watch their health and the health of subsequent children and family members. 1. Ask two or three participants to share their experience and knowledge of the following topics: u Domestic Violence u Sexual Harassment u Militarization 2. Each one shares the problems related to her topic, actual experiences, the actions taken by the women, and why actions were not taken. Each one is given 20 minutes to share. 3. After the sharing session, discussion follows. The facilitator summarizes the main points of the discussion/sharing by clustering the ideas into problems, actions taken, and why no actions were taken. (10 minutes) Exercise I \u2013 Sharing Session (1 hour 10 minutes) 58 A Community Training Manual In addition to direct impacts on victims, violence also has impacts on society. Children living in families in which domestic violence exists, who see violence between their parents, learn from the examples provided to them. When adult, they are more likely to use violence against their own families or others around them. Factors that Cause Violence The roots of violence against women and children can be traced to the patriarchal social system, which lies at the heart of our culture and sub-consciously in each individual. Patriarchy causes diff erentiated behavior between the genders leading to sexual discrimination. Women are looked at as inferior or subordinate to men, good only for sex or for the home. It can even allocate and justify the right and authority of men to use violence against women and children. Thus, women tend to see violence against them as something that they should be ashamed of, or that it is somehow their fault. They thus try to hide the violence, scared that if it were known publicly they would be judged by society. It is necessary for women to break the culture of silence and report and fi ght back against any form of violence infl icted upon them. 61 SESSION 5.4 Division of Domestic Work Division of Domestic Work54 SESSION 62 A Community Training Manual Objectives: 1. To understand the situation of the division of domestic work between men and women in the household. 2. To discuss what kind of change is possible and what can be done to change the situation Time: 1 hour 30 minutes 63 SESSION 5.4 Division of Domestic Work Input and Discussion: (10 minutes) Division of Domestic Work In traditional rural societies, agricultural work is based on a division of labor between women and men. For example in paddy farming, the men do the plowing and clearing of the land, which are considered heavy work. The women do the lighter work that requires long hours and days such as weeding. Harvesting is often done together by both men and women. However, domestic or housework (excluding or including child rearing) are mostly left to the women. This is true today, even in some cases where the women may be the main income earners of the family. Housework ranges from cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing (in modern-day), fetching water and gathering fi rewood. Although modern appliances such as gas cookers and washing machines have lightened the burden of housework, other work and responsibilities have been added to women\u2019s workload such as managing the household expenses, paying the bills, etc. As with many gender issues, it is often very diffi cult to discuss about division of domestic work with our husbands, brothers and parents in a family. This is because comments tend to be taken as accusatory and the discussion can therefore become polarized and personalized. As such, there is a need to discuss these issues at the community level. A fi rst step would be to determine the most conducive venue and eff ective way to bring up the issue. Exercise II - Role Playing: Introducing issues of division of house work (20 minutes) Exercise I - Task Division in our Family (20 minutes) 1. Divide the participants into 2 groups. 2. Group 1 makes a list of men\u2019s work in the house. 3. Group 2 makes a list of the work done by women in the house. 4. The two groups then come together, compare lists and discuss how domestic tasks are divided in the family.

Discuss the best scenario and condition to discuss the issue. 64 A Community Training Manual 1. Discussions can be done in one big plenary group. The facilitator draws out the ideas of the participants on following questions: u What kind of change is possible? u What can be done to change the situation? 2. Discuss the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of the following changes. Visualize the answers by writing the pro\u2019s and cons on cards and pasting them in the appropriate column for each change. u Employ a househelp. u Buy more modern gadgets. u Inculcate in male children the willingness to do housework from a young age. u Ask men to do the cooking and cleaning in the house. u Ask men to carry fi rewood and water during community activities or when the organization has a live-in programme. u Inculcate respect for men who are willing to help women in their housework and not to frown or laugh at them. 3. The facilitator summarizes the results of the group discussion and relates it to the objectives of the session. Discussion: (10 minutes) It is obvious that women are generally overburdened with domestic work. Thus, they do not have the time to participate in meetings or to go to other places for exposure programmes. These are venues that can provide the space for women to express their views and to have a say in decisions that aff ect women and the society. If this situation is not changed, then the present and next generation of women will continue to be discriminated and will not attain a positions of decision making in society. Exercise III \u2013 Group Discussion: Bringing about Changes (30 minutes) 67 SESSION 6 : International Instruments on Indigenous Women and Decision-making International Instruments on Indigenous Women and Decision-making 6 SESSION 68 A Community Training Manual Objectives: 1. To situate indigenous women within the wider international context 2. To raise awarness/learn of existing international instruments that recognize the rights and role of indigenous women in decision-making 3. To explore how indigenous women can have a voice in decision-making in the international arena. Time: 2 hours 69 SESSION 6 : International Instruments on Indigenous Women and Decision-making Input and Discussion: (10 minutes) Impacts of International Policies on Indigenous Women By tracing the impacts of international policies on indigenous women, we can see that we are all aff ected by decisions being made by policy-makers at the international level. For example, the World Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture has imposed quotas for the importation of agricultural products on underdeveloped countries. This has resulted in the fl ooding of the market with imported food, which compete with local products. This has also pushed local farmers to shift to modern high-yielding varieties of crops that are dependent on agro-chemical inputs and imported seeds. Buying of imported food and seeds has marginalized indigenous women from subsistence agriculture and has led to the loss of the important role of women in seed selection. Another example is Structural Adjustment Programs (SAP) imposed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund on indebted underdeveloped countries. These SAPs include cost- cutting and revenue-raising measures by government in order to pay their foreign debt, such as privatization and reduction of subsidies for basic social services. This is one reason why social services, such as water, electricity, education, health services for the grassroots are sorely neglected, which in turn has resulted in a heavier domestic burden for indigenous women. Still another example is the liberalization policy, which has pushed governments to open up their natural resources for exploitation by foreign multinational corporations. This is why we now see mining operations, megadam construction, energy projects, logging, plantations on indigenous peoples\u2019 territories. Many of these development projects displace indigenous peoples\u2019 from their land and territories leading to homelessness, unemployment and poverty. Ultimately, indigenous women are aff ected by major international developments and policies, thus the need for indigenous women to make our voices heard and take part in decision-making up to the international level.

The groups present their mind maps. 70 A Community Training Manual Input and Discussion: (20 minutes) Knowing international instruments There are number of existing international instruments that recognize the rights and role of indigenous women in decision-making. These can be presented in a chart or visual aid showing the diff erent instruments, their main features and how these can be used by indigenous women. Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979): It requires all States to take \u201call appropriate measures, including legislation, to ensure the full development and advancement of women, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms on a basis of equality of men.\u201d This is the main international treaty specifi c to women. Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the fi rst international document that states that all human beings are \u201cequal in dignity and rights.\u201d (Article 1) Everybody is entitled to the rights in the Declaration, \u201cwithout distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\u201d (Article 2) International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) This Covenant outlines the basic civil and political rights of individuals. There are also provisions for collective rights. \u201cIn those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members Exercise II - Agree/Disagree: Can women have a voice in decision-making in international arena? (20 minutes) 1. Pose the following questions to participants and ask them to physically stand in two groups: Group 1 \u2013 Agree, Group 2 \u2013 Disagree 2. Discuss the reasons for their decision and propose solutions. u Women cannot participate in international meetings because men have been attending these meetings and therefore better experienced and able to negotiate better Solution: Must get women to participate in these meetings, otherwise, they will never learn. u Women cannot participate in international meetings because many women do not speak English Solution: Then choose those who can speak English or fi nd an interpreter u International instruments like CEDAW are just nice on paper but cannot be implemented at the local and national level. Solution: True, but it can also be a tool for education and once women are aware of these international standards, they could fi nd ways to call for its implementation. 71 SESSION 6 : International Instruments on Indigenous Women and Decision-making of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own religion, or to use their own language.\u201d (Article 27) International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966) This Covenant describes the basic economic, social, and cultural rights of individuals. It also has provisions for collective rights. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1966) \u201cRacial discrimination\u201d is defi ned as \u201cany distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or eff ect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other fi eld of public life.\u201d (Article 1) International Labor Organization Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, 1989 (No. 169) ILO Convention No 169 - and the earlier ILO Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Populations, 1957 (No. 107) \u2013 is the only international convention specifi c to indigenous peoples. It outlines the responsibilities of governments in promoting and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples, and contains comprehensive provisions relating to land and resource rights, consultation and participation, rights to mother tongue instruction and labour rights. Convention on the Rights of the Child (1990) The Convention contains regulations and suggestions relevant to Indigenous Peoples on the non-discrimination of children (Article 2), the broadcasting of information by the mass media in minority languages (Article 17), the right to education, including education on human rights, its own cultural identity, language and values. (Article 29) Article 30 states that children of minorities or indigenous origin shall not be denied the right to their own culture, religion or language.

United Nations Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples This is the most comprehensive statement of the rights of Indigenous Peoples to date, establishing collective rights to a greater extent than any other document in international human rights law. It establishes the rights of Indigenous Peoples to the protection of their cultural property and identity as well as the rights to education, employment, health, religion, language and more. It also protects the right of Indigenous Peoples to own land collectively. Although States are not legally bound by the Declaration, it will exert a considerable amount of moral force when adopted by the General Assembly. 72 A Community Training Manual HerStory of Tining Tining is an indigenous woman belonging to the Kalinga people of the Cordillera Region in the Philippines. She is a farmer, a mother of two children, who got married at age 16 and was widowed at age 23. They produce rice, vegetables and other crops, both in rice paddies and swidden farms in their community of Dupag, Kalinga. They use manual methods of farming, which make the work in the fi elds diffi cult and tiring. They continue to practice traditional agricultural knowledge, indigenous varieties and rituals that are sustainable and conserve the environment. In the 1970s, the Philippine government planned to build four dams along the Chico River to be funded by the World Bank. The construction of these huge hydroelectric dams would have resulted in the fl ooding of rice fi elds, houses and whole communities of the Kalinga and Bontoc people along the Chico River valley. Tining was one of those who joined the anti-Chico Dam struggle in the Cordillera during the 1970s. They sent petitions, held dialogues, rallies, long marches, dismantled camps of the surveyors, set up barricades and conducted numerous protest actions. Women played key roles in the resistance to the dams. In the course of the struggle, they had to endure militarization, arrests, detention, harassment, off ers of bribery, even death. But in the end, the people\u2019s actions were successful in stopping the construction of the dams. The struggle led to the formation of various organizations, including women\u2019s organizations. Tining helped set up her own women\u2019s organization in Dupag and later on became the chairperson of Innabuyog, the provincial federation of women organizations in Kalinga and of the Cordillera Peoples\u2019 Alliance Kalinga chapter. In 1995, Tining was one of the delegates to the Beijing 4th World Conference on Women. Here, she spoke of her experiences as a farmer and indigenous woman representing her network in the Cordillera during the World Public Hearing on Crimes Against Indigenous Women. She also took part in the drafting of the Beijing Indigenous Women\u2019s Declaration. Today, Tining continues to farm, work with her organization and participate in various activities. Her story is an example of how women can contribute to the indigenous peoples\u2019 movement for the recognition of their rights to land and self-determination. How can we improve grassroots indigenous women\u2019s voices and participation in the international arena? (10 minutes) Introduce the story of Tining, an indigenous woman farmer who experienced being involved in international activities. Discussion: (10 minutes) Indigenous women can participate through various ways in the international arena. This can be done through our own participation in local activities, organizations and community struggles and the projection of these concerns to the international public through the media and information dissemination activities. This can also be done through the participation of our leaders, organizations and networks in international activities, processes and campaigns. Another way is to have solidarity linkages and cross-learning with other indigenous women. In this way, we can learn of the situation and concerns of other indigenous women and join hand and forces in letting our voices be heard internationally. 73 SESSION 6 : International Instruments on Indigenous Women and Decision-making Exercise III - Workshop: Overcoming Dilemmas (20 minutes) 1. Discuss the problems/dilemmas of women in participating in international meetings. Write down the answers on the board.

To become familiar with the existing national laws and policies on women and indigenous peoples. 2. To analyze the advantages and limitations of such laws and policies. 3. To explore possible opportunities for advocacy and promoting women\u2019s participation in decision-making at the national level. Time: 1 hour 30 minutes 77 SESSION 7 : National Laws and Policies on Women and Women\u2019s Participation in Decision-making at the National Level Input and Discussion: (30 minutes) National laws and policies exist that could be either advantageous or disadvantageous to women and their participation in decision-making. There are some examples from diff erent countries that can be cited. For example, in the Philippines, the Gender and Development Code requires all government agencies and local government units to set aside 5% of the budget for Gender and Development activities that benefi t women. This policy could be advantageous if the funds are used properly for projects or activities that truly address women\u2019s needs and concerns. However, when not used properly, the funds could be squandered on meaningless activities in the name of \u201cgender and development\u201d. There also exists a National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women at the national level that acts as an advisory body under the Offi ce of the President, aside from Gender Focal Points in various government agencies. In addition, a new law, the \u201cAnti-Violence Against Women and Children Act\u201d of 2004 provides measures to protect women and children from physical and emotional abuse by their husbands or partners and prescribes punishment for perpetrators. Some of the most important national laws and policies that are important for the participants to know about in their own country can be presented in visual form, with the main features of the law and how they are relevant to indigenous women. Exercise I \u2013 Card Collection: Advantages and Limitations of National Laws and Policies (30 minutes) 1. Participants are given 2 colors of manila cards. Ask them to write down on the cards the advantages and limitations of the various national laws and policies discussed earlier. One color for advantages and another color for limitations. 2. After writing, the participants paste their cards on the board, advantages in one column and limitations on the other. 3. The facilitator reads the answers, leads the discussion and summarizes the essential elements of the advantages and limitations of the national laws and policies. We can maximize the advantages and opportunities off ered by national laws and policies, at the same time being aware of its limitations. For instance, we can use existing bodies at the national level as possible venues for bringing indigenous women\u2019s issues to the attention of concerned authorities. At the same, we have to have realistic expectations on what these bodies can do or be critical of their limitations. 78 1. Divide the participants into smaller groups. Each group discusses and answers the following questions: (20 minutes) What are the opportunities available for advocacy at the national level? How can indigenous women take advantage of these opportunities? 2. The groups report the results of their discussion. (10 minutes) 3. The facilitator summarizes the main points of the reports.

Recall what happened in Exercise I. Ask the participants the reasons why some took responsibilities and why the others were passive with respect to the formation of the Programme Committee. No need to go into details, just to try to evoke some ideas on the pros and cons of taking roles and responsibilities. 2. The facilitator can also recall the results of Session 1 on Women and Decision-Making in the Community on why women are not willing to take up decision-making positions. 3. Discuss the various dilemmas that indigenous women face when tasking on roles and responsibilities. Visualize their answers by writing them on the board. Some of the issues could include: u Women\u2019s fear of being Overloaded and Overburdened u Dilemmas with family responsibilities u No family support u Lack of confi dence u Lack of skills u \u201cLet others do it\u201d attitude u Tendency to rely on leaders u Fear of being criticized 4. Discuss and visualize how these dilemmas could be overcome by writing the answers on cards and sticking them on the board. Discussion: When we examine the concept of position in indigenous societies, we need to look at the pros and cons of taking up roles and responsibilities in the public sphere and consider the hurdles we face. Firstly, it is important to recognize some of the dilemmas within us when we take up roles and responsibilities in the public sphere. Exercise II - Buzz Session: Dilemmas We Face When Taking On Responsibilities (20 minutes) Exercise I: Forming a Committee for the Cultural Evening (10 minutes) A real exercise to observe rationalization in taking up roles and responsibilities 1. Start the exercise without telling the participants that it is part of the session. Inform them of tonight\u2019s cultural evening where everyone will need to share their culture, food and other activities. They are encouraged to form a programme committee, where they can take on the following roles: u Master of Ceremonies u Preparing the Programme u In-charge of food u In-charge of preparing the venue u Giving a short speech of appreciation to the local host on behalf of all participants 2. Observe how the participants select those responsible or how readily they take on positions/responsibilities. 84 A Community Training Manual Discussion: Let us now look at our own position in our own community and draw some appropriate strategies to improve our decision-making position in society. As was discussed in the previous sessions, society\u2019s stereotypes on women and decision-making may have also curtailed women\u2019s interest in assuming positions in the public sphere. If we recognize that it is critical for women to be part of the decision-making structure in the community and outside the community (e.g. organizations, political and local government structures), it is thus important to rectify the stereotypes and launch women into decision-making positions. 1. Divide the participants into small groups. Ask them to discuss the following questions: (30 minutes) u What can be done to place indigenous women in decision-making positions in the community and/or organization? u What can women do to infl uence decision-making in the community and to address IP women issues? 2. The groups present the results of their discussions written in manila paper. (20 minutes) 3. The facilitator summarizes the answers and includes some of the following suggestions on how women can put themselves in decision-making positions and how they can infl uence decision-making in the community and organization: (10 minutes) u Include some provisions in the organization\u2019s by-laws and principles setting a gender balance to invite women leaders to hold positions. u Ask traditional council to include women as a matter of fairness. u Prepare women candidates beforehand to accept positions if they are nominated. u Lobby voters/community to elect women leaders u Assertiveness of women to be included in decision-making u Visibility of women leaders in the organization/community\u2019s activities. Synthesis: (10 minutes) Traditional decision-making process is unique in the sense that decisions are made with the involvement of the whole community, not just by the council of elders. Indigenous societies have informal mechanisms in which consensus is reached after several deliberations and discussions, often through social gatherings. In some societies, there exist venues for discussing issues and problems such as in the murung (Nagas), dap-ay (Kankana\u2019ey) or special meetings such as among the Ibans. In most societies, informal social talks e.g. during drinking, eating, weddings, funerals or simply sitting around an open fi re are opportunities where opinions are formed. These could be opportunities where empowered ordinary women and men in indigenous society can infl uence decisions-makers in the community and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c52d1fd-a925-44f9-8f44-16ae4bc98a84": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c52d1fd-a925-44f9-8f44-16ae4bc98a84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and Decision-Making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e098c650475bdfd3f283aa50870d72fa0a7a72a46b8e31d68437e90f5ab8529"}, "3": {"node_id": "87b6cdaf-9094-4182-b63d-5f30ffd3b649", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-decision-making", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "428e7de44679698fb0264a560c8f9620b5e1764dea2bf17d9d967a920fd62f55"}}, "hash": "3252830080b1fff8af524b81076c82fc188344005fe9fab0e24a874b5995c82b", "text": "local government offi cials on various gender issues. Such opportunities have to be identifi ed and strategies developed in order to bring about changes in these structures. These changes could give women more space in decision-making positions, or simply infl uence others to make decisions that are gender sensitive. In present-day community organizations, empowered women and men can organize community trainings or workshops. Local government institutions can also be encouraged to ensure that decisions made on issues of women are a concern for the whole community. Exercise III - Workshop: How Do We Put Women in Decision-Making Positions? (1 hour) 87 SESSION 9 : Follow Up Plans Follow Up Plans9 SESSION 88 A Community Training Manual Objectives: 1.

In recognition of this role, the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues1 devoted its third session (2004)2 to a dis\u00ad course on the unique contributions made by indigenous women within their families, communities and nations. While lauding their contributions, the Forum did express concern at the multiple forms of discrimination that indigenous women faced, based on their gender, race, ethnicity and low socio\u00adeconomic status. This, the Forum noted, had led to a complex web of problems that must be tackled. For example, globalization has presented new challenges and prob\u00ad lems for indigenous women in many parts of the world. Indigenous women\u2019s roles are often eroded as their livelihood built on accessibility to natural resources disappears, ecosystems are depleted and others are transformed into cash economies. This has produced profound changes not only at the local level and within social and decision\u00admaking struc\u00ad tures but within their families as well. It is important, however, to recognize that indigenous women, like women everywhere else, are not a homogeneous group. They in fact represent a wide variety of cultures with different needs and concerns. Their particular concerns should therefore be central to the design of any policy or programme. The Inter\u00adAgency Network on Women and Gender Equality, at its February 2004 session, decided to establish a Task Force on Indigenous Women as a follow\u00adup to recommendations emanating from the Perma\u00ad nent Forum on Indigenous Issues at its third session. The Task Force is chaired by the Forum secretariat. The members of the Task Force are the secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Common\u00ad wealth Secretariat, the Division for the Advancement of Women of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Sec\u00ad retariat, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Economic Commission for Africa, the International Labour Organi\u00ad 1 Established by Economic and Social Council resolution 2000/22 of 28 July 2000. 2 The report of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues on its third session is contained in Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 2004, Supplement No. 23 (E/2004/43). iv Indigenous Women and the United Nations System zation, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Develop\u00ad ment Fund for Women, the World Health Organization and the Inter\u00ad Agency Task Force on Gender and Water of the Division for Sustainable Development of the Department of Economic and Social", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4b60a31-59fc-438f-9fec-4f6a519987bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4b60a31-59fc-438f-9fec-4f6a519987bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and the United Nations System", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d01b1327cdc8a37fce9e743c82e94414a09b9737559d746e9e4aeb681c51dfb"}}, "hash": "7d01b1327cdc8a37fce9e743c82e94414a09b9737559d746e9e4aeb681c51dfb", "text": "Affairs. The main purpose of the Task Force on Indigenous Women is to in\u00ad tegrate and strengthen gender mainstreaming in the work of the United Nations system that affects indigenous people, while highlighting the roles of indigenous women and the urgent need to address all the forms of discrimination that they face. This is an important challenge for the United Nations as well as for Member States. The Task Force adopted a three\u00adyear programme of work. As part of its programme of activities, the Task Force has collected a series of good practices in addressing the problems that indigenous women face. On behalf of the Inter\u00adAgency Network on Women and Gender Equality, I am very pleased to share these case studies with you. I want to thank the United Nations organizations that submitted the case studies, namely, the secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the International Labour Organization, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the United Nations Development Programme. The case studies that have been drawn from Africa, Asia and Latin America show how important it is to strengthen local initiatives by sys\u00ad tematically building solidarity, alliances and partnerships within and across borders while respecting the point of view of the poor and the underserved. The case studies show that indigenous women have suc\u00ad ceeded in building on the victories of other human rights movements and are moving forward with the conviction that development can be theirs without sacrificing dignity, human rights and justice. The case studies further demonstrate that through gender mainstreaming as well as through programmes targeting women, much can be accomplished to improve the livelihoods of the very poor, to reduce gender discrimina\u00ad tion and to contribute to the realization of the Millennium Development Goals. I thank the secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Is\u00ad sues and the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United v Preface Nations Secretariat for the compilation of these case studies, which are both informative and highly educative. Rachel Mayanga Chairperson Inter\u00adAgency Network on Women and Gender Equality Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women Indigenous women and the Convention on Biological Diversity Work of the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity with indigenous women (2000-2005) The Convention on Biological Diversity1 in its preamble, recognizes \u201cthe vital role that women play in the conservation and sustainable use of bio\u00ad logical diversity\u201d and affirms \u201cthe need for the full participation of women at all levels of policymaking and implementation for biological diversity conservation\u201d. A specific framework for the participation of indigenous women is found in the programme of work on the implementation of article 8 ( j) and related provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity2 regard\u00ad ing participatory mechanisms for indigenous and local communities. In this regard, task 4 of the first phase of the programme of work urged: Parties to develop, as appropriate, mechanisms for promoting the full and effective participation of indigenous and local communi\u00ad ties with specific provisions for the full, active and effective partici\u00ad pation of women in all elements of the programme of work, taking into account the need to: Build on the basis of their knowledge Strengthen their access to biological diversity Strengthen their capacity on matters pertaining to the conservation, maintenance and protection of biological diversity Promote the exchange of experiences and knowledge Promote culturally appropriate and gender\u00adspecific ways in which to document and preserve women\u2019s knowledge of biological diversity In order to ensure the full involvement and participation of indig\u00ad enous women in the work being carried out under the Convention on Biological Diversity with regard to traditional knowledge, the Secretariat \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 1 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1760, No. 30619. 2 Contained in the annex to decision V/16, adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention at its fifth meeting, held in Nairobi from 15 to 26 May 2000 (see document UNEP/CBD/COP/5/23, annex III). 1 2 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System takes into account gender considerations when selecting participants for meetings, when undertaking research work, when creating experts groups and, in general, when engaging in all activities related to policy\u00adcreation and implementation of the provisions of the Convention.

In the United Re\u00ad public of Tanzania, the project supported one research study that explored local knowledge of the Maasai on breeding and selection of cattle, sheep and goats and its relation to the goals of food security and herd survival. Maasai pastoralists possess a specific knowledge system that they have used for generations to maintain their livestock and their production system. This study set out to investigate local knowledge, preferences and 2 4 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System criteria regarding breeding and selection, and the differentiation of local knowledge depending on roles, responsibilities, age and gender. Further\u00ad more, possible changes in local knowledge under the influence of migra\u00ad tion were investigated. The preliminary results of this study will be high\u00ad lighted here. What was planned (objectives and main activities) The main objective of the study was to understand the dynamics of lo\u00ad cal knowledge on breeding and selection of livestock in the Maasai com\u00ad munity and to determine whether changes in the local knowledge system occurred when the Maasai migrated to different agro\u00adecological zones. The specific objectives were to explore preferences and criteria for the breed\u00ad ing and selection of cattle, sheep and goats of the Maasai in two different regions, one in Simanjiro (in the northern part of the United Republic of Tanzania and presumed to be the area in which the Maasai had originated) and the other in Mbarali (in the southern part of the United Republic of Tanzania, a preferred migration area for the Maasai for the last 30\u00ad50 years). The local knowledge systems of the Maasai from these two regions were specifically verified in relation to: Gender and age Roles and responsibilities Decision\u00admaking Goals and food security and herd survival What the strategy was The research team was a multidisciplinary group of scientists and extension staff who identified the main stakeholders and tried to involve them as far as possible in the study.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec37cae2-f846-4c34-8526-5a0f196c65ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec37cae2-f846-4c34-8526-5a0f196c65ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and the United Nations System", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc5173e479beab53bbf0affdaff99c901fd035d27b2cf46697ede34415559de3"}, "2": {"node_id": "a60b757a-f532-4b84-b624-c4a41d0890c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fa7abf670d7df718a9be44ff47eefc2caaffe9a58865dd50057ac1711df99d1"}}, "hash": "fd2129edcf80b888e6dd78a5cf638d1f6ea60892fd3ab5bc2f1366d78b1099b0", "text": "During the field visits, the team applied a par\u00ad ticipatory action research approach, using tools and gender analysis tools specific to this approach.

Phase one focused on the Maasai in Simanjiro; phase two focused on the Maasai who had migrated to Mbarali; and phase three entailed the organization of visits between the Maasai of the two regions so as to give them the opportunity to exchange experiences, and to enable each group to understand how the other had responded to conditions in different agro\u00adecological zones. The exchange visits offered an excellent opportunity for all of the participants to learn from each other. \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 5 Indigenous women and FAO Who was involved The participants comprised a multidisciplinary team of seven researchers, consisting of social scientists, animal scientists, breeders and veterinarians from the Ministry of Water and Livestock Development, the University of Dar es Salaam and Sokoine University of Agriculture, district extension staff and pastoral/agropastoral communities. Sustainability Some members of the research team understood that the Maasai were true livestock specialists and that they practised animal breeding for specific purposes. Furthermore, they understood very well that Maasai women had in\u00addepth knowledge and understanding of livestock, that they knew the animals they milked very well and that they played important roles in mon\u00ad itoring the animals, giving advice to their husbands about breeding and treating sick animals. The research study led to much\u00adincreased awareness of the importance for the Maasai of local knowledge in livestock breeding. Awareness\u00adraising material will soon be available for extension staff, researchers and policymakers. Replication/spin-off effects All of the members of the research team went through an intensive on\u00adthe\u00ad job learning process. Their understanding of the Maasai and their local knowledge systems was increased and new insights were derived from their experiences. Hopefully, the research team members will apply this know\u00ad ledge and experience to their future work and to the dissemination of the research results. What was learned It is important to work with a multidisciplinary team to achieve a better and an in\u00addepth understanding of the complex local knowledge systems of the Maasai. A detailed gender analysis at the beginning of the study was crucial. Intensive training in data collection and a clear understanding by the research team of the concepts of \u201cgender, local know\u00ad ledge and biodiversity\u201d were necessary before entry to the field. During data collection, it was important to collect information separately from men and women groups of the Maasai. This gender disaggregation was important with respect to under\u00ad standing different gender roles and responsibilities. Gender roles and responsibilities are flexible and adapt them\u00ad selves to changing situations (drought, diseases etc.) and outside influences (policies, markets etc.). Therefore, it is necessary to \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 6 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System conduct a careful, in\u00addepth examination in the rural commu\u00ad nities of the ways in which men and women respond to these outside challenges. Triangulation of information is extremely important. The re\u00ad search study was divided into three parts. After each field visit, the data were analysed, a report was prepared and the results were presented, in a feedback workshop, to the agro\u00adpastoral community and the stakeholders. The preparation of the next field visit reflected the comments and discussions. It is difficult to collect information on local knowledge: people often do not value this knowledge themselves and therefore do not share it. Maasai women play an important role in selecting animals for breeding. Owing to their daily contact with cows while milking them, Maasai women are able to monitor the animals closely. In respect of the breeding of animals, women have their own prioritizing criteria. This information is regularly shared with their husbands and the other men of the boma. Women monitor animals and their health situation closely. Women take care of sick animals and prepare medicine for their treatment and also treat less serious diseases. Women are responsible for newborn calves, their mothers etc. Women are responsible for milk management; the income from selling milk products is controlled by women. Women and children may possess their own animals, which are managed together with the herd of the boma. Women have control over their own animals. Outside influences: when men, from time to time, leave the boma in search of additional income earning opportunities, women assume greater and greater responsibility for the herd and its management. Factors contributing to success The research team participated in various workshops con\u00ad ducted to sensitize them regarding gender, participation, local knowledge etc. Each of the different steps of the study was followed by a work\u00ad shop focused on analysis, report writing, feedback to the pas\u00ad toral community, and planning of the next step.

Destroying the myths is a definite challenge! The confrontation of local knowledge and scientific knowledge. Local knowledge (and especially women\u2019s knowledge) was thought to have little value. Local animal breeds and the local knowledge associated with them were not valued very highly either by researchers or by the agropastoralists themselves. This lack of esteem for local traditions was a challenging factor in the study and throughout the project.

The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) co\u00adfinanced Programme aims to generate direct benefits to 16,000 rural indigenous households. In April\u00adMay 2003, shortly after PRODEVER was launched, an evaluation was undertaken to determine the differences between the situation of men and that of women in the Department. It was found that women interested in participating in the development activities 3 10 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System supported by PRODEVER would have to either hire someone from out\u00ad side the family to take care of the children and prepare meals, or take their eldest daughter out of school and have her take charge of these activities. Women were found to suffer from lower education levels, higher rates of il\u00ad literacy (80 per cent), less ability to speak the mainstream language (Span\u00ad ish), heavier domestic workloads, poorer knowledge of their rights, weaker citizenship in their communities, lower self\u00adesteem, and non\u00adrecognition of their contributions to family livelihoods in the male\u00adoriented local cul\u00ad ture. The study provided the information needed for detailed planning of the activities to be supported by PRODEVER. What was planned The overall goal of PRODEVER is to reduce poverty among the rural families living in the poorest municipalities of Las Verapaces Department. Its specific objectives are to: (a) increase their incomes by promoting farm\u00ad ing and non\u00adfarming income\u00adgenerating activities; (b) promote and con\u00ad solidate their local organizations as strong community\u00adbased institutions; (c) improve their access to rural financial services; (d ) introduce a gender\u00ad sensitive approach to all programme\u00adfinanced activities; (e) preserve and strengthen their natural resource base for future generations; and (f ) pro\u00ad mote their integration into the mainstream of the national economy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29fe396c-29dc-4be2-90e8-721aef3daa6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "29fe396c-29dc-4be2-90e8-721aef3daa6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and the United Nations System", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e37e8af252a032493189962a9c466f9c74219037a7bbb37016e9492094c323b"}, "2": {"node_id": "16306884-fe2a-4636-a454-b5535dea364c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59d6c287d476de4e49fa6eb802a6594d48e81aebfe213e7af5402b730250bd8c"}}, "hash": "f112a6a58927059dd0261b915ade5a577ef354e37b1b8a51d21ce746fdfb99c0", "text": "The purpose of the Programme\u2019s gender\u00adsensitive approach is to create the con\u00ad ditions necessary for women as well as men to gain access to and exercise equitable control over the services, resources and benefits resulting from the Programme.

The violence was concentrated in the small towns and remote villages, with particularly devastating ef\u00ad fects on the women and children of the K\u2019iche, Pocomchi and K\u2019ekch\u2019i peoples. In addition to enhancing food security, boosting incomes and im\u00ad proving the living conditions of at least 10,000 smallholder families living in 10 municipalities of the two Departments, the Programme of Recon\u00ad struction and Development for the Quiche and Proderqui Departments (PRODERQUI) aims to rebuild the social fabric and contribute to the consolidation of peace by strengthening local indigenous organizations, rebuilding the small productive units of indigenous farmers that were destroyed or abandoned during the years of violence, and promoting the socio\u00adeconomic reintegration of the populations most affected by the con\u00ad flict. The rationale for the Programme\u2019s gender\u00adsensitive approach and methodology is the fact that: (a) a high proportion of the households in the post\u00adconflict areas are headed by women (30 per cent in Quiche); and (b) women can be excellent mediators in a peace process, often contribut\u00ad ing in decisive ways to reconciliation and reconstruction. 15 Indigenous women and IFAD What was planned The main objective of PRODERQUI is to promote the installation of ef\u00ad fective technical support mechanisms and activities within a broad range of areas that can help both women and men to: increase their incomes from farming and non\u00adfarming income\u00adgenerating activities; recapitalize their small\u00adscale productive units damaged during the conflict and create new ones; consolidate their local organizations and institutions; enhance the role of rural women in economic and social affairs; contribute to the long\u00adterm conservation of natural resources and the environment; and support the rights of indigenous communities with respect to their terri\u00ad tory, their natural resources and their cultural values. What the strategy was The thrusts of the strategy encompass: (a) Gender as a cross-cutting issue. The original design of the Pro\u00ad gramme had included a sub\u00adcomponent specifically designed to promote women\u2019s projects. This design was modified in 2000, placing gender eq\u00ad uity at the core of all activities to be financed under the Programme. Since then, all personnel and partner organizations have been expected to adopt a gender\u00adsensitive approach that perceives the family as a whole, including women as well as men, as the focal point for all their activi\u00ad ties. The institution cooperating with IFAD, namely, the United Nations Office for Project Services, also hired two gender specialists \u2014 a woman and a man \u2014 to guide and supervise implementation of the new gender approach. Under the terms of reference laid down in their contracts, they are encouraged to make strong recommendations to Programme manage\u00ad ment on how to push for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment; (b) Alleviating women\u2019s workload. The strategy emphasizes the im\u00ad portance of finding ways to reduce the time spent by women on tasks like fetching water and firewood, preparing meals etc., so that they will have time to participate in development activities. Relevant aspects include: en\u00ad abling access to clean water; food security; more profitable women\u2019s micro\u00ad enterprises; silos to store staple cereals; and a food\u00adfor\u00adtraining programme aimed at allowing women to participate in greater numbers; (c) Food security. This is a major focus in the communities where a majority of the inhabitants are living in extreme poverty. Groups of women, in particular, are being trained on how to improve the produc\u00ad tivity of their vegetable gardens and orchards, are receiving egg\u00adlaying poultry and are being assisted in the creation of revolving group funds; (d) Gender training of social promoters. Trained gender promot\u00ad ers \u2014 14 men and 4 women \u2014 are encouraging more women to grow ir\u00ad rigated vegetables for cash sale. Their training on subjects like gender 16 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System and participation places the family as a whole at the centre of efforts to promote more productive activities; (e) Municipal women\u2019s offices. The Programme\u2019s general strategy of gender equality, which is based both on the Peace Agreements and the Laws of Social Development Decree 42\u00ad2001 and on the decentralization laws, is promoting the active participation of all women \u2014 indigenous and non\u00adindigenous \u2014 in local development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cecfc2ae-adc3-4b06-8a9c-f20d3d9c2ff1": {"__data__": {"id_": "cecfc2ae-adc3-4b06-8a9c-f20d3d9c2ff1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and the United Nations System", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47a2ee7e5206df75003ca3a4916d64e3d506e26ff9ccfa67f93e218cde034186"}, "2": {"node_id": "185b6f97-bada-4c64-92a8-9371826e8e32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60c15e9b21ff0fcc56d55e48e9f1f65b6f49c7293f0b8554c42b75cf1e78cca5"}}, "hash": "1fdb3276e2d5f4ccb5bd962c8741becee9e489380878c8dba6a89d743b675ff0", "text": "These laws have enabled the creation of municipal women\u2019s offices with the mandate to undertake both advocacy and lobbying in favour of women\u2019s views and priorities in partici\u00ad patory planning processes.

The region is inhabited by five ethnic groups, of which three (Ember\u00e1, Wounaan and Kuna) are indigenous and two (Afro\u00addescendientes and Mestizos) are non\u00adindigenous. Indigenous terri\u00ad tories within the region are self\u00admanaged by elected traditional authorities. The main sources of subsistence and income are extractive activities like hunting, fishing and logging, as well as slash\u00adand\u00adburn agriculture. Crafts are an important activity for indigenous women. What was planned The Sustainable Agricultural Development and Environmental Protection Project for the Dari\u00e9n (PRODARIEN) was designed to improve rural liv\u00ad ing conditions by fostering community organizations and strengthening traditional institutions and governance. Recognizing the importance of extractive activities, it includes a training programme on environmental sustainability and promotes replanting of trees. It also aims at improv\u00ad 20 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System ing agriculture by facilitating access to extension, credit and training on marketing skills.

Other national and in\u00ad ternational organizations, such as Fundaci\u00f3n Natura (Nature Foundation) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), have expressed interest in creating alliances in the region. What was learned Women\u2019s interests and agendas differ from those of men (for example, women tend to be more interested in family planning and other aspects of reproductive health). Projects must analyse these differences and make provisions for appropriate initiatives also for women. There are structural barriers to the participation of indigenous women. Projects must take account of these barriers so as to be able to promote equality of opportunities.

Between 2003 and 2004, follow\u00ad ing the implementation by the Department of Agrarian Reform of the 2001 IFAD\u00adfinanced Western Mindanao Community Initiatives Project (WMCIP), an IFAD technical assistance grant (TAG No. 486) to the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) made it pos\u00ad sible to provide technical assistance in documenting the ethno\u00adbotanical knowledge of the Subanen indigenous communities, especially women. What was planned The objectives of the project were fourfold: (a) to facilitate local par\u00ad ticipatory natural resource management planning of ancestral domains; (b) to assist indigenous organizations in identifying and documenting all their traditional rice varieties, and all their wild plants and animals; (c) to establish the property rights of local communities over their knowledge systems and practices; and (d) to ensure that no biological specimens or genetic resources left the area without the \u201cfree and prior informed con\u00ad sent\u201d of the concerned communities. A fourfold approach to the docu\u00ad mentation work was adopted, encompassing: 25 Indigenous women and IFAD (a) Multidisciplinary documentation. A team of local researchers, half of them women, explored and documented the expertise of tribal plant experts. The team was supported by a multidisciplinary team of specialists; (b) Participatory documentation. All the documentation activities focused on consensus\u00adbuilding and the convergence of the interests of the indigenous communities and the institutions involved. The commu\u00ad nities were empowered by the transferring of the skills in technical docu\u00ad mentation to the women and men making up the team. The Subanen community, especially women, carried out most of the documentation work, with the institutions as facilitators. Members of the community were involved at all stages, from that of the setting of research priorities through the stages of data gathering and processing, and the production of knowledge outputs. Illiterate but knowledgeable community elders, especially women, provided the information which was documented by literate younger members of the community; (c) Culturally sensitive documentation. The ethno\u00adbotanical docu\u00ad mentation work was conducted in a manner that was deliberately sensitive to local culture. Outsiders respected customary rules and behaviour dur\u00ad ing fieldwork: for example, ritual offerings before entering a documenta\u00ad tion site; a thanksgiving ceremony upon leaving it; respect for taboos on matters (guarded secrets) whose public revelation was perceived as likely to compromise the well\u00adbeing of the entire community etc.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b91c52ed-9928-40f0-ad40-ebeb00ad5518": {"__data__": {"id_": "b91c52ed-9928-40f0-ad40-ebeb00ad5518", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and the United Nations System", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9db5b57a077f9fda361c3fa6806b6617dd8a83fe487bc3d2546ffc5ed87f41a7"}, "2": {"node_id": "365ed77b-4f87-4950-b15d-3877f1dd1652", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20f59b1aecddc642b48629ef65306bdb1fda1c784d6e270d8224538e8bcdab15"}}, "hash": "aa1a979d957120bc3d999bd2bed10f2bea782957c861ae16e26f7f75dc6aaf71", "text": "Reliance on com\u00ad munity members as documenters simplified the task, as they were already familiar with local customs and mores; (d) Documentation sensitive to the issue of intellectual property rights.

Under this act, a Certificate of Plant Variety Protection may be granted for plant varieties that are \u201cnew, distinct, uniform and stable\u201d.

A Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Government on behalf of the communities and based on their specific re\u00ad quests and stipulations secures their intellectual property rights and options for obtaining benefits from any future commercial or beneficial use of their knowledge, by requiring that the free and prior informed consent of the community be obtained be\u00ad fore any knowledge is shared with a third party. A body of culturally relevant learning materials was produced with the potential for protecting/revitalizing traditional culture. There was reproduction of rice that was on the verge of extinction. Sustainability The project awakened in local women a strong interest in continuing the reproduction of threatened rice varieties for in situ (on\u00adfarm) conserva\u00ad tion and documentation. In 2004 and 2005, a total of 82 traditional rice varieties were collected and planted for the first cycle of morphologic documentation by groups of women, who are traditional seed\u00adkeepers and seed\u00adgrowers. \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 UN Photo 28 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System Replication/spin-off effects The Lakewood approach has been adopted for the documentation of plant diversity in the ancestral domain of the Kankanaey peoples in Bakun, Benguet (also in the Philippines).

What was learned The project demonstrated that the ethno\u00adbotanical knowledge of indigenous women (and men) covers a wide spectrum of plant species (trees, vines, herbs, shrubs, grasses, ferns, edible mushrooms, palms and mosses), most of which have mul\u00ad tiple uses. The documented species were used as medicine (62 per cent), food (37 per cent) and construction materials (20 per cent).

Its rationale, perceived as an alternative both to nation\u00ad alization and to the community forestry approaches, was based on giving to small groups secure user rights over blocks of degraded forest which they would rehabilitate themselves. The 10 districts covered by the project were the traditional lands of several indigenous groups, including the Tamang, the Danuwar, the Praja, the Magar and the Majhi. A total of 7,377 hectares of degraded forest were rehabilitated by 1,729 leasehold groups comprising 11,756 poor households. Under a 40\u00adyear lease agreement, the leasehold groups have exclusive user rights over the products of the rehabilitated for\u00ad est within the framework of an agreed management plan. What was planned The main activities included: (a) Fostering the creation of leasehold groups of 5 to 10 households each, and promotion of regular meetings to collect monthly savings, de\u00ad liver loans and collect repayments; 31 Indigenous women and IFAD (b) Integration of women into mainstream forestry activities (in\u00ad stead of supporting specific women\u2019s activities); (c) Employment of women as group promoters. What the strategy was In order to address the negative effects of \u201copen access\u201d man\u00ad agement which had been resulting in widespread deforestation and degradation, the project introduced the idea of leasing spe\u00ad cific tracts of degraded forest lands to specific groups, mainly women, willing to undertake their rehabilitation in exchange for secure access to the products thereof. As women represented the majority of the beneficiaries, women were recruited as group promoters to assist in fostering the ac\u00ad tivity of additional groups, for example, by linking their com\u00ad munities with the line agencies and extension staff. Who was involved United Nations Office for Project Services Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Department of Forestry Government of the Netherlands Specific changes resulting from the project The project\u2019s basic premise, namely, that poverty alleviation and reforestation could be addressed simultaneously by transferring degraded lands to the very poor, was proved correct. Men increasingly accepted women\u2019s new status and their right to have agricultural land registered in their name.

The project\u2019s approach was replicated in the Leasehold Forestry and Livestock Programme (LFLP) approved by the Executive Board of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in December 2004. LFLP is an eight\u00adyear programme aimed at reduc\u00ad ing the poverty of 44,300 households in 22 districts. Its objectives are to: (a) increase household forage and tree crop production through the environmentally sound management of rehabilitated leasehold plots; (b) improve household incomes from small livestock (goats); (c) foster the delivery by viable microfinance institutions of financial services to the leaseholders; and (d) strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity to imple\u00ad ment leasehold forestry as a national poverty reduction programme with a strong gender equity focus. What was learned Giving women secure access to land and forestry can transform their lives both economically and socially. Economically, this gives them access to a more secure and stable source of income and to new ways of making money for their families. Socially, they acquire a new sense of self\u00adconfidence and self\u00adesteem: their husbands show growing respect for them and they are increas\u00ad ingly involved in higher levels of responsibility and decision\u00ad making. These transformations are weakening the unequal power relations that foster poverty both of their households and in their communities. External support should be planned and carried out in a com\u00ad plementary manner. The indigenous knowledge and active participation of farm\u00ad ers are crucial in defining and implementing environmentally sound land\u00aduse options for fodder, forage and livestock.

There is a strong need to assess the demand and market struc\u00ad tures for forage and to develop marketing strategies before promoting forage production. Livestock\u00adrearing and the sale of grass seeds should not be overemphasized during the early stages of a project.

Although these districts have experienced protracted conflict linked to local peoples\u2019 quest for freedom and the sovereignty of the Indian State, women were always agents of peace and dialogue. In 1974, they set up one of the most widely respected welfare\u00adcum\u00adhuman rights organizations of the re\u00ad gion, Tangkhul Shanao Long (TSL). In addition to undertaking a host of so\u00ad cial activities aimed at uplifting women, TSL assisted the victims of conflict and was an important mediator between the people and the Government.

This goal is pursued by: (a) enhancing the capabilities of local people; (b) increasing family incomes from farm and non\u00adfarm sources; (c) fostering environmen\u00ad tal awareness and knowledge; (d) establishing effective systems for input delivery and asset management; (e) increasing the participation of women in local institutions and decision\u00admaking; (f ) enhancing saving capacity and thrift; and (g) providing basic services and social infrastructure. The resulting six components are the following: (a) Capacity-building of communities and participating agencies. Helping communities to (i) establish viable, equitable and sustainable vil\u00ad lage institutions, (ii) formulate community resource management plans and (iii) strengthen their capacity to manage their development initiatives through training, in\u00adcountry study tours and self\u00adhelp groups; (b) Economic livelihoods. Enhancing livelihoods by introducing/ improving a wide range of on\u00adfarm and non\u00adfarm activities, including IFAD/Hollingworth 37 Indigenous women and IFAD irrigation, improved practices for crops and livestock, modifications to jhum plots, input supplies, fish farming, agro\u00adprocessing and credit; (c) Community-based biodiversity conservation. Protecting the re\u00ad gion\u2019s rich biodiversity resources through protecting sacred groves and introducing buffer zone management, developing alternative livelihood sources for adjacent communities, surveys of biodiversity, creation of a database on local flora, conservation of endangered species, and awareness\u00ad raising programmes; (d ) Social sector activities. Improving access to basic services by building drinking\u00adwater schemes, training health workers, and provid\u00ad ing basic medicines and training; (e) Village roads and rural electrification. Improving access to mar\u00ad kets by upgrading 170 kilometres of village roads and building 20 kilo\u00ad metres of new roads, and broadening the base of the rural economy by providing electricity so as to open up new possibilities for non\u00adfarm en\u00ad terprises; (f ) Project management. Strengthening the capacity of the imple\u00ad menting agencies, and developing and implementing a monitoring and evaluation system. What the strategy was The patriarchal sociocultural and political backdrop prompted a strong focus on gender equality, ecology, participation and sustainability. The aim was to help women improve their position within their households and communities by enhancing their active role in economic and social activi\u00ad ties. Instruments like natural resource management groups and self\u00adhelp groups were used both to generate meaningful participation by women and to provide them with a chance to move beyond their traditionally subordinate role. The central principle of self\u00adhelp groups is that women do not have to depend on outsiders for the credit they need for their eco\u00ad nomic activities. Their self\u00adhelp groups, whose guiding principles are thrift and credit, allow them to increase their incomes and exchange experiences with other women.

These achievements are likely to enhance their decision\u00admaking and financial management capability in the long run and hence improve their position both within the household and in the community. This said, the weak economic base of the self\u00adhelp groups remains a concern. Specific changes resulting from the project Poverty reduction.

Natural resources management. Eight hundred and twenty\u00adfive natural resource management groups (with a female member\u00ad ship of over 50 per cent) are managing funds for watershed development and natural resource management activities, in\u00ad cluding conservation and protection; 10,211 hectares of jhum land have been turned over to permanent cultivation, includ\u00ad ing horticultural crops, and community forests for biodiver\u00ad sity management. About 370 hectares of new terracing were installed and 1,530 hectares of small\u00adscale irrigation structures were repaired. \uf0a7 \uf0a7 39 Indigenous women and IFAD Economic benefits. Cash savings are increasingly common thanks to the fostering of 2,071 self\u00adhelp groups with some 33,056 women as members. Total group savings in January 2005 amounted to 280,500 United States dollars. Loans fi\u00ad nanced through savings, which are usually small (US$ 4.50\u2013 US$ 67.00, depending on the availability of funds), are used for income\u00adgenerating activities (cultivation of poultry, pigs, maize and potatoes and weaving) as well as school fees and consump\u00ad tion. Many economic activities are time\u00adsaving for women, in addition to generating more income and improving food availa\u00ad bility. Forest management and water conservation activities also reduce their drudgery, for example, by reducing distances to water sources. Home vegetable gardens, previously little known in the area, have been created by 16,322 households and have added substantially to household food supply and sales. Ani\u00ad mal husbandry has increased markedly, with 8,162 and 12,334 households, having adopted pig\u00ad and poultry\u00adrearing, respect\u00ad ively. Ten villages in the West Garo Hills have established a cooperative milk chain and hope to undertake milk processing and packaging in the near future. The number of fish ponds has increased substantially (176 hectares); and 470 hectares in 547 locations are under fish\u00adrice culture in irrigated terraces. Social benefits.

Natural resource management groups and self\u00adhelp groups can play an active and effective role in mitigating ethnic con\u00ad flict by educating and building awareness of the advantages of reconciliation, coexistence and mutual support, through, for example, a multi\u00adethnic forum for peace, reconciliation and development in sensitive zones. Self\u00adhelp groups promote and reinforce women\u2019s solidarity. The project\u2019s positive experiences confirm their importance as an instrument for fostering a savings mentality leading to self\u00adreliant and self\u00adsustaining development. It is necessary, however, to strengthen the ties between these groups and the formal rural financial institutions. The emergence of unanticipated forms of cooperative ventures among some members (that is to say, collective farming and rearing) must be identified early on and supported. If women are to be empowered in societies where the major decision\u00admaking and official positions remain the prerogative of men, it is necessary that women\u2019s rights to land be secure and legally recognized.

Both natural resource management groups and self\u00adhelp groups have conducted adult education programmes for their members, including women, and are encouraging the schooling of girls. Another important factor was the proactive encouragement of women\u2019s participation in the management and use of commu\u00ad nity resources (natural resource management groups) and in the creation of self\u00adhelp groups.

The project aims to reverse this trend and improve the livelihoods of these peoples by adopting a two\u00adpronged approach encompassing: (a) diversifying on\u00ad and off\u00adfarm activities and (b) developing alternative livelihoods. The area covered comprises seven districts and 728 villages in the province of Oudomxai, situated in the north\u00adwestern part of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.

What the strategy was The project\u2019s gender component recognizes the major role that women play in both on\u00ad and off\u00adfarm activities. The women of the indigenous commu\u00ad nities are facing an increasingly critical situation with regard to land own\u00ad ership. Although the traditional kinship and residence patterns of many groups are matrilocal, with matrilineal inheritance systems, land alloca\u00ad tion documents normally carry the name of the husband as the household IFAD 44 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System head and he becomes the legal owner of land inherited by his wife. This situation has serious implications for women\u2019s ability to provide land as collateral for credit. Gender considerations are mainstreamed in all project activities, through the Lao Women\u2019s Union, a mass organization mandated to mo\u00ad bilize women. The Union is providing women with training in on\u00ad and off\u00adfarm income\u00adgenerating skills (numeracy and literacy, marketing, and management of small business and village development funds) as well as health. The project is also building local drinking\u00adwater systems that al\u00ad leviate women\u2019s burden and improve family health status. Who was involved United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) World Food Programme (WFP) Provincial government of Oudomxai Department of Planning and Cooperation Government of Luxembourg Specific changes resulting from the project Substantial numbers of women are employed by the implement\u00ad ing agencies: 24 per cent of the 296 staff of the project; 20 out of the 69 staff (29 per cent) at provincial level; and 52 out of the 227 staff (23 per cent) at the district level. Under the community development component, 683 people, including 411 women, attended 103 days of gender training, and 36 per cent of the participants in all training activities are women. What was learned To ensure that project activities respond to the needs of the target group, community\u00adled development and participatory planning from the village level should be integral parts of both project design and implementation, and a government agency should be made responsible for coordination. Project implementation should be as decentralized as possible to the provincial, district and village levels, and phased in in ac\u00ad cordance with existing institutional capacity at these levels.

This IFAD\u00adinitiated project, as reflected in its design and implementation, therefore views women as constituting a special target group for efforts aimed at improving productive roles.

It has adopted a comprehensive empowerment approach that envisages: (a) a deepening of the decentraliza\u00ad tion process that recognizes an expanded role for village development boards in needs assessment, prioritization and implementation; (b) the adoption of highly participatory planning processes; and (c) the introduction of a flexible and demand\u00addriven credit scheme. Throughout design and implementation, women are viewed as a special target group for all five components of the project, namely: (a) microfinance and microenterprise development; (b) up\u00ad land farming systems extension and research; (c) livestock improvement and animal health; (d) forest land management; and (e) gender. What the strategy was The gender component aims at empowering women from indigenous up\u00ad land communities by improving their access to and control over produc\u00ad tive resources. A Women\u2019s Livelihood Fund (WLF) established in each of the beneficiary communes assists women in carrying out activities that they themselves have identified with a view to improving their living conditions. Each of the beneficiary villages has a WLF Village Group. The Women\u2019s Livelihood Fund may be used to fund: any activities that will benefit groups of village women; support for destitute households; and support to education (schools and short\u00adterm vocational training). The planning and management of Women\u2019s Livelihood Fund\u00adfunded activities follow a highly decentralized and participatory approach. IFAD 48 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System Who was involved United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) Provincial People\u2019s Committee of Tuyen Quang Province Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) Specific changes resulting from the project The membership of self\u00adhelp groups is 71 per cent women and 71 per cent indigenous groups. The women\u2019s self\u00adhelp groups fostered in 2002 and 2003 are developing well and are waiting eagerly to receive land. Nearly 70 per cent of the 3,300 persons trained in farmer field schools were women. Land\u00aduse certificates in the names of both spouses are still pend\u00ad ing owing both to ongoing land exchanges and relocation and to new legislation that has altered the format of the \u201cred books\u201d. The chief accountant of the Provincial Project Coordination Unit is a woman, but only 7 of the remaining 22 Coordination Unit staff are women. However, women account for 47 per cent of the staff at district level. Three of the 11 community organizers are women. Two hundred and two project staff and 53 village leaders have undergone training on gender\u00adawareness enhancement and gender mainstreaming. Discussions with the implementers at project, district, commune and village levels suggest that both the implementing agencies and the target population are fully aware of their responsibilities with respect to gender issues and the corresponding project targets. Sustainability According to the Women\u2019s Union in Tuyen Quang, the most suc\u00ad cessful activity is credit.

It is particularly important to respond to the perceived needs of women themselves. Obstacles or problems identified during the project Language was a problem because most indigenous women are not confident when speaking the mainstream language: they fear that they will not use the correct words. Social norms may limit women\u2019s ability to express their priority needs in mixed groups, often because their role within the com\u00ad munity is perceived as being one of maintaining social harmony by not raising issues. Factors contributing to success The programme was attentive to the needs of the women them\u00ad selves, and 10 per cent of the base cost was allocated to gender mainstreaming and improving the livelihoods of women. All reports were disaggregated by gender and wealth ranking.

The project area focused on the steeper, less fertile, less accessible and less developed mountainous area. It covered 92 of the 239 townships in the two Provinces. The prime recipients of support for socio\u00ad economic activities and food for work were ethnic minorities who account for some 60 per cent of the population, estimated at 10 million, of the two Provinces. The best\u00adrepresented indigenous peoples are: the Miao (28 per cent), the Dong (14 per cent) and the Tujiia (19.4 per cent). Although the target group included all rural households living in the project area, con\u00ad sisting of about 390,000 families, priority was given to those living in the more remote and hence poorer villages. Indigenous peoples were specially targeted if found to be structurally worse off than mainstream society, and indigenous women in particular were a major target group owing to their low literacy resulting from gender discrimination, weak or a lack of access to credit \u2014 as most of their work was unpaid \u2014 and weak participation in leadership. What was planned The project had six main thrusts: 52 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System Food crop production.

Irrigation, drinking water, electrification and roads What the strategy was For this joint IFAD/WFP project, resources provided by WFP were used to support training programmes for poor women and children (literacy, productive activities, health care) while the proceeds of the IFAD loan were used to finance all other activities. A strong gender focus was assured by provisions for: the foster\u00ad ing of women\u2019s associations at township, country and prefec\u00ad ture levels; the fostering of federated associations at prefecture and national levels; special attention to women\u2019s crafts (em\u00ad broidery), fish farming, livestock and agriculture; and assisting support services aimed at improving women\u2019s health. The loan agreement between IFAD and the Government clearly stated that women were a major target group (article 35) and part of the allocations for short\u00adterm credit was reserved for women\u2019s income\u00adgenerating activities (article 112). Special groups made up of village leaders and farmers, includ\u00ad ing at least two women, were formed at village level to dissemi\u00ad nate information and mobilize local communities. \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 53 Indigenous women and IFAD Who was involved World Food Programme (WFP) Government of China: Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Finance Specific changes resulting from the project Women\u2019s workload was reduced by two to three hours per day owing to improved drinking\u00adwater supply systems and the in\u00ad troduction of labour\u00adtime\u00adsaving technologies for women\u2019s activities. Hygiene and health improved owing to improved drinking\u00ad water systems; training on health, hygiene and nutrition; and greater attention to widespread gynaecologic disorders during medical check\u00adups as the first step towards curative protocols. Livestock husbandry undertaken by women improved through specialized training. Incomes increased by incremental livestock husbandry provided additional cash for food, school fees and clothing. Women\u2019s self\u00adesteem and social position improved owing to im\u00ad proved economic performances and entrepreneurial success. Over half (55 per cent) of the participants in literacy training in Tongren prefecture were women. Although 95 per cent of the loans were used for typical women\u2019s activities, they were signed in men\u2019s names: neither men nor women were aware that women could sign their own contracts. Women accounted for 20 per cent of technical staff and 30 per cent of project staff. Seventy\u00adfive per cent of the 31,490 participants in health and nutrition training were women. What was learned The specificity of the grass\u00adroots stakeholders must be taken into account when designing and implementing projects. The fact that women were major beneficiaries of the project was not reflected in the records of the project because its formal procedures did not envisage a focus on gender\u00adspecific respon\u00ad sibilities. Functional literacy training in Mandarin, including the ability to sign, ought to have been provided to women, who should be assisted in obtaining the individual seals allowing them to sign their own loan contracts. Emphasis on organic farming of medicinal herbs would have resulted in a good opportunity to valorize local knowledge and \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 54 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System resources, promote high\u00advalue products and build awareness on environmental issues. Credit alone cannot help the poor: it must be associated with training designed to improve their skills and thereby improve their ability to repay loans. Obstacles or problems identified during the project Although the design envisaged that women would participate in the activities, take out loans and undertake training, par\u00ad ticipation by Miao women was limited because most of them do not speak standard Chinese and are unable to communicate with outsiders, gain access to information and training etc. Land is a very important constraint for women. Property rights are not based on freehold ownership.

Methodology of education for working with indigenous peoples Communal development planning. A process of evaluation of former pro\u00ad cesses and projects in which pilot communities had participated was initi\u00ad ated in order to ensure that the planning process would be sustained by the communities\u2019 own experiences and needs, which can be immediate or longer term. Special consideration was given to the handling of the time frame of the planning process so that it would be in accordance with the Emmanuel Audelo 60 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System communities\u2019 own timing patterns and their own socio\u00adorganizational dynamics. The Honduran National Indigenous Women\u2019s Coordinating Organization has also participated in developing self\u00adesteem and moti\u00ad vational dialogues to promote the participation of indigenous women. The participants have the capacity to develop and demonstrate aptitude for collective endeavour. The outcome has been a communal development plan that includes ideas for productive and social projects for each of the participating communities. The National Institute for Women has helped initiate joint action to benefit a greater number of indigenous women more effectively.

Even though it had been expected that 75 per cent of the beneficiaries would be women, the data indicate that female participation was approximately 60 per cent of a total popula\u00ad tion of 180 persons. Access to literacy training in remote communities is essential if they are to attain an educational level that will allow them to access other capacity\u00adbuilding courses in tourism, comprehend basic aspects of administration, and ultimately carry out their projects in order to become sustainable.

Indigenous women will need to identify and develop contexts such as those of indigenous persons and women, within which to define and explore the characteristic features peculiar to and inherent in this dual identity.

The overall objectives of the meeting encompassed empowering the participation of indigenous women at community, national and international levels, and providing at each level the unique perspective of indigenous women. Further objectives were strengthening organizational and leadership know\u00adhow among indigenous women and strengthening communications within the Continental Network of Indigenous Women. The issues that were discussed were the Beijing Declaration1 and Platform for Action,2 confronting the outcome of the five\u00adyear review and appraisal of the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the 2000 World March of Women. Owing to the interest expressed by the participants themselves, a space was dedicated to a discus\u00ad sion on ILO Convention No. 169. The Continental Demonstration of Indigenous Women was held at the end of this event. Indigenous women marched through the princi\u00ad pal streets of Panama protesting against poverty and the violence inflicted on indigenous women and indigenous peoples, as well as demanding the ratification of ILO Convention No. 169 by the countries that had not yet done so. \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 1 Report of the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, 4-15 September 1995 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.96.IV.13), chap.

The following is a chronological outline of the process developed for the crea\u00ad tion of the Programme. March 2000 The Third Continental Meeting of Indigenous Women was held in Panama City. The Enlace Continental de Mujeres Ind\u00edgenas (Continental Network of Indigenous Women) offers a space for dialogue and exchange and delib\u00ad erations and provides the opportunity for indigenous women to put forth their own proposals. It is organized into three sub\u00adnetworks corresponding to the northern, central and southern regions and works through the fol\u00ad lowing Commissions: the Commission for Training, the Commission for Commercialization/Marketing and Copyrights, the Commission for Inter\u00ad national Instruments and the Commission for Communications. During this meeting, Honduras and Guatemala were selected to im\u00ad plement the programme of the Commission for Training for the central subregion of the Network. May 2000 The Third Inter\u00adagency Meeting on Indigenous Peoples was held in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica. Among the agreements reached at this Meeting was one on the exchange of information between the agencies regarding gender and on work with the regional networks of indigenous women. A follow\u00adup committee was created with UNDP/Guatemala, the ILO Project, the In\u00ad ter\u00adAmerican Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and the Fondo para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Ind\u00edgenas de Am\u00e9rica Latina y El Caribe \u2014 Fondo Ind\u00edgena (Indigenous Fund for the Development of Indigenous Peoples in Latin America and the Caribbean), maintaining the ILO Project as the link. 2000 UNDP/Guatemala and the ILO Project initiated conversations with the Continental Network of Indigenous Women to assist in the implementa\u00ad tion of a training programme for indigenous women of the region. September-October 2000 Indigenous women organizations of the region that belonged to the Con\u00ad tinental Network of Indigenous Women were initially consulted regarding their needs in terms of training. 69 Indigenous women and ILO November 2000 UNDP/Guatemala and the ILO Project hired a consultant to carry out the systematization of the data results and the production of a proposal from the Regional Training Programme for Indigenous Women. December 2000 The validation workshop, entitled \u201cPensando el futuro del liderazgo de la mujer ind\u00edgena: una invitaci\u00f3n al di\u00e1logo y propuesta\u201d (\u201cThinking about the future of indigenous women\u2019s leadership: an invitation to a dialogue and a proposal\u201d), was held in Guatemala City to discuss and facilitate input for the Regional Training Programme for Indigenous Women. The meet\u00ad ing was sponsored by the ILO Project and UNDP/Guatemala. The Work\u00ad shop made use of an entertainment dynamic that permitted the attendees to envision future scenes as indigenous women and as persons belonging to indigenous peoples. In attendance were some 30 women from Central American countries and Mexico belonging to indigenous organizations that were part of the Continental Network of Indigenous Women, as well as other indigenous organizations. Mexico became part of the subregional network, as it did not have a commission for training in the northern region. June 2001 After the input had been received at the workshop of the women them\u00ad selves, the final proposal for the Regional Training Programme for Indig\u00ad enous Women was put forth. March 2002 There was now an educational guide on the specific rights of indigenous women for the training workshops and an accompanying video. These were the outcomes of the December 2000 workshop. October 2002 There was an official presentation by the Regional Training Programme to the Continental Network of Indigenous Women. Negotiation processes led by indigenous women In the indigenous territory of Rey Curr\u00e9, Costa Rica, the organization Mujeres con esp\u00edritu de lucha (Women with struggling spirit) has been cre\u00ad ated to tackle the threat of the construction of the hydroelectric dam in their territory. This is an example where engagement in the negotiation processes supported by the project have been led by women. 70 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System Ombudsman\u2019s Office for Indigenous Women in Guatemala Guatemala is the only country to have an ombudsman\u2019s office for indig\u00ad enous women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eec543ea-610e-4ad5-aeac-8e5e2dc40cf0": {"__data__": {"id_": "eec543ea-610e-4ad5-aeac-8e5e2dc40cf0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and the United Nations System", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04e81d7639be0f4020dd31593bb87ac70678279cce92f852779c3eb04b803160"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9c46c26-a7e0-48ed-91e5-985f6bb517c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28e38c436a6bd9a5813aa1f428a97dae179854ad730f0be76fa648338f638350"}}, "hash": "c1a87e7bf8104d14bdde066ac653beda7a80f9a958c7422460bdb83d4bcfa412", "text": "The agreement to create an ombudsman office was included in the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, in which the national Government promised to promote the dissemination of, and faithfully abide by, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Dis\u00ad crimination against Women3 and other legal instruments relating to the rights of indigenous peoples that had been ratified by the Government of Guatemala, creating an indigenous ombudsman office.

The technical assistance given was in de\u00ad veloping the strategy for consulting on the specific rights of indigenous women within the 24 linguistic communities of Guatemala. For this pur\u00ad pose, the following activities were conducted: Training on women\u2019s human rights, the rights of indigenous peoples and specific rights of indigenous women, for those fa\u00ad cilitators in charge of the process of consultation and training Producing a workbook for consulting and training on the spe\u00ad cific rights of indigenous women (rights that are intrinsic to indigenous women because they belong to a people that is sepa\u00ad rated from the rest of the national society) and an evaluation of the existing inability of indigenous women to exercise certain of those human rights considered to be universal, as well as a workbook designed to systematize the data from the consulta\u00ad tion and training Achievements The conclusions arrived at were useful to the Ombudsman\u2019s Office for In\u00ad digenous Women in Guatemala in respect of its having access to an analysis of the real situation of indigenous women in their communities.

Our working capital encompasses the confidence and faith that emanates from the indigenous peoples and organizations of the subregion. 2. Numerous indigenous organizations of the subregion have been able to benefit from the training workshops offered by the project. 3. We have shortened the distance between discourse and action in the exercise of the rights of indigenous peoples. 4. Some of the trained legal teams have initiated actions in the national courts to present the cases with which they have been entrusted by indigenous organizations and/or communities. For example, cases in Panama and Costa Rica currently await final resolution in the courts of those countries. The cases are in defence of the indigenous territories as regards the construction \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 72 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System of the Tabasar\u00e1 II Hydroelectric Dam, and the delimitation and transfer of land registration of Boruca and Terraba indigenous territories, respectively. 5.

Furthermore, there has been a request made to the Government for compensation for possible damages. 7. The production of educational materials has been noteworthy. These include the Serie Gu\u00edas Legales (Series of Legal Guides), Serie Normativa (Normative Series) and Jurisprudencia Ind\u00ed\u00ad gena (Indigenous Jurisprudence), teaching materials designed to create awareness of the rights of indigenous women and/or aimed specifically at them, as well as other specialized studies that were produced in support of particular demands, as was the case for the studies entitled \u201cCondiciones laborales de los Buzos Miskitos de Nicaragua\u201d (Working conditions of the Mis\u00ad kito Divers of Nicaragua) and \u201cCondiciones de las comunidades ind\u00edgenas de El Salvador\u201d (Conditions of the indigenous com\u00ad munities of El Salvador) issued after the earthquake of 2001. 8. The educational material has been distributed to the indigenous peoples and organizations of the subregion and also, on many occasions, to indigenous organizations and peoples of Mexico and South America that have requested copies. 9. Initial steps have been taken for the establishment of alliances to bring indigenous organizations and labour organizations closer together to ensure the effective use of existing ILO mech\u00ad anisms, conventions and recommendations for the defence of indigenous people\u2019s rights. 73 Indigenous women and ILO 10. Efforts were made to train and create awareness among public authorities in the countries covered by the project, resulting in the attainment of significant breakthroughs. A ruling was ob\u00ad tained from the Attorney General of Panama, recommending a discussion on ILO Convention No. 169 at a plenary session of the Legislative Assembly. 11. The Executive Power of Panama has reached an agreement with the Indigenous Congresses to submit ILO Convention No. 169 for the consideration of the Legislative Assembly at a plenary. 12. Another achievement was the full support for the Indigenous Parliament in respect of the legislative lawsuits of the indig\u00ad enous peoples of Nicaragua. 13. Owing to the work that has been accomplished, the legislative assemblies of different countries regularly consult the project regarding the congruence of the different laws and legal instru\u00ad ments that can be applied to indigenous affairs. 14. Indigenous peoples and organizations of the subregion regu\u00ad larly consult the project regarding the relevance of their legal strategies. The use of this mechanism often extends beyond the subregion, since on various occasions indigenous organizations and State organisms of Mexico and South America have been given legal advice. 15. The work that the project has carried out in empowering in\u00ad digenous women\u2019s organizations and attending to their specific needs has been remarkable. 16. Numerous workshops for training and dissemination aimed at indigenous women have been organized. 17. A Regional Training Programme for the Continental Network of Indigenous Women has been developed to support the Com\u00ad mission for Training \u2014 Central American Region of the Conti\u00ad nental Network of Indigenous Women. 18. An interesting discussion and analysis have been initiated on the specific rights of indigenous women. 19. Educational material on the rights of indigenous women has been developed for or aimed directly at them. 20. Also, there has been technical support and advice given to State organisms that were designated as responsible for examining particular situations where indigenous women might have been vulnerable, defenceless or discriminated against, as is the case for the Ombudsman\u2019s Office for Indigenous Women in Guate\u00ad mala. 21.

Replication/spin-off effects We are confident that the knowledge passed on to the legal teams and indigenous leaders who participated in the various workshops and general meetings of the project will be transmitted to other groups and persons in such a way as to ensure that at each transmission there will be an ever\u00ad greater number of indirect beneficiaries of the project. We believe that the legal teams will continue advising the indigenous peoples and organizations and will conclude in a satisfactory manner their legal proceedings. The educational materials generated by the project are both lasting products that will continue to be useful to indigenous peoples and their advisers in the creation of effective strategies and powerful tools for pro\u00ad tecting and safeguarding their rights. The labour union organizations constitute essential spokespersons on existing ILO mechanisms for implementation of the norms and recom\u00ad mendations; therefore, the synergies between these organizations and the indigenous organizations are vital. The project initiated a process of rec\u00ad onciliation to bring them closer. It would be highly advantageous for this truly innovative unification process to continue, as it would contribute, through the powerful strategies shared by both groups of organizations, to the fulfilment of the project\u2019s fundamental objectives. The project has provided a unique experience to the subregion and it would be highly desirable for ILO through its headquarters in San Jos\u00e9, which has generated high visibility and credibility in this regard, to con\u00ad tinue its support of indigenous peoples and organizations. Consequently, 75 Indigenous women and ILO there is a need for concerted efforts to consolidate and expand the activities in this field, and meet the challenge of mainstreaming the aforementioned legal provisions, so that they will yield tangible benefits to indigenous peo\u00ad ples in their everyday life. The experience derived from the project has demonstrated the need for a more integral strategy that will take into consideration the aspects of in\u00ad come\u00adgeneration and economic empowerment within a framework encom\u00ad passing the recognition and exercise of the rights of indigenous peoples. The above\u00admentioned fundamental principles and rights are invested with a special importance and meaning in the work sphere for the mem\u00ad bers of indigenous peoples owing to the fact that they face social exclusion and discrimination. The project has made efforts to apply the new integral perspective to the launch of international labour standards and their use by the members of indigenous peoples, especially the fundamental conven\u00ad tions strategically linked to indigenous issues. It would be of the utmost relevance to continue this strategy and to be able to focus the different activities of the ILO Subregional Office in accordance with this vision. What was learned The prominent use of graphics and a simple format highlight the impor\u00ad tance of adapting the means of conveying information to the intended audience.

At the end of the second phase, a civil society\u2013Government co\u00admanaged model through which to address sexual and reproductive health issues affecting the Ng\u00f6be indig\u00ad enous peoples in difficult\u00adto\u00adreach areas \u2014 one that is culturally sensitive, evidence\u00adbased and strong \u2014 will be available. National health authorities in Panama will possess tools with which to orient public policies and to expand efforts to improve the sexual and reproductive health of indigenous peoples in difficult\u00adto\u00adreach areas. The project will contribute to improving access to quality sexual and reproductive health services and to strength\u00ad ening the demand for those services for indigenous peoples in difficult\u00ad to\u00adreach areas. The ultimate goal is to ensure that all indigenous couples and individuals in difficult\u00adto\u00adreach areas enjoy good reproductive health including the right to make voluntary informed choices regarding the size of their families and to enjoy sexual health throughout life. What was learned There is a need to take into account, in the planning of the project activities, large distances, difficult terrain, rainy weather and poor communication, as well as seasonal migration of in\u00ad digenous people for farming purposes. There is a need to supervise systematically all project activities. There is a need for more project personnel to work at the com\u00ad munity level in difficult terrain. There is a need for permanent and systematic advocacy on sexual and reproductive themes to achieve a wider acceptance. Men need to be targeted in the project activities. Sexual and reproductive health issues need to be joined to gen\u00ad eral development programmes in areas of indigenous popula\u00ad tions. Better results are achieved when community and health services work together. Better results are achieved when the commitment of all authori\u00ad ties at all levels is secured. Sexual and reproductive health should be a national priority. Factors contributing to success The project developed a model with a human face in which the Ng\u00f6be Women\u2019s Association played an outstanding role, sup\u00ad ported by UNFPA, health, community and project staff. The perseverance of these individuals and organizations and their \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 83 Indigenous women and UNFPA commitment to changing the alarming sexual and reproduc\u00ad tive health situation of the Ng\u00f6be indigenous peoples contrib\u00ad uted to sustaining the project through difficult periods. Coordination existed among interested partners with respect to sexual and reproductive health, specifically regarding train\u00ad ing of traditional birth attendants. Obstacles or problems identified during the project Sexual and reproductive health of the indigenous people is pre\u00ad sented only from an occidental point of view; there is a lim\u00ad ited number of facilitators with knowledge of the sexual and reproductive health practices or the cosmovision of indigenous people. There is no intercultural service provision model that has been institutionalized or that is being taught in schools and medical/ nursing training institutions.

This support allowed the Jambi Huasi health clinic, which had been established in 1994, to expand and upgrade its services, initiate an outreach programme, provide reproductive health education and informa\u00ad tion to women, men and adolescents, and introduce a referral system for obstetric complications. Jambi Huasi, which means health house, provides both modern and traditional medical treatment, as well as family planning advice and services. The traditional healers draw from a \u201cpharmacy\u201d of over 3,600 native plants used for medicinal purposes. Jambi Huasi has a staff of 14 people, including 2 indigenous medical doctors and 2 community volunteers, who help with outreach. About half of Jambi Huasi\u2019s clients use the services of traditional healers. The unique combination of services has made Jambi Huasi a very popular clinic. Al\u00ad though it had been set up initially to serve some 4,000 people a year, by 2005 over 1,000 people per month were using the clinic\u2019s services, some coming from places as far away as 50 kilometres. What was planned To provide a full constellation of reproductive health and family planning services in a culturally sensitive manner, taking into account the special needs and concerns of indigenous people To revalue the traditional healing methods and provide evidence for the application of the knowledge of indigenous medicine \uf0a7 \uf0a7 86 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System To strengthen cultural comprehension of the causes of sickness through an effective doctor/patient relationship and a world view adapted to the cultural reality of the indigenous and mes\u00ad tizo populations Broadening the level of problem solving by complementing in\u00ad digenous medicine with occidental medicine through a system of internal referrals and by providing, if needed, a referral to a health centre with greater resources What the strategy was Attempting to combine the two systems of obstetric care, Jambi Huasi seeks, on the one hand, to respect the confidence that indigenous women have placed in traditional birth attendants owing to the role that they play in the community and, on the other hand, to offer an institutional service with the technical capabilities to resolve complications and a referral sys\u00ad tem in case of obstetric emergency.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "677b6c18-88e0-46ec-a897-15c29e4b4d20": {"__data__": {"id_": "677b6c18-88e0-46ec-a897-15c29e4b4d20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and the United Nations System", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25fa16ec453bca0aac1b250cf3f05dc6600d59a216f7964134584255731f8803"}, "2": {"node_id": "a68d9296-2cd1-49fb-b035-1828c75b13aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ff393a97e6e033b70f99ec7822015e6f00123a29793ec301ac6b40aa53f3de4"}}, "hash": "abba3166d2f6bf144e0ba3048044d97307b3cb843ff33c1f81e991a9927a6c7c", "text": "As an outreach reproductive health strategy targeting indigenous women, Jambi Huasi organized a number of community and home visits to promote a better knowledge of health issues among women, families and communities.

Jambi Huasi changed the way health services were offered in traditional communities by making them totally community\u00ad based, thereby fostering rapid and lasting improvements in the reproductive health of women, adolescents and men. Jambi Huasi changed the perspective of health to one encom\u00ad passing a combination of traditional and occidental medicine. At the moment, mestizo and indigenous peoples are using the services of Jambi Huasi. A gender focus within a cultural perspective was incorporated. Initially, gender was not a subject for consideration by Jambi Huasi. Currently, violence against women is also an issue that is tackled in the centre. Jambi Huasi has contributed to the empowerment of indigenous people. Indigenous organizations and particularly women took responsibility for sexual and reproductive health and learned how to make decisions affecting their own lives, on the com\u00ad munity level, and how to influence public policies. \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 UNFPA Ecuador 88 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System Jambi Huasi is moving from a \u201cpilot\u201d project to public policies, lobbying the Ministry of Health for the inclusion of cultural perspectives in its work. Sustainability One remarkable feature of Jambi Huasi is that it is a self\u00adsufficient opera\u00ad tion. Cost recovery is an important aspect of the work of the centre, with client fees accounting for all of its budget. However, respectful of the value of reciprocity, which is of great importance in the indigenous culture, the centre applies differential tariffs in order to take into account the indi\u00ad vidual situation of each patient. Replication/spin-off effects Jambi Huasi is an example of a grass\u00adroots organization manifesting politi\u00ad cal will and technical capacity. It is hardly conceivable that this experience could be replicated as a \u201cmodel\u201d. However, what could be replicated are the principles applied in Jambi Huasi, namely: Grass\u00adroots participation and empowerment Commitment of indigenous leaders, women and men Political will of local and national authorities Inclusion of different perspectives on health, there being no one single approach, only differences in knowledge and beliefs related to culture. Success is linked to the recognition of and respect for different approaches What was learned An intercultural undertaking must consider the heterogene\u00ad ity of the population, and its beliefs, culture and cosmovi\u00ad sion, accepting the emerging differences. It should not only be concerned about the adaptation of the services, through, for example, changing the birthing position, but also work to over\u00ad come the more profound obstacles related to long\u00adlasting racial prejudice including disrespectful attitudes towards language and indigenous beliefs and the lack of gracious and respectful private care. Occidental medical knowledge and indigenous medical know\u00ad ledge are complementary rather than in opposition to each other and both need to be promoted in the training of health professionals in universities and training centres. This implies an attitude of respect and acknowledgement of the values of the other cultures. \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 89 Indigenous women and UNFPA An intercultural approach to reproductive health needs to start with an acknowledgement of the cosmovision proper to the in\u00ad digenous world. Consideration of conceptions of sexuality, the body, health and sickness, community participation and the physical environment, among other things, are important in reshaping health services to accommodate cultural differences. Referrals by an occidental health system to a service including indigenous medicine, and vice versa, are possible only if there exists a basis of confidence in, and acknowledgement and val\u00ad orization of, different types of knowledge.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96fd7bc2-f55a-45d2-8e09-900131bae9ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "96fd7bc2-f55a-45d2-8e09-900131bae9ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and the United Nations System", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e568e9a1bab8950f454ff5f227cf75b5b4d3287187dd0c592d0169dfca94176"}, "2": {"node_id": "34504f49-6403-4d1c-9237-4ac73b532e4d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fda64b88aa759689015fdf38e8c69218a94f93b7c23578699dfffe8546a395c9"}}, "hash": "6c75c25ffa0dd2d98b0f2bb4b311dae3ef409548759368f91268ea1895aaaca4", "text": "Cultural identity is a reinforcing element with respect to the achievement of personal, family, community and social well\u00ad being.

In 2002, after a process of institutional deliberation and participatory consultation with adolescents and young women, their violent relationships were identified as another manifestation of the problem of violence against women. This type of behaviour sets a negative precedent for the role of women in rela\u00ad tionships, naturalizes violence and contributes to the perpetuation of dis\u00ad criminatory stereotypes against women. Adolescents \u2014 young women in particular \u2014 recognize sexual vio\u00ad lence as part of romantic relationships. It goes unrecognized as a form of violence and is instead learned and experienced as something inherent to a woman\u2019s role within a relationship. 6 92 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System In Bolivia, there exist Law 1674 against Violence within the Fam\u00ad ily and a National Plan for the Eradication of Gender Violence. Both the Law and the Plan refer to relationships between married people or couples living together but there is no legal instrument to denounce and punish violent behaviours that take place during the period prior to marriage. Violent relationships before marriage constitute a topic that has not been identified, discussed or treated, although the number of adolescents that suffer violence in their relationships increases. What was planned General objectives Decrease the incidence of violence in the relationships among adolescents and teenagers in El Alto through actions of preven\u00ad tion and assistance, thereby contributing to building a society characterized by gender equality Provide quality assistance to adolescents and young women in violent relationships Contribute to educational processes oriented

Women and the United Nations System 1,508 youths were informed about the service and the results of the research. 294 youths participated as activists, approximately half of whom were men (59 per cent of the number hoped for). 1 teacher participated (of the 24 teachers hoped for). 26 programmes were broadcast. There were fairs promoting anti\u00adviolence in relationships, three theatre productions and two discussion panels. There were 14 meetings, which brought together 19 organiza\u00ad tions that worked with youth to create the Inter\u00adinstitutional Network of Youth in El Alto (RIDJEA). Research was presented and used as a basis for debates in work\u00ad shops in high schools. Sustainability The organization maintains its commitment to continuing its support for the problem. This commitment is driven in large part by the statistics gen\u00ad erated by legal services for women which report that almost 80 per cent of the cases that come before them mention sexual violence perpetrated by their partner even prior to their marriages, that is to say, starting with their initial courting. In 2005, a family psychologist and an educator were contracted to ensure the quality of the training portion of the project. The Centre has developed the following levels of sustainability for the project: Technical: creation and maintenance of institutional training facilities Social: provision of a space for intervention and discussion with the main actors of the project, such as youth, so as to include them in local and national public policy agendas Financial: allocation of $10,000 for 2005 until new financing sources are found, with the objective of sustaining the provision of integrated services such as training activities and political participation Replication/spin-off effects The organization continues to work on the issue of violent relationships among adolescents and teenagers and it is currently seeking funding cor\u00ad related with its experience.

It is accepted and almost normalized in a large part of society. \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 95 Indigenous women and UNIFEM In contrast with the difficulties experienced by adult women in relationships, the difficulties experienced by young women in their first romantic relationships, though they do exist, are less dramatic. In respect of the participation of women in the presence of their male partners, we have confirmed that the dif\u00ad ficulties for young women are not as great as those for adult women. Effective work with young women entails integrating young men into the process instead of dividing the work groups by gender. This has proved to be less isolating and more produc\u00ad tive, as it generates an interchange of experiences and a coopera\u00ad tive effort to address the problem of gendered violence. The project plan must be flexible enough to respond to chang\u00ad ing situations, since, sometimes, results cannot be achieved ow\u00ad ing to circumstances that are impossible for the implementing organization to predict or to control.

Moreover, the State\u2019s structure ex\u00ad cluded the majority of Ecuadorians, particularly women and indigenous peoples. To overcome this exclusion, the indigenous movement outlined, as a strategy, the acquisition of democratic and participatory power, starting with the conquest of local power spaces (municipalities and territories). In the wake of democratic consolidation in Ecuador, members of the judiciary branch of government, in particular, sought to establish legitimacy by signalling their autonomy. Judges used gender quota laws to demonstrate their independence. This provided an opportunity for quota law supporters to gain leverage. Thus, in 1997, in Ecuador, a gender quota law was passed as a means of boosting the presence of women in politics. The labour protection law (Ley de Amparo Laboral) set the level of the quota at 20 per cent. In Ecuador, generally, it was expected that women would fill po\u00ad litical positions so that the quota could be reached but not that women would make decisions or enter into negotiations. This was especially the case within the indigenous movement. Capabilities associated with being a good leader, such as skill in public speaking, articulateness and the abil\u00ad ity to take the initiative, were not cultivated in indigenous women. As a result, on many occasions these women excluded themselves by not acting like leaders. As a result of the success of the replicas, the United Nations Develop\u00ad ment Fund for Women (Andean Region office) (UNIFEM\u00adAR) expanded 98 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System the Saraguro project in an attempt to meet increasing and new demands. The UNIFEM project entitled \u201cIndigenous Women: Local Development and Leadership Building\u201d was designed to address the need for a new gen\u00ad eration of capable indigenous women leaders with experience on the local scene who would become models for future generations of women leaders to follow. What was planned The project had four components: Facilitating the development of gender\u00adsensitive municipal poli\u00ad cies and projects through seven workshops, on: municipal law, conflict resolution, citizen participation and alliance building, decision\u00admaking and organization, gender and development, gender and public policy, and decentralization A study of indigenous peoples\u2019 access to justice in Saraguro Institutionalizing the Leadership School for Indigenous Women Leaders of Saraguro through eight workshops, on: self\u00adesteem, gender violence, leadership and participation, gender and eth\u00ad nicity, economic and social rights, cultural rights, women\u2019s rights, and relationships Communication and dissemination (radio programme and bulletin) via eight programmes covering the following topics: migrations, domestic violence, human rights and discrimina\u00ad tion, indigenous women\u2019s rights, access to justice, the role of the family in Saraguro, women\u2019s roles, and elections What the strategy was In the context of the invisibleness of ethnic and gender demands and pro\u00ad posals, this project aimed towards: gaining a better understanding of the conditions that prevent indigenous women from participating in the pub\u00ad lic sphere, constructing leadership based on ethical, democratic, participa\u00ad tory, and gender\u00ad and ethnic\u00adconscious values and increasing the participa\u00ad tion levels of indigenous women and indigenous organizations within the decision\u00admaking arena. Furthermore, the project aimed at developing strategies to integrate engendered leadership and governance more fully into the programmes on violence against women, and on economic and social rights. This is in ac\u00ad cordance with the belief of UNIFEM that ensuring that women are leaders in all aspects of their lives, both individually and collectively, will engender governance and compel adequate responses to situations of gender inequal\u00ad ity and differences.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db63399c-79ac-452e-980a-0a4ac8d5070b": {"__data__": {"id_": "db63399c-79ac-452e-980a-0a4ac8d5070b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Women and the United Nations System", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14bd88055c277063aca80c9f7bf3bd20266d4b1b33f2a08cbbac2eb9e991439d"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa2ffcee-fb97-454f-89cf-7f0fa7aef3be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-women-and-united-nations-system", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7dae57f59061d297c5bd566829bc99de42e4db4258c84d41173f6523e3e2c74e"}}, "hash": "aff35321ae10d079c41b01bb511df350feed23208a4f75c043b75b741be1490f", "text": "\uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 \uf0a7 99 Indigenous women and UNIFEM Who was involved Interprovincial Federation of Indigenous People of Saraguro (FIIS) Corporaci\u00f3n Mujer a Mujer (our counterpart in the project) Indigenous councilwoman Angelita Chalan and several munici\u00ad pal departmental heads Indigenous Women\u2019s Association of Saraguro (ASOMIS) Association of Indigenous Communities of Saraguro (ACIS) Asociaci\u00f3n de Comunidades y Organizaciones de San Lucas (ACOS) Casa de la Mujer Specific changes resulting from the project (outputs and impact) The Saraguro Indigenous Women\u2019s Agenda for Action was devel\u00ad oped.

Replication/spin-off effects Participants in the original pilot project were able to observe the replicas and develop a proposal for further replicas, which excited interest and were approved for funding by the German Cooperation Service (DED). What was learned Prior to the project, indigenous women had often denied the existence of violence against women within their communities. They feared that bringing about changes in the nature of their relationships with their partners and within their communities would be detrimental to their INDESIC 101 Indigenous women and UNIFEM efforts to be strong as an ethnic group. As the project progressed, these women came to realize that fighting against the abuses they had en\u00ad dured would not weaken their community, but would actually serve to strengthen it. Thus, throughout the project, it was learned that violence was not a natural part of relationships and that a strong community was one in which no members suffered from any forms of abuse. Obstacles or problems identified during the project Despite an encouraging display of openness from the mayor and the Council, indigenous councilwoman Angelita Chalan and several depart\u00ad mental heads were the only ones showing consistent attendance. Part of the problem involved a political split within the Council, and another part was the prevailing conception that \u201cgender\u201d referred only to women. Our counterpart, Corporaci\u00f3n Mujer a Mujer, attempted to maintain a dialogue, especially with the mayor, but they were often unable to meet with him.

Empowerment of communities and peoples to assert and gain greater control over their lives and futures necessitates a holistic and multifaceted approach covering areas in which indigenous peoples remain among the most vulnerable in society. For such empowerment to be sustained, it is necessary that it reach every segment of society, including youth, the poor and women. It is vital that in the struggle of indigenous societies for recog\u00ad nition of rights, women\u2019s rights assume equal importance. Over time, the influence and impact of globalized socio\u00adeconomic patterns have resulted in the transformation of some cultural norms and traditions to conform to the dictates of modern society.

As stated in the Project Completion Report (February 2006): It is a rare experience for women to be given a space to gather and identify issues relevant to their own decision\u00admaking. Moreover, discussing resolution to such issues is much more important, as it provides space to facilitate actual decision\u00admaking. In general, pro\u00ad viding such moments empower women, as well as men, to look deeper into the changing social and cultural relations as indigenous socie\u00ad ties develop in the context of a broader sphere. This process allows 1 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1249, No. 20378. 105 Indigenous women and UNDP co\u00adaccountability of both women and men in decision\u00admaking while considering transformation of structures within the dynamics of an advancing society. What was planned The objectives of the women in the decision\u00admaking programme were: (a) To provide a venue and an opportunity for indigenous women to share specific and common experiences within their social context; (b) To provide women with broader comprehension of their rights with a view to building their capability to protect and demand recognition of such rights, both within their community and in general; (c) To provide a space within which to assess the skills and know\u00ad ledge necessary to make sound decisions or influence leaders in their com\u00ad munity within the context of changing relations in indigenous communi\u00ad ties or societies; (d) To employ indigenous resolution processes in the long term with a view to deciding on conflicts and situations of inequality so as to be able to guarantee the rights of indigenous women within communities and the general society; (e) To enhance the capacity of local trainers in Bangladesh and Ma\u00ad laysia by facilitating exchange visits in the actual conduct of the trainings. Activities The project was implemented from 15 July 2005 to February 2006 and cov\u00ad ered training conducted with local organizers in Bangladesh and Malaysia. In order to implement the training, efforts involved creating and clarifying the responsibilities of the team of local trainers, preparing the participants and the venue, training conduct and report\u00adwriting. These were packaged into the preparatory process, the actual conduct and the post\u00adtraining activities: Activity one: creating the local trainers\u2019 team In preparation for the training, each country formed a local trainers\u2019 team composed of from three to four local trainers directed to serve as resource persons. A visiting local trainer from Malaysia joined the team of Bangla\u00ad desh and a trainer from Bangladesh joined the Malaysia team. The local members of the team were chosen from indigenous communities/groups with previous experience in gender\u00adrelated discussions. Activity two: conducting the training Subsequent to the training of the pool of local trainers, a five\u00adday training session was conducted using the commonly understood local language. 106 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System (a) Training for Indigenous Women Leaders on Decision-making, Bangladesh: The activity was co\u00adorganized by Trinnamul Unnayan Sang\u00ad stha, the Hill Tracts NGO Forum (HTNF) and Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact Foundation (AIPP) and held from 5 to 9 August 2005 in Rangamati, Bangladesh. The participants were some 33 women leaders from different communities including Chakma, Marma, Pankua, Khiang, Tangchangya, Tripura, Bawm, Chak, Mro, Khumi, Garo, Khashi and Orao, covering the three districts of Rangamati, Kagrachari and Bandarban in the Chit\u00ad tagong Hill Tracts, as well as from the plains areas of Bangladesh.

This series included six women representatives from Bangladesh participating as part of their training as local trainers and as members of an exchange/sharing\u00adof\u00adexperiences component. PACOS staff served as secretariat, while AIPP and UNDP resource persons also participated. Activity three: evaluation At the end of the training, an evaluation was conducted with a view to improving future trainings and gaining an overview of the training\u2019s suc\u00ad cesses and challenges. Activity four: documentation This activity encompassed documentation of the process and methodology of the training, and of the experiences and situations of women partici\u00ad pating in the training; and dissemination of the documentation, both in formal reports and in accessible booklet form, to ensure awareness\u00adraising on the issues facing indigenous women. The programme of activities was adapted to the local condition with a view to providing a better response thereto. Evaluation of the topics con\u00ad tained in the programme included other stakeholders. This led to the rec\u00ad ommendation of adding one more day to the module, to be devoted to an exchange of views on issues significant with respect to national and inter\u00ad national processes and policies specifically affecting indigenous women. The learning method used in raising the capability of the local train\u00ad ers took some innovative forms. In particular, the training in Malaysia accommodated six local trainers from Bangladesh, instead of one. This 107 Indigenous women and UNDP allowed for a collective approach to gaining knowledge for the purpose of building the capacity of the local trainers. The modifications mentioned above resulted in changes being made to the budget allocation so that it would include additional activities such as field visits, as well as related documentation and miscellaneous expenses within the whole learning process. What the strategy was The strategy was to incorporate local organizations into every stage of the training so as to ensure that indigenous women at every level, ranging from those in community organizations, civil society and development organizations to those in regional and national indigenous organizations, would become more aware of their rights and of the constraints that they faced. The training aimed at enabling all women involved in the process to realize their full potential to play a decisive role in their society and com\u00ad munities. This was achieved through training and capacity development workshops and sharing and learning sessions. Who was involved UNDP, through its Regional Initiative on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights and Development\u00adAsia\u00adPacific (RIPP) and the Asia\u00adPacific Gender Main\u00ad streaming Programme (APGMP), in partnership with the Asia Indigenous UNDP-RIPP 108 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System Peoples Pact Foundation (AIPP), the Hill Tracts NGO Forum and Part\u00ad ners of Community Organisations (PACOS). The training was jointly organized by AIPP, Trinamul Unnayan Sang\u00ad stha, Hill Tracts NGO Forum, PACOS Trust and other women\u2019s groups and organizations in close consultation and cooperation with UNDP\u00adRIPP. The collaboration fostered the complementarity of the roles of the various organizations and groups and created the means to empower and strengthen indigenous women\u2019s leadership and representation. Specific changes resulting from the project (outputs and impact) It is rare for women to be given a space within which to gather and identify issues relevant to their own decision\u00admaking. Discussing the resolution of such issues is much more important, as it provides a space within which to facilitate actual decision\u00admaking. In general, providing such moments empower women as well as men to take a deeper look at changing social and cultural relations as indigenous societies develop within a broader context. This process allows for the co\u00adaccountability of women and men in decision\u00admaking while the transformation of structures within the dynamics of an advancing society is considered. The impact of the training on women local trainers has been reflected in a broadening of skills in imparting knowledge to their colleagues. The training in Malaysia, especially, has fostered a country\u00adto\u00adcountry ex\u00ad change of skills among the trainers, thereby contributing to the acquisition of broader knowledge. The participants and local organizers were provided with a greater opportunity to enhance their familiarity with coordinating and network\u00ad ing among various groups such as non\u00adgovernmental organizations and support agencies at the regional (Asia) level. In the case of Bangladesh, the event provided the local hosts with an additional opportunity to consoli\u00ad date their efforts in organizing indigenous women members and partners. Integral to the capacity\u00adraising of the participants was the formula\u00ad tion of a follow\u00adup action plan. Identification of efforts to further the reso\u00ad lution and discussion of gender\u00adrelated issues among both women and men in indigenous societies was generally held to be significant.

Sustainability The gender training included a component on training of trainers. It is ex\u00ad pected that this group of indigenous women will be available to contribute 109 Indigenous women and UNDP to and support the work of their sisters in their communities and in other countries in the region. It is envisioned that follow\u00adup activities shall consider medium\u00ad and long\u00adterm activities and plans directed towards the concrete realization of the training as a tool for empowerment of women in respect of their par\u00ad ticipation in decision\u00admaking. Further development of the training module shall be made integral. The series of training sessions will continue and will be held in the years that follow, possibly in two countries per year. Projects shall be identified, if necessary, depending on the outcomes of the training sessions. At the regional level, the results of the training sessions have predict\u00ad ably included better linkages and networking between the two countries specifically, and in the region at large, given the learning/sharing nature of the training series. In addition, documentation and materials through which to disseminate the stories, experiences and lessons learned are being produced, and these will in turn support further training, dissemination of information and advocacy on gender issues. Replication/spin-off effects This model will be replicated and expanded to other countries in the Asia\u00adPacific region in the next steps of the programme. The two country sharing/learning exchanges have proved to be extremely rewarding and will be followed up to ensure that the process is manageable and that the exchange between indigenous women maintains its momentum and gen\u00ad UNDP-RIPP/Nicholas 110 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System erates greater awareness of the challenges they face both within and outside their communities. The training modules used will also be freely available to any indig\u00ad enous organization that is interested in providing members with the same technical skills and knowledge. In addition to funded replication of the training modules used in this training process, sustained impact from the \u201ctraining of trainers\u201d, which is an integral part of the training process, is expected. As a result of the training of trainers, groups of technically skilled lo\u00ad cal women have been able to replicate the training with or without external funding. What was learned Lessons learned during the first training session held in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, in August 2005 were examined and built into the second training session (Malaysia, 11\u00ad14 December 2005).

The talent and capabilities of the leaders, both women and men, are essential for projects to function. They are the ones responsible for encouraging and mobilizing people, and may require external support, including specialized training and opportunities to share and exchange experiences and lessons learned with other projects and processes involving indigenous communities, in order to com\u00ad pare, learn and connect to wider processes. Capacity development initiatives such as leadership training, capacity\u00adbuilding, technical assistance and alphabetization are predominant in the case studies collected. Post\u00adliteracy support should focus on improving training processes and capacity\u00adbuilding, going beyond the teaching of read\u00ad ing, writing and arithmetic to enable women to better carry out their productive activities and increase household income. 3. Strengthening the skills of community members, both women and men, prior to the planning of projects enhances beneficiary partici\u00ad pation and builds the sense of ownership needed to ensure that the schemes will be appropriately managed and maintained by the com\u00ad munities. 4. In most cases, a close partnership and the exchange of information were successfully achieved among indigenous women\u2019s organizations, indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations and the United Nations country offices as well as the other actors involved. 5. Legal security and law enforcement with regard to the different as\u00ad pects of the lives of indigenous persons (citizenship, identity papers, the right to individual and collective ownership, rights to land and territory, intellectual property rights etc.) are an important element for the sustainability of their development process. 6. One challenge demonstrated by the case study projects was the ten\u00ad sion that arose as indigenous women sought to claim both their collective rights as indigenous people and their individual rights as women. By pressing for equal treatment by gender, indigenous women are often accused of undermining the unity of indigenous movements advocating for collective rights. Furthermore, there is 114 Indigenous Women and the United Nations System uncertainty as to the extent to which the right to gender equality infringes upon indigenous cultural traditions and customs, although experience has shown that reinforcing women\u2019s rights benefits com\u00ad munity as a whole. Hence, there is also a need to translate the rights of women as outlined in international treaties into culturally relevant concepts and priorities. Good\u00adpractice studies that can be replicated exist in this regard. 7. Although indigenous women continue to be marginalized and dis\u00ad criminated against, the projects demonstrated that through the involvement of government offices and indigenous organizations, encouraging partnerships, opportunities do exist to improve recog\u00ad nition of the rights of indigenous peoples and women, to address patriarchal and discriminatory attitudes and to improve equality of opportunities in the public sphere. 8. The creation of synergies between governmental offices and United Nations country offices was important in developing a systematic programme for analysis and reform of existing legislation, legal training and broad\u00adbased interaction involving indigenous organi\u00ad zations, especially women, public and local authorities and other so\u00ad cial actors. 9. Increasing decentralization and devolution to local governments, and its effects on local\u00adlevel power and public investment, are opening up new spaces for indigenous participation in local government ad\u00ad ministration and management of territories, communities and neigh\u00ad bourhoods, with a legitimacy that is sustainable over time. Recommendations 1. The United Nations system, Governments and all actors involved should promote the establishment of true participatory mechanisms for the involvement of indigenous peoples, especially women, in decision\u00admaking processes related to any projects or programmes impacting on their lives. 2. The United Nations system needs to pursue effective methods for maintaining and increasing its support to projects fostering the pro\u00ad tection and sustainable use of natural resources, in particular through the expansion of participatory research programmes designed to ex\u00ad plore and record indigenous women\u2019s knowledge and their specific ways of owning, using and maintaining diverse natural resources. Another important element is to ensure that indigenous women hold the ownership and copyright of that knowledge, and that their work in this sphere is granted due recognition. 3. The educational materials generated by different projects undertaken by United Nations organizations should be broadly disseminated as knowledge products that can be used to stimulate the creation of effective strategies as a tool for protecting and safeguarding in\u00ad digenous women\u2019s rights. In this context, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues can play a key role in facilitating the collection, dissemination and adaptation of relevant materials as tools for advo\u00ad cacy and outreach. 4.

Corruption endangers the stability of democratic institutions, discriminates in the delivery of government services and thus violates the rights of the people, the poor in particular. Corruption also poses a major obstacle to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). As such, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) considers its activities in the area of anti-corruption as essential to the strengthening of democratic governance in support of poverty alleviation and human rights protection.This also follows the broad consensus in the international community that good governance is essential to achieving sustainable development and poverty reduction. Reducing corruption also increases the effectiveness of aid in UNDP\u2019s partner countries. Since 1997, UNDP has been involved in accountability, transparency and integrity (ATI) programmes as part of our interventions to strengthen democratic governance. In past years, UNDP\u2019s interventions in the area of ATI and anti-corruption have evolved from principally supporting awareness-raising and advocacy to advising partners through holistic approaches grounded on early lessons and internally developed policy tools. A significant recent development is the entry into force of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) in 2005. As the United Nations agency that takes the lead on governance issues,UNDP will collaborate closely with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) as well as with national, bilateral and international organizations to support capacity development in support of UNCAC implementation. One of the obligations on State Parties to the Convention is that they make the necessary institutional arrangements to prevent and combat corruption. This comparative study of institutional arrangements to combat corruption, which covers 14 countries, is aimed at providing an overview of the various options available in this regard as well as discussing the advantages and disadvantages of these various options. The idea for this comparative study resulted from an initial request made by the parliamentary working group on anti- corruption of the State Great Hural in Mongolia to provide them with a series of options on how to design the institutional framework that will support future implementation of the national anti-corruption programme. The study provides a useful overview of different modalities used in different countries, and thus offers a menu of options and solutions for other countries in the region and beyond, based on a thorough understanding of the local political, social and economic situation. The study precedes and complements another study that is currently being undertaken by the Bureau for Development Policy (BDP) on anti-corruption laws in a selected number of countries. The comparative study on institutional arrangements to combat corruption is the result of a joint initiative by the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB), UNDP Mongolia and the Democratic Governance Group of the BDP. The paper was prepared by Patrick Keuleers (Regional Advisor on Public Administration Reform and Anti-Corruption,Democratic Governance Practice Team, RCB) and Nils Taxell (Research Officer, Democratic Governance Practice Team, RCB).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5cc5faa-da05-4bd6-8dc1-c3738348d33c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5cc5faa-da05-4bd6-8dc1-c3738348d33c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f6e9724721f1049f5a1d64559077bbe8b4d963782001c3d885c3ea73033c9c0a"}, "2": {"node_id": "808a5937-606f-46ad-b21c-994ed12ee2a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3f44e18d3409858daa85050020cdb81d3cbe665756443529e28668839854de0"}}, "hash": "dcfc454284e8f61b840d565850422e314b49a5b3100e012bc07309d5f687ce59", "text": "Inputs to the paper were provided by Pauline Tamesis (Anti-Corruption Advisor, BDP, New York), Turod Lkhagvajav (Programme Specialist, UNDP Mongolia) and Ryratana Suwanraks (Manager of the Governance Unit, UNDP Thailand).

There are many reasons for these sobering facts. One is the significant distributional implications that widespread corruption has on growth, equity and poverty. Corruption causes social disintegration and distorts economic systems; it implies discrimination, injustice and disrespect for human dignity; it endangers the stability of democratic institutions, discriminates in the delivery of government services and thus violates the rights of the people, and the poor in particular. Where corruption reigns, basic human rights and liberties come under threat and social and economic contracts become unpredictable. Corruption remains thus one of the main obstacles to achieving sustainable pro-poor development in support of the MDGs. A comprehensive attack on corruption remains a challenge for many countries, developing and developed alike. In the 1990s, the focus on good governance and the rise of democracy and empowerment of civil society that resulted from it created hope for a more open and transparent society, in which corrupt practices would no longer be tolerated.Since then,there have been promising trends,fuelled by successful awareness-raising campaigns organized by international civil society organizations, with Transparency International playing a leading role. An increasingly dynamic media helped to bring corruption into the open. But despite new legislation and the establishment of more anti-corruption and integrity institutions, overall results remain disappointing, with intentions still outnumbering accomplishments and tangible successes remaining sparse. The current wave of decentralization raises additional concerns that corruption will spread further to the local levels of government. Corruption is considered a failure of institutions,in particular those in charge of investigation,prosecution and enforcement. Much attention now goes to the implementation of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), which was signed in December 2003 by 95 countries and entered into force in 2005 following the 30th ratification of the Convention. The Convention provides a comprehensive framework for dealing with international and domestic corruption in the public and private sectors.The Convention also promotes the mutual exchange of relevant experiences and specialized knowledge and stimulates the discussion on problems of mutual concern and successful practices for preventing and combating corruption. One such crucial issue is to decide on the institutional arrangements for combatting corruption i.e., the choice regarding the kind of agency(ies) or commission(s)/ committee(s) that need to be established or strengthened in order to ensure a successul fight against corruption and related decisions on legal matters,policy,resources and other issues that need to be taken into consideration. This comparative research on institutional arrangements to fight corruption resulted from initial work done with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Mongolia and a s ubsequent request from the Mongolian parliamentary working group on anti-corruption to the UNDP Country Office in Ulaanbaatar to conduct an in-depth comparative study. Given the centrality of the institutional problem in a number of other countries where UNDP is involved or becoming involved in anti-corruption work, it was decided that the Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) would take the lead in conducting this study, in collaboration with UNDP Mongolia and the Anti-Corruption Advisor in the Democratic Governance Group in UNDP\u2019s Bureau for Development Policy (BDP). INTRODUCTION1 3 1 Singapore took 15 years to set up the CPIB as an independent agency beginning in 1952, outside the purview of the police.

The second part contains 14 country briefs that describe the key institutional mechanisms for fighting corruption in each of these countries. The countries have been chosen in an attempt to provide as wide a cross section as possible of the various existing institutional arrangements for combating corruption that exist today. Several of the countries have also been chosen as they are widely perceived as having been successful in coming to terms with corruption. The attached comparative table provides a summary overview of the different systems in each country. 1.1 The importance of effective anti-corruption bodies Despite the increased emphasis that is being given to fighting corruption, many anti-corruption efforts have failed for multiple reasons. One of the reasons is the apparent imbalance between prioritizing short-term, immediately visible targets that attack the symptoms rather than the root cause of corruption, over deeper, more difficult, as well as time and resource intensive systemic reforms (UNDP,2004:6). A well-thought through anti-corruption reform strategy requires a long-term vision and a clear understanding that fundamental change can take place, at the earliest, in the next and not in the present generation1. One crucial element of an anti-corruption strategy is to decide on the institutional models for fighting corruption and on the policies and capacity development efforts that will allow these institutions to effectively play their role. Whether to establish a separate institution such as an anti-corruption agency (ACA) to deal exclusively with corruption problems,to modify or adapt existing institutions, or to decide on some combination of both, remains an issue of debate in many developing countries. Each of these options brings along a number of legal, policy, resource and other factors that need to be carefully weighed. Equally, if not more important,is to ensure clear rules of engagement that will guide the interaction and collaboration between the various institutions involved in the holistic fight against corruption. While it is argued by some that it would suffice to merely copy the successful Hong Kong or Singapore models to curb corruption, the fact remains that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to fighting corruption. While \u2018best practices\u2019 exist and can provide useful guidelines, they are not automatically applicable to any one country\u2019s specific context2. 1.2 The UN Convention Against Corruption and institutional arrangements for combating corruption As stated in the UNCAC: Each State Party shall ensure the existence of a body or bodies, as appropriate, which prevent corruption. Each State Party shall grant these bodies the necessary independence, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system,to enable the body or bodies to carry out its or their functions effectively and free from any undue influence.The necessary material resources and specialized staff,as well as the training that such staff may require to carry out their functions,should be provided (Article 6). In addition to the articles dealing with prevention, Article 36 of the Convention stipulates that: Each State Party shall,in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system, ensure the existence of a body or bodies or persons specialized in combating corruption through law enforcement.Such body or bodies or persons shall be granted the necessary independence,in accordance with the fundamental principles of the legal system of the State Party,to be able to carry out their functions effectively and without any undue influence. Such persons or staff of such body or bodies should have the appropriate training and resources to carry out their tasks. The UNCAC thus requires the establishment of such institutions, unless they already exist in some form, in two specific areas: (i) preventative anti-corruption bodies; and (ii) bodies specialized in combating corruption through law enforcement. Yet, according to the proceedings of the preparatory meetings, State Parties may establish or use the same body to meet the requirements of both provisions. State Parties to the Convention thus will need to decide whether to establish new entities or to reform/improve existing ones, and whether to grant responsibilities to a single organization or to divide responsibilities between various prevention and law enforcement institutions. It will also be necessary for State Parties to decide on the mandates and powers of these institutions, their level of autonomy, the resources they will be entitled to and the rules of engagement that will guide the interaction and collaboration between these various institutions. The following chapters provide an overview of different models used in various countries, and looks at advantages and disadvantages of these different models. 4 Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 5 Several countries have opted for or are currently considering creating", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "423d736e-ee12-4ac2-ae5c-c5e1bb972f09": {"__data__": {"id_": "423d736e-ee12-4ac2-ae5c-c5e1bb972f09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "571164ebcbedde4d62e2d1da47b226d40f5ae2a7d7512c201d697dce339da99d"}}, "hash": "571164ebcbedde4d62e2d1da47b226d40f5ae2a7d7512c201d697dce339da99d", "text": "an independent commission or agency charged with the overall responsibility of combating corruption. However, the creation of such an institution is not a panacea to the scourge of corruption. There are actually very few examples of successful independent anti-corruption commissions/agencies. The most cited success stories are those of the Hong Kong Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), Singapore\u2019s Corrupt Practices Investigations Bureau (CPIB), Botswana\u2019s Directorate for Economic Crime and Corruption (DCEC) and New South Wales\u2019 Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). But as mentioned, these models are not easily replicable because of the specific contexts in which they operate (and the particular history of their creation and evolution). Establishing an ACA should thus be based on a systematic assessment of the local (political) context, and the particular needs and priorities of the country. 2.1 Independence of the anti-corruption agency The independence of an ACA is considered a fundamental requirement for its effectiveness as it allows the institution to act free from influence of powerful individuals or factions, and to investigate suspected corruption in all sectors and at all levels of society (Kpundeh and Levy, 2004). A constitutional amendment providing for the independence of the ACA is useful, however, it is not sufficient. But are the currently existing institutions really independent? Reality shows varying levels of autonomy, and even some of the most successful agencies or commissions are not fully independent of those in power3. For example, the DCEC in Botswana reports to the President,and the Director and staff fall under the Public Service Act. Singapore\u2019s CPIB is located within the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and its Director is directly responsible to the Prime Minister. Hong Kong\u2019s ICAC reports to the Chief Executive. So what makes these organizations more effective than others? Part of the answer lies in the design of appropriate checks and balances and the fact that they are constantly scrutinized through various oversight mechanisms that ensure their unbiased functioning. Hong Kong\u2019s ICAC, for example, has its activities scrutinized by four independent committees, including representatives from civil society, as well as the independent ICAC Complaints Committee, which receives, monitors and reviews all complaints against the Commission. Another way to enhance the autonomy of the ACA is to ensure that the selection and appointment of the executive(s) of the ACA is a shared responsibility of several institutions4. Security of tenure for the senior officials of the agency and appropriate immunity against civil litigation are also essential. Indonesia\u2019s Commission for the Eradication of Corruption (KPK) is appointed by Parliament from a list of candidates provided by the President5.The list of candidates is prepared by a Selection Committee appointed by the Government. In other countries, the head of the ACA is appointed by the President (Tanzania), the Governor (New South Wales),or President or Prime Minister with the consent of or on the recommendation of Parliament (Lithuania and Nigeria), or by Parliament on the recommendation of the Cabinet (Latvia), or by the King on the recommendation of the Prime Minister (Malaysia). In the Republic of Korea, the President appoints the chairman and the standing members A SPECIAL ANTI-CORRUPTION AGENCY OR COMMISSION2 3 Their independence is first from the police and to a lesser extent from the government. 4 The public credibility of a commission or agency will depend largely on whether the public perceives that its members have integrity, are competent, and that all relevant interests in society are represented. 5 It is essential that there is someone at the top who is the authority and who is accountable for the conduct of that body. Experience elsewhere suggests that a body that operates on the basis of collective decision-making processes has difficulties in acting quickly and decisively. 6 Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study of the Korea Independent Commission Against Corruption (KICAC). In addition, the Parliament and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court recommend three members each. To avoid manipulation by the main institutional host of the ACA, a number of countries have established multiple reporting lines or have shifted the reporting line to the people\u2019s representatives. But increased independence also requires built-in checks and balances to ensure that the autonomy is not abused. As mentioned above, Hong Kong\u2019s ICAC has four advisory committees (Corruption Prevention Advisory Committee, Citizens Advisory Committee on Community Relations, Operations Review Committee and Corruption Prevention Advisory Committee). Composed of specially appointed members drawn from the larger community, these committees meet regularly to review the ICAC activities.The ICAC in New South Wales is held accountable to citizens through the multiparty Parliamentary Joint Committee (PJC), which monitors its activities; through the Operations Review Committee6, which includes members of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b417e8d6-810a-44d6-8749-752818bf99b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b417e8d6-810a-44d6-8749-752818bf99b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9eeabffbb44f18496bdf77a148d18fdd6028cabc1766688d32c8dc8ada09bdb6"}}, "hash": "9eeabffbb44f18496bdf77a148d18fdd6028cabc1766688d32c8dc8ada09bdb6", "text": "the public and various government agencies; and through its obligation to report regularly to the public and annually on its major investigations.The PJC reports to both Houses of Parliament on any matter related to the ICAC, which, in the opinion of the PJC, should be directed to the attention of Parliament. Tanzania\u2019s Prevention of Corruption Bureau (PCB) also has a Committee of Control and Evaluation that supervises its performance, but the composition of the committee hardly guarantees independent scrutiny (the Committee is chaired by the Chief Secretary of the President\u2019s Office and composed of the PCB Director General, the Director General of the Tanzanian Intelligence and Security System and the Private Secretary of the President). Multiplying the reporting lines of the ACA is also a way to enhance oversight by making the ACA accountable to more than one authority. In Indonesia, the KPK is considered an independent state agency that reports on its activities to the President, the National Assembly and the State Auditor. Lithuania\u2019s Special Investigation Service (SIS) is accountable to the President and to the Parliament; it is obliged to report, at least twice per year, in writing to the President and to the Chairman of the Seimas. Thailand\u2019s National Counter Corruption Commission (NCCC) reports to the Senate. However, its annual report is also submitted to the House of Representatives and the Cabinet. Other countries have decided to shift reporting lines from a single-person institution, such as the President or the Prime Minister,to the legislative body representative of the people, hence allowing various parties in the parliament to scrutinize the activities of the ACA. Recent amendments to legislation in Uganda and Zambia have directed the Inspector General and the Anti-Corruption Commission, respectively, to report to Parliament rather than the Head of State. 2.2 Mandate The mandate of the special anti-corruption body will depend on several factors; in particular, the mandates of other relevant entities involved in areas such as policy-making, legislative change, law enforcement and prosecution, the existence of internal anti-corruption bodies (e.g. special investigation units within the police force) and whether the mandate is intended to deal with corruption at all levels of government (i.e. central, regional and municipal or local) (UNODC, 2004:92). To varying degrees, the following five key functions can be assigned to a special anti-corruption body: 1. Investigation; 2. Prosecution; 3. Education and awareness-raising; 4. Prevention; and 5. Coordination. Most of the ACAs apply the three-pronged strategy of prevention, investigation and education (e.g. Botswana, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Latvia, Lithuania, New South Wales and Thailand). The investigation function is central to the mandate of many of the ACAs covered in the country briefs. However, not all agencies are mandated to carry out investigations into alleged acts of corruption, as is currently the case for KICAC. For anti-corruption bodies that do have such a function, there is a variation in when they can initiate an investigation into alleged or suspected acts of corruption. Ideally, the ACA can initiate investigations into complaints received as well as on its own accord, regardless of whether a complaint has been received. In some cases, an investigation may also be prompted by a request from other institutions (e.g. by the Houses of Parliament in the case of the New South Wales ICAC). Typically, there is a structure within the ACA for assessing whether or not an investigation should be launched based upon a report received. In some cases, however, the ACA is required to investigate every report that is received (e.g. the Hong Kong ICAC). As reports from the general public are often one of the main sources of information, many ACAs have put mechanisms in place to ensure accessibility and ease of reporting. In Hong Kong, the ICAC has established regional district offices (as it has been found that individuals feel more comfortable in less formal settings) and the KICAC 6 The ICAC must consult the ORC before deciding on whether to discontinue or not to commence an investigation or a complaint or to discontinue an investigation already in progress. 7 A special anti-corruption agency or commission in the Republic of Korea has established a dedicated Corruption Report Center. In contrast, the complicated procedures for lodging complaints with Nigeria\u2019s Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission have been given as an explanation for the low number of complaints that the Commission has received.

Most, but not all, ACAs (e.g. the NCCC in Thailand) do consider anonymous reports. Several ACAs (e.g. the Hong Kong ICAC, the KICAC in the Republic of Korea and the KPK in Indonesia) have an explicit mandate to ensure the protection of witnesses and whistleblowers. Where witness protection has been seen as being successful, it has also led to a decrease in the number of anonymous reports of acts of corruption. The officers and staff of the various ACAs covered in the country briefs have varying degrees of investigative powers. These include the search of individuals and premises; arrest and/or detention; powers to request individuals or institutions to provide information; powers to request bank books; deploy surveillance measures e.g. wire taps; and seize property, among other things. Often, these powers of investigation require that the investigating officer seek prior written approval from a prosecutor (e.g.Malaysia,Singapore) or a judge/court (e.g. Thailand) and in some cases from the head of the anti-corruption body (e.g. Nigeria,Tanzania). An important part of the investigation function is the monitoring of the asset and liabilities declarations (and lifestyle) of senior officials, which also has a powerful prevention effect. Thailand\u2019s NCCC in particular has a broad and well-defined mandate in this area7. This is also the case with the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (CPCB) in Latvia8, tasked with monitoring the observance of the law on Prevention of Conflict of Interest in Activities of Public Officials. Where there is an obligation to maintain confidentiality, the ability to investigate a large number of asset declarations may be compromised, as it renders impossible the outsourcing of additional work to outside investigators (as has been the case in Botswana). But other agencies may also be involved in the investigation of asset declarations. In Bulgaria, the National Audit Office holds the register of asset declarations of senior officials. In Lithuania, senior officials need to file their asset declarations with the Official\u2019s Ethics Commission,which is tasked to analyse these declarations. In the Philippines, public servants are required to file a sworn statement of their assets and liabilities every year9 and lifestyle checks can be conducted by the Ombudsman or by the Presidential Grafts Commission. In Lithuania, responsibility lies with the Chief Officials Ethics Commission, which analyses asset declarations and ensures that holders of public office make decisions solely in terms of the public interest, securing the impartiality of the decisions made and preventing the emergence and spread of corruption in the public service. In Tanzania, it is the Public Leaders\u2019 Ethics Secretariat, headed by the Ethics Commissioner (appointed by the President), that has the duty to receive asset declarations. In all cases, the relationship between the ACA and the body in charge of monitoring asset declarations and income tax filings is crucial.Increasingly,the burden of proof is being reversed. While the traditional legal doctrine embodies the principle of a \u2018presumption of innocence\u2019until the prosecutor can prove an illicit act, corruption laws now increasingly presume illicit enrichment unless the accused can provide a satisfactory explanation for his unusual lifestyle. Whether asset declarations should be done by all civil servants or only selected officials remains an issue of debate10. To avoid overload of asset declarations and excessive cost of investigation11, a selective approach may be more appropriate.Where expertise and capacity is limited,it would be recommended to target only specific groups of public officials (e.g. elected or appointed political officials, high-level civil servants) as well as those that are employed in sectors that are prone to high levels of corruption (e.g. procurement officers, tax and customs officials). Not all ACAs have been granted a mandate to prosecute, a function that usually remains the responsibility of the judiciary12. After investigation by the ACA13 or one of the law enforcement agencies (e.g. the police), if there is grounds for prosecution, the matter is typically referred to the general prosecutor to bring the case to court. Based on the evidence 7 Persons holding political positions as well as high-ranking (central and local) government officials need to submit to the NCCC the account of their assets and liabilities, as well as those of their spouses and (dependent) children (every three years, as well as upon assuming office, upon leaving office and one year after leaving office).The NCCC has the responsibility to define the categories of positions that that are subject to asset inspection and to proscribe related rules and procedures.The NCCC can inspect any case where there is reasonable cause to suspect a state official (even if that person is not a high- ranking official) and order that state official to submit such a declaration.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4e20adf-a619-453b-9afc-4db4a608776a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4e20adf-a619-453b-9afc-4db4a608776a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d16a95c92b81b4aaea5fc32885040492a8bcb1d985a44ac7db16ecf51c7233b3"}}, "hash": "d16a95c92b81b4aaea5fc32885040492a8bcb1d985a44ac7db16ecf51c7233b3", "text": "8 The CBCB in Latvia also monitors observance by the political organizations of the party financing regulations. 9 The lifestyle probe/check will eventually cover all government officials, but initially, it will focus on high-ranking government officials (whether elected or appointed) as well as on officials of the following reportedly most graft-prone agencies: Bureau of Internal Revenue; Bureau of Customs; and Department of Public Works and Highways. 10 In Singapore for example, all public officers are required to make a declaration of non-indebtedness as well as a declaration of assets and investments at the time of appointment and subsequently once per year. 11 In the Philippines, it was estimated that the cost of investigation per case was around US$2,000. In 2004, the average time-frame for investigation of a case was around three months plus ten months of Ombudsman proceedings (reduced from the previous average of two years). 12 In Hong Kong, the power to prosecute after completion of investigations is vested with the Secretary for Justice, thus ensuring that no cases are brought to the courts solely on the judgement of the ICAC. 13 The Republic of Korea\u2019s KICAC is not mandated to carry out investigations. Singapore\u2019s CPIB can only investigate with the consent of the Prosecutor. 8 Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study provided, the latter exercises discretion over whether or not to bring criminal proceedings. There are, however, some interesting arrangements that merit attention. In Botswana, the Attorney General is mandated under the Constitution and the Criminal Law to direct all criminal prosecution, including the prosecution of cases related to corruption. But due to heavy workload of the Attorney General, the DCEC is increasingly taking on prosecution itself. In Lithuania, the Investigation Divisions of the SIS report directly to the Prosecutor General; they cannot be influenced by the director of the SIS. The police in Lithuania have a general obligation to investigate any crime brought to their attention, including corruption cases, but the latter are usually submitted to the SIS or the prosecutor. In Tanzania, prosecution is normally the mandate of the Director of Public Prosecution. However, the PCB may prosecute cases itself, pending approval by the Director of Public Prosecution, in which case it is the Legal and Prosecution Section within the PCB that is responsible for prosecuting corruption offences. In doing so, the section is to work closely with the Police and the Director of Public Prosecution. However, the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is itself susceptible to corruption.There are situations where the ACA should have priority of investigation and even be empowered to act itself as a prosecutor, subject to appropriate judicial review. In Thailand, the NCCC acts as prosecutor in cases that are brought before the Constitutional Court (Asset Declaration).It can also act as the prosecutor in the case when the accused is a Prosecutor General. Finally, when the Prosecutor General considers that the report of the NCCC is not complete and does not justify prosecution and no further agreement can be reached, the NCCC can decide to act itself as prosecutor in the case. In Indonesia, the KPK is empowered to take over an indictment or prosecution in a corruption case being carried out by the police or the Prosecutor\u2019s Office (who then need to hand over all relevant documentation).This takes place in any case where the police or the Prosecutor\u2019s Office are unable to carry out the case in a responsive and adequate manner14. In Latvia, the CPCB is also entitled to take over from other investigation institutions cases which fall within its mandate. This is also the case in Tanzania, where the Director General of the PCB may assume the responsibility for any investigation or prosecution commenced by the police for an offence involving corruption. In countries where the police and the prosecution services are considered highly corrupt, these measures are crucial. Where high-level officials are implicated in corrupt activities, the ACA may well be the only body with sufficient independence to bring the case to court. But where the existing prosecution service is functioning properly, a separate prosecution mandate may not be required (UNODC, 2004:92). A special case relates to the impeachment of high-level officials. An ACA typically cannot prosecute Presidents in office or other high-level officials as they often have immunity under the country\u2019s Constitution. Impeachment proceedings are thus in principle a matter for the national legislature.Nonetheless,legal provisions could allow the ACA to provide reports to the Speaker of the House/President of the National Assembly whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that the President or another high-level official has committed an offence and if there is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29fd1b56-1c91-4d7c-90c5-c43b38756224": {"__data__": {"id_": "29fd1b56-1c91-4d7c-90c5-c43b38756224", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "824c79eb81c173043fa039b320ce65ee9700b6ca16cb8d71e9ec4845eadd1eac"}}, "hash": "824c79eb81c173043fa039b320ce65ee9700b6ca16cb8d71e9ec4845eadd1eac", "text": "prima facie evidence admissible in a court of law (Pope, 1999). It is then normally the responsibility of the Legislature to proceed with impeachment in accordance with constitutional provisions. Many anti-corruption programmes have been considered instruments of the state, mainly targeting the civil service and/or other relevant regulatory institutions.The Hong Kong experience has shown that the education and awareness- raising function is crucial in each anti-corruption strategy. Transparency is needed to establish a minimal level of credibility for prevention purposes and as a measure of success. Hong Kong\u2019s ICAC is noted for its unique outreach programme. It has used press releases, public information announcements, interviews, documentaries, posters, informational leaflets,meetings,public speaking and worked with schools and universities to convey an anti-corruption message to the public. It sponsors sporting, cultural and entertainment events that are aimed at youth and that emphasize anti-corruption themes.In 1995, it spearheaded a collaborative effort with six major chambers of commerce to found the Hong Kong Ethics Development Centre to promote ethics in corporate governance15. The ICAC in New South Wales also has an extensive mandate in this area. New South Wales\u2019 ICAC holds public hearings to expose corruption.These hearings also serve to increase the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the investigations. Malaysia is now also focusing its anti-corruption efforts on the family as a core social nucleus within society.The focus on families also brings in the youth,which are the next generation of leaders. In the framework of Malaysia\u2019s National Integrity Plan, which is based on the results from a national survey on public perceptions of corruption completed in January 2003, the 14 Article 9 of the Law on the KPK provides that the KPK shall take over an indictment or prosecution if: a report by a member of the general public about an act of corruption has been ignored; the processing of a corruption case goes on for too long or is delayed without a valid reason; the handling of the corruption case has been manipulated in order to protect the accused; the handling of the corruption case has been subject to corrupt acts; there has been executive, legislative or judicial interference in the case; or any other circumstances where the Police or the Prosecutor\u2019s Office are unable to carry out the case in a responsible and adequate manner. 15 Today, nearly one in ten reports of corruption in the private sector is made by senior business managers (ICAC website \u2013 Hong Kong). 9 A special anti-corruption agency or commission Government has established the Malaysian Institute of Integrity,through which it aims to enhance awareness about corruption and the need for transparency in the public service (ADB/OECD, 2004:55). Apart from general education measures,the ACA should also be in a position to develop, propose and, where appropriate, implement preventive measures, and/or to collaborate closely with other agencies that have a mandate to do so. Hong Kong\u2019s ICAC has an extensive mandate in this area16. This is to examine the practices and procedures of government departments and public bodies in order to facilitate the discovery of corrupt practices and to secure the revision of work methods/procedures which may be conducive to corrupt practices.Further,it is to instruct,advise and assist any person, on the latter\u2019s request, on ways in which corrupt practices may be eliminated and to advise heads of government departments or of public bodies of changes in practices or procedures compatible with the effective discharge of their duties which the Commissioner thinks are necessary to reduce the likelihood of corrupt practices. Botswana\u2019s DCEC, Singapore\u2019s CPIB and New South Wales\u2019ICAC have similar mandates.Indonesia\u2019s KPK also has a broad mandate to monitor the governance of the State. It can conduct reviews of the management system of all state institutions; if the recommendations made by KPK are not adhered to, the KPK is to report this to the President, the Parliament and the State Auditor. Tanzania\u2019s PCB (Research, Control and Statistics Division) carries out research on various policies, laws, regulations and operations of different institutions in order to detect loopholes that lead to corruption. It also conducts research on methods for combating corruption adopted in other countries. Part of these preventive measures is the ability to take account of lessons learned and use them to propose amendments to laws, regulations and procedures. In some countries the ACA is authorized to make such recommendations to both administrative and legislative bodies,publicly if necessary.The CPCB in Latvia and the SIS in Lithuania are entitled to analyse legal acts and make proposals for review. The SIS has the power to propose legislation to the President and to Parliament.

The capacity to conduct research into public opinion on as well as trends and the nature of corruption is essential in order to devise effective strategies for combating corruption. In its assessment, the European Commission found that lack of research capacity in Latvia and Lithuania was a concern, and it was recommended that capacity be developed in this regard. In New South Wales, it was concluded that the most efficient and effective placement of the capacity for research was within the ACA itself. In several of the countries studied below, the ACA does indeed have research functions. However, this is a role that, in many countries,is also carried out by other institutions as well as by civil society. 2.3 Summary: Advantages and disadvantages of an independent anti-corruption body As the corrupt have become more sophisticated, conventional law enforcement agencies are becoming less able to detect and prosecute complex corruption cases. The experiences of the CPIB in Singapore, the DCEC in Botswana, the ICAC of New South Wales and the ICAC in Hong Kong demonstrate the effectiveness of a single anti-corruption commission/agency in implementing the anti-corruption policies and legislation. All these experiences demonstrate the need for the ACA to be separated from the police, especially when the latter is perceived to be corrupt. A growing number of countries in the Asia region have opted for a centralized anti-corruption agency. Hong Kong, Malaysia, Nepal, and Singapore have been working with this model for decades; Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Korea, and Pakistan have established them more recently; and Cambodia and Mongolia are taking steps towards creating such an institution. In Bangladesh, an act establishing an independent Anti-Corruption Commission was passed in 2004, but a commission has yet to be established (ADB/OECD, 2004). The successful cases also stress the importance of strong political determination and leadership. Where they have been successful, the ACAs have enjoyed high levels of political and public support, had sufficient resources, adequate research abilities, and have adopted both rigorous investigative methods and creative programmes of prevention and public education. The need for a special committee(s) charged with monitoring its activities has also proven indispensable. 16 Prevention (and the community education and awareness-raising that goes with it) has been a core activity of the Hong Kong model, often informed by the revelations of investigators working on the enforcement side.This enabled the Commission to develop a coherent and coordinated set of strategies, with results that are the envy of many.Those who have tried to copy the model have largely failed because they have lacked both this coherent approach and the resources necessary to carry it through. 10 Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study In contrast, insufficient focus on prevention and education, weak legal enforcement, lack of resources, lack of political will, lack of independence and related political interference17 and inadequate laws are considered the main reasons for most of the failures18. There is also an opportunity cost in creating new institutions in a context of low state capacity, which characterizes most of the Least Developed Countries in the region. Prevention is better than prosecution and an effective ACA with investigation and monitoring/coordination responsibilities and with sufficient authority and independence from politicians is considered best placed for that task (Pope, 1999). The box below summarizes the advantanges and disadvantages of having an independent anti-corruption body (summarized from UNODC, 2004). Advantages and disadvantages of having an independent anti-corruption body Advantages: \ufffd Sends a signal that the government takes anti-corruption efforts seriously; \ufffd High degree of specialization and expertise can be achieved; \ufffd High degree of autonomy can be established to insulate the institution from corruption and other undue influences; \ufffd The institution will be separate from the agencies and departments that it will be responsible for investigating; \ufffd A completely new institution enjoys a \u2018fresh start\u2019, free from corruption and other problems that may be present in existing institutions; \ufffd It has greater public credibility; \ufffd It can be afforded better security protection; \ufffd It will have greater political, legal and public accountability; \ufffd There will be greater clarity in the assessment of its progress, successes and failures; \ufffd There will be faster action against corruption.Task-specific resources will be used and officials will not be subject to the competing priorities of general law enforcement, audit and similar agencies; and \ufffd It incorporates an additional safeguard against corruption in that it will be placed in a position to monitor the conventional law-enforcement community and, should the agency itself be corrupted, vice versa.

Even in countries where agencies or commissions were well-resourced and established under model legislation,they have all relied on the interaction and effectiveness of other institutions. This section will provide an overview of some of the key complementary governing institutions (e.g. prosecutor, ombudsman, auditor and courts)19 that play (or have the potential to play) an important role in combating corruption. The text box below (extracted from the UNDP Practice Note on Anti-Corruption) provides an overview of the different types of institutional reforms that need to be considered to strengthen the enforcement of anti-corruption incentives. OTHER INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN ANTI-CORRUPTION3 Institutional reforms to be considered to strengthen the enforcement of anti-corruption incentives \ufffd Establish independent investigators, prosecutors, and adjudicators that ensure \u2018equal\u2019enforcement of the laws and regulations. \ufffd Strengthen capacity and integrity of the police as the frontline investigative agency for criminal infractions. \ufffd Strengthen and ensure independence and accountability of the judicial system. \ufffd Provide adequate powers of investigation and prosecution consistent with international human rights norms. \ufffd Integrate transparent mechanisms, which eliminate privileges that have no relations with the needs of the public, and which high public officials enjoy by reason of their office, into the reform of enforcement measures. \ufffd Develop effective complaints mechanisms and procedures for appeals, whether internally by a public servant or by a member of the public. \ufffd Develop mechanisms to protect whistleblowers: encourage the development of institutions,laws and practices,which ensure that responsible citizens can report corrupt practices without fear of reprisals, and to ensure that the media is empowered to play its pivotal role in holding relevant individuals and institutions accountable. \ufffd Tackle special sectors that are known to be breeding corruption (e.g. in Georgia, the fight against corruption started in the Ministry of Education, considered to be one of the most corrupt systems). \ufffd Impose powerful deterrents for the would-be corrupt, such as civil penalties, blacklisting of corrupt firms, extradition arrangements, and other legal provisions that enable the profits of the corrupt to be seized and forfeited, inside or outside the country. \ufffd Strengthen the ministry in charge of civil service reform and establish a close relationship between it and other anti-corruption agencies (enforced codes of conduct; increased supervision; results-oriented enforcement, management-based measurable performance indicators; empowering the public through citizens\u2019 charters; a credible public complaints system; access to information. 19 Although the police force also has an important role to play in combating corruption, this institution will not be covered separately; where relevant, it will be discussed in relation to the other institutions covered. 12 Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 3.1 Prosecutor Prosecutors play a key role in the process of bringing corrupt activities before the courts, moving the process from investigation to prosecution.A country must have legislation that ensures the political independence not only of the ACA but also of the judiciary and the public prosecutors. The interaction between the anti-corruption body and the prosecutor has been described in each of the country briefs. The relationship between the ACA and the Public Prosecutor is a critical one. In principle, there is no binding framework within civil or common law countries about who is to retain investigation and prosecution powers (unless there is a Constitutional provision for it). Where the Constitution prescribes that the prosecutor has sole oversight for all prosecutions, s/he is usually empowered to intervene in all criminal proceedings initiated by any other person or authority. However, the question in many developing countries is whether the prosecutor effectively enjoys sufficient independence to decide to bring a case to court. Very often, the weakness of the anti-corruption machinery becomes visible at the crossroads of investigation (by the ACA or a similar body)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de7ba1aa-db1f-4995-8fce-efa69045c4d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "de7ba1aa-db1f-4995-8fce-efa69045c4d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95e0dd527c54ca906215fcbbf21eeae7b31ae3ebc2cc3f910777a406e493bbb2"}}, "hash": "95e0dd527c54ca906215fcbbf21eeae7b31ae3ebc2cc3f910777a406e493bbb2", "text": "and prosecution by the judiciary and/or court proceedings. There are also examples of countries that have chosen not to establish a special anti-corruption agency, instead establishing a special anti-corruption unit under the Public Prosecutor. This is currently the case in Mongolia20 (Special Investigation Unit), in Nicaragua (Investigations and Advice Unit), in Mozambique (Central Anti-Corruption Unit) and in Colombia. In Colombia, the 1991 Penal Code grants significant investigatory powers to the Attorney General21. Similarly, in Tajikistan, the general prosecutor is responsible for the implementation of the Law on Fighting Corruption. In Mozambique, the new Anti-Corruption Act (2001) outlines a structure whereby \u201cthe Public Prosecutor and the Criminal Investigation Police are responsible for the prevention and fight against the crimes foreseen in the law\u201d. The Unit will have specially trained prosecutors and police to work in the area of corruption. The Unit will work under the Attorney General\u2019s Office22. Japan has created specialized investigation departments within the prosecutors\u2019 offices in major cities. But in countries where corruption is widespread, there is serious scepticism against an internal anti-corruption unit within the Prosecutor\u2019s Office. In addition to the existing enforcement problems, it remains to be seen whether the prosecutor would have the capacity and moral authority to undertake preventive measures such as coordinating with civil society and youth organizations and interacting frequently with the media and the education system. Where there is a special anti-corruption body, it should, under certain conditions,have the power and the capacity to launch prosecutions independently of the Attorney General. Examples of this have been provided in an earlier section of this report (e.g. Indonesia, Nigeria and Thailand). But whatever the relationship with the prosecutor, the ACA should be entitled to enjoy all the rights of law enforcement officers and thus have full access to government documents and civil servants (Pope, 1999). 3.2 Auditor General The UNCAC treats audit requirements as elements of prevention of corruption, in both the public sector (Article 9) and the private sector (Article 12), but specific elements of the Convention, such as the requirements to preserve the integrity of books, records and other financial documents make it clear that the functions of deterrence, detection, investigation and prosecution are also contemplated (UNODC, 2004:100). Audit institutions play a critical role, as they help promote sound financial management and accountable and transparent government and thereby contribute to both preventing and detecting corrupt practices. Full independence of audit institutions \u2013 in terms of personnel and budget, wide-reaching authority and adequate investigative powers, including calling witnesses and seizing documents \u2013 are essential to the proper functioning of such institutions (ADB/OECD, 2004:17). The role of the Audit Office in fighting corruption is not to be underestimated. Regular audits prevent corruption and economic crimes by making them riskier and thus reduce opportunities for corruption. Audits support the anti- corruption efforts because they verify information and analysis, identify weaknesses, malfeasance or other problems that insiders may be unable or unwilling to identify; identify strengths and weaknesses in administrative structures and procedures; report on their activities and thus generate political pressure to act in response to problems identified. 20 There is now a majority in Parliament working on anti-corruption that is in favour of establishing an independent ACA, and a revised draft of the anti-corruption law has been finalized.The draft law gives the anti-corruption body a mandate to investigate allegations of corruption, prevent corruption and educate and mobilize the public.The prosecution and trial of offences is left to other organs of state. It remains to be seen, however, whether there will be sufficient political support in Parliament and in the government for the ACA option. 21 This official is appointed to a four-year term by the Supreme Court and cannot be dismissed or reappointed. Operating within administrative and budgetary autonomy, the office investigates and brings charges before judges, directs and coordinates the functions of the Judicial Police and protects victims, witnesses and others involved in proceedings. 22 There are mixed views regarding Mozambique\u2019s decision to strengthen the Attorney General\u2019s Office as the primary anti-corruption mechanism instead of establishing some form of an anti-corruption commission.There are serious questions regarding the Unit\u2019s capacity for oversight and coordination and outreach and civic awareness functions. 13 Other institutions involved in anti-corruption But there are important differences depending on the appointing authority and reporting lines.This could be either the executive (in which case they are part of the internal, self-policing function of the governance pillars) or the legislature (in which case they are part of a process of \u2018horizontal accountability\u2019 or oversight), or both. The oversight function of the Auditor General is often also hampered by the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22237272-f7bf-4b4d-b3de-31ca9fac9c69": {"__data__": {"id_": "22237272-f7bf-4b4d-b3de-31ca9fac9c69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31889b72f7f8d2be02d3c91d56dfaeb42a9fc6ba3636f744b43a4015e4c120b8"}}, "hash": "31889b72f7f8d2be02d3c91d56dfaeb42a9fc6ba3636f744b43a4015e4c120b8", "text": "weakness of parliamentary oversight committees. It is not unusual for parliament to ignore the audit reports that were submitted to them. The positions of Auditor Generals in most South Asian countries are constitutional. But there are cases where the independence of the Auditor General is compromised since the position is, in practice, subordinate to the Ministry of Finance (e.g. Bangladesh). The Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) in the Republic of Korea has an extensive mandate including undertaking investigations pertaining to the use of public funds23. Prior to the establishment of the KICAC, a Commission for Prevention of Corruption was created to advise the BAI on the fight against corruption. The New South Wales Audit Office also provides advice to Parliament, the Government and public sector agencies on public sector performance. The case of Bulgaria is particularly interesting because of the primary role given to the Auditor in the fight against corruption.The National Audit Office in Bulgaria is composed of a President and ten members elected for a nine-year term by the National Assembly. The Bulgarian Auditor not only holds the register of asset declarations submitted by senior public servants;the Auditor also audits the financial activities of political parties.However,the Auditor has no enforcement role. Should it uncover criminal acts, it is obliged to submit these acts to the Public Prosecutor. Auditors usually report to the National Assembly. There are examples, as mentioned above, where the latter has failed to act on the recommendations made in the reports (e.g. Botswana and Bulgaria).In a number of countries,the annual report of the ACA is shared with the Auditor. In Indonesia, the KPK is required to report on its activities to the Audit Board; the latter also falls within the supervisory mandate of the former. It is thus equally essential to ensure that the ACA has access to the audit reports. Because of the secrecy acts that still prevail in many developing countries, reports may need to be transmitted solely to senior officials to prevent broader disclosure of sensitive information. Experiences from countries that have been successful show a close collaboration between the ACA and the auditor general, as well as with the Office of the Ombudsman (see below). Reviews of corruption allegations are also undertaken by the Inspector General in Uganda. In many cases, these audit offices function like an Ombudsman registering citizen complaints on corruption. In other cases (e.g. Bolivia), they coordinate anti-corruption activities among agencies. Still others have investigatory and prosecutorial powers (e.g. Peru\u2019s Tribunal for Public Ethics and Uruguay\u2019s Public Prosecutor). 3.3 Public Service Reform Agency or Public Service Commission Public sector reform is imperative to any kind of anti- corruption strategy.The ACA should work closely with these institutions as the reform of the public service is an essential element of the anti-corruption prevention measures. Organizational culture cannot be controlled from the outside, and it has thus proved necessary that public sector managers themselves take responsibility for integrity within their respective workplaces. It is also essential to monitor management responses to preventive measures and recommendations made by the various anti-corruption and audit bodies. One of the main reasons for Singapore\u2019s success in combating corruption has been the government\u2019s efforts to remove the opportunities for corruption \u2013 through a sustained focus on streamlining cumbersome administrative procedures, cutting down red tape and enacting procurement reforms. The leading-by-example policy in Singapore\u2019s public service has been a decisive factor in its anti-corruption strategy.The high wages in the public service are usually considered one of the main contributing factors to the low levels of corruption in Singapore, but it must be remembered that these high salary levels are a main outcome of the anti-corruption policies, rather than an explanatory factor for their success24. What is key in the Singapore case is that the primary responsibility for preventing corruption lies with the respective departments. The Permanent Secretary in each ministry is responsible for ensuring that each department has a committee tasked with reviewing anti-corruption measures as well as to ensure that adequate measures are taken to prevent corrupt practices. This also includes putting in place strict conflict-of-interest policies. 23 The BAI in the Republic of Korea reports to the President, the National Assembly and the Government. 24 In 1959, when the anti-corruption strategy was launched, GNP per capita in Singapore was only US$443.Thirty-eight years later, that figure had grown by more than 11 percent annually, mainly due to gains in revenue and productivity that resulted from the anti-corruption policy and from rapid growth- oriented development policies, including high investments in human development. By 1994, the public sector wages ranked among the highest in the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ab31e3b-2364-48f1-8481-7edd628c232b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ab31e3b-2364-48f1-8481-7edd628c232b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f48ed46318da0986a59a2e0ba173da02595e3c15d46d1495f5d1a6a89920a5a1"}}, "hash": "f48ed46318da0986a59a2e0ba173da02595e3c15d46d1495f5d1a6a89920a5a1", "text": "world, nearing private sector wage levels. 14 Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study In South Africa, the anti-corruption mandate has been divided between the Police, the Prosecutor, the Auditor General, the South African Revenue Services and the Public Service Commission (among others). They all have as their core function to strengthen employee integrity, financial management and the quality of administration within the public service. In the absence of a special anti-corruption agency, South Africa relies very much on its civil service and the public sector managers to maintain a culture of integrity in government.Within the Department of Public Service and Administration, the Public Service Anti-Corruption (PSAC) Unit also has a coordinating function and is responsible for the development and implementation of the Public Service Anti-Corruption Strategy. The PSAC Unit also provides advisory and support services to the public sector on implementation of anti-corruption policies and legislation as well as convenes the Anti-Corruption Coordinating Committee. The Unit does not, however, carry out any corruption investigations itself. In addition, in its efforts to prevent and combat corruption, the government has enacted that all departments and institutions in the Public Service must establish a minimum capacity to undertake risk assessments, implement fraud plans, investigate allegations of corruption, manage whistle-blowing and promote ethical behaviour among their employees. It appears, however, that many agencies do not have the policies and procedures in place to comply with these obligations. In Thailand, the Civil Service Commission as well as the Public Sector Development Commission play key roles. The former acts as the central agency in protecting the merit system and encouraging results-based management, transparency and accountability in the public service. The latter monitors the implementation of the Decree on Rules and Procedures for Good Public Administration. Also important is that citizens in Thailand can file a complaint with the Office of the Official Information Commission in case of non-compliance by a public agency to disclose information. The Prevention of Corruption Act in Lithuania provides that all state and municipal agencies may establish internal units for the prevention of corruption within their respective mandates. The Public Service Commission in Fiji established a special unit not only to investigate reports of corruption but also to make inquiries if there is a suspicion of corrupt activity. A Code of Conduct Bill is to be tabled in the House of Representatives that will apply to all the holders of high state office, including the President, the Vice President, Ministers, Members of Parliament,Chief Executives and those who hold statutory appointments or executive positions in statutory authorities. The legislation will demand exacting standards of integrity. Where there is an ACA, it usually has a mandate to make recommendations on how to improve public management to reduce opportunities for corruption as part of its preventive mandate. In some countries, the recommendations of the ACA to government agencies are binding. In other countries, public agencies are not required by law to follow the recommendations of the ACA. In those cases, the ACA should, however, be allowed to give recommendations in its annual report to Parliament, the government and the Auditor, which can hold the departments accountable if no improvements are made. 3.4 Ombudsman The importance of the Ombudsman lies in the fact that,as an independent institution, it can be considered an additional instrument for preventing and combating corruption, covering a different area of activities than those of already existing institutions in that the Ombudsman protects citizens from abuse by the public administration. Most importantly, the Ombudsman should be independent25 of other branches of the government/administration, but should work in cooperation with other autonomous regulators,such as courts and audit bodies (World Bank,1999). The mandate of the Ombudsman generally goes beyond corruption cases and includes incidents of maladministration attributable to incompetence, bias, error or indifference that are not necessarily corrupt. In Botswana, the main mandate of the Ombudsman is to investigate complaints received from the public of injustice or maladministration in the public service26. This can be an advantage as the complainant in many cases will not know of or suspect the presence of corruption. Instead, the Ombudsman will determine if corruption is present and, if necessary, refer the matter to an ACA or prosecutor for further action. In other countries, the Ombudsman can also directly investigate complaints of corruption. In the Republic of Korea the Ombudsman does not have statutory power to investigate on its own initiative,nor are its recommendations binding. Its strength lies in the publication of its reports. In New South Wales, the Ombudsman also monitors the activities of the Police Integrity Commission27, established to prevent, detect and investigate serious", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "420ce784-bcc4-4be8-acf1-2c0474db34cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "420ce784-bcc4-4be8-acf1-2c0474db34cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6cb63b5291ca7047f0885de22397a239e3ad98266f2451df87993a576b5f2a14"}}, "hash": "6cb63b5291ca7047f0885de22397a239e3ad98266f2451df87993a576b5f2a14", "text": "misconduct within the police. The Ombudsman also has the power to review existing legislation. 25 In Lithuania, the Ombudsman can only be removed from office by a majority vote in Parliament. 26 Should the recommendations of the Ombudsman not be followed, the Ombudsman is obliged to make a special report to the national Assembly. 27 The ICAC cannot investigate or deal with a matter involving the conduct of police officers, even when this involves the conduct of public officers who are not from the police. ICAC has not been successful in combating corruption and misconduct in the New South Wales Police Force, which is the reason why the Police Integrity Commission was established. Nonetheless, corruption within the Police Force apparently remains a serious problem. 15 Other institutions involved in anti-corruption In certain countries, the Office of the Ombudsman operates as the anti-corruption body (e.g. in Papua New Guinea and Uganda). Latvia has no Ombudsman, but the functions are carried out by the State Office for the Protection of Human Rights (the establishment of the Ombudsman is being considered). Others would argue that there is a clear distinction between the two roles: that the Ombudsman is there to promote administrative fairness,and that this is best achieved by winning the confidence of the bureaucracy. An agency or commission that is also charged with the investigation and prosecution of public servants is more likely to be feared than trusted (Pope, 1999). In Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Vanuatu, the Ombudsmen have a mandate similar to that of the ACAs. The Philippines\u2019 ombudsperson is also equipped with the requisite investigative means. India has set up decentralized vigilance institutions responsible for the prevention and investigation of corruption cases (ADB/OECD, 2004:41). In Sri Lanka, the ombudsman, known as the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, has been created to investigate complaints against government departments, statutory boards, corporations, government authorities and other local government institutions. The Commissioner also examines the infringement of fundamental rights, general public maladministration, failure to afford access to public information and acts of administrative abuses. Negligence and omissions are the subject matters of most complaints. 3.5 The Courts The competence, professionalism and integrity of judges are critical to the success of anti-corruption efforts. The unique importance of judicial institutions is recognized in the UNCAC, which devotes a specific provision (Article 11) to the issues in this area. This article calls for measures which strengthen integrity and prevent opportunities for judicial corruption itself to be taken without prejudice to judicial independence. Article 11 also calls for similar action in respect to prosecutors in systems where they enjoy a similar degree of independence. Yet, as is evident in several of the country briefs, the judiciary is often the weakest part of the institutional arrangements put in place for combating corruption,thus impacting on the credibility of the national integrity system as a whole. In Botswana, there have been several instances where trials have been delayed, thus affecting the conviction rate of the cases brought before the courts by the DCEC.Cases have also been delayed within the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, prompting the DCEC to develop its own capacity to prosecute corruption cases (see above). Apart from the fact that the judiciary itself is being perceived as highly corrupt, in Bulgaria, a further concern has been the lack of judges, prosecutors and investigators specialized in corruption offences. If the judicial system is weak and unpredictable, efforts to provide remedies through the courts will be less than effective. Therefore, some countries have established a special court to judge corruption cases. Indonesia, for example, has a Court of Corruption mandated to appraise and decide on criminal cases of corruption, including those committed outside the jurisdiction of Indonesia (if the perpetrator is of Indonesian nationality). Whether there is a special anti-corruption court or not, part of the anti-corruption efforts should be to strengthen the integrity of the judiciary to ensure appropriate professional development to combat corruption and to establish adequate accountability structures. While reforms of other institutions, such as the legal profession, prosecution services and law enforcement agencies, are also critical, it is at the judicial level that corruption does the greatest harm and where reforms have the greatest potential to improve the situation (UNODC, 2004:51). 17 Not all countries have opted for a special ACA. Bulgaria and South Africa are examples of two countries that decided not to establish such a body but rather to strengthen existing institutions. They have set up alternative institutions to assure specialized competence in detecting and investigating corruption. In Bulgaria, a central role is played by the National Service of the Police, the National Security", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "954ca874-bcfe-4169-85a8-6068f25ad5c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "954ca874-bcfe-4169-85a8-6068f25ad5c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2837991896fa90dd59759b28434969f11a56b8ca1f070b5e09a477a95cf49e6f"}}, "hash": "2837991896fa90dd59759b28434969f11a56b8ca1f070b5e09a477a95cf49e6f", "text": "Service, the National Service on Combating Organised Crime, the Financial Intelligence Agency and the Financial Control Agency. The Ombudsman and the National Audit Office also play a key role in corruption prevention. The South African government also decided to maintain the current structures for combating corruption and opted for incremental improvements to existing agencies. But an Anti-Corruption Coordination Committee was established to coordinate the work of the different agencies. The anti- corruption mandate has thus been divided between the Police, the Prosecutor, the Auditor General, the South African Revenue Services and the Public Service Commission. A key role lies with the National Prosecuting Agency. The Internal Complaints Directorate investigates alleged misconduct within the police force. Dedicated anti-corruption institutions are more likely to be established where corruption is widespread or is perceived to be so widespread that existing institutions cannot be adapted to develop and implement the necessary reforms,or where the existing institutions are themselves considered corrupt. If the established criminal justice system is able to handle the problem of corruption, the disadvantages of creating a specialized agency will outweigh the advantages. Many of the advantages,such as specialization,expertise and even the necessary degree of autonomy can be achieved by establishing dedicated units within existing law- enforcement agencies.This results in fewer disadvantages in the coordination of anti-corruption efforts with other law enforcement cases (UNODC, 2004). However, as is evident in the case studies, in the countries that have not established an ACA and instead rely on existing institutions,coordination appears to be one of the main problems, requiring special institutional solutions. COUNTRIES WITHOUT A SPECIAL ANTI-CORRUPTION AGENCY4 19 As the various institutions involved in combating corruption often have a complementary role, the success of the ACA largely depends on good cooperation and communication with, and the proper functioning of, other law-enforcement agencies, especially the police, Public Prosecutors and the courts. Regardless of the institutional setup a country has chosen, effective cooperation of the involved actors determines whether the fight against corruption will be successful. Improvement of cooperation between existing law enforcement agencies is thus a priority for many countries in the Asia region. In the Philippines, formalized information exchange has been established between relevant law-enforcement agencies so as to enhance their cooperation, and the establishment of inter-agency consultative bodies and ad hoc task forces and/or the organization of joint training programmes has been carried out. Papua New Guinea is setting up an anti-corruption alliance that pools and coordinates resources of different law enforcement agencies.The Republic of Korea is operating an anti-corruption policy coordination body composed of ten related agencies, such as ministries and supervisory bodies (ADB/OECD, 2004:41-42). Examples of mechanisms established in countries without an ACA include the Commission for Coordinating Actions Against Corruption established in Bulgaria in 2002. It is an inter-ministerial commission with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Justice and the Audit Office. The main function of the Commission is to coordinate and control the implementation of the national anti-corruption strategy and to analyse the effectiveness of the efforts to combat corruption. The Commission does not have investigative powers of its own and is not allowed to intervene in corruption cases. In addition, a Parliamentary Commission was also established to identify gaps in enforcement practices and propose amendments to existing laws. Following on the recommendations of the Public Service Anti-Corruption Strategy, South Africa established the Anti- Corruption Coordination Committee, composed of those agencies that have anti-corruption functions, including national as well as provincial departments. Notwithstanding this committee, coordination remains problematic because of overlapping legislative mandates. But coordination is not only a problem in countries that do not have a special ACA. The oversupply of institutions, often with conflicting mandates, is a problem that is common to many countries. Coordination is needed, and as mentioned above,a clear mandate needs to be granted to the institution that will take up this responsibility. In Indonesia, the KPK has been charged with coordinating and supervising all institutions involved in anti-corruption activities. The KPK may request the Police or Prosecutor\u2019s Office to investigate a case further if it is not able to find enough evidence. The Police and Prosecutor\u2019s Office may carry out indictments in relation to corrupt cases but they must inform KPK within 14 days. The KPK is mandated to coordinate their activities.

In practice however, many problems remain, in particular because of the multiplication of the law enforcement agencies (Finance Police, Security Police, State Police, and Prosecutor). This explains why a Parliamentary Crime and Corruption Prevention Council was established, headed by the Prime Minister and tasked with coordinating and supervising all State Authorities\u2019 activities in the field of crime and corruption prevention. COORDINATION5 20 Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study In Lithuania, it is the Prosecutor who is tasked with distributing criminal cases taking into account the specific area of competence of the various law enforcement bodies. The SIS is usually charged with corruption cases, but the Police also has a general obligation to investigate any crime brought to its attention, including corruption cases. Lack of coordination thus forced the government to clarify the responsibility for the distribution of corruption cases. Thailand also seems to be struggling with a coordination problem.Thailand has designed a complex institutional web of organizations involved in combating corruption, whereby corruption can be tackled from different angles. But with the increase in the number of agencies involved in anti-corruption activities, there is an increasing risk of overlap and duplication, hence the need for effective coordination mechanisms. When deciding on the number of institutions involved in anti-corruption activities and related distribution of responsibilities, the challenge will be to allow just enough redundancy \u2013 and even rivalry \u2013 to expose corruption if the primary ACA fails to do so (UNODC, 2004).There should not, however, be so much duplication allowed that the flow of intelligence becomes reduced or the investigative and prosecutorial opportunities available to the primary authority become diminished. In Zambia, for example, the Police, the Anti-Corruption Commission and the Electoral Commission each have been denying that it was their responsibility to enforce the electoral law, resulting in a complete lack of enforcement of the Electoral Law and related regulations (Tamesis, 2004:6). To solve the problem, the ACA or another agency may be responsible for coordinating anti-corruption efforts, either in a comprehensive manner or in certain areas (e.g. the Prosecutor may be responsible for coordinating all investigations). Where coordination remains problematic, a special committee or commission may be established. Members of such a committee/commission can include representatives from the executive branch,judiciary,legislature,civil servants in key departments such as customs, procurement and revenue collection and law enforcement, and from local governments. It can also include members from outside Government (e.g. representatives of religious groups, relevant non-governmental organizations, business leaders, the media and the academic community). 21 No society is totally free of corruption. However, with the appropriate institutional and legislative measures, corruption can be kept within acceptable limits.The UNCAC invites countries to share their experiences and techniques with fellow professionals and policy makers in order to mutually benefit from international good as well as bad practices. As a broker of knowledge, UNDP has an important role to play in this process.The UNCAC,which came into force in 2005 upon the receipt of the 30th instrument of ratification, provides strong guidance on the issue of anti-corruption as an international standard, and countries that have ratified it are bound by its content. However, to date, Azerbaijan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Turkmenistan are the only Asian countries to have become parties to the convention. This comparative study has analysed institutional arrangements for combating corruption in a variety of countries. The study provides a number of lessons to be taken into account when designing reforms of the institutional arrangements, for which there are several provisions in the UNCAC. It was mentioned on several occasions that the creation of an ACA is not in itself a panacea for solving the problem of corruption.If the existing criminal justice system is perceived as being capable of fighting corruption, there may be little added value in creating an ACA. However, should an ACA be established, there are several considerations that must be taken into account (see also UNDP, 2004): \ufffd The ACA must be independent (politically as well as operationally) from outside influence in order to enable it to pursue corruption allegations at all levels (this can be achieved through constitutionally guaranteed independence or through the establishment of adequate accountability/ oversight mechanisms); \ufffd The ACA (as well as other agencies involved in the fight against corruption) needs to operate on the basis of solid and comprehensive legal frameworks28; \ufffd The ACA must have strong political backing at the highestlevels of government; \ufffd The ACA must have adequate financial29, human30 and technical resources and organizational capacity to effectively combat corruption; it must operate under exemplary leadership which must be of the highest integrity;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f878d0c-7e77-4ffe-8bcb-55878dd83048": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f878d0c-7e77-4ffe-8bcb-55878dd83048", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60faa673fad7c5be02d6cf234f5a5560caa1dcd5092ec69614e79db6ad40c0e6"}, "3": {"node_id": "5758f64b-5d7a-493a-ab3d-49950eb20b06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18a5af69d2e7c6d43aa1f91b144a97a97d55168580f276c20784823b61db4767"}}, "hash": "8ab92d7584d79fcb76a677082e69b404422371940d1ed2385da77a8efe058989", "text": "\ufffd The ACA must have adequate powers of investigation, i.e. to question witnesses, access documents, etc. as well as the possibility to prosecute as and where required; \ufffd The ACA must have a coherent and holistic strategy for combating corruption, focusing on prevention, investigation and awareness raising. (It is essential that attention is given to all three elements. In some of the countries, studied institutions that have focused on investigation and enforcement have been less successful than those who have adopted a more holistic approach); and CONCLUSION6 28 Without enforceable and effective laws, an agency is hamstrung. In Hong Kong, the authorities recognized the value of a legal framework within which the ICAC should operate. Similarly, CPIB in Singapore and the New South Wales ICAC also have the backing (after repeated amendments) of strong enabling legislation. 29 For example, the budget for Hong Kong ICAC was US$94 million in 2002/US$90 million in 2001;The ICAC in New South Wales operates with an annual budget of about US$8.7 million; Singapore\u2019s Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau\u2019s budget is not published but was reported to be around US$4.3 million in 1986. Botswana\u2019s Directorate on Corruption and Economic Crime has a US$2.4 million budget. 30 Hong Kong\u2019s ICAC has a manpower of 1,300 staff for a total population of 6.8 million.Thailand\u2019s NCCC has a manpower of approximately 500 for a total population of 65 million. It explains some of the difficulties the NCCC encounters in covering its mandate. 22 \ufffd The ACA must have the support of society at large in order to be successful (further emphasizing the importance of awareness raising). Across all the country briefs, it is evident that for any effort to combat corruption to be effective, there needs to be a systematic,comprehensive and long-term approach. This means that the institutions charged with combating corruption must be given adequate time, in addition to resources, to be successful. This also supports the position that in addition to providing a deterrent to corruption, the institutions charged with combating corruption must also work to raise awareness of corruption and, through prevention, work towards eliminating opportunities for corruption. Further, no institution will be successful in combating corruption without the existence of an enabling governance framework as well as a coherent and functioning national integrity system. As discussed above, this includes the judiciary, police, audit institution, ombudsman, police, etc. Of particular importance is the relationship between the institution(s) charged with combating corruption and the prosecution and judiciary. They are essential for corruption cases to be brought to court and tried. Thus, if attention is not paid to strengthening the capacity of the prosecutors and the courts, efforts to combat corruption are likely to be a failure. The role of the audit institution as well as the ombudsman must also be seriously considered as these institutions have an important complementary role to play in combating corruption, fulfilling functions that the institution primarily charged with corruption may not be able to do. Whether a country opts for establishing an apex institution (such as an ACA) to combat corruption or opts for using the existing institutional and criminal justice system, it is essential that there be effective channels and mechanisms for ensuring cooperation and coordination between the various institutions involved in combating corruption in order for them to be effective. However, regardless of the institutional arrangements that a country chooses to adopt, it must be emphasized that what looks good in theory may not be as good in reality. As stated above,the institutions must have full political backing as well as be equipped with adequate powers and resources. But they must also be supported by an appropriate legislative framework. Also, in several of the countries covered in this study, an important factor in the success of the efforts to fight corruption has been the example set by the leaders of that country.Where the political leadership is not perceived as being corrupt and corruption is not accepted amongst members of government, efforts to combat corruption appear to have been more successful.

The introduction of the needed legislation thus became necessary and, consequently, the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act was passed by both Houses of Parliament in 1988. A Commissioner was appointed in 1988 and the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) began operating in early 1989 with the commencement of the ICAC Act (ICAC, 1997). The decision to establish the ICAC resulted from serious and ongoing scandals in the public sector also extending into the political arena, which had given rise to widespread public concern (O\u2019Keefe, 2002:2-3).The ICAC adopted a three-pronged approach towards combating corruption similar to that adopted by the Independent Commission Against Corruption in Hong Kong S.A.R. after which the NSW ICAC is modelled.This entails a strategy that focuses on investigation, prevention as well as education.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "217bacf7-1c91-42f1-b39a-739cbb329faf": {"__data__": {"id_": "217bacf7-1c91-42f1-b39a-739cbb329faf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "191ac698a3729ed671b7d5f0c082cebc26744f459cf53565084a8e5862d8e258"}, "2": {"node_id": "257c56a1-d31a-4a7c-aeb9-14abb36a8749", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31c3ea411822cd1cdc8847d69dee8e082e2cbc043299725b2a7c00c826c6067d"}}, "hash": "35956724912724954d1c3c8488c61e9e4218e457ad1b0723c47a3820c2dbe803", "text": "The ICAC is seen internationally,together with the anti-corruption commissions in Singapore and Hong Kong S.A.R.,as a model for the establishment of anti-corruption bodies and the model is being adopted,e.g.in South Korea,or is being considered by other countries.The high economic and political cost of establishing such an independent commission has, however, resulted in slow implementation (Transparency International, 2001:14). Australia (New South Wales) Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 28 Although the ICAC is considered an example for others to follow the 1996 Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Force found widespread corruption within the NSW Police Force. The Royal Commission found that the ICAC was not sufficiently equipped to deal with corruption in the Police Force and recommended the establishment of an independent body dealing solely with misconduct in the Police Force. This led to the adoption of the Police Integrity Act in 1996, subsequently leading to the establishment of the Police Integrity Commission (PIC) in 1997 (Wood, 2004). There is no equivalent to the ICAC at the national level in Australia. Similar agencies do exist at the state level e.g., the Crime and Misconduct Commission in Queensland and the Anti-Corruption Commission in Western Australia.This is considered by some to be a clear omission in the arrangements for combating corruption at the national level (Doig and McIvor, 2004:16). Australia ranked 9th out of 159 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index 2005. Although this indicates that Australians perceive that there is little corruption in their country, the picture is different at the state level. The 2003 survey conducted by the ICAC, Community attitudes to corruption and the ICAC, found that 82 percent of those surveyed perceived corruption to be a problem in NSW and 42 percent believed that they or their families were affected by corruption in some way. Corruption was perceived to affect the whole community through poorer services and/or people having to pay more for services.Examples of corruption given by respondents mainly involved local government,police,other government departments or employment opportunities. Mandate and institutional links of the key anti-corruption institution The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is a standing commission of inquiry focusing specifically on investigating and preventing corrupt conduct in the public sector.

In addition to the ICAC Act, the Governor may also make regulations consistent with the Act, with respect to, for example, appointments,conditions of employment,discipline,code of conduct and termination of employment of staff of the ICAC,etc. (ICAC Act, Section 117). The ICAC operates independently of the NSW Parliament, Government and judiciary, and the ICAC Act confers significant powers and discretions to the ICAC to undertake its principal functions. Consequently,\u201cthere is a comprehensive [internal as well as external] governance framework in place to ensure that the ICAC is accountable and transparent\u201d (ICAC, 2004:51). The framework will be discussed below as well as under the heading Operational Arrangements. In accordance with Section 76 of the ICAC Act, the Commission shall deliver to the Presiding Officer of each House of Parliament an annual report on its operations.The Commission is accountable to the NSW Treasury in relation to funding and expenditure. The ICAC is headed by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor (ICAC Act, Section 5) after the person to be appointed has been referred to the PJC (ICAC Act,Subsection 5A[1]),together with an Assistant Commissioner appointed by the Governor on the concurrence of the Commissioner (ICAC Act, Section 6). The Commissioner's term is for five years and is non-renewable (ICAC Act,Schedule 1,Section 4) and s/he can only be removed on the address of the Houses of Parliament (ICAC Act,Schedule 1, Section 6[3]).In accordance with Subsection 104(1) of the ICAC Act, the Commission may employ staff as necessary in order to exercise its functions. All members of the ICAC are under the control and direction of the Commissioner (ICAC Act, Subsection 104[7]). In accordance with Subsections 107(1-2) of the ICAC Act, the Commissioner as well as the ICAC may delegate any of their respective functions to an Assistant Commissioner or an officer of the Commission, except as provided by Subsections 107(4-5). The organizational structure of the ICAC consists of one executive unit and five divisions, namely: \ufffd The Assessments Section,which receives all reports and complaints,registers each matter and makes additional enquiries as necessary.

In the case of a Minister or Member of Parliament, it must be a substantial breach of the applicable code of conduct or involve a breach of the law (ICAC Act, Section 9). It should also be noted that the ICAC may only investigate suspected acts of corruption in the private sector when it relates to or impacts on the public service. \ufffd In the field of prevention (Subsection 1[d-g]), the principal functions of the Commission are: \ufffd To examine the laws governing, and the practices and procedures of, public authorities and public officials, in order to facilitate the discovery of corrupt conduct and to secure the revision of methods of work or procedures, which in the opinion of the Commission, may be conducive to corrupt conduct; \ufffd To instruct, advise and assist any public authority, public official or other person (on the request of the authority, official or person) on ways in which corrupt conduct may be eliminated; \ufffd To advise public authorities or public officials of changes in practices or procedures compatible with the effective exercise of their functions which the Commission thinks necessary to reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of corrupt conduct; and \ufffd To cooperate with public authorities and public officials in reviewing laws, practices and procedures with a view to reducing the likelihood of the occurrence of corrupt conduct. \ufffd In the field of education (Subsection 1[h-k]), the principal functions of the Commission are: \ufffd To educate and advise public authorities,public officials and the community on strategies to combat corrupt conduct; \ufffd To educate and disseminate information to the public on the detrimental effects of corrupt conduct and on the importance of maintaining the integrity of public administration; \ufffd To enlist and foster public support in combating corrupt conduct; and \ufffd To develop, arrange, supervise, participate in or conduct such educational or advisory programmes as may be described in a reference made to the Commission by both Houses of Parliament. Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 30 In addition to this, the ICAC is, in accordance with Subsection 13(2), to conduct investigations in order to determine: \ufffd Whether any corrupt conduct has occurred, is occurring or is about to occur; \ufffd Whether any laws governing any public authority or public official need to be changed for the purpose of reducing the likelihood of the occurrence of corrupt conduct; and \ufffd Whether any methods of work, practices or procedures of any public authority or public official did or could allow, encourage or cause the occurrence of corrupt conduct. In addition to this,the principal functions of the ICAC also include the power to make findings and form opinions on the basis of the results of its investigations, in respect to any conduct, circumstances or events with which its investigations are concerned.This may be done whether or not the findings or opinions relate to corrupt conduct, and the power to formulate recommendations for the taking of action that the ICAC considers should be taken in relation to its investigations (ICAC Act, Subsection 13[3]). As noted above,the ICAC may conduct investigations on its own initiative as well as on a complaint or report made to it as well as on a reference made to the Commission. In accordance with Subsection 10 of the ICAC Act \u201cany person may make a complaint to the Commission about a matter that concerns or may concern corrupt conduct\u201d. It is at the discretion of the Commission whether or not to investigate a complaint or to discontinue an investigation (ICAC Act, Subsections 10[2-3]). The ICAC must, however, consult the ORC before deciding on whether to discontinue or not commence an investigation of a complaint or report (ICAC Act,Subsection 20[4]).Principal Officers of public authorities are required by the ICAC Act to report to the Commission any suspected act of corruption that is brought to their attention (Subsection 2).The ICAC may instruct the appropriate authority to take measures to protect witnesses and persons assisting the ICAC (ICAC Act, Section 50). The importance of investigation is considerable as there is no presumption of guilt based on a complaint or a report received. It is the role of the ICAC to prove that corrupt conduct has occurred (ICAC, 2004:30).Thus, the Commission has been provided with extensive powers of investigation under the ICAC Act, exceeding those given to the police.These include: the power to require a public authority or official to provide information or produce documents (ICAC Act,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04b175fc-0f6c-4d09-8270-621a0e80f9bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "04b175fc-0f6c-4d09-8270-621a0e80f9bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b461c19bea9bdc0ddde1515621ed47a37b30bbc2605566d6906119c13a39a72a"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c09cf28-b316-4821-8b40-12f5828be9ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a0addb0b5ebd0eb58731b0b987f5411d591af4c75b56f5e1076f2a3bdcb3688"}}, "hash": "eb48aece2bb0bb803acf4595fa7fa8903ecfd37187e5a07fcb6b6700d31bd0bd", "text": "Sections 21 and 22); the power to enter public premises with the written authorization of the Commissioner (ICAC Act, Section 23); as well as with search warrants to enter premises,conduct searches and inspect,copy and seize documents or other evidence (ICAC Act,Sections 41 and 47). Search warrants may be issued by a judge or the Commissioner (although the Commissioner rarely uses this power) (ICAC Act, Subsections 40[1-2]). ICAC investigators may also obtain warrants to use listening devices and intercept telephone calls. In accordance with the Listening Devices Act 1984, listening device applications have to be approved and granted by a Justice of the Supreme Court. In accordance with the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, telephone intercept applications have to be approved or granted by a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In order to ensure compliance with statutory requirements, the Ombudsman inspects ICAC records of telephone intercepts and controlled operations.The ICAC also reports on its use of listening devices to the Attorney-General\u2019s Department. The ICAC also has an internal approval policy before any application is made for a warrant of any type.In accordance with this policy, ICAC investigators must submit the application to the Legal Division for review. The application must then be submitted to the Executive Director of the Strategic Operations Division before being submitted to the appropriate authority. For the purpose of an investigation, the Commission may also hold hearings to be conducted by the Commissioner or an Assistant Commissioner as determined by the Commissioner (ICAC Act, Subsection 30[1-2]). The hearings may be held in public, in private or a combination of both (ICAC Act, Subsection 31[1]). Public hearings are seen as an important tool in exposing corruption and can also serve to increase the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of investigations. In connection to the holding of hearings, the Commission is empowered to summon witnesses (ICAC Act, Subsection 35[1]). Should a witness summoned to appear before a hearing fail to show,the Commission may issue a warrant for the arrest of the witness (ICAC Act, Subsection 36[1]). The Commission has adopted the ICAC Code of Conduct, which sets out the principles that ICAC staff are expected to uphold as well as prescribing specific conduct in areas considered central to the exercise of the ICAC\u2019s functions.Complaints about the conduct of ICAC staff are treated seriously and are investigated by a member of ICAC senior management.The investigation and any proposed action will usually be reviewed by the Commissioner. In particularly serious cases, an investigator from outside the ICAC may be engaged to conduct the investigation, which will be reported to the ORC. 31 Country Briefs: Australia (New South Wales) In order to foster transparency, the administrative, research and educational matters of the ICAC are covered by the Freedom of Information Act. Operational arrangements As mentioned above, an elaborate framework has been established in order to ensure the accountability of the ICAC to the public of NSW as well as its transparency.This is of particular importance considering the extensive powers conferred on the Commission by the ICAC Act. In addition to the ones already covered above, the two most important oversight bodies are the Operational Review Committee (ORC) and the Parliamentary Joint Commission (PJC) on the ICAC. The ORC is constituted under Section 58 of the ICAC Act in order to provide a mechanism which ensures that the ICAC properly deals with complaints received by the public.The functions of the ORC are: to advise the Commissioner on whether the ICAC should investigate a complaint made under the ICAC Act; to discontinue an investigation of such a complaint; and to advise the Commissioner on such other matters as the Commissioner may from time to time refer to the ORC (ICAC Act, Subsection 59[1]). In accordance with Subsection 60(1) of the ICAC Act, the ORC shall consist of eight members: the Commissioner, as the Chairperson; an Assistant Commissioner, nominated by the Commissioner; the Commissioner of Police; a person appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the Attorney General and with the concurrence of the Commissioner; and four persons appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the Minister and with the concurrence of the Commissioner to represent community views.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c09cf28-b316-4821-8b40-12f5828be9ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c09cf28-b316-4821-8b40-12f5828be9ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b461c19bea9bdc0ddde1515621ed47a37b30bbc2605566d6906119c13a39a72a"}, "2": {"node_id": "04b175fc-0f6c-4d09-8270-621a0e80f9bd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb48aece2bb0bb803acf4595fa7fa8903ecfd37187e5a07fcb6b6700d31bd0bd"}}, "hash": "6a0addb0b5ebd0eb58731b0b987f5411d591af4c75b56f5e1076f2a3bdcb3688", "text": "Section 63 of the ICAC Act provides for the establishment of the PJC.The functions of the PJC,as provided by Subsection 64(1) of the ICAC Act, are: \ufffd To monitor and to review the exercise by the Commission of its functions; \ufffd To report to both Houses of Parliament,with such comments as it thinks fit,on any matter relating to the ICAC or connected with the exercise of its functions to which, in the opinion", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "995e28d6-71ef-409a-9185-dca774002b96": {"__data__": {"id_": "995e28d6-71ef-409a-9185-dca774002b96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3bb4280c705913d2f470676ec84bc7da9cd642d70e1831034cd86eb87e85cd4"}, "3": {"node_id": "8597b476-efe7-4232-9b6a-20e60178169e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "596d12ad3e1961f89db9f68fd99720ab0e6c168028e811745de33b7b4c5446c1"}}, "hash": "42fc8a87c0d19e7ff8614dc12b6f3cec113ae29cf482433dace63e2850a2531a", "text": "of the PJC, the attention of Parliament should be directed; \ufffd To examine each annual and other report (often conducted as public hearings before the PJC) of the Commission and report to both Houses of Parliament on any matter appearing in, or arising out of, any such report; \ufffd To examine trends and changes in corrupt conduct, and practices and methods relating to corrupt conduct, and report to both Houses of Parliament any change which the PJC thinks is desirable to the functions,structures and procedures of the Commission; and \ufffd To inquire into any question referred to it by both Houses of Parliament in connection with its functions and report to both Houses on that question. As mentioned above, the PJC also has the power to veto a proposal for appointment of the Commissioner of the ICAC (ICAC Act, Section 64A). The PJC may not, however, investigate a matter relating to particular conduct, or reconsider a decision to investigate, not to investigate or to discontinue investigation of a particular complaint, or reconsider the findings, recommendations, determinations or other decisions of the ICAC in relation to a particular investigation or complaint (ICAC Act,Subsection 64[2]).In accordance with Subsection 65(1) of the ICAC Act,the PJC shall consist of 11 members,three of which shall be members of,and appointed by,the Legislative Council,and eight of which shall be members of,and appointed by,the Legislative Assembly.The Chairperson and the Vice-Chairperson of the PJC are elected by and from the members of the PJC (ICAC Act, Subsection 67[1]). The Supreme Court has both the inherent and statutory jurisdiction to supervise the functioning of administrative tribunals such as the ICAC to ensure that it acts in accordance with the law. The ICAC is,in accordance with Subsection 16[1] of the ICAC Act,required to,as far as practicable,work in cooperation with law enforcement agencies as well as other agencies such as the Auditor-General and the Ombudsman when conducting investigations. This includes the secondment of members of the Police Force to the ICAC, in accordance with provisions of Subsection 104(5) of the ICAC Act.The ICAC may also, before or after investigating a matter, refer the matter for investigation or other action \u201cto any person or body considered by the Commission to be appropriate in the circumstances\u201d (ICAC Act, Subsection 53[1]). Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 32 It is the role of the ICAC to assemble evidence that may be admissible in the prosecution of a person for a criminal offence against a law of NSW and furnish any such evidence to the Director of Public Prosecution. Where there is sufficient evidence, the ICAC will recommend to the Director of Public Prosecution that consideration be given to criminal prosecution or to the supervising authority (principal officer), that disciplinary action be taken against a specified person. The Director of Public Prosecutions or the principal officer of the relevant department or authority is then responsible for considering whether prosecution or disciplinary action is appropriate. The Director of Public Prosecution \u2013 appointed by the Governor (DPP Act, Subsection 4[1]) upon the approval of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Office of the Ombudsman and the Police Integrity Commission (DPP Act, Subsection 4A[1]) \u2013 is head of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution (ODPP). The independence of the Director is provided by the DPP Act in that,although the Director is responsible to the Attorney General for the due exercise of the Director\u2019s functions under the Act, the Director is independent in respect to the preparation, institution and conduct of any proceedings (Subsection 4[3]).In accordance with Subsection 7(1) of the DPP Act,the Director is responsible for instituting and conducting prosecutions for indictable offences under NSW laws in the Supreme Court and the District Court; i.e., it is the Director who decides whether or not to institute a prosecution.

The Audit Office provides advice to Parliament, Government and public sector agencies about public sector performance. The Audit Office also conducts audits under the PFA Act and other NSW Acts and may conduct an audit of all or any of the particular activities of a public authority concerning the efficiency, economy and compliance with relevant laws. As such, the Audit Office also reviews the ICAC\u2019s financial statements contained in the Commissions annual report.The ICAC also engages the Audit Office to provide the Commission with an internal audit function. The Office of the Ombudsman was established upon the appointment of the first Ombudsman in 1975, in accordance with Subsection 6(1) of the Ombudsman Act, which provides that the Governor may appoint an Ombudsman on the recommendation of the Minister upon the approval of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Office of the Ombudsman and the Police Integrity Commission (Ombudsman Act, Section 31BA). The Committee also monitors and reviews the Ombudsman in the exercise of his/her functions (Ombudsman Act, Section 31B). In accordance with Section 33 of the 33 Country Briefs: Australia (New South Wales) Ombudsman Act, the Ombudsman shall deliver to the Presiding Officer of each House of Parliament an annual report on his/her operations.The primary role of the Ombudsman is to act as an independent review body.As such, the functions of the Ombudsman include performing: \ufffd Administrative reviews, including dealing with complaints about the administrative conduct of public sector agencies and officials, and equivalent bodies and persons. \ufffd Compliance reviews, including: \ufffd Reviewing compliance with the law and good practice, e.g. compliance with procedural fairness and good practice in investigations, use of police powers, controlled operations, auditing of telecommunication interception records; \ufffd Reviewing the handling of and response to allegations and complaints; and \ufffd Reviewing standards of service provision. \ufffd Legislative review, i.e. reviewing implementation of certain legislation that expands the powers of police and correctional staff. The Ombudsman may initiate investigations into cases whether or not a complaint has been made (Ombudsman Act, Subsection 13[1]). It should, however, be noted that the Ombudsman does not have any power to enforce compliance with recommendations s/he may make. Lessons learned One of the main features of the ICAC is the existence of an elaborate framework, both internally and externally, to ensure the accountability and transparency of the Commission. These measures are essential to ensure that the public perceive the Commission as being just that \u2013 accountable and transparent.This is particularly significant because,as is concluded in an early report by the ICAC,much of the success of the Commission was a result of the help and information provided by the members of the public, and that the ICAC cannot fulfil its functions without the help and support of the public (ICAC, 1991:17-18).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0d2caa5-fe1f-4d52-b8ce-6e745b4dc230": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0d2caa5-fe1f-4d52-b8ce-6e745b4dc230", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9084255b0ad4a524c743d65f79825cbd0ccc8ccfb318bfbabbe00f9fc2bcc3ed"}, "2": {"node_id": "aac9f3fa-a75a-4510-a3a7-eb42063d7fe7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4af83319929d4e48c6ab50b007e41f88e8ed79810286d039c5ddf8a8b72dd2d3"}}, "hash": "3d4df6a3704987df59026db48740ef29f897f8ce300124edeb70b1f3d70a0931", "text": "The three-pronged approach to combating corruption is also considered fundamental to the success of the ICAC in addressing the issue of corruption in the public sector.One lesson learned by the Commission is that focusing on systems and organizational culture is more effective than focusing on the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bd19630-a25b-4e19-8897-803df516fc2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "3bd19630-a25b-4e19-8897-803df516fc2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f969f69f148dae291ad0d605f35da7d2be998a35a499adeb8cdc247d178b2571"}, "3": {"node_id": "bb20c0cf-685e-4442-a3d5-9b80b84b4e72", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "351dd1240b416a0c0e83a21d48b7f2faeb6c7da91bd1abb193e2db76bd44f03d"}}, "hash": "d0f7502ca0de09572d4062870fa4aadddb70bcc84454fbabce483c0e5849a0b3", "text": "individual. Investigating individual allegations is not sufficient. Prevention has proven to be an integral part of combating corruption, further emphasizing the importance of focusing on systematic and organizational changes (Gorta, 1999). Part of the success of the ICAC also lies in its collaboration with other agencies. No agency, regardless of resources, will on its own be able to effectively address the issue of corruption.There must be a shared responsibility for ensuring a corruption-free public sector.Furthermore,organizational culture cannot be controlled from the outside,and it has thus proven necessary that public sector managers themselves take responsibility for integrity within their respective workplaces. Related to this is the importance of monitoring outcomes.It has been found that it is important to measure management responses to prevention measures and that if monitored, measures and recommendations are more likely to be implemented (Gorta, 1999). The ICAC realized at an early stage that it is necessary to have the appropriate data in order to carry out proper risk analysis and assessments. In the opinion of a former Commissioner of the ICAC, the most appropriate and effective and efficient placement of research capacity is within the anti-corruption agency itself.The ICAC has also come to significantly expand its research capacity. The research unit has provided the ICAC with valuable data which has been seen as assisting significantly in the allocation of resources in the area of proactive investigations as well as guiding the allocation of resources in regard to corruption prevention (O\u2019Keefe, 2002:9). The ICAC also conducts surveys of the view of public sector employees as it is considered that employee or workplace attitudes to corruption are more salient in governing behaviour than formally imposed definitions; employees are in the best position to observe and respond to potentially corrupt conduct that may occur in their workplace.Thus,it is essential to foster a common understanding of what constitutes corrupt behaviour (Gorta, 1999). The ICAC\u2019s power to hold public hearings has been seen by some as an effective way to expose questionable patterns of behaviour,and the idea behind the hearings is that they will \u2018shame\u2019those involved in the hearing to change their ways.It also provides an opportunity to highlight and expose areas which require changes in procedures, policy or legislation. It is also an effective tool for enlightening the public to what exactly is taking place. During the hearings, the ICAC may summon witnesses to give evidence. The evidence given,however,is not admissible in court.This is an aspect of the hearings which has come to be highly criticized as the individual, if ever brought to court on charges of corruption, can plead that s/he does not have access to a fair trial. It has been argued that this mechanism may be more suited to countries experiencing widespread corruption as it could be a tool to identify areas that require reform, although it allows the individual to go free (Hakes Drielsma, 55). Although there is an improving confidence among the public that people who report corruption will not suffer negative consequences,60 percent of respondents in the ICAC survey believed that people who report corruption are likely to suffer as a consequence. In relation to this, it has been highlighted by Transparency International that the legislative framework will need to be strengthened in order to improve public confidence (2004:156). Although the ICAC is widely seen as successful in combating corruption in the public sector, in 1996, the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Force found that the ICAC had not been successful in combating corruption and misconduct in the NSW Police Force.This was explained in part by the wide mandate of the ICAC, covering all public agencies and officials in combination with limited staff and resources. A further complicating factor was the dependence of the ICAC on investigators seconded from the NSW Police Force, who would later return to the Police Force, as well as the lack of a specific division within the ICAC with the competence to address the issue of police corruption.The Royal Commission also found that the ICAC had emphasized corruption prevention and education at the expense of its investigative role.These findings led the Royal Commission to recommend the establishment of the independent Police Integrity Commission, a recommendation which was implemented in 1997 (Wood, 2004). However, according to Transparency International\u2019s Global Corruption Report 2003, corruption within the NSW Police Force remains a problem (2004:117).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb20c0cf-685e-4442-a3d5-9b80b84b4e72": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb20c0cf-685e-4442-a3d5-9b80b84b4e72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption -

The early 1990s, however, saw the revelation of several cases of high-level corruption uncovered by three consecutive Presidential Commissions (Frimpong, 2001:11).These revelations prompted the Government in 1994 to establish the Directorate on Corruption and Economic Crime (DCEC) within the Office of the President, by virtue of Section 3(1) of Act No. 13.The decision to create the DCEC followed on a Government review of different approaches taken towards combating corruption across the world. Hong Kong\u2019s Independent Commission Against Corruption and its \u2018three-pronged attack\u20191 on corruption was seen as being of particular interest, and the DCEC came to adopt a similar approach also focusing on investigation, prevention and public education. Since its inception,the DCEC has received increasing numbers of reports on suspected or alleged corruption.In 2001,the DCEC received 1,841 reports of corruption, a 24.8 percent increase from the previous year, and the number of investigations resulting from these reports increased by six percent over the previous year (DCEC, 2002:18). In order to deal with its high caseload, the DCEC has introduced a Case Management System, which in 2001 resulted in the caseload per officer decreasing from 13 to an average of seven (DCEC, 2002:13). At the end of 2001, the DCEC had completed 42 cases2 and 52 cases were uncompleted, showing a continuing increase in cases completed each year (DCEC, 2002:16). Sixty-three cases were also referred to the Attorney General\u2019s Chamber. An additional encouraging development is that the national assembly in 2001 adopted legislation requiring comprehensive asset disclosure by members of Parliament,although this register remains confidential (Transparency International,2003:253). Botswana experiences relatively low levels of corruption, placing 32nd out of 159 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index 2005.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "092d88e0-33a4-4561-ab35-b4693d2d69d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "092d88e0-33a4-4561-ab35-b4693d2d69d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b18444b5b5ea266f8043b4e5ea252fdd217f97853d1be3c1e40373858383b4d1"}, "2": {"node_id": "931a2958-2161-4fa3-96c1-d082f71c4f99", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3f1d3d2b2b1c931d65eaa038eb7fc8cd6447cb37356d0618d7710139c874ec3"}}, "hash": "36b1dd42d12ba38f5dbc1cf49aca26f338b8d86b6419caf5072c52540c2e866d", "text": "Although not devoid of corruption, Botswana nevertheless stands out in Southern Africa in that major corruption scandals are rare and the government is generally perceived as accountable and transparent (Transparency International, 2001:57).

Some allegations have, however, been made that the DCEC is 35 Botswana 1 For further information on the ICAC and the institutional arrangements put in place to combat corruption in Hong Kong,please refer to the Hong Kong S.A.R. coutry brief. 2 Out of the 42 cases completed, 24 resulted in convictions and six were withdrawn. simply not going after the \u2018big fish\u2019. The cases investigated by the DCEC now typically involve low-level corruption, with the suspects being low-level government officials (Frimpong, 2001:14-15). However, although a number of convictions have been handed down in corruption cases by the Courts, the DCEC has expressed concern that the sentences for these crimes have been to lenient (DCEC, 2002:17). Mandate and institutional links of the key anti-corruption institution The Directorate on Corruption and Economic Crime (DCEC) was established in September 1994 by virtue of Section 3(1) of Act No. 13, enacted the previous month. In addition, Act No. 13 also provides for the functions of the DCEC, the powers and duties of its Director and the procedures to be followed in dealing with corruption cases. Organizationally, the DCEC is placed as an autonomous Directorate under the Office of the President and reports directly to the President. The DCEC is headed by a Director, together with a Deputy Director. The Director is responsible for the direction and administration of the DCEC (Section 4[2],Act No.13).The President appoints the Director \u201con such terms as he sees fit\u201d(Section 4[1],", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75e5297d-b49d-480f-b4e5-3c7bec8f2f8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "75e5297d-b49d-480f-b4e5-3c7bec8f2f8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fba6474bfe5afd54c95b51cf047424877e62719425600c2aaafb229b595cce0"}}, "hash": "3fba6474bfe5afd54c95b51cf047424877e62719425600c2aaafb229b595cce0", "text": "Act No. 13). By virtue of Section 3(2) of Act No. 13, the DCEC is designated as a public office and thus the Director and the staff of the DCEC are regulated under the Public Service Act. As such, the Director does not have security of tenure and is formally and directly responsible to the President. The DCEC is made up of seven branches: Prosecution; Investigation; Intelligence Analysis; Corruption Prevention; Public Education; Administration and Human Resources; and Personnel Management Systems and Training. Section 6 provides that the DCEC has a wide range of functions, namely: \ufffd To receive and investigate any complaints alleging corruption in any public body; \ufffd To investigate any alleged or suspected offences under Act No. 13, or any other offence disclosed during such an investigation; \ufffd To investigate any alleged or suspected contravention of any of the provisions of the fiscal and revenue laws; \ufffd To investigate the conduct of any person that, in the opinion of the DCEC Director, may be connected with or conducive to corruption; \ufffd To assist any law enforcement agency of the Government in the investigation of offences involving dishonesty or cheating of the public revenue; \ufffd To examine the practices and procedures of public bodies in order to facilitate the discovery of corrupt practices and to secure the revision of methods of work or procedures which may be conducive to corrupt practices; \ufffd To advise heads of public bodies of changes in practices or procedures in order to reduce the likelihood of corruption; \ufffd To educate the public about the evils of corruption; and \ufffd To enlist and foster public support in combating corruption. In fulfilling these functions,Section 7(1) of Act No.13 mandates that the Director authorize any officer of the DCEC to carry out inquiries and investigations into any alleged or suspected offences as outlined in Part IV of Act No. 13. Officers are also mandated to request that any information relevant to a case of suspected corruption be presented to him/her from individuals as well as from banks or other financial institutions (Sections 7 and 8,Act No.13).The Director may also request that a Magistrate revoke the travel documentation of any person suspected of a corrupt act (Section 16, Act No. 13). An officer authorized by the Director of the DCEC may also arrest a person if that person has committed or is about to commit an offence under Act No. 13 (Section 10, Act No. 13). It should noted that the DCEC, by virtue of Section 34 of Act No. 13, may investigate any person maintaining a standard of living not corresponding to his income or who has wealth or property that is disproportionate to his/her present or known sources of income or assets. A person is considered to be guilty of corruption if s/he is not able to give a satisfactory explanation as to how his/her wealth or assets were acquired. Section 39 of Act No. 13 provides that if, after an investigation, the DCEC has reason to conclude that an individual has committed an offence as outlined in Part IV of Act No.13,the Director of the DCEC is to refer the matter to the Attorney General for his decision.No prosecution of an offence may be instituted except by or with the written consent of the Attorney General (see the section below on the relationship between that DCEC and the Attorney General\u2019s Chamber). Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 36 In fulfilling its mandate, the DCEC has worked effectively to raise public awareness of its existence and function as well as to educate the public on the ills of corruption. Activities in this regard have also included visiting villages in rural areas to alert local people of their rights and to ensure that teachers and other public servants do not take bribes for providing services that the Government funded and intended people to receive freely.The DCEC also publishes regular press releases to inform the public of trails that have been raised to public awareness and the outcome of these. Operational arrangements As noted above, it is the Attorney General who decides on whether or not to initiate the prosecution of a suspected case of corruption.The Attorney General is head of the Attorney General\u2019s Chamber, which forms an extra-ministerial department. The Attorney General is mandated under the Constitution and the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act to direct all criminal prosecution, including the prosecution of cases related to corruption. All cases are prosecuted in the general court system.The Police and DCEC, however, are also empowered to prosecute for and on behalf of the Attorney General.Thus", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9398431-6cb6-4de0-92c9-4314e5af0fc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9398431-6cb6-4de0-92c9-4314e5af0fc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da3ac759f09039c70e35f09f2f4c99adb98a00367050d5ba9033c60b8fdb9f16"}, "3": {"node_id": "1265d77a-2562-4b48-95d0-4131389cb484", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3eb72065c2bf1e6e9725a0751a79fd48f994d77332fde7e7f4f01be2e321659"}}, "hash": "85246a39c3df3b7d5d931ebf54a0182ac488c16a3d05119a960e992d6f8a647f", "text": "the Attorney General may direct the DCEC to undertake the prosecution after deciding upon a prosecution. Yet, although the Prosecution Branch of the DCEC was initially intended to serve as a liaison between the DCEC investigators and the Attorney General, it has increasingly been necessary for the DCEC to itself undertake prosecutions due to the heavy workload of the Attorney General\u2019s Chamber. This has also required that the DCEC acquire personnel that are qualified to undertake this additional function. The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) was established by virtue of Section 124 of the Constitution, which provides that there shall be an Auditor General. In the exercise of his/her functions, the Auditor General is not subject to the directions or control of any other person or authority.Although the Auditor General is appointed by the President,his/her independence is safeguarded in that his/her removal from the office is not within the prerogative of the executive. The Office is only to be vacated when the Auditor General reaches the age of 60 years. The Auditor General audits the public accounts of Botswana and all officers, courts and authorities of the Government as well as the accounts of parastatal organizations and local government.The Auditor General submits reports to the Minister responsible for finance, who causes them to be laid before the National Assembly. The OAG undertakes, on behalf of the Auditor General, the duties of the Auditor General and is therefore the Supreme Audit Institution of Botswana.The prime objective of the Auditor General, and therefore the OAG, is to enhance the socio-economic development of the country through the promotion of sound financial management and proper accountability for public funds and assets. The Office of the Ombudsman was established by the Ombudsman Act of 1995 and the first Ombudsman was appointed in 1997. The Ombudsman is appointed by the President. The Office of the Ombudsman is an extra-ministerial body under the Office of the President. In discharging his/her functions the Ombudsman is not to be under the control or direction of any other person or authority. In addition, the Ombudsman\u2018s proceedings shall not be questioned in any Court of Law.The main mandate of the Ombudsman is to investigate complaints of injustice or maladministration in the public service received from the public.If such complaints are found to be valid,the Ombudsman makes recommendations to the appropriate authority on the matter. Should these recommendations not be followed, the Ombudsman is obliged to make a special report to the National Assembly. Lessons learned The DCEC distinguishes itself from other similar bodies in Africa primarily in that it has not merely replicated the three-pronged approach of investigation, prevention and education of Hong Kong S.A.R. but has also achieved successful outcomes in complementing the other institutions within the country that have been established with the purpose of improving governance and fostering accountability and transparency.Several reasons have been given for this,including that the statutes of the DCEC specify that it is an independent agency that also provides community outreach programmes to public and private sectors on the cost of corruption; that the other core bodies making up the National Integrity System work relatively well; and that political and incentive structure in Botswana contributes to the important role the agency plays in complementing the core institutions. Additionally,the DCEC has a predictable operating budget (US$2.4 million allocated in 2001-2002 vis-\u00e0-vis US$2.2 million the previous year). 37 Country Briefs: Botswana A number of factors, however, have contributed towards hindering the effectiveness of the DCEC. Although the judiciary is considered to be fully independent and free to discharge its responsibilities without fear or favour and have fulfilled their responsibility of convicting and sentencing those guilty of corruption, there are several instances when trials have been delayed, which has come to affect the conviction rates of the cases brought before them by the DCEC (Frimpong, 2001:17). Cases have also been delayed within the Attorney General\u2019s Chamber,further compounding the problem.As noted above,this has prompted the DCEC to develop its own resources and capacity in order to prosecute corruption cases (Frimpong,2001:18). In both cases,these shortcomings can be attributed to a lack of staff as well as resources.However,this has serious implications in that it negatively impacts the public\u2019s perception of the efforts made in combating corruption. Also, the DCEC would need to increase its staff in order to meet its increasing workload (Frimpong, 2001:23).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1265d77a-2562-4b48-95d0-4131389cb484": {"__data__": {"id_": "1265d77a-2562-4b48-95d0-4131389cb484", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da3ac759f09039c70e35f09f2f4c99adb98a00367050d5ba9033c60b8fdb9f16"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9398431-6cb6-4de0-92c9-4314e5af0fc0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85246a39c3df3b7d5d931ebf54a0182ac488c16a3d05119a960e992d6f8a647f"}}, "hash": "e3eb72065c2bf1e6e9725a0751a79fd48f994d77332fde7e7f4f01be2e321659", "text": "As mentioned above, allegations have also been made that the DCEC is going after the cases of low-level corruption while ignoring the \u2018big fish\u2019(Frimpong, 2001:14).

This could be addressed by requiring the DCEC to report to the National Assembly rather than as now to the President. A further issue that has been raised is that the Director of the DCEC does not have security of tenure (Frimpong, 2001:6). Also, regarding the Office of the Ombudsman \u2013 also part of the public service like the DCEC \u2013 it has been claimed that it does not have sufficient independence to fulfil its mandate effectively and calls have been made for the legislation to be amended (Frimpong, 2001: 5). As opposed to the DCEC and the Office of the Ombudsman,the Auditor General is independent and enjoys security of tenure. It is perceived that the Auditor General has been very active and effective in reporting on and exposing cases of corruption and misuse of public funds. It has, however, been claimed that the National Assembly has failed to act on the recommendations contained within these reports (Frimpong, 2001:12-13). A discussion which has been held within the DCEC is whether or not to adopt a system of \u2018operational targeting\u2019 that would lead to the DCEC focusing its investigations on specific target groups. It was decided, however, that it was necessary for DCEC to continue to investigate any accurate report that it receives.Nonetheless,DCEC does give priority to investigating corruption that has affected the poor.

Some reforms, however, have remained ineffective and there has been a lack of coordination of anti-corruption efforts (OSI, 2002:82). An important reason for the increased focus on corruption and anti-corruption measures has also been the EU accession process. In the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, the Government explicitly states that its adoption is a significant prerequisite for guaranteeing membership in the EU (2001:1). The approval of the National Strategy by the Government in 2001 in itself represented a first attempt to place anti-corruption efforts within a systematic framework (OSI, 2002:91). The strategy places greater emphasis on preventive measures for combating corruption. A further step was the creation of an inter-ministerial commission to coordinate and consolidate the institutional setup for the fight against corruption and coordinate and control the implementation of the National Strategy.A permanent parliamentary commission on corruption was also established in 2002. A number of other reforms,discussed below in the section on Lessons 39 Bulgaria learned, have also been instituted that should improve the effectiveness of the fight against corruption and address existing weaknesses in the national integrity system. The eventual appointment of the Ombudsman should also be a further improvement in the fight against corruption.

It has further been stated that Bulgaria has \u201cmade more progress in developing a legal framework for combating corruption,than is the case with the implementation of the laws\u201d(GRECO, 2002:21). Bulgaria places 55th out of 159 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index 2005. A corruption assessment carried out by Coalition 20001 in 2003 found that there had been no significant changes in the levels of corruption in the country over the previous year and that corruption is still seen as one of the gravest problems of society.It was further concluded that \u201cthis lack of development signals that the anti-corruption measures undertaken so far have been exhausted\u201d(Coalition 2000, 2004:5). Mandate and institutional links of the key anti-corruption institutions There is no specialized agency which deals with corruption per se. Instead,a number of dedicated units,divisions,departments and agencies have been established within various ministries, the judiciary and the police in order to combat corruption. The various police functions are carried out under the direct responsibility of the Ministry of Interior. The ministry is headed by a Minister together with Deputy Ministers and the Secretary General \u2013 the most senior civil servant within the Ministry. The Secretary General is appointed and dismissed by the President on the proposal of the government. Although all services which sort under the Ministry of Interior take part to some extent in the fight against corruption, those that play the most central role are the National Service of Police (NSP),National Service of Security (NSS) and the National Service on Combating Organised Crime (NSCOC). There are specialist units within all regional and provincial police departments for dealing with economic crime, including corruption. At the Ministry of Interior level, the NSP has five units within the Economic Police Department that deal with various corruption-specific offences (GRECO,2004:5).The NSS is tasked with countering and preventing criminal offences against national security, including that of corruption, where foreign services or organizations are involved (GRECO, 2002:10).Within the NSCOC there is a Department on Combating Corruption for which the fight against corruption has been placed amongst its priority tasks. The activities of the Department include detection of corruption within the public and private sector as well as within the Ministry of Interior itself (GRECO, 2004:5). Within the Ministry of Finance,the Financial Intelligence Agency (FIA)2 and the Public Internal Financial Control Agency (PIFCA) perform functions relevant to the national integrity system. FIA is an independent state administration headed by a Director. The main function of the Agency is to receive, preserve, examine, analyse and disclose to the relevant law enforcement bodies information connected with money laundering3. The activities of PIFCA are defined by the PIFC Act and the Agency is headed by a Director appointed (and dismissed) by the Minister of Finance with the approval of the Prime Minister (Articles 6 and 7). Apart from the appointment of the Deputy Director, for which the Director needs the approval of the Minister of Finance, the Director is responsible for personnel management within the PIFCA (Article 7) as well as for managing and supervising the activities of the Agency (Article 9[1],PIFC Act). The principal goal of PIFCA, as provided by Article 2(2) of the PIFC Act, is the prevention, discovery and recovery of damages within the state. The main functions of the PIFCA include planning, managing and implementing an integrated policy in the public internal financial control; developing risk assessment mechanisms; and providing guidance and recommendations on the establishment of financial management and control systems and to check their correct application; as well as provide oversight on the spending of financial resources under EU programmes and funds. In addition, the independent Ombudsman and National Audit Office (NAO) play or are expected to play a role in the prevention of corruption.

State and municipal authorities and their administrations, legal persons as well as citizens are obligated to inform the Ombudsman of any information entrusted to them officially and assist the Ombudsman in relation to complaints received by him/her (Article 7). The Ombudsman is to submit an annual report to the National Assembly (Article 22). Public Mediators have also been appointed in a number of municipalities across Bulgaria (CSD, 2004). The NAO, established by virtue of Article 91 of the Constitution, consists of a President and 10 members elected (and dismissed) for a nine-year term by the National Assembly (Article 10[2], NAO Act). The powers, structure, organization and activities of the NAO are regulated by the NAO Act (Article 1[2]). As provided by Article 2 of the NAO Act, the NAO is independent with accountability to the National Assembly and has its own budget (Article 3, NAO Act). The President of the NAO is responsible for the personnel management of the NAO (Article 15, NAO Act). The NAO consists of a number of functional departments together with Regional Offices established on a territorial basis (Article 16, NAO Act). The NAO is a state body for external audit of the budgetary and other public funds and activities as provided by this Act. Its main task is to contribute to the sound management of budgetary and other public funds and to provide the National Assembly with reliable information on the use of these funds (Articles 1[2] and 4, NAO Act), as well as to audit the financial activities of political parties (OSI, 2002:100). In addition, the NAO holds a register of asset declarations submitted by all civil servants occupying senior positions (OSI, 2002:99).5 The NAO is given certain powers in order to execute its duties (Article 31[1], NAO Act).The NAO may make recommendations for improvements in the management of budgets and/or other public funds and the audited entity is required to implement these recommendations (Articles 41[1] and 42[1], NAO Act). Should these recommendations not be implemented,the NAO forwards a report with recommendations for taking relevant action to the relevant superior institution (Article 42[2],NAO Act).The NAO does not,however,perform an enforcement role.Should the NAO uncover criminal acts, it is obligated to submit these facts to the Public Prosecution Service or to the superior institution responsible for imposing administrative or other liability (GRECO, 2002:16 and OSI, 2002:101). The judiciary also plays an important role in combating corruption. The judiciary consists of the Courts, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Investigation Services, the functions and organization of which will be covered below under Operational arrangements.The judiciary is administered by the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). The SJC determines the composition and carries out the organization of the judiciary.The Council consists of the Minister of Justice as Chairperson6 and 25 members \u2013 the Chairpersons of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court and the Chief Prosecutor as ex-officio members, together with 11 members elected by the National Assembly and 11 members elected by the Judiciary (Articles 16, 17 and 26[1], JS Act). It is the SJC which proposes to the President for appointment or dismissal Chairpersons of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court as well as the Chief Prosecutor. Should a proposal be repeated to the President, s/he must follow the proposal. The SJC also appoints, promotes, demotes and dismisses as well as rules on disciplinary cases against judges, prosecutor and investigators within the judiciary (Article 27, JS Act). Operational arrangements In order to coordinate and consolidate the institutional setup for the fight against corruption, the Commission for Coordinating Actions Against Corruption was established in February 2002. It is an inter-ministerial commission with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Justice as well as the NAO, among others. The commission is headed by the Minister of Justice as the Chairperson, together with two Vice-Chairpersons and is supported in its work by a Secretariat headed by a Secretary.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee2b61ce-db4e-48eb-ab2b-54184758c1e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee2b61ce-db4e-48eb-ab2b-54184758c1e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7df491a9c40fd92e4dc0d357523ea54a60bc860eb429342078fb33f9ac1bda06"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae19351e-c9e8-460b-a0d3-600535ec1511", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "065136974c17d0ac6bcff8201ad4e9dfe6130a6faad9089254009ca69f478f27"}}, "hash": "537c4eb3dd269bb1d5557d80da26213bd0d5edc28376df495c96d6123b99e41f", "text": "The main function of the commission is to coordinate and control the implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy and the accompanying Action Plan, which includes 41 Country Briefs: Bulgaria 4 The election of the Ombudsman was preceded by two previous failed attempts by the National Assembly to hold elections (CSD, 2004). 5 This obligation follows on the introduction", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c916fb7-ed67-4e6c-af54-a2f5a2a4fde7": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c916fb7-ed67-4e6c-af54-a2f5a2a4fde7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "119e36a4173ab3aa4dcab0c3cfe3d860c26ad10177db69721c34f6ec1f2ff938"}, "3": {"node_id": "60283ee8-d469-4297-98e9-bea4e3f8208f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04ae9e34a76fb7630c760096f2bc1037e675bd380652be2cb5c33b10ea03c24d"}}, "hash": "5d0704bc4f67ea62f2cf91b085b52df27fb6ca61b1bc23cce4a7eec14a70e3a0", "text": "of the Act on Property Disclosure by Persons Occupying Senior Positions in the State.

In addition to this, the commission is also tasked with analyzing the general effectiveness of the efforts to combat corruption and preparing measures for increasing the effectiveness of anti-corruption measures.The commission does not,however,have any investigative powers of its own and is unable to intervene in any corruption cases (EC, 2003: GRECO, 2004:3;TI, 2004:167). 7 In addition, a 24-member Permanent Parliamentary Commission was set up by the National Assembly in October 2002 in order to combat corruption.The main task of the commission is to bring national legislation into line with the EU acquis and practices, to monitor the implementation of legislation and to supplement said legislation should any weaknesses occur (EC, 2003:20).The commission is also tasked with proposing amendments and monitoring existing laws as well as identifying gaps in enforcement practices.The commission does not have any investigative powers (TI, 2004:167). The judiciary is tasked with the investigation, prosecution as well as adjudication of corruption cases (GRECO, 2002:7). The independence of the Judiciary is provided by Article 117 of the Constitution as well as Articles 13 and 14 of the JS Law. There are no specialized courts for dealing with corruption cases (GRECO, 20021:5). The Prosecutor\u2019s Office is unified and centralized, with each prosecutor being subordinate to the immediate superior prosecutor, with all prosecutors being subordinate to the Chief Prosecutor, who is also head of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office (Articles 111 and 112, JS Law). The Investigation Services consist of the National Investigation Service and the District Investigation Services, headed by Directors (Articles 122 and 123, JS Act). The investigators conduct preliminary investigation of criminal cases as provided by law (Article 121[1], JS Act). The cooperation between the Police, the Prosecution Service and the Investigating Services is regulated in the Criminal Procedure Code and the Directive on the Activity and Coordination between the Preliminary Proceedings Authorities (GRECO, 2002:14 and GRECO, 2004:6). There are, however, no special provisions made for the investigation and prosecution of corruption cases, which are dealt with in the same way as any other offence. Corruption cases are normally investigated by the District Investigation Services, although the investigations are supervised by the Prosecution Service. The Prosecution Service monitors the lawfulness of pre-trial investigations as well as brings cases to court (GRECO, 2002:14). Lessons learned In Bulgaria,a main concern has been the lack of coordination of anti-corruption efforts.In part,this has been addressed by the establishment of the inter-ministerial Commission for Coordinating Actions Against Corruption as well as the permanent parliamentary commission on corruption. The inter-ministerial Commission has stated, however, in its report to the Government on the implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, that the administrative setup of specialized structures for the fight against corruption should be further strengthened. 8 The President has proposed the possibility of introducing a new independent structure or service to combat corruption in order to improve public confidence as well as provide greater effectiveness in pursuing corruption by senior government officials and politicians9\u2013 something which the current National Strategy has not been perceived as addressing adequately (OSI, 2002:82). It would appear, however, that the government has chosen instead to strengthen the capacity to combat corruption within existing institutions. Also, the appointment of the Ombudsman may contribute towards the prevention of corruption. In addition, the role of the NAO in the fight against corruption has been strengthened, based on a prevention approach, transparency of the audit work and publication of the audit results (EC, 2003:114). It has been claimed, however, that the NAO\u2019s reports and recommendations have come to be largely ignored (OSI, 2002:101). The adoption of the National Strategy was in itself a measure in order to address the lack of a coordinated and comprehensive programme for the fight against corruption.The lack of such a strategy had been seen as a serious impediment to effectively addressing corruption.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60283ee8-d469-4297-98e9-bea4e3f8208f": {"__data__": {"id_": "60283ee8-d469-4297-98e9-bea4e3f8208f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "119e36a4173ab3aa4dcab0c3cfe3d860c26ad10177db69721c34f6ec1f2ff938"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c916fb7-ed67-4e6c-af54-a2f5a2a4fde7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d0704bc4f67ea62f2cf91b085b52df27fb6ca61b1bc23cce4a7eec14a70e3a0"}}, "hash": "04ae9e34a76fb7630c760096f2bc1037e675bd380652be2cb5c33b10ea03c24d", "text": "The National Strategy also places a greater emphasis on prevention of corruption, whereas previous efforts had primarily focused on the repression of corruption.The National Strategy does not, however, appear to include any significant elements of education on corruption or public awareness raising as had been recommended in GRECO 2002 Evaluation Report on Bulgaria (2002:19).

Bulgaria has also created a Unified Information System for Combating Crime and a Criminological Survey Council in order to address the concern that there was a general lack of data available on corruption as well as insufficient research on corruption \u2013 both of which are necessary in order to formulate and effectively implement any measures to prevent and combat corruption (GRECO, 2002:17-18 and GRECO, 2004:2-3). A further concern regarding Bulgaria\u2019s ability to effectively combat corruption is the functioning of the judiciary.One obstacle has been the lack of judges, prosecutors and investigators specialized in corruption offences together with a general lack of human resources as well as funds within the judiciary.In addition to this,the criminal justice system was considered to be slow, resulting in relatively few cases of corruption adjudicated. Although it was perceived that this was partially due to the general lack of resources, it was emphasized that increased specialization on corruption within the investigating authorities would improve the investigation and adjudication of corruption cases. It was thus recommended in the GRECO 2002 Evaluation Report on Bulgaria that specialized departments for corruption cases within the Prosecution Service as well as the Investigating Services (2002:20-21).The government has taken some steps towards establishing such specialized departments as well as providing more institutionalized training on corruption for judges, prosecutors and magistrates (GRECO, 2004:5-7). An additional impediment has been the lack of coordination between the Prosecution Service and the Investigation Services, as well as with other law enforcement bodies (GRECO, 2002:20). As mentioned above, the government has taken measures to improve the coordination between the various investigating bodies through the adoption of specific directives (GRECO, 2004:6). It should also be noted, however, that the judiciary itself is perceived as being corrupt, and one position is that a comprehensive reform of the judiciary is necessary both in order to address corruption within the judiciary and for the judiciary to be effective in combating corruption in society.10 Sources \ufffd Coalition 2000, Corruption Assessment Report 2003,http://www.csd.bg/fileSrc.php?id=357 \ufffd Center for the Study of Democracy, CSD Brief No. 5: The Long Way of the Emerging Ombudsman Institution in Bulgaria: Six Months Later, http://www.csd.bg/artShow.php?id=4283 \ufffd European Commission, 2003 Regular Report on Bulgaria\u2019s progress towards accession, http://europa.eu.int/comm/enlargement/report_2003/pdf/rr_bg_final.pdf \ufffd Financial Intelligence Agency, 2004, Annual Report of the Financial Intelligence Agency (2003), http://www.fia.minfin.bg/docs_en/fia_report2003.pdf \ufffd GRECO, 2002, First Evaluation Round,Evaluation Report on Bulgaria, http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/untc/unpan009761.pdf \ufffd GRECO, 2004, First Evaluation Round,Compliance Report on Bulgaria, http://greco.coe.int/evaluations/cycle1/GrecoRC-I(2004)3E-Bulgaria.pdf \ufffd National Anti-corruption Strategy,2001, http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/UNTC/UNPAN016837.pdf \ufffd Open Society Institute, 2002, Monitoring the EU Accession Process: Corruption and Anti-corruption Policy, http://www.eumap.org/reports/2002/corruption \ufffd Transparency International, 2004, Global Corruption Report 2004, http://www.globalcorruptionreport.org/download.htm Information was also gathered from the websites of the various institutions listed above. 43 Country Briefs: Bulgaria 10 See for example CSD, 2003, Judicial Anti-Corruption Programme, http://www.csd.bg/artshow.php?id=137 44 Hong Kong S.A.R.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee03c12e-946f-4c5d-87ea-53079098df8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee03c12e-946f-4c5d-87ea-53079098df8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a52666b638b391e0b11211fd195c010661813a448e86151e41ce2226599468b4"}, "2": {"node_id": "d0e12e0b-47ac-4a98-8038-9e3df38c34c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e739f0a9749b28364f9a9befe1a65e0f09fe6fa4c56bcbcedad5dd2e34c57c7"}}, "hash": "eb31fa41351bafe97566abea4b94381123f9bdaf4f40b33d3779559a01455565", "text": "Key institutions of the national integrity system \ufffd Department of Justice (DoJ) www.doj.gov.hk \ufffd Hong Kong Ethics Development Centre (HKEDC) www.icac.org.hk/hkedc \ufffd Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) www.icac.org.hk/eng/main \ufffd Office of the Ombudsman www.ombudsman.gov.hk Main legislation1 \ufffd Audit Ordinance (Cap. 122) \ufffd Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance (Cap. 554) \ufffd Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) Ordinance (Cap. 204) \ufffd Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO) (Cap. 201) \ufffd Public Service Commission Ordinance (Cap. 93) \ufffd The Ombudsman Ordinance (OO) (Cap. 397) Background Although it may seem unimaginable today, corruption was widespread in Hong Kong during the 1960s and early 1970s. Bribery was regarded as a necessary evil and a way to get things done.The police department was in charge of investigating corruption offences. The effectiveness of the Police, however, was limited as corruption syndicates within the force were particularly prevalent and bribe-taking was institutionalized in most city administrations.A turning point was reached first due to a corruption scandal involving a senior police officer. It was against this background that the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) was established in February 1974 in order to respond to the public\u2019s call for action against widespread corruption. The ICAC was given the two main tasks of rooting out corruption and restoring public confidence in Government. In order to win the confidence of the public, the ICAC was separated from the rest of the civil service and made directly accountable to the Governor of Hong Kong. In order to enable the Commission to tackle the problem at the source, the ICAC was given the task of carrying out an integrated three-pronged attack on corruption \u2013 investigation, prevention and public education.

By 1977, it was thought that all the major corruption syndicates had been broken. In particular, efforts had been made to root out corruption within the police. In light of its success, the ICAC was now able to turn its attention to addressing the problem of corruption in the private sector.The change in the character of corruption can also be seen from that of the 4,310 reports 1 All legislation is available at http://www.legislation.gov.hk/eng/index.htm. The Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Chapter 455) may also be of interest. on corruption received by the ICAC in 2003 \u2013 57.4 percent were on the private sector,with government departments,the police and public bodies accounting for 23.4 percent,12.3 percent and 6.9 percent respectively (ICAC,2003:35).In the same year,421 persons were prosecuted in 207 cases with a case-based conviction rate of 85 percent (ICAC, 2003:12-13). In 1974, corruption within the public sector had accounted for over 80 percent of reports received by the Commission. Some recent developments in the fight against corruption have included the 1994 review of the powers and accountability of the ICAC, which was completed within the context of political changes, and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance 1993.The aim of the review was to ensure that the ICAC remained effective against corruption without itself becoming corrupted.The changes introduced as a result of the review included more outside control over some investigating powers; search warrants, for example, are now issued by the courts and not by the ICAC. In 1995, six major chambers of commerce, together with the ICAC, helped found the Hong Kong Ethics Development Centre to promote ethics and corporate governance. Nowadays, nearly one in ten reports of corruption in the private sector is made by senior business managers.2 Corruption in the Hong Kong is today under control, with Hong Kong placing 15th out of 159 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index 2005. While no government can expect to eradicate corruption completely, improvements in the area of integrity are encouraging.The efficiency and honesty of the civil service has been acknowledged by the world community and syndicated corruption is something which belongs to the past. The change in public attitude, from accepting bribery as a necessary way of life to actively helping to bring corrupt individuals to justice was achieved through extensive media campaigns and face-to-face contact with various members of the community.The trust in the ICAC is high, with over 98 percent of respondents expressing support for the work of the ICAC. The proportion of respondents agreeing that the ICAC was impartial in its investigation rose to an all-time high of 74.6 percent in 2000, up from 56.4 percent in 1994. Mandate and institutional links of the key anti-corruption institution The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) was established on 15 February 1974,by virtue of Section 3 of the ICAC Ordinance as the primary body for combating corruption applying the three-pronged approach of prevention, investigation and public education. The ICAC consists of the Commissioner as the head, together with the Deputy Commissioner \u2013 both of whom are appointed by the Chief Executive (Subsection 5[3] and Section 6, ICAC Ordinance) \u2013 and officers as appointed. The ICAC Ordinance also provides the charter of the Commission and, together with the POBO, also provides for the ICAC\u2019s mandate. Section 6 of the ICAC Ordinance provides that the Commissioner is responsible for direction and administration of the ICAC, subject to the orders and control of the Chief Executive.Furthermore,the ICAC Ordinance provides that the Commissioner shall not be subject to the direction or control of any person other than the Chief Executive. The Commissioner has the power to appoint officers to the ICAC (Section 8, ICAC Ordinance). Under Section 17 of the ICAC Ordinance, the Commissioner shall submit, on an annual basis, a report on the activities of the ICAC to the Chief Executive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91dafd14-63cc-4235-8cd5-45816ff9118c": {"__data__": {"id_": "91dafd14-63cc-4235-8cd5-45816ff9118c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "953bf778ef913b259c20f65b3256e480237bc4ecaef25682e20f40e7ed6f13e2"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb9b9ed8-42fd-483e-aefc-15fa7ab86eff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ffb6a0c451884b4337e2b83d386483dcd8af4f946bdd782fbdf421856d852b1"}}, "hash": "05ffc7093dca0085504b9bf6b7ee6cb1312c9174ebc9a12b22ba145957e4edb1", "text": "In accordance with Section 4 of the ICAC Ordinance, the expenses of the Commission are charged to the general revenue, i.e. the ICAC receives its resources from the government.The ICAC is independent in terms", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "316ea827-004d-4480-bcf0-00283df0c7f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "316ea827-004d-4480-bcf0-00283df0c7f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d5b4f05c15113f9c05024095f6db5728aa66ab9a532131933f3e54ffde77a18"}}, "hash": "6d5b4f05c15113f9c05024095f6db5728aa66ab9a532131933f3e54ffde77a18", "text": "of structure, personnel, finance and power. Organizationally the ICAC comprises the office of the Commissioner and three functional departments \u2013 Operations; Corruption Prevention; and Community Relations \u2013 serviced by the administration Branch. The division of labour between these departments mirrors the three-pronged approach of the ICAC in the fight against corruption: investigation, prevention and education. The Operations Department is the investigative arm of the ICAC and is its largest department. Operations include investigations into the law-enforcement services,the public service,banking,the private sector and elections.Fraud is a police responsibility, but the receiving of illegal commissions is handled by the ICAC. In that respect, by virtue of Section 10(A to G) of the ICAC Ordinance, the Director of the Operations Department is enabled to authorize his or her officers to restrict the movement of a suspect, to investigate bank accounts and safe deposit boxes, to restrict disposal of a suspect\u2019s property and to require a suspect to provide full details of his financial situation.The ICAC may arrest and detain persons (without a warrant) 45 Country Briefs: Hong Kong S.A.R. 2 For further information on the Hong Kong Ethics Development Centre, see http://www.icac.org.hk/hkedc/eng/main2.asp in its own centre for up to 48 hours (for the offences indicated in the ICAC Ordinance and the POBO).The Department can also collect and detain any evidence for such offences. From time to time, ICAC officers engage in undercover activities. While initially, the ICAC was allowed to issue search warrants, this has now become the sole responsibility of the courts. The Corruption Prevention Department is the smallest unit within the ICAC. The role of the Department is to examine practices and procedures of government departments and public bodies, identify corruption loopholes and make recommendations to reform work methods for reducing the potential for graft. Prevention is claimed to be more cost-effective than prosecution. Prevention includes making recommendations on good business practice to minimize temptation and risks.Recommendations are mandatory for the public sector and advisory for private businesses.Focus is given to changing systems rather than people.To this end, corruption prevention specialists are dispatched to various government departments to examine their procedures and practices with a view to removing all loopholes for corruption.Assistance is also rendered when necessary to help departments produce codes and guidelines on staff conduct. The Department is also involved in the early stages of policy formulation and in the preparation of new legislation to close down opportunities for corruption. The Community Relations Department consists of two divisions dealing respectively with the mass media and the public. The Department is responsible for educating the public about the evils of corruption and for harnessing popular support for the ICAC.It conducts an intensive education programme in the community.Every year,staff of the Department meet managers of the business sector, head teachers, teaching staff and students of schools and tertiary institutes, Government servants and representatives of organizations elsewhere in China, to educate them on the costs of corruption, anti-bribery legislation, especially relevant past cases, penalties and consequences of corruption. Community relations and education are concerned with helping people to develop attitudes against corruption.The success of these efforts depends in part on successful court cases and their publicity, thus providing a credible threat of prosecution. Workshops, seminars, training programmes and various formats are adapted to reach the targets and so-called prevention packages are handed out. The Department has brought about a revolution in the public\u2019s attitude towards corruption. An important tool for the ICAC in combating corruption is Section 10 of the POBO \u2013 possession of unexplained property \u2013 which provides that individuals who maintain a standard of living or have financial resources which are beyond his or her levels of income and cannot provide a satisfactory explanation for how s/he can maintain such a standard of living or how the financial resources were gained is considered guilty of an offence. The ICAC uses the media for deterrence and educational purposes.A series of announcements in the public interest have been produced for television and radio explaining the efforts of the ICAC with three main themes: appeals to the public to report corruption; warnings that corrupt practices are likely to be discovered and that dire consequences will follow; and pleas for honest dealings for the benefit of society. Education packages are also provided for schools. Operational arrangements The ICAC is the primary body responsible for fighting corruption and as such,extensive powers have been vested in it in order to enable the Commission to effectively fulfil its mandate.

To thus ensure the Commission\u2019s integrity, its activities are scrutinized by four independent committees made up of citizens from different sectors of the community appointed by the Chief Executive.These committees receive reports and complaints and monitor the work of the ICAC in order to ensure that the Commission itself does not abuse its powers or become corrupt. The committees are: \ufffd The Advisory Committee on Corruption, which oversees the general direction of the ICAC and advises on policy matters; \ufffd The Operations Review Committee, which oversees the work of the ICAC's investigative arm; \ufffd The Corruption Prevention Advisory Committee, which advises on the priority of the corruption prevention studies and examines all the study reports; and \ufffd The Citizens Advisory Committee on Community Relations, which advises the ICAC on the strategy to educate the public and enlist their support. Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 46 A further accountability mechanism is the independent ICAC Complaints Committee \u2013 chaired by an Executive Council member \u2013 which receives, monitors and reviews all complaints against the ICAC. The ICAC does not have the mandate to prosecute corruption cases. The power to prosecute after the completion of investigations is vested in the Secretary for Justice, thus ensuring that no cases are brought to the courts solely on the judgement of the ICAC. The Secretary for Justice heads the Department of Justice, which is responsible for the conduct of criminal proceedings.In the discharge of this function,the independence of the Department is constitutionally guaranteed by virtue of Article 63 of the Basic Law, which stipulates that the Department \u201cshall control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference\u201d. Within the Department the Prosecution Division \u2013 headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions \u2013 has the role of prosecuting trials and appeals on behalf of the State, to provide legal advice to law enforcement agencies upon their investigations, and generally to exercise on behalf of the Secretary for Justice the discretion of whether or not to bring criminal proceedings. The Office of the Ombudsman \u2013 headed by the Ombudsman, who is appointed by the Chief Executive (Subsection 3[3], OO) \u2013 serves to ensure that the public is served by a fair and efficient public administration that is committed to accountability, openness and quality of service. This is achieved through independent, objective and impartial investigation, to redress grievances and address issues arising from maladministration in the public sector and bring about improvement in the quality and standard of and promote fairness in the public administration.The functions of the Office of the Ombudsman are thus to ensure that: \ufffd Bureaucratic constraints do not interfere with administrative fairness; \ufffd Public authorities are readily accessible to the public; \ufffd Abuse of power is prevented; \ufffd Wrongs are righted; \ufffd Facts are pointed out when public officers are unjustly accused; \ufffd Human rights are protected; and \ufffd The public sector continues to improve quality and efficiency. Lessons learned The high-level success of the ICAC is generally attributed to: \ufffd Political will manifested by, among other things, the provision of adequate legal powers and resources to the ICAC; \ufffd The independence of the ICAC; \ufffd The authority of the Commissioner to appoint, manage and to dismiss staff without explanation; \ufffd The existence of proper, and properly enforced, legislation against corruption; \ufffd Publicity for prosecutions of corruption; \ufffd A law that obliges public servants to declare their assets and the sources of their funds, when asked; \ufffd A holistic approach to the problem of corruption through the three-pronged strategy of investigation, prevention and public education; \ufffd A supportive public; and \ufffd The rule of law. More specifically, the need to win the cooperation and trust of the public in the fight against corruption is of central importance.The transformation of the public\u2019s attitude from resigned tolerance to extreme intolerance of corruption has been a slow and painstaking process, with successes and setbacks. Public identification with the cause is necessary, requiring sustained community education campaigns in order to raise public awareness of corruption.People should be made aware that corruption may have dire consequences if left unchecked. They must also be convinced that ordinary citizens are in a position to do something about it, for their own interest and the common good. They should be shown in concrete terms that corruption only fuels other crimes to the detriment of the prosperity and economic well-being of the people. The ICAC therefore produces its own public interest announcements to proactively communicate a culture of probity and integrity.
