This prompted environmentalists and residents of polluted areas, as well as NGOs to turn to the courts for a suitable remedy. The judiciary referred to constitutional provisions to provide the Court with the necessary jurisdiction to address this issue. The Court observed that Article 21, \u201cThe right to live, includes,\u2026the right of enjoyment of pollution- free water and air for full enjoyment of life.

For example, prosecutors may prevent access to legal advice and delay trials unjustifiably and to their own benefit. In some systems, the discretion of the prosecutor as to who to indict is a quasi-judicial power, and can also be abused. Hence, careful selection and rigorous training of prosecutors is crucial, and independent and stringent disciplinary measures should be put in place to discourage abuses. In common law countries, using an adversarial system of trial, prosecutors represent the interests of the State in front of a neutral third party (the judge) in an adversarial trial in which the ultimate aim is to have one party\u2019s position win over the other. They have a minimal supervisory role over the police in investigations. Only in special cases involving corruption, bribery or corporate crimes do prosecutors perform an investigative function. Prosecutors play more of a so called \u2018inquisitorial\u2019 role in the civil law system. They not only initiate prosecution but also supervise investigations from the outset. 35 They exercise a quasi-judicial power to see that the rights of suspects are protected.36 They contribute to the judicial role of seeking \u2018the truth\u2019. The prosecution service is an essential part of the justice system. Generally, the public prosecution service is headed by a chief lawyer who represents the State, participates in executing the criminal policy of the State, and inspects the application of laws by courts.37 The chief prosecutor is assisted by deputy attorneys and many other public prosecutors who take action in criminal cases or in civil cases involving the State. The table below describes briefly the role of prosecutors in different legal systems in three Asian countries: 90 Programming for Justice: Access for All COUNTRY CHINA THAILAND SRI LANKA LEGAL SYSTEM Communist/Socialist Civil Law Common Law ROLE OF THE PROSECUTORS The Supreme People\u2019s Procurator is in charge of prosecution and legal supervision. It approves arrest, conducts prosecutorial and investigative works, and initiates public prosecution. It is not involved in investigations, detentions, and preparatory examination of criminal cases. Civil LawState attorneys institute prosecution of criminal cases and direct enforcement of criminal sentences. They have a large amount of discretion in controlling and directing criminal cases. They investigate certain categories of criminal cases (especially those involving money laundering or corporate crimes) on their own initiative, without assistance from the police and other law enforcement agencies. The Attorney General acts as the chief law officer. 39 The District Attorney conducts indictment and criminal prosecution in the name of the Attorney General after the police have investigated the case. Table 6.The Role of Prosecutors38 35 Prosecutors in civil law jurisdictions often have little control over the police who rely on their own hierarchical structures. This can inhibit prosecutors\u2019ability to conduct efficient investigations. 36 The quasi-judicial power of prosecutors might include the abilities to 1) assess and make legal decisions based on guidelines,rules of professional conduct,and directives from senior management; 2) dismiss pending cases; 3) decide when to issue warrants; and 4) control certain aspects of judicial proceedings. 37 In many jurisdictions,this individual is known as the attorney general; in other jurisdictions,the person is called the solicitor general or the prosecutor general.Some jurisdictions have even instituted both the attorney general and the solicitor general to prosecute government cases, with the solicitor general assisting the attorney general.The attorney general often plays a dual role of acting as the chief legal advisor to the State and as the chief prosecutor.This becomes problematic in situations where government officials are prosecuted and the attorney general 38 Bureau of Justice Statistics.2003.The World Factbook of Criminal Justice Systems.US Department of Justice.[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/ abstract/wtcj.htm ]. 39 The chief law officer represents the Government in any criminal or civil proceedings and provides advice to the Government on legal matters and the constitutionality of national laws and policies.The individual can also institute,conduct,or discontinue proceedings for any offence without government control. Challenges in Ensuring Access to Justice through Prosecutors Operational efficiency \ufffdLack of adequate resources, especially in civil law jurisdictions where prosecutors are more activelyinvolved in investigations, can prevent prosecutors from doing their jobs efficiently.In addition, inadequate government resources and funding to the Justice Department or Ministry could lead to inadequate mentoring programmes and insufficient training for prosecutors on human rights issues. \ufffdLimited communication between the Government and professional/bar associations of lawyers.

For example, they may accept or pay bribes to expedite/dispose of cases or to overlook critical evidence during investigations. Prosecutors may also knowingly disregard the basic rights of disadvantaged individuals, assuming that their lack of legal knowledge and resources would make them incapable of seeking public remedies and speaking out against abuses. \ufffdLow salary levels of prosecutors in many countries. Prosecutors who are inadequately rewarded for performing their duties might be tempted to accept bribes. Poor pay also tends to only attract junior and inexperienced lawyers to the ranks of prosecutors. This creates a high turnover of prosecutors leading to poor prosecution capability. \ufffdLack of national qualifications for the selection, promotion, and transfer of prosecutors. Without clear selection criteria for prosecutors, there is a risk that prosecutors will be appointed based on subjective conditions (e.g., prejudice, bribery or discrimination).41 The absence of criteria can also hinder states in promoting qualified prosecutors who are aware of the ideal and ethical duties of their office, uphold the constitutional and statutory protections of the rights of the suspect, and defend the human rights and fundamental freedoms recognized by national and international law. \ufffdLack of clearly detailed codes of conduct and ethics for prosecutors. Without establishing clear codes of conduct and ethics for prosecutors, states cannot inform the general public as to the role of prosecutors and they may also fail to establish objective standards that determine whether prosecutors have violated a suspect\u2019s rights. A code of ethics is a pre-requisite for holding prosecutors to account for ethical breaches. \ufffdImprecise criminal procedural codes. Prosecutors should always follow the criminal procedural codes in filing charges and prose cuting individuals. Imprecise criminal procedural codes allows prosecutors to detain suspects for unreasonable amount of time, therefore depriving suspects of basic rights to legal counsel, timely trials, etc. Procedures should be put in place to deal with the re-filing of charges after dismissal or adjudication in order to address double jeopardy concerns. Independence \ufffdGovernment setting of prosecutors\u2019 agenda. While it is appropriate for the national Government to set priorities,there is a need to guard against political interference with investigations and prosecutions. For example, a change in government should not impact on the conduct and role of law enforcement agencies. \ufffdTension between police and prosecutors. As prosecutors and the police fall in most cases under the supervision of two different government divisions (the Ministries of Justice and the Interior respectively), strengthening the independence of prosecutors is likely to affect their collaborative relationship with police in investigative work. \ufffdProsecutors overstepping their quasi- judicial power. Prosecutors, particularly those working in rural or remote areas, are often asked by locals to mediate or arbitrate disputes. Such acts contradict the fundamental nature of prosecutorial work and overstep the function of judges, local magistrates, and ADR groups in resolving these matters.42 Prosecutors in civil law jurisdictions may also be seen to be working too closely with the judiciary and perceptions of judicial independence can be called into question. 91 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies 40 Cooperation between the Government and bar associations does not mean that the agendas of bar associations should be dictated by national policies.Bar associations should act mainly as instruments that flag government activities and programmes for the purpose of promoting public awareness.The cooperative relationship between the Government and bar associations needs to be monitored carefully and assessed continuously. 41 Prosecutors,for example,can be appointed by the executive with the advice and consent of the legislature.As a result,there is a dual screening, and the prosecutors are directly accountable to the executive and indirectly accountable to the electorate. 42 Prosecutors in Laos PDR have immense quasi-judicial power over judges.They can overrule judges\u2019decisions de facto by bringing cases to the National Assembly for rehearing.Such unrestrained quasi-judicial power is problematic. \ufffdLack of personal safety for prosecutors and their families. When the safety of prosecutors or their families is threatened, prosecutors are much more vulnerable to external pressures when trying cases and are more likely to compromise their goal of delivering justice to victims. Accessibility \ufffdAttitudes of prosecutors. Sometimes, prosecutors can be indifferent or unhelpful, which discourages disadvantaged groups from seeking legal remedies. \ufffdGeographical and physical barriers.

People with culturally and/or linguistically diverse backgrounds might have difficulties accessing services and understanding complex legal proceedings that are based on different customs and languages. Capacity Development Strategies to Enhance Access to Justice with Prosecutors Operational efficiency Maintain essential facilities and funding in justice institutions to reduce corruption among prosecutors. Adequate resources and funding provide prosecutors with the opportunities to learn from mentors and programmes about their role while ensuring individual freedoms and rights in court proceedings. States should produce annual reports detailing the funds allocated to justice institutions to improve accessible and support for disadvantaged groups. Funding and essential facilities like information and administrative management greatly improve prosecutors\u2019efficiency in processing and prosecuting cases. Provision of new resources, however, must be carefully supervised to ensure that they are not diverted for inappropriate or unlawful purposes. Human resources development of prosecutors \ufffdIncrease support on human rights understanding by lawyers. Organizations such as the National Human Rights Commission, the Association for the Prevention of Torture, and the International Association of Prosecutors can help to equip lawyers with an adequate understanding of human rights principles and can encourage discussions on human rights violations. Such organizations could provide training to prosecutors on the content and application of international conventions relating to policing and prosecution. They should also actively promote programmes to inform the public about their rights and duties under the law and the role of prosecutors in protecting their fundamental freedoms. Increasing awareness and demand for basic rights from the public can in turn ensure prosecutors uphold human rights principles in the justice system. \ufffdIncrease prosecutors\u2019 awareness of gross human rights violations. Such awareness could be increased by giving prosecutors intensive trainings on the principles of human rights and the need to assist disadvantaged groups, particularly women, children, and other disadvantaged groups, to assert these rights.Although the administration of justice is essentially a domestic matter and the national constitution, legislation, and legal culture, is of paramount importance in domestic courts, they also need to pay attention to the human rights standards set by international human rights instruments.Trainings on prosecution of gross human rights violations are necessary to ensure that consistent standards and respect for international human rights norms are upheld. States can also foster sensitivity among prosecutors by creating incentives and conditionality that encourages them to uphold human rights principles among disadvantaged groups. In addition, sanctions need to be put in place for prosecutors who commit human rights violations (both by commission or omission). \ufffdTrain prosecutors in case management, evidence gathering and investigation. Although the role of prosecutors in investigating cases and gathering evidence varies from minimal to substantial involvement,prosecutors should have the skills to assist or supervise the police when necessary and determine whether or not evidence has been obtained lawfully. Further, specialized trainings on specific topics, e.g., case scheduling, budget planning, etc., are necessary for prosecutors to effectively streamline case management procedures for monitoring and accountability purposes. 92 Programming for Justice: Access for All Integrity and accountability \ufffdHelp states to establish codes of conduct and ethics for lawyers.This should be done in accordance with national law and recognized international standards.43 Legal institutions and experts should advise and assist states on establishing codes of conduct and ethics for lawyers,which would function as standards for gauging the prosecutors\u2019 performance, particularly when prosecutors have grossly exceeded or taken advantage of their authority in judicial proceedings. For example, supporting legislative reforms to define the boundaries of prosecutorial discretion to institute and waiveprosecution. The codes should give the public a general understanding of the role of prosecutors. The Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors44 provides a good starting point on principles. \ufffdDetailed criminal procedural codes should be created.To ensure that prosecutors respect the rights of suspects, especially those from disadvantaged groups, states need to codify their criminal procedures and specify the conditions of detention (e.g., the severity of the crime, the maximum time period for detaining the accused before charges are brought, when warrants should be issued, etc.) and the suspects\u2019 rights to legal advice. Legal experts and institutions should coordinate with and assist the Justice Department or Ministry in creating these codes. The code provisions should give detainees the right to a prompt appearance before a judge to challenge unlawful, excessive detentions in accordance with international human rights standards. \ufffdMaintain sufficient funding. Adequate funding and compensation/reward packages in justice institutions decrease the likelihood that prosecutors will disrupt the effective functioningof a fair justice system. Sufficient funding should also be put into place to attract experienced lawyers into the ranks of the prosecution and enable them to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "625ee825-0830-47c2-bfee-9e26e62c0002": {"__data__": {"id_": "625ee825-0830-47c2-bfee-9e26e62c0002", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e415b5491b9857944187f78bdd13d2a80e908c99051aefefb74d025977ed214b"}, "3": {"node_id": "51fa50ae-0777-453b-981d-1f53222a5c73", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be3b01dbdee9ec35d28816ab77a66ad53aaae6781abcc64b25c550ae2d72f75d"}}, "hash": "c26b773927016176736e2ba23bd7f0b5717b89ff8aa629a57f71d90adc038b5c", "text": "conduct full investigations. \ufffdHold prosecutors accountable for their conduct in court. Courts should impose high standards on prosecutors when investigating and prosecuting criminal cases, based on a code of conduct and ethics. Prosecutors who violate the rights of a suspect, e.g., unreasonably detaining the accused, failing to withdraw charges when evidence is insufficient, falsified, or improperly obtained, or carrying on prosecution without adequate investigation, should be subjected to sanctions by the court. Another way of holding prosecutors accountable is by ensuring that the promotion of prosecutors is based on objective factors such as professional qualifications,ability,integrity and experience, as determined according to fair and impartial procedures. \ufffdAuthorities should cooperate with professional associations,legal institutions, and human rights groups to monitor the activities of prosecutors. Other groups such as these can be useful partners in generating public discussion on laws and observing the conduct of prosecutors. Most importantly, disadvantaged groups might have easier access to these groups and be more willing to report corruption and human rights violations by prosecutors. Independence \ufffdGive prosecutors discretionary power to divert criminal cases from the formal justice system, particularly cases that involve juvenile defendants45. States should fully explore the possibility of adopting diversion mechanisms to avoid overburdening prosecutors with cases involving lesser crimes and to avoid the stigmatization of minor defendants as a result of pre-trial detention, indictment, conviction, and imprisonment46. Prosecutors should consider available alternatives when deciding whether or not to prosecute individuals, particularly disadvantaged persons and juvenile defendants. Before filing charges, prosecutors should look into the nature and gravity of the offence, protection of society, and background of the suspects. Most importantly, although prosecutors should have the discretionary power to choose alternative mechanisms to dispose of cases, they should not be involved in mediation. \ufffdProsecutors should enjoy the freedom to form and join professional associations to represent their interests, to promote their professionaltraining and to protect their status. Accessibility \ufffdEncourage community outreach and education projects by prosecutors. These efforts will not only increase the credibility and reputation of prosecutors\u2019 offices, but will also challenge misconceptions about their indifferent attitudes, allowing disadvantaged individuals to understand more about prosecutors. 93 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies 43 Timor-Leste is a good example of incorporating codes of conduct for prosecutors and the judiciary (the Superior Council for the Public Prosecution and the Superior Council for the Judiciary) in its constitution,in accordance with international standards.

Programming for Justice: Access for All 94 \ufffdRecruit prosecutors from disadvantaged or minority backgrounds. For example, women, cultural and linguistic minorities, those from rural or remote areas, etc. Prosecutors with similar backgrounds as the individuals they serve may understand better the difficulties of the poor and disadvantaged in seeking legal remedies and could address their needs and grievances more effectively. The relationship between prosecutor and defendant is generally one of power, thus encouraging prosecutors from disadvantaged groups may help in mitigating cases of abuse and discrimination.

While the goal of ADR and TIJS are often the same \u2013 to provide alternatives to the formal system different strategies need to be adopted in each situation. This section is broken down into two parts. The first section addresses ADR and the second examines TIJS. 4.3.1 ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) refers to processes that are available for the resolution of disputes outside the formal courts of justice. This includes not only state-sanctioned ADR such as court-annexed ADR, but also community-level ADR mechanisms and ADR services provided by other non-state actors (e.g., civil society). ADR typically includes: \ufffdArbitration - A simplified version of a trial involving less strict rules of evidence.Decisions made in arbitration hearings are usually binding, even if the disputing parties don\u2019t agree with them. Arbitration is often used to resolve commercial and business disputes. \ufffdNeutral evaluation \u2013 A non-binding process where a third party with expertise in the subject matter hears the arguments of the disputing parties and suggests a likely outcome of a court hearing. This process may encourage disputing parties to come to a settlement. \ufffdMediation/conciliation \u2013 The terms \u2018mediation\u2019 and \u2018conciliation\u2019 are often used interchangeably. Mediation involves a third-party intervention (the mediator or a panel of mediators) in which the disputing parties meet and negotiate face-to-face and where the mediator may advise on, or determine the process of, mediation. Mediation at the community-level is a form of ADR frequently used by disadvantaged groups; therefore, UNDP programmes should consider this option to improve access to justice for disadvantaged groups. For example, community mediation boards can be established through legislative acts and commissions can be set up to monitor their activities. They are often free of charge to users and mediation boards generally meet once a week to discuss cases in public. Community mediators are typically local volunteers who are trained to resolve conflicts and are not required to have academic or professional credentials but generally represent the diversity of the community served. They are often individuals of some standing and moral authority within that community who are well respected and are likely to be accepted by those coming before them with disputes. Most community mediators are retired teachers and civil servants living within the community, religious leaders, or volunteers. Interface between the Formal and Informal Systems In order to assist the Government of Cambodia in its Strategy for Legal and Judicial Reform, UNDP Cambodia undertook a study to assess the access to justice situation in Cambodia. The study used a national survey, detailed case studies, in-depth interviews and participatory workshops to examine people\u2019s use of formal and informal system to resolve conflicts. It looked at people\u2019s demand for justice and ability of institutions to respond to these demands. The courts, ADR (Cadastral Commission) and community and indigenous justice systems were evaluated during the workshops to determine the ability of people to access them and their degree of effectiveness. Recommendations emerging from this survey will feed into UNDP projects in the sector as well as influence the Strategy for Legal and Judicial Reform. UNDP Cambodia Community Mediation \u2013 Sri Lanka In Sri Lanka, community mediation boards have been established by the Ministry of Justice to reduce court backlog and facilitate access to justice for disadvantaged groups. The Mediation Boards Act was passed in 1998 to provide the legal framework for community mediation boards. Mediators were trained (along with trainers so that capacity building of mediators could continue) and mediation boards were established at the local level to increase access to alternative means of dispute resolution. 48 There is much debate about the term \u2018informal justice system\u2019as in some cases these systems may be set up by the State (e.g.,state sanctioned ADR) and therefore can be considered formal. In this case,informal justice system refers to traditional justice systems as well as different forms of ADR. Informal ADR also has the potential for strengthening local-level (community) governance since it can play a role in empowering communities to be self-supporting. Given that many local disputes or conflicts arise from disempowerment and diminishing social cohesion at the community level, this is an important subsidiary aim of ADR mechanisms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0ef97de-ddd7-4e86-a7a7-190f96a420e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0ef97de-ddd7-4e86-a7a7-190f96a420e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "973bec6f2f5dcb2a186637019c4870502eb331cf1a1227252c2229cb51bbc354"}, "2": {"node_id": "edffd01b-5933-4ad5-ad21-b9ada4d7a317", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a7a3ad4844247dca9dc60b18e584de943c24e18a915aecc1b8df015ef2bc010"}}, "hash": "f9de7ccd2eceab1af3bedd5c311852d41a882f9174f0e248019fcc7e3cd98928", "text": "Role of ADR in Strengthening Access to Justice Though ADR cannot be a substitute for the formal court system, it can serve as an alternative that complements formal systems.

Some characteristics of ADR that promote access to justice include: \ufffdFaster than court settlements \ufffdLower costs in comparison to litigation in court (no lawyer and court fees, etc.) \ufffdNot as formal as court systems and people may feel less intimidated to approach them \ufffdLocal communities often already have their own ADR, reducing linguistic and cultural barriers \ufffdAs many mediators are from the community and are well known, disputing parties may more willingly trust them and their suggestions than judges in the formal system \ufffdHelps in reducing court backlog ADR (formal and informal) plays an important role in prevention as well as control.It can be used at an early stage,reducing the chances of escalation.The formal system, however, usually functions retrospectively, i.e., after a conflict or crime has taken place. ADR is also about finding win-win solutions to problems, thereby eliminating the adversarial nature of court decisions, which are often win-lose decisions. When community members have to live closely together after the conclusion of a dispute, this type of win-win situation can play a big role in ensuring harmony at the local-level. Challenges in Ensuring Access to Justice through ADR Ineffective enforcement of ADR decisions There is some debate on whether referrals to mediation should be mandatory (ordered by the court) or voluntary. Some judicial systems require litigants to mediate prior to court action while others make mediation voluntary. In either case, mediation awards have no enforceability under law. Since no rules of evidence or laws are followed in a mediation hearing, and there are is no legal representation of the parties, enforcement of mediation awards is not compatible with the law. Because there is no punitive action for violating the award, there are instances where the agreement reached during mediation is broken, and parties go back to the beginning of the problem, which, along with extensive delays,may also cause the community to lose confidence in mediated settlements. Unpredictability of ADR decisions The essence of mediation is that parties in dispute agree on a solution that is acceptable to both in that specific instance without the decision necessarily being legally correct. Since ADR often lacks formal procedures in decision-making and there is a lack of substantive laws to follow, outcomes of decisions primarily depend on negotiations between the parties as well as the mediation skills of the mediator/panel. \ufffdMediators can come from diverse backgrounds and may have different levels of qualifications that can affect the outcome. They are often inadequately trained, partly due to insufficient funds, but also because the training itself may not be comprehensive. \ufffdNot all countries have laws and regulations on mediation, or binding codes or minimum standards for mediators to follow. Lack of impartiality The impartiality of mediators from the community may be questionable. Issues of corruption and nepotism are likely to arise, especially at the local-level where structural inequalities may be perpetuated by decisions made by the mediator. Unclear standards and guidelines Mediators may not be aware of, or may be unwilling to apply, national or international human rights standards. As a result, outcomes of mediation settlements may not be compatible with international standards. Some local customary practices, especially those applying to women, may directly contradict protections provided by international law. There is often no clear distinction in terms of the jurisdiction of community mediation and formal courts. Some disputes are simply not eligible for mediation.Serious crimes (such as murder, rape, grievous bodily harm, torture, armed robbery etc.) fall in to this category. In promoting mediation, it must be clearly articulated that such offences need to be addressed through the formal justice system courts (which have clear enforcement mechanisms), and no attempts must be made at mediation. 98 Programming for Justice: Access for All Lack of political will and funding It is often a challenge to obtain state and donor funding for ADR mechanisms.Though ADR itself is not costly,funds are needed to train mediators and ensure proper monitoring of ADR processes. It is also necessary to have political commitment on the behalf of the State to establish and support ADR processes, especially when they face resistance from other judicial and law enforcement branches who may see them as \u2018competition\u2019 or may be dismissive of their abilities. In these cases, the judiciary and the police may not be supportive of referring cases to ADR mechanisms. Capacity Development Strategies to Enhance Access to Justice with ADR Increasing public awareness and confidence in community mediation In any mediation programme, as a first step, the public must be made aware of the availability, modalities, and benefits of mediation.

Awareness raising must take into account background conditions including political support, the institutional and cultural situation, human and financial resources, and power plays within communities. Some strategies could include: \ufffdA series of targeted focal group meetings to increase awareness among duty bearers. \ufffdA wide media campaign accompanied by focal group meetings for claim holders. \ufffdAwareness programming in schools to \u2018educate\u2019 young persons on how to resolve their disputes through mediation. Any meetings and campaigns must be conducted by experts, experienced in the process of mediation and knowledgeable of local conditions. Obtaining political and financial support from government Financial support is key to the success of mediation programmes. While programmes can commence with donor funds, sensitizing governments and increasing political will to allocate sufficient funding is crucial for the sustainability of mediation programmes when donor funding comes to an end. The Ministry of Justice can be an effective entry point for supporting community mediation boards and other ADR process. It can be seen as a champion of community mediation and ADR. However, it is also necessary to get the courts and the formal legal system to support these alternative processes as well. Improving referral mechanisms to mediation boards and increasing caseloads at mediation boards Sometimes, a mediation programme may have sufficient awareness and funding, but not enough referrals. In these instances, a clear interface between courts and community mediation systems should be set up so that they are both clear about the roles they play, when to refer cases to each other and what their monitoring duties are. For example,preparing guidelines on when to refer cases for mediation would help in reducing the caseload for lower courts. Also, sensitization of the police, promoting conflict management and mediation skills within the police and developing criteria for referrals by the police are some other strategies. Training in community mediation As mediation becomes more and more widespread there is considerable expertise within the field and this expertise must be used for foundation level training, advanced training and training of trainer courses, and continuous training for mediators. A code of ethics,human rights and minimum standards for mediators,and a handbook on how to apply the code of ethics should also be developed and be used as part of the training curriculum. Avoiding conflicting roles There are a growing number of NGOs and civil society groups providing mediation and conflict resolution training at the community level. While these groups are generally seen to be providing a valuable service, there are also potential problems. For example, there may be confusion over who has the authority to resolve disputes at local levels which can undermine the authority of formally trained magistrates as well as traditional leaders.In Papua New Guinea, this issue has resulted in a concentrated effort to ensure that mediation/ADR training is accompanied by awareness raising on how informal mediators trained by NGOs should 99 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies Formal Mediation In an effort to promote mediation as a way to reduce the backlog of cases in courts,UNDP Nepal has helped district courts to organize \u201cSettlement Fairs\u201d \u2013 events in which dozens of pending court cases are settled simultaneously through trained mediators. After the success of these events, permanent mediation centres are now being established. The District Court rules were also amended, allowing the Court to refer cases for mediated settlement to appropriate institutions or individuals. UNDP Nepal be used in relation to both formal magistrates and police, as well as what their role is in relation to traditional leaders.Therefore, there must be a clear mapping of the roles of the various justice players at the local level (formal and informal) and this should be widely disseminated through awareness programmes in order to avoid confusion and \u201cforum shopping\u201d. Community involvement Local communities, especially disadvantaged groups, should actively participate in, and monitor, ADR processes to ensure that they do not have a bias. Women and minorities should be trained as mediators, and encouraged to take part in ADR hearings.Claim holders can also help in monitoring ADR mechanisms by: \ufffdDeveloping a local report card system to evaluate the success and sustainability of settlements. \ufffdFormulating civil society watchdog groups within the community to monitor the implementation of settlements. \ufffdOverseeing progressive realization of settlements. \ufffdIncluding members of disadvantaged groups in mediation panels. These elements are essential ingredients for encouraging community involvement and making mediation more meaningful and relevant.

As courts become more congested, the need for community mediation can only grow.One of the challenges for the community mediation sector is to ensure that societal demand for mediation is met by professional and effective services in this area, and \u2018justice\u2019 is received by all claimholders, especially those representing disadvantaged groups. 4.3.2 TRADITIONAL AND INDIGENOUS JUSTICE SYSTEMS Traditional and indigenous systems of justice refer to the types of justice systems that exist at the local or community level which have not been set up by the State.49 It can also be seen as a system of justice that usually follows customary law or an uncodified body of rules of behaviour, enforced by sanctions, varying over time. Traditional and indigenous systems of justice exist throughout the Asia-Pacific region and serve as an alternative for many people who are unable to, or choose not to, access the formal justice system (courts as well as formal ADR).50 Though law making and enforcing is one of the core functions of the State, traditional and indigenous justice systems often fill in the gap when the State is not able to fulfil its duties or when people simply opt to use traditional systems. In particular, groups that are marginalized by the State often feel it more worthwhile to seek systems of justice that better suit their needs and represent their values. As a result, traditional and indigenous justice systems (TIJS) handle the bulk of the cases in the Asia-Pacific region and when working on improving people\u2019s access to justice, programmes need to recognize their existence and seek entry points in improving the role and function of TIJS. It is difficult to generalize about traditional justice systems, as there are a wide range of TIJS with varying degrees of structure. They range from systems dealing with small-scale civil disputes to those dealing with capital crimes, from systems that promote harmony and restorative justice to those that seriously violate human rights. They include arbitration and mediation systems, and disputes are resolved by single persons or by collegial bodies.The common denominator of TIJS is merely that they exist and function largely outside the purview of state governance.This, and their lack of homogeneity, presents a major challenge when developing solutions and strategies to improve the functioning of TIJS. It is important to recognize that TIJS has its limitations, and may not always be able to deliver appropriate and equitable forms of justice. While many of the failings attributed to TIJS (e.g., nepotism,corruption,human rights abuses,gender bias, etc.) are similarly applicable to formal justice agencies/systems in many countries, these limitations need to be recognized in order to 100 Programming for Justice: Access for All 49 Penal Reform International,for example,defines \u2018traditional justice systems as \u2018non-state justice systems which have existed since pre-colonial times.\u2019 50 Dinnen,for example,states that in Papua New Guinea,traditional systems of justice are used 98% of the time.See Annotated bibliography for publication details. The Salish System\u2013 Bangladesh Salish mediation councils are a type of traditional alternative dispute resolution system that is often used at the local level. An estimated 60-70% of local disputes are solved through the Salish. They are often used for the resolution of small disputes or as an alternative to expensive and time consuming court processes and are accessible to disadvantaged groups. Marriage, family, dowry and land issues are also often dealt with through the Salish councils. Encouraging and supporting the Salish with procedures for recording,conducting and making decisions helps increase the ability of people to access justice at the local level. Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies 101 address them. TIJS may be susceptible to elite capture and may serve to reinforce existing power hierarchies and social structures at the expense of disadvantaged groups. Popular and community justice traditions may be exploitative and violate the basic human rights of individuals (e.g., vigilante justice where the community takes its own form of vengeance, often violent, against perpetrators). Programmes that seek to work with traditional and indigenous forms of justice should attempt to promote the positive aspects of TIJS \u2013 simplified process, easier access in terms of understanding the language and rules, lower cost, geographical proximity,and restorative focus \u2013 and reform the negative aspects that compromise human rights standards. Role of Traditional Systems in Strengthening Access to Justice TIJS can compensate for the State\u2019s unwillingness (lack of political will) or inability (lack of capacity) to provide justice for all. Below are some reasons why people may avoid formal justice systems and instead use TIJS: \ufffdIn remote areas and societies,and also", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5796ae57-f9c0-4838-a3d3-56c904f78d99": {"__data__": {"id_": "5796ae57-f9c0-4838-a3d3-56c904f78d99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a7ad2561e050186c24d18d5a7ce9770feaeea06bca19fccf7be8d4e8e76d2bd"}}, "hash": "7a7ad2561e050186c24d18d5a7ce9770feaeea06bca19fccf7be8d4e8e76d2bd", "text": "in areas not under state control, the courts are often physically too far away and the only accessible form of resolution for disputes may be TIJS. \ufffdThe costs associated with the formal justice system (court and counsel fees, travel costs, delays) are often too high, especially for the poor and disadvantaged. \ufffdTIJS can play a role where the State is over- whelmed with a backlog of cases because of a lack of financial or staff capacity. \ufffdIntimidation can be an important factor preventing people from seeking justice under formal systems. Unfamiliarity of formal procedures and the formal court atmosphere can be an obstacle. As traditional forms of justice are often conducted in the local language and follow local customs, people are less likely to be intimidated by the proceedings. \ufffdTraditional judges are usually aware of the local context. For example, the case may be about livestock theft, but during the hearing, other issues such as land disputes may emerge and the traditional system has the flexibility to address those problems as well. \ufffdPeople also may prefer to use traditional justice systems because the process of dispute resolution is usually much faster than formal systems.Long court delays thus can be avoided. Along with facilitating access to dispute resolution mechanisms, traditional and indigenous processes often take a restorative approach to implementing justice. The goal often is not just to punish the perpetrator, but also to compensate the victim for their loss, prevent the accused from committing the crime again, and to reintegrate both the victim and the offender back into the society. As a result, traditional processes tend to seek restitution, reconciliation and rehabilitation, and emphasize compromise rather than applying strict legal sanctions. However, because of a lack of formal enforcement mechanisms, traditional systems rely largely on social pressure and the consent of both parties to the ruling, which may not always follow human rights standards. In addition,the existence of traditional or indigenous systems enables legal pluralism. In many countries in the region, the formal justice system is based on the legal system of their former colonial rulers, and as a result is not necessarily well understood or respected by many ordinary citizens. Building bridges between the formal sector and TIJS is not only a way of trying to regulate TIJS and ensure their compliance/consistency with state law; it is also a way of building understanding of, and respect for, what are often exceedingly fragile formal justice systems. It is important to focus on strengthening the intersections between the two in a manner that promotes the rule of law and respect for human rights. Preference for TIJS The Pnong community in Cambodia have their own system of justice which involves using village elders to conciliate and settle their dispute. Part of the settlement includes a payment of \u2018Leas Leang\u2019 where the village elder determines the payment that must be made by the wrongdoing party. During the Access to Justice Workshop held in Mondulkiri, Cambodia in November 2004, the participants expressed the following reasons for their preference for using indigenous systems of justice to resolve their problems: \ufffdLower cost/free of charge \ufffdLess time consuming than the formal system \ufffdEasy to get to \ufffdCan use their own language and speak out freely \ufffdCommunity leaders understand the context of the conflict \ufffdAmicable settlement \ufffdSimpler procedure \ufffdLess nepotism/corruption than in the formal system UNDP Cambodia Challenges to Ensuring Access to Justice through Traditional and Indigenous Justice Systems Even though traditional courts can play a role in facilitating access to justice,there are limitations as to how effective, efficient and impartial they can be. Customary traditional laws often reflect social hierarchies and can be discriminatory in their rulings. Often, the rulings depend on the knowledge and skills of the individual mediator/arbitrator.Further,there are no minimum standards that have to be followed and the rights of victims and suspects are protected only by customary norms. Therefore, it is important to regulate these systems so that abuses do not occur. The following section details some weaknesses of TIJS that may be an obstacle in terms of access to justice. Gap between traditional laws and human rights standards TIJS needs to respect human rights, at its most basic level the right to equality and non- discrimination. As traditional judges and community members are often not aware of human rights and related duties they are usually not upheld. Another problem arises when human rights standards directly contradict local customs and beliefs. For example, public humiliation and physical violence may be considered an appropriate punishment for someone who has committed a crime in the community.

Inappropriate use of traditional and indigenous justice systems The differences between human rights systems and traditional and indigenous justice systems can become especially problematic in the case of capital crimes, such as rape and murder. The informality of procedure, which may be a strength in dealing with small scale civil and criminal cases makes these systems inappropriate for cases in which formality is needed to protect the rights of both the victim and the offender.This includes the right to due process and to legal assistance,rules of evidence and presumption of innocence. In contrast to this,traditional and indigenous systems may put the burden of proof on the accused, use torture to effect a confession, or allow serious offenders to escape legal responsibility for their actions. Exclusion of disadvantaged groups TIJS throughout the world are often dominated by men of high status and tend to exclude women, minorities,younger people and most disadvantaged groups. The traditional justice system in India, for example,is usually run by those from higher castes. As a result, social hierarchies and biases are reinforced in the dispute resolution system and there is little opportunity for people from disadvantaged groups to appeal against decisions made by those in power. Traditional laws can also be biased and can discriminate against women and other disadvantaged groups. For example, in Melanesia, women accused of adultery are imprisoned whereas their male counterparts are not punished. Also, decisions are often made not on merit alone, but as a result of outside pressures such as powerful connections or threats of violence or sanctions. This seriously compromises the integrity of TIJS. \u201cForum shopping\u201d When jurisdictions are not clearly defined or overlap, it poses a problem for an effective justice system.For example,if one party in a dispute is not satisfied with the outcome of the decision, they have the option of appealing against the decision in other forums.This undermines the ability of TIJS to rule effectively and their positive role in reducing the backlog in formal systems. Lack of enforcement mechanisms TIJS are often centred around the concept of restorative justice where emphasis is placed on reconciling the victim and the offender and reaching a consensus about settlement. However, because traditional systems do not have specific enforcement measures to back their decisions, often they are non-binding and rely primarily on social pressure. Though this may be sufficient for minor cases, for serious offences however, accountable enforcement mechanisms need to be in place that are both humane (i.e., avoid cruel and degrading treatment) and effective. 102 Programming for Justice: Access for All The Barangay Justice System (BJS) \u2013 Philippines Traditionally, Barangay leaders were respected members of Filipino communities and were often responsible for resolving disputes.In 1978,the BJS was restructured into a formal system and eventually incorporated into the Local Government Code of 1991. Though the BJS was not used very much initially, a concentrated effort was made to increase people\u2019s awareness of their rights and the functions of the BJS which includes mediated settlements. For example, even if crimes such as domestic violence are beyond the jurisdiction of the BJS,they can help families come to an agreement, especially when the goal is to induce a change in behaviour rather than sending people to prison. Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies 103 Enforcement mechanisms that violate human rights Sometimes,corporal,cruel and inhuman punishment for committing even minor crimes is used by some TIJS, attempting to enforce customary law. These violations of rights need to be addressed when developing strategies to improve TIJS. Corruption Some structural deficiencies make TIJS susceptible to corruption.Traditional leaders with the authority to resolve disputes may abuse their power to benefit those who they know or who are able to pay bribes.Traditional judges are often not paid or are insufficiently paid and may rely on gifts and bribes for an income, influencing the outcome of the hearing. Nepotism is also a problem in traditional systems. Traditional judges may be chosen on the basis of who they know or are related to, not on their ability to make appropriate and fair decisions. Finally, traditional justice systems may also lack independence and decisions may be influenced by outside (political) concerns and pressures. Capacity Development Strategies to Enhance Access to Justice with Traditional Indigenous Justice Systems TIJS does not make up for the shortcomings of the formal justice system There is a danger in relying too much on traditional systems to solve all disputes. However, in many parts of Asia,TIJS remains the cornerstone of access to justice for the majority.

Combining rather than choosing between formal justice and TIJS A more innovative approach entails designing hybrid justice institutions that combine the elements of both the formal justice system and TIJS.A good example of this is Papua New Guinea\u2019s Village Court. This court was created by statute with a defined jurisdiction which is subject to review by district courts. Village court magistrates are local villagers appointed by their peers and charged with settling local disputes in accordance with local custom. Their weakness in practice is that the Government often fails to provide the prescribed allowances, training, manuals, etc., and the district court magistrates are less than dutiful in fulfilling their supervisory obligations. This is essentially a failure of the formal system (e.g., the State fails to pay, train and supervise) although in practice it is often portrayed (especially by lawyers) as an indication of the inherent failings of the informal justice system. Start with thorough research and knowledge development The large variety of traditional systems requires thorough research and knowledge development activities to enable programmes to effectively respond to the particular strengths and weaknesses of the TIJS. Research on customary law and indigenous institutions also implies the different laws and methods will be recorded. This can be helpful so that people can easily access previous cases when necessary. Though some argue that it may go against oral traditions, recording and researching laws and traditions can be useful as long as these laws are not codified and allow for flexibility. Research and publication of customary law may also help judges and other staff of the formal justice system to better understand and take into consideration indigenous methods of justice when they have to deal with cases relating to indigenous peoples. Codification of traditional law The issue of codification of customary law is a frequently debated subject.Customary law is often defined by its fluidity: each case is judged on its own facts without referring to a written set of laws. This allows customary law to change with the community and be as flexible as the situation demands. This becomes problematic only when attempts are made to codify traditional judicial customs and laws, as norms can change from village to village. The codification process will freeze the laws in place, and will not allow them to develop and change with the time. In special cases codifying customary law may lead to legal insecurity. Hence, it is best to devise programmes based on research and documentation of practices in consultation with indigenous communities, but codifying customary procedures themselves may be counterproductive. Build linkages between formal and traditional justice systems Building linkages between the formal and traditional justice systems is a key strategy in developing both the State justice system and TIJS. Linkages between Indigenous Peoples Organisations (IPOs), the State and indigenous justice systems can be a way to start discussions about indigenous issues and devise ways in which to work together in complimentary manner while respecting each other\u2019s jurisdictions. By creating clear guidelines for the role of the State vis-\u00e0-vis indigenous peoples and their territory while at the same time engaging in dialogue with them Programming for Justice: Access for All 104 can be a constructive means of working with the State. Also, encouraging other alternatives such as the State setting up hybrid justice institutions that combine elements of both the formal justice system and indigenous justice systems can be a means of interface between the formal and indigenous justice systems. For example, the formal justice system could adopt a more restorative and rehabilitative approach in the court room and in sentencing rather than an adversarial one. Establish regulatory mechanisms Regulatory mechanisms help to clarify the mandate (serious criminal offences should be referred to the formal courts) of TIJS, establish monitoring and accountability mechanisms (including against corruption and nepotism), and to ensure that decisions made and enforcement measures pursued adhere to certain minimum standards in line with national laws and human rights. However, it is best if these mechanisms and lobbying for setting up these mechanisms come from within indigenous communities. Often indigenous peoples have their own methods of holding their chiefs and elders accountable for their decisions. Establish clear accountability lines Accountability must be to the State justice system so that the State can ensure the protection of the rights of minority and disadvantaged groups and make sure that: \ufffdThe lower-level courts (e.g., district court) oversee traditional systems. \ufffdAn ombudsman-like institution is established", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ee15172-3d7a-41f2-ac3e-1f63a386133c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ee15172-3d7a-41f2-ac3e-1f63a386133c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16ed32d07e8ade95912b409d4adf20c48404da60beac9812ae0036cadcfa214c"}}, "hash": "16ed32d07e8ade95912b409d4adf20c48404da60beac9812ae0036cadcfa214c", "text": "to oversee the functioning of TIJS. \ufffdTraining is provided for basic documentation and record keeping in traditional justice institutions so that monitoring can be more easily carried out. \ufffdA system of checks by civil society and local political representatives is promoted so that abuses of power are reduced. \ufffdThe legal empowerment and literacy of the community is enhanced so that they can also play a monitoring role. In turn, traditional justice systems should also be able to demand accountability of the State mechanisms and ensure that their rights, and the rights of their community and their jurisdiction,are respected by the State. Include popular TIJS methods into the State system State justice systems could adopt a more restorative and rehabilitative approach in dealing with cases, they could allow community representatives to express their views during formal hearings, and could encourage a less adversarial approach in courts. These types of reforms can help state systems become more user-friendly and can increase the willingness of people to seek out formal systems. Conduct training on human rights and national and international standards Traditional leaders and judges should be made aware of their mandate and their duties, including the standards they need to follow.Legal awareness programmes can help communities ensure that their rights are not violated by traditional judges and that these judges fulfil their responsibilities to the community. If awareness programmes are promoted by the formal local courts,it may encourage linkages with the community and TIJS. Awareness programmes can also provide information on alternatives to traditional systems as well as where and how to appeal decisions made by traditional judges. Working with Traditional Systems To get an understanding of indigenous systems UNDP Nepal commissioned several studies in remote areas in Nepal and found that these century-old community mediation systems are functioning very effectively, including the implementation of and adherence to rulings in criminal cases. Based on the studies, a meditation manual was prepared that was used to train traditional mediators in order to raise awareness about the formal law. It was essential to convince traditional mediators of the added value of adhering to formal law as well as providing them with the best international practices on mediation. UNDP Nepal Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies 105 Include disadvantaged groups Along with setting up laws that prohibit traditional systems from engaging in discriminatory behaviour, it is necessary to also address underlying beliefs and practices. Changing attitudes and behaviour can take time and the State and civil society need to be involved through active advocacy and behavioural change programmes to encourage traditional systems to be more inclusive. This can include promoting members of disadvantaged groups to actively participate and be part of the traditional tribunals, encouraging programmes that raise awareness about the rights of disadvantaged groups, and encouraging disadvantaged groups to mobilize themselves to make demands from traditional systems. Build bridges between TIJS and the formal justice system TIJS need to be considered as more than alternative systems that can fill in the gaps when the State is unable to provide adequate services. Further, it is necessary to move away from viewing the relationship between the formal system and TIJS in dichotomous terms (either/or alternatives). Building bridges between them is a way of achieving the ultimate objective which is to build a unitary (national) system capable of accommodating different justice traditions. Citizens, for example, can take their disputes to the local traditional judges (except for serious criminal cases which must be investigated by the State) which are monitored by the formal system and, if need be, have the choice to appeal the decisions in the formal courts. Ultimately, TIJS should be viewed as an integral part of the national justice system, not as an alternative to it. 4.4 Oversight 4.4.1 National Human Rights Institutions 4.4.2 Civil Society Oversight 4.4.3 Parliamentary Oversight 4.4 Oversight 109 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies 4.4 OVERSIGHT Accountability is one of the key principles of the rights-based approach, and to ensure that the justice system is accountable it is necessary to set up oversight mechanisms. This section discusses three key actors that can play a role in external oversight of the justice system to ensure that it respects and promotes the rights of all people but especially those who are disadvantaged. National Human Rights Institutions, including National Human Rights Commissions,Ombudsman offices, and thematic commissions investigate human rights abuses and make recommendations with regard to improving legislation and implementation of legislation that protect people from human rights violations. Civil society, including the media, can investigate abuses, publicize irregularities and advocate for changes within the justice system.

By establishing national human rights institutions, encouraging civil society to monitor the justice system and advocating for Parliament to engage with the justice system,additional checks are put in place so that the formal and informal justice systems work towards promoting access to justice for all. 4.4.1 NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) are established by the State, according to specific legislation (e.g., constitutional amendment), in order to promote and protect human rights at the national level.The application of human rights and establishing NHRIs can be part of a remedial process for grievances. They are quasi-judicial or statutory bodies whose mandate generally includes (i) investigation of complaints in cases of human rights violations, (ii) promotion of human rights education, and (iii) review of potential legislation. 51 In 1993, the UN General Assembly adopted what is generally known as the Paris Principles: a set of standards for national human rights institutions that stress the importance of certain institutional requirements \u2013 such as a broad mandate, a sound legal foundation, an independent appointment procedure,autonomy from the State and adequate funding \u2013 for institutional effectiveness in ensuring access to justice. 52 The responsibilities of NHRIs may include: \ufffdReviewing draft legislation and administrative actions and suggesting measures to improve the human rights situation such as amendments or additions to the existing legislation, or policy changes. 53 \ufffdInvestigating individual human rights violations by seeking to settle a dispute, for example through consultation or mediation, between individual and the government body. \ufffdActing as independent monitors of the executive\u2019s action, including the activities of enforcement agencies and other actors within and outside the justice system. This is important in order to strengthen overall accountability in the system. \ufffdPromoting and ensuring the harmonization of national legislation and governmental practices with the international human rights instruments to which the State is party to, as well as encouraging ratification of,or accession to, these instruments. \ufffdPromoting human rights education and awareness through various means, including research and analysis on human rights, collaboration with academia, civil society and the media. \ufffdLitigating directly on behalf of disadvantaged and marginalized groups, or indirectly as amicus curiae (friends of the court). The International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights evaluates NHRIs from around the world and determines their accreditation status by the extent to which they adhere to the Paris Principles.54 Political commitment of the Government and the establishing frameworks (along with human and financial resources) is also crucial in allowing NHRIs the independence to fulfil their duties. Though NHRIs do not have judicial or lawmaking capacities (and as such do not have the mandate to issue binding judgments), they can still work through other means,including external ones such as the media and civil society organizations, to put pressure on government to respect human rights. With regard to disadvantaged people, NHRIs can help them reach remedies that would otherwise remain inaccessible and can help strengthen their capacity to seek a remedy. 51 According to the International Council on Human Rights Policy\u2019s study on National Human Rights institutions.The term national human rights institution is \u201ca hybrid category and includes many different varieties within it.As far as this study is concerned,the defining point is simply that it is a quasi-governmental or statutory institution with human rights in its mandate.That would exclude a government department on the one hand (say a human rights office in the Foreign Ministry) and an NGO on the other.But it would include human rights commissions,ombudsmen, Defensores del Pueblo,procurators for human rights and an infinite variety of other institutions.

primarily manifest themselves through National Human Rights Commissions, various thematic commissions (e.g., women\u2019s commissions, indigenous people\u2019s commissions) and through national Ombudsmen. The function of the Ombudsman is to ensure fairness and legality in public administration55,while other NHRIs are more specifically concerned with protection and promotion of human rights. 56 These institutions facilitate access to justice by monitoring human rights situations and providing the means through which members of society can seek redress for violations of their human rights. First, as state institutions, they are by their existence a statement of the Government\u2019s commitment to human rights, especially when enabling legislation provides them with an expansive mandate. Second, these institutions are under national ownership, which alleviates people\u2019s fear of external intervention. Third, a national human rights institution develops the country\u2019s capacity to respond to human rights issues internally,at a much faster rate than even the best-intentioned external actors and even more than the domestic courts. NHRIs can help poor and disadvantaged people obtain remedies that would otherwise remain inaccessible to them. The presence of NHRIs may also be useful in preventing future grievances. These institutions often create a necessary space for human rights dialogue between state institutions and non-governmental entities. NHRIs 55 In some case,Ombudsmen may have a wider human rights mandate (e.g.,in the CIS Georgia,Azerbaijan and Kyrgyz Republic). 56 In situations of conflict,NHRIs also play a role in monitoring the implementation of international humanitarian standards.

This can be critical to strengthening of overall accountability within the system.Finally,NHRIs are also involved in legislative review and advocacy, which can improve normative protections for disadvantaged groups. NHRIs can further strengthen people\u2019s capacities to seek justice remedies through their role in human rights education. Challenges in Ensuring Access to Justice through NHRIs Deficient legal frameworks ensuring minimum standards for the institution In many countries NHRIs are relatively new and their establishment may be seen as merely a token gesture by the Government and not really incorporating the true essence of international human rights standards. In fact, NHRIs may be provided with a narrow mandate,independence or authority, which would limit their ability to complete their duties in accordance with the Paris Principles. Also, there may not be a clear definition of the role of NHRIs which can lead to confusion over what is included within their mandate and responsibility. However, unless NHRIs meet the minimum standards of independence and are provided with the appropriate mandate to protect and promote human rights, the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights (ICC) will not accredit these institutions, compromising their legitimacy. Unsatisfactory performance Performance refers to the extent to which a NHRI addresses human rights grievances, particularly those of the poor and disadvantaged. NHRIs\u2019 performance is critical to determine whether its existence contributes to greater access to justice,or perpetuates impunity by shielding governments from criticisms.There is also a risk that NHRIs focus too much on processing individual cases and do not focus sufficiently on broader human rights policy and implementation issues. The performance of NHRIs is also dictated by their mandate. If the legislation that establishes NHRIs is limiting, then their performance is confined within those parameters. Performance can also be compromised by appointing a commissioner who may not have the necessary expertise. It is important to ensure that commissioners are not just political appointees but have the necessary competence and a background in human rights.57 Perception of insufficient legitimacy The legitimacy of NHRIs depends on the extent to which they are accepted (by both the Government and society) as independent human rights monitoring bodies. If the recommendations and opinions of NHRIs are not honoured and there is no respect for minimum standards, their legitimacy will be eroded over time. If the institutions are not perceived to be completely independent and objective, or are not able to perform their necessary duties (i.e., highlight human rights violations as well as discriminatory conduct and omissions on the part of the Government), then their legitimacy is compromised. Also, if there is no mechanism of follow up defined in NHRI legislation NHRI\u2019s will not be perceived as a credible and effectively functioning institutions.An indicator for the lack of legitimacy is the trust people have in civil society organizations rather than NHRIs and their reluctance in seeking assistance from NHRIs. Limited political commitment Government commitment is necessary in order to establish NHRIs. Legal arrangements (within the legislation) should be included in the legal framework as a proof of political will. After establishing a NHRI, it is then crucial to provide it with adequate financial and staff support as well as the necessary mandate and freedom to access information and fulfil their role. Provision of adequate resources can be a basic indicator of political will. Without adequate political commitment, the Government can undermine the goals and work of NHRIs.

Establishing a National Human Rights Commission \u2013 Bangladesh As courts are very expensive, time consuming and largely inaccessible especially for the very poor, UNDP Bangladesh is focusing on developing preventive strategies with regard to human rights, including the creation of a strong, independent NHRI to provide accessible remedies. However, despite having conducted a PRA study on institutional development of human rights in Bangladesh that pointed out the need for a central organization to deal with cases of human rights violations, a national human rights commission still has not been established.Though the PRA was helpful in developing baselines, the initiative lacked overall detailed guidance in setting up the NHRC.Also,while participation of all stakeholders should be encouraged, a prolonged political process may be disastrous, especially in a context where governments are unstable and policies change frequently. As a result, a national human rights commission has yet to be established in Bangladesh. 57 Though commissioners may not be overt in their support for the ruling party,they may display subtle executive-mindedness and may be partisan in their decision-making or the cases they choose to pursue. 113 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies Inadequate budgets A national human rights institution depends to a large degree on public expenditure to determine the scope of its work.Government control over the budget allocations for a NHRI may limit its independence, neutrality and effectiveness. As the Paris Principles note, in order to secure the smooth conduct of activities of the national institution, it is necessary to have adequate funding. This funding should be used to enable NHRIs to have their own staff and premises so as to maintain control of their operation. In addition, their budget should be granted directly from the State budget and not through a particular Ministry. Lack of efficient,qualified and experienced staff The work of NHRIs requires committed and experienced staff \u2013 both to work in the capacity of policy,strategy and decision-making and to ensure implementation of programmes. However, low budgets restrict NHRIs ability to recruit the necessary level of qualified and experienced staff. This also affects the motivation of staff to carry out their duties. Sometimes, governments underpay ombudsmen or do not fund fulltime commissioners for the NHRI, making it difficult for the NHRI to be effective. As per the Paris Principle, a more pluralist representation should also be required.58 Capacity Development Strategies to Enhance Access to Justice with NHRIs Ensure legitimacy \ufffdEstablish sound founding legislation. NHRIs should ideally be established by law or, preferably, by constitutional amendment, as presidential or other kinds of decrees make them vulnerable to having their powers limited or abolished. In order to establish NHRIs within the appropriate legal framework, there needs to be sufficient political commitment that can be generated by the Government itself or encouraged through advocacy by citizens\u2019 groups, NGOs and other civil society organizations. \ufffdStrengthen NHRIs\u2019 accountability. Ensuring that NHRIs report publicly on their activities is a way to strengthen their accountability. Reporting may be done formally to a parliamentary body and/or to a committee representing different sectors of society, or informally through periodic meetings with civil society organizations, government officials, etc.Generally, an annual report on the activities of the NHRI should be submitted to Parliament and shared with the media. \ufffdAllow for investigative powers and develop capacities to address systemic violations. NHRI\u2019s founding legislation should allow for investigative capacity with respect to all human rights violations (civil and political as well as economic, social and cultural). They should have the authority to investigate all actors, including government officials, insurgent groups, armed forces, the police, etc. They need to have freedom to access, for example, all places of detention, and their security along with those whom they speak to must be guaranteed. Their ability to access information, documents, materials and evidence from different actors is also critical in ensuring public legitimacy. NHRIs may also be granted the power to initiate legal proceedings on their own, to conduct public enquiries on issues where systematic patterns of abuse may be found, and provide the necessary recommendations for addressing and improving the human rights situation in their country. NHRI\u2019s capacity for policy analysis and identification of systemic problems can maximize the impact of its investigative work. Also, it is necessary to establish a way of linking (in given cases) NHRIs with the Chief Prosecutor for imely prosecution of human rights violations. \ufffdEnsure financial sustainability.

Sensitizing of parliamentarians through committee structures is important to increase Parliament\u2019s awareness of the work carried out by NHRIs and encourage allocation of sufficient resources. Also, alternative routes of funding (e.g., through international cooperation) can be explored without compromising financial sustainability. Secure autonomy and independence Autonomy and independence are crucial to NHRIs. Without autonomy and independence to monitor and report on human rights issues, they will be The Islamic Human Rights Commission \u2013 Iran The experiences of the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) in Iran demonstrate that a human rights watchdog organization can operate successfully,despite the lack of a strong legal man- date, if it is anchored well in the national governance structure. Though the IHRC has a limited mandate (and has a status similar to that of an NGO), it is treated by the Government as a national institution and functions in a similar capacity. It works on human rights complaints, human rights education, and human rights reporting as well as building partnerships and networks. By supporting such institutions, UNDP can be involved even in sensitive and controversial issues. 58 In countries where there are multiple NHRIs there may be a limited number of efficient,qualified and experienced staff to meet the needs of all the institutions. 114 Programming for Justice: Access for All unable to fulfil their duties. To guarantee this independence, it is necessary to ensure that: \ufffdAppointments are made through a transparent process that selects the best- qualified members and at the same time ensures a pluralist representation of society. \ufffdMembership and staffing of NHRIs is diverse (including from disadvantaged groups) and qualified in working on human rights. \ufffdClear terms of appointment are definedso that commissioners cannot be removed simply because they criticize the Government. \ufffdThe authority to hire and fire staff lies within the jurisdiction of the NHRI. \ufffdCommissioner/ombudsman/staff should not hold or perform incompatible functions elsewhere - in either government or civil society. \ufffdImmunity should be provided for staff from prosecution for words spoken or acts performed under the mandate of the NHRC. Increase accessibility Accessibility of NHRIs can be improved in order to facilitate reporting of human rights violations. By ensuring that complaints-making mechanisms are accessible is one way to accommodate civilian complaints. Some strategies to increase access, especially for disadvantaged people, to NHRIs include: \ufffdExpanding geographical outreach through developed structures (regional and local). \ufffdNon-threatening/neutral location of premises (including premises that are sensitive to the needs of disadvantaged groups \u2013 e.g., accessible for people with physical disabilities). \ufffdEnsuring representation of disadvantaged groups in the institution\u2019s membership. \ufffdEstablishing linkages with NGOs working on particular issues and with disadvantaged groups. \ufffdInitiating investigations focused on issues facing disadvantaged groups. \ufffdPromoting public enquiries. \ufffdAdvocacy work on the rights of the disadvantaged, for example,through outreach to the media. Build linkages Improve coordination with the judiciary, prosecution, police and prisons. NHRIs should complement the work of the formal justice system. NHRIs should have the mandate to ensure that cases are dealt with, e.g., by filing cases in court or by having them automatically filed by the prosecution where they lack prosecutorial capacities. Though NHRIs usually have no powers to enforce their decisions, they can help facilitate the judicial process when they work with the formal system. In such circumstances, the judiciary is critical to ensuring appropriate redress and prevent impunity. Linkages with police and prison institutions can expand NHRIs\u2019access to persons in detention.Ways to build linkages include: \ufffdStrengthening cooperation between different types of NHRIs. Where there are multiple national institutions for the protection of human rights, maximum coordination needs to be ensured through joint planning and regional and international cooperation among national human rights institutions. This can serve to mutually develop the capacities of the various institutions working on specific human rights issues,as well as reducing role confusion among NHRIs. Cooperation can also strengthen the internal security of the institution itself, if its activities make it vulnerable to threats by those complicit with human rights violations. Cooperation and planning strategically can help in making the optimal use of limited resources. \ufffdConstituency building to ensure maximum legitimacy. Legitimacy is indispensable for NHRIs to be effective. Initial legitimacy can be strengthened through ensuring maximum participation of different sectors of society, particularly those involved in human rights within and outside government (including human rights activists and civil society organizations) during the process of establishing NHRIs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5fce7f2-90ef-450e-9c7c-e6fae956359f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5fce7f2-90ef-450e-9c7c-e6fae956359f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2c1135d0b7704074639b6d8208b890a39a4d2c97a4f44451b79e8de4fecbcff"}, "2": {"node_id": "b8aea389-e1da-4c3b-bb2d-11e4d695ce5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21bdf59b34b65a8af6b45f492151febe760d6640a03bcd7052cb82a29db6f685"}}, "hash": "98b18ffd26977b17bc8964e012bb5e902aa8d5335549066c738057540dfb59db", "text": "Much of the public legitimacy of NHRIs lies in the extent to which they succeed in developing links with the Government, the media, professional groups (lawyers, forensics, etc.) and other civil society institutions,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58b60add-8481-4241-8fcf-0113be3eb749": {"__data__": {"id_": "58b60add-8481-4241-8fcf-0113be3eb749", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b7fd020f5b00937f49bd512e465f945048213dfdc3dd194ed30bb8e622b40aa"}}, "hash": "6b7fd020f5b00937f49bd512e465f945048213dfdc3dd194ed30bb8e622b40aa", "text": "and address urgent social issues, which are often controversial. In addition, a well-maintained case handling process can increase its reputation in society in general. Cooperation with UN and regional human rights bodies and special procedures on the follow up to government commitment can also assist NHRIs in their work and in building networks regionally and internationally. 115 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies 4.4.2 CIVIL SOCIETY OVERSIGHT Civil society actors, in particular civil society organizations (CSOs) and the media can act as watchdogs over the justice sector and function as a force for accountability. Civil society is a crucial agent for limiting authoritarian practices, strengthening the empowerment of the people and improving the quality and inclusiveness of the justice sector. 59 Role of Civil Society in Strengthening Access to Justice Civil society actors have a five-fold function in improving access to justice: \ufffdAs campaigners and advocates pressing for reform. \ufffdAs monitors, fostering accountability within the justice sector. \ufffdAs disseminators and communicators of information. \ufffdAs educators through legal empowerment and legal literacy initiatives. \ufffdAs direct agents helping people access justice through legal aid and representation services. This section focuses on the first three functions of communicator, campaigner and monitor; the others are covered in Chapter 5. Experience shows that without considerable public pressure, governments and other state institutions are unlikely to foster the transparency and accountability needed to curb malfeasance by officials. Therefore, it is important that civil society actors engage in dialogue to pressure and negotiate with justice institutions and political authorities to change practices in the justice system and to ensure that new regional and international systems of protection are given effect in national justice systems and institutions. Civil society actors can improve access to justice through systematic independent observation, monitoring and evaluation of the justice system and sustained reporting back to actors within and outside of the justice system about procedures, behaviours, and practices. Scrutiny applied by the media and civil society can aid the successful and just resolution of disputes and strengthen overall accountability within the justice system. While there are no explicit international standards which guarantee civil society\u2019s role in access to justice,several instruments state the importance of civil society involvement in ensuring transparent and accountable governance processes in all sectors of society.60 In addition, two international legal instruments guarantee freedom of association and thus, define the parameters within which a government may restrict or regulate CSOs \u2013 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 61 Challenges in Ensuring Access to Justice through Civil Society Oversight Civil and political rights may not be legally protected Despite being enshrined in international conventions and resolutions,if civil and legal rights are not protected under national legislation, civil society actors wishing to use these rights to challenge the State or other more powerful actors may be threatened or intimidated. No accountability or enforcement mechanisms In many countries there are no mechanisms to enable the public to claim their right to information, and no public and media access to court proceedings. No effective media In its absence, CSOs or coalitions advocating reform, work largely in isolation and are deprived of the opportunity to influence and mobilize public pressure. Journalists may lack professional skills In many countries where civil society has been repressed or is weak, the media often lacks the professional skills, understanding and resource base needed to undertake investigative reporting. 59 There is no one standardized definition of civil society,however there is agreement more or less on two main principles about what civil society is not. First,civil society is not part of the Government or state apparatus.Second,civil society is not the market; it is non-commercial and therefore excludes profit-seeking firms.The media are considered part of civil society because of the role they play in the formation of public opinion even though they are technically considered firms.CSOs in this section include NGOs,CBOs,PVOs and the media. 60 One example is the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Report of the 1997 Special Session of the UN General Assembly.Further, the GA Resolution 48/134 on national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights and the Commission on Human Rights resolution 2003/76 on National Institutions state that the composition of national institutions ensures the pluralist representation of the social forces (or civil society),highlighting the importance of partnerships and increased cooperation with representatives of NGOs,universities and qualified experts. 61 Some states are not signatories to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,1966 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by its nature was never opened for signing.Despite this,the Universal Declaration has", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99c532d7-1aae-4b71-b7c3-d3f6c834d43d": {"__data__": {"id_": "99c532d7-1aae-4b71-b7c3-d3f6c834d43d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "654f54d701304459ad2d06a1b5ca30d55da035a473c03617bff9e94b13259d9e"}}, "hash": "654f54d701304459ad2d06a1b5ca30d55da035a473c03617bff9e94b13259d9e", "text": "been accepted as having the force of international customary law since 1968 and as such lists rights which are universal in nature.These rights apply to all people of the world,and the Covenant falls under the same category by virtue of its adoption and application.As such,the basic rules are binding. experts. Programming for Justice: Access for All 116 Few civil society actors prepared to advocate for justice and legal reform Often CSOs in lesser developed countries are dominated by middle-class professionals and based in urban centres. Consequently, they generally represent relatively small constituencies, which exclude the poor, vulnerable and disadvantaged. Therefore, even if they are vocal and active,individual CSOs often exercise very little leverage on behalf of a reform agenda. CSOs may be unable to form coalitions to champion reform agendas Constraints to collective action vary,but are largely as a result of policy issues and leadership styles. Many CSOs are personal expressions of dynamic leaders who, having founded an organization, are reluctant to share power with or subordinate their identity to a coalition involving other CSOs. Misuse of the principle of \u2018judicial independence\u2019 While some judiciaries welcome civil society involvement, the principle of \u2018judicial independence\u2019 is often misused as an argument to reject any form of public control or accountability. The notion that the justice system should be considered a public service is not widely understood. Non-lawyers may be ill-informed Legal professionals often argue that non-lawyers do not understand the law and what they do and are therefore incapable of contributing usefully to their work. Civil society may lack the expertise and willingness to monitor effectively In many countries civil society is reluctant to engage in activities which involve monitoring, analyzing and criticizing justice institutions as it is considered as dangerous. Being too vigorous in criticism could lead to trouble, either officially or unofficially. There is also often widespread pessimism about what, if anything, civil society actors can achieve in such matters. Other capacity constraints faced by CSOs \ufffdCSOs often lack the internal capacity to fulfil their role, including limited resources, knowledge and technical skills, and as a result they often lack the necessary legitimacy and credibility required tomeet their objectives. \ufffdCompetition for resources among CSOs may be fierce. \ufffdCSOs often lack sustainable funding and are seen as lacking in transparency and accountability due to limited capacity for proper financial and administrative management. \ufffdCSOs are sometimes more accountable to donors than their constituents and are criticized for being donor-driven. \ufffdThe way in which governments and civil society react to each other can be an obstacle. Non-democratic states, which often have corrupt and inefficient bureaucracies and are dominated by patronage networks, generally do not respond positively to reform initiatives. CSOs can also view the Government as the main obstacle to achieving their objectives and can become unnecessarily critical and antagonist rather than engaging constructively with the Government. Capacity Development Strategies to Enhance Access to Justice with CSOs Monitoring \ufffdOrganized and routine court monitoring normalizes the observation and information-gathering process. The objective of civil society court monitoring groups (ideally comprising of media and CSOs) is to report on what takes place in courts and to make recommendations for improvement. This type of monitoring provides a comprehensive way to examine a local justice system and is particularly useful for reformers within the system. It protects them from external threats and frees them from internal pressures to deliver a verdict in favour of one party regardless of the evidence. In the Philippines, observers attend courts to monitor and study court performance and report to the Supreme Court any violations of judicial ethics and procedures they observe. The information gathered from these observations is published in the hope that it will stimulate reform and improvement. Reports indicate that judges are altering their conduct because of the project and are ordering their staff to be on their best behaviour. In this particular project, the monitors are not known to the judges, and there is no way of knowing when the monitors might be present in the court. \ufffdEffective monitoring mechanisms are complex, and more effort needs to be dedicated to their design and refinement. This should involve developing the technical capacity of civil society to effectively monitor and evaluate the functioning of justice sector 117 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies institutions.Developing this technical capacity should include the preparation of reliable empirical studies of justice system functioning and the impact of reforms. \ufffdProvide support to judicial councils or other institutions playing a role in judicial selection processes.

The strategic and organized public participation in judicial appointment processes can have a significant impact on the outcome of these processes by ensuring that persons who are qualified to dispense justice, in terms of competence, integrity and dedication, are recruited to key positions. \ufffdProviding hard facts is important. Faced with accurate and reliable data, it is much harder for officials to contend that allegations are baseless.This can also help in constituency building, as one crucial foundation for informed public debate is sound data and analysis on the system\u2019s internal workings.This typically involves research to generate information, and can also involve innovative and participatory methods, which in themselves act as awareness raising and mobilization mechanisms. A lack of reliable data will also impact on the ability to conduct investigative journalism into,and legal analysis of, the judicial system. \ufffdPublic opinion surveys provide empirical evidence on public opinions towards the justice system. While such surveys often reveal little that is not already known or suspected, they can present opinions about public issues in a way that is difficult for leaders to deny or ignore. Such data alone cannot force reform, but it contributes to a climate in which political will for reform is easier to encourage. \ufffdCivil society involvement will have more impact if it is ongoing and constructive. This means sustained engagement with the issues and institutions of the justice sector and constantly taking the initiative to present proposals for the development of transparency mechanisms or other mechanisms to improve the justice system. CSOs should remain active and vigilant even after completing a successful campaign as ingrained non-transparent practices can easily reassert themselves. Networks and coalitions \ufffdLinking civil society with wider networks, nationally and internationally can have a larger impact on the reform process and make individuals less vulnerable to threats, intimidation and other risks inherent in community mobilization. Linking CSOs with National Human Rights Institutions designed to oversee the actions of state institutions and protect human rights, can establish a nation wide presence through regional offices and local networks. International organizations can function as a remote accountability mechanism at the local level. Human rights CSOs have been particularly adept at using international counterparts and institutions to draw attention to governmental policies and behaviour not in accordance with international conventions ratified by the Government. International CSOs such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Federation of Journalists have successfully drawn the attention of donor governments and key actors in the international community to harmful state practices, after having been alerted of cases and problems by local CSOs. \ufffdSupport coalition building to strengthen support networks. Given the limited size, resources and impact of most CSOs, partnerships between CSOs, the media, civil society, and reformers within the justice system can build astrong support network able to hold the legal system more accountable, and create a widespread demand for change. Coalitions that include diverse groups, which have established reputations and credibility are likely to have greater impact. Successful coalitions have a broad membership, ideally one which cuts across classes or other social divisions, demonstrating the legitimacy and relevance of the concern, and limiting any suggestions it might be a narrow interest group. \ufffdSupport e-governance and the use of networking technologies to strengthen CSOs. Foster interaction and partnerships between CSO networks through international, national and local e-governance initiatives. CSOs can enhance their own internal capacities and networks, and take a stand vis-\u00e0-vis issues relevant for the local context by harnessing both expertise and knowledge through new and existing CSO networks. 118 Programming for Justice: Access for All Media The media can be an effective advocacy tool to promote behavioural change, disseminate information, raise awareness and monitor the obligations by duty bearers. \ufffdUse the media to catalyze the justice sector. This has been done either through exposing bad practice or corrupt behaviour by officials, or alternatively by praising good practice or good behaviour and reinforcing positive service delivery innovations.

By making the system more transparent, it becomes more difficult to conceal corruption and malfeasance. In Sri Lanka, the Asia Foundation has supported the development of a university degree programme in investigative journalism. In the Philippines, the Centre for Investigative Journalism has provided training to journalists and sponsored investigative press reports, which have exposed judicial malfeasance. 4.4.3 PARLIAMENTARY OVERSIGHT The justice system includes formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, and processes that are meant to provide remedies for disadvantaged individuals\u2019 grievances within national and international human rights frameworks. By using its monitoring and legislative powers, Parliament can oversee the various aspects of the justice system to ensure that the institutions function properly. Parliament should reflect public and social concerns in order to retain public legitimacy and promote the participation of constituents, particularly members of disadvantaged groups. When disadvantaged groups are given a voice, Parliament's oversight function can play a significant role in ensuring the delivery of constitutionally guaranteed socio-economic rights and the further strengthening of a rights-based culture.Responsible parliamentary oversight of the justice system is therefore,an essential component of good governance and democracy. Role of Parliament in Strengthening Access to Justice Parliament can exercise its oversight functions through a wide range of means. One of the most obvious controls that Parliament exercises over the judiciary is the ability to confirm, review and impeach executive judicial appointments.Through this power, Parliament is able to monitor the composition of the courts. Parliament also exercises a significant influence over the justice sector through its power of budgetary allocation. Parliament is responsible both for allocating funds and overseeing their usage. Another one of the most direct forms of parliamentary oversight of both the judiciary and the police is through committees. Committees provide parliamentarians with the opportunity to organize their work and to focus expertise. In addition to specific judiciary and police oversight committees, a number of other parliamentary committees perform relevant oversight functions. For example, counter-corruption committees investigate claims of corruption among judges or police.Some ad hoc or select committees influence justice and security sector policy and undertake other types of oversight of specific justice system actors. Committees also allow for direct communication between Members of Parliament (MPs) belonging to different political parties. Access to committees by all constituents, for instance through public hearings,petitions and the media ensures that their effectiveness is maximized. Parliament can also perform oversight functions through a range of actors. Parliament has the power to create or enhance National Human Rights Commissions (NHRCs) so that they can monitor the actions of the justice system as a whole and to initiate litigation or provide amicus curiae submissions when necessary. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, Ombudsmen can also be important tools for oversight. Parliament has the power to create an ombudsman office charged with the task of overseeing specific sectors of the justice system. In addition, MPs can work with NGOs and think-tanks that can act independently to monitor the justice system in order to have access to more information. Parliament can also create specialized think-tanks to provide it with additional expertise when needed. Finally, Parliament often exercises 119 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies \u201cultimate oversight\u201d, even over watchdog institutions such as human rights commissions to ensure that they in turn are effectively carrying out their mandates. Other means of strengthening parliamentary oversight include: \ufffdInviting experts from civil society to participate in parliamentary hearings. \ufffdEngaging research institutes and universities to carry out research and audits. \ufffdEnsuring that NGOs can have access to all relevant public policy documents. \ufffdStimulating the existence and functioning of NGOs by lowering the bureaucratic barriers for legal recognition of NGOs or giving financial support. \ufffdAllowing the media to cover abuses and encouraging training in media awareness on issues relevant to the justice sector. \ufffdRequesting that independent institutions conduct research on the executive\u2019s budget and activities. 62 Through its role in overseeing the executive, Parliament can also exercise oversight of ministries that control various aspects of the justice system. Parliament must hold the executive branch accountable for their policies and activities. In this context, the most relevant bodies within the executive are the Ministry of Justice, which oversees prison systems and sometimes, the Attorney General\u2019s Department; the Ministry of the Interior,which oversees the police;and the Ministry of Defence when the military is performing policing functions. This can be accomplished through enacting laws and providing the executive with legal guidelines. Through this legislative power, Parliament is able to control the finances of agents of law enforcement.

Challenges in Ensuring Access to Justice through Parliamentary Oversight The greatest challenge to parliamentary oversight is striking a balance between intervention and respect for the independence of the judiciary. Judges must be able to make decisions in an atmosphere free from intimidation from the legislative branch. However, at the same time, the judiciary has to respect Parliament\u2019s duty to keep it to account. A clear line must also be drawn between parliamentary oversight and executive control. Parliament should not micro-manage the justice system. However, Parliament\u2019s constitutional duty to oversee the executive must be respected. The executive must operate transparently and share all relevant information with Parliament. Ombudsmen and NHRCs can also face limitations. Since their mandates originate in Parliament they may not be entirely independent,which can hinder the effectiveness of their work. Political sensitivity can also pose a major challenge. For example,it is relatively rare for parliamentarians to challenge executive nominations to the judiciary since such nominations are generally considered a privilege of the executive. An additional challenge is posed by the difficulty of ensuring that disadvantaged groups are enfranchised. Parliament does not always listen to the concerns of their least influential constituents. Yet, these are the groups that most desperately need their assistance. Programmes that promote participation should be particularly focused on these groups. Another challenge is that development organizations, including UNDP, tend to work with Parliament and the justice sector separately. Working together with both of them could enhance their relationship. 62 Born,Hans.2000.\u201cRepresentative Democracy and the Role of Parliaments: An Inventory of Democracy Assistance Programmes.\u201d4th International Security Conference,Geneva,November 15-17,2000.

Providing support to parliamentary committees dedicated to overseeing the judiciary, including providing information (e.g., by encouraging experts to participate in parliamentary hearings, engaging research institutes to carry out research and audits, etc.) and assisting in building commitment and political will, can be a strategic entry point for UNDP. Some specific strategies: \ufffdPromote awareness among MPs about criteria for objectively assessing potential justices. \ufffdProvide policy advice to the executive or the legislature in any of the areas falling within parliamentary oversight of the justice sector. \ufffdProvide comparative and other research to enhance the institutionalization of parliamentary oversight. \ufffdAdvocate for budgetary reform that addresses impediments facing the disadvantaged, especially in accessing justice. \ufffdPromote the enhancement of oversight components in the mandates of various parliamentary committees. \ufffdAssist in ensuring that committees are empowered with sufficient research and other resources to fulfil their oversight role. \ufffdEncourage constituent participation in the work of committees. \ufffdEmphasize the role of socio-economic factors in determining the conduct of members of the justice and security sectors. \ufffdAssist in the creation of advocacy-based organizations and institutions and facilitate transparent links to Parliament. \ufffdFacilitate dialogue among the executive, legislature, and civil society regarding improvements to the justice system. \ufffdWork with Parliament and the justice system in tandem through joint programming, budgets, steering committees etc. \ufffdProvide support to parliamentary committees. Through committees, parliamentarians have the opportunity to organize their work and to focus expertise. A well-developed committee structure is needed if Parliament is to be effective in its oversight of the justice system. Committees are vital as they allow for direct communication between parliamentarians belonging to different political parties. . 123 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies 4.5 ENFORCEMENT The two institutions charged largely with the responsibility of enforcing the law are the police and the prisons system.

They are also public service providers who have an important responsibility to uphold and defend human rights.Unfortunately,in some countries the police have not been so effective in preventing human rights violations, or have even been accused of abusing their discretionary powers, and infringing on the rights of the people they are supposed to protect. Prisons are the second key element in enforcement.They are a place in which people are confined and deprived of a range of liberties. The prescribed function of a prison is to enforce judgments under criminal law. Conventionally, prisons are institutions authorized by government, which form part of a country\u2019s criminal justice system. The responsibility for the prison service normally falls under the Ministry of Home Affairs, although in some countries this responsibility lies within the Ministry of Justice. 4.5.1 THE POLICE Role of the Police in Strengthening Access to Justice The role of the police in access to justice is two-fold: \ufffdMaintenance of law and order \ufffdEnforcement of judicial decisions These roles grant the police broad discretionary powers, including the use of force, which, if misused, can result in grave human rights violations. The police, in this context, must be defined within a human rights and justice framework, which considers the primary mandate of the police one which respects and protects human dignity and maintains and upholds the human rights of all people. The right to use force,63 which is central to the role of the police, can lead to human rights violations if there is unnecessary and excessive use of force. Police can also misuse their authority if they engage in arrest and detention without clear charges,thereby seriously undermining the right of individuals to freedom and liberty. To guarantee that the discretionary powers of the police do not lead to human rights violations,there is a need to set up elaborate legal structures and accountability measures, which can monitor performance and successfully restrict the abuse of police powers. A number of human rights instruments define the boundaries within which this power can be used. The instruments relating most directly to police performance are described below: \ufffdCode of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials defines, among other things, the circumstances under which force can be used; the accepted types of force; the principles of confidentiality with respect to sharing information, as well as issues of how to secure the medical health of persons in police custody. \ufffdBasic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials defines the circumstances under which force and firearms should be resorted to; the rules guiding the use of force and firearms in terms of exercising restraint, minimizing damage and ensuring medical aid; the role of the Government when abuse of force takes place, as well as reporting and reviewing of procedures relating to cases of injury or death. \ufffdBody of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment defines the circumstances under which detention should be carried out; how persons under detention should be treated and the rights and entitlements of people in detention. Challenges in Ensuring Access to Justice through the Police Inappropriate legal frameworks Most police agencies in the Asia-Pacific region are still guided by past colonial laws and regulations that do not support the principles of human rights, such as accountability, transparency in actions and participation of the people.Some of the laws are in direct conflict with international human rights standards and constitutional guarantees of liberties. Inappropriate and outdated regulations can compromise the effectiveness of the police in serving the needs of the disadvantaged. Discriminatory practices Institutional and systemic discrimination by the police prevents many disadvantaged people, especially women, from seeking redress for a 63 To apprehend a felon,for example,or to negotiate a family dispute or engage with someone who is mentally ill. grievance. Behaviour can range from ridicule, ignorance, and hostility, to sexist and derogatory remarks. The police are often seen as favouring elite members of the community (either because these individuals can exert power over the police or because they can afford to bribe them). As a result,powerful people are often immune from the consequences of crimes they commit, blatantly violating human rights standards. Insensitive behaviour towards victims of crime Victims of crime are in a vulnerable situation, and often have to deal with poor service, lack of awareness and insensitivity on the part of police officers. For example, victims of rape need special kinds of services. Police should also be sensitive to the psychological and medical difficulties victims of sexual crimes face and should provide them with the care and support they", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b1db90f-8060-4776-af92-aaf098eefc1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b1db90f-8060-4776-af92-aaf098eefc1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f722fc2ef7ea67a957546a132dcb794ffe9cc8f48d8bba354b5357a2719d52dc"}}, "hash": "f722fc2ef7ea67a957546a132dcb794ffe9cc8f48d8bba354b5357a2719d52dc", "text": "require. In some cases, enforcement officials do not take rape cases seriously and claim that reports of sexual assault are exaggerated and deserve no special attention. Similar lack of sensitivity may also be displayed when dealing with people with physical or mental disabilities. Lack of public confidence/faith in the police Interaction between the police and the community in many Asian countries has traditionally been negative, with antagonism, mistrust and prejudice common to both sides. Many citizens do not feel welcome at police stations and feel discouraged from filing reports. The poor public image of the police is also caused by many instances of privileging the rich and powerful in society, common practices of corruption and bribery and non-registration of cases. Moreover, the police often do not include community perspectives in the planning and execution of their work which leads to further alienation and distrust on the part of the community. Lack of transparency/access to information Mechanisms to make policing more transparent and accountable are lacking in all countries in the region. People may generally have difficulties in accessing information about departmental rules, copies of complaints they have filed and data or information on crime, policies and procedures adopted while making arrests and detentions etc. 64 Insufficient oversight and accountability mechanism There is often an absence of suitable internal and external oversight mechanisms to monitor the quality of policing. For example, the \u201ctough on crime\u201d strategies adopted by many governments in the region often overlook abuses committed by the police. Also, mechanisms to ensure police accountability may be neglected or even weakened in the name of fighting crime or terrorism. Influence of external actors is too great The police force is often closely connected to the executive and consequently subject to various political influences and pressures, which may be detrimental to its proper functioning and performance. This lack of independence from external influences can encourage a culture of impunity within the police force. Unless the police are only accountable to the rule of law and guided by the framework of respect for human rights,their ability to fulfil their duties as defenders of human rights will be seriously compromised. Excessive arrests Disadvantaged and powerless sections of society often experience a higher number of haphazard and unlawful arrests by the police resulting in casual detention and victimization. Police in the Asia-Pacific tend to \u2018over-arrest\u2019 which not only leads to over-crowded prisons and pre-trial detainees, but as discussed in the next section on prisons, it is also a violation of human rights. Poor protection of detainees The conditions under which detainees are kept in police custody often violate their human rights. Detainees may be chained within offices, kept in police cells for long periods of time or not given adequate medical attendance. Clear regulations protecting detainees and training on respecting the rights of detainees is often lacking. Poor working ethics and low police morale Low pay rates and adverse working conditions serve as obstacles to good policing, creating low morale and poor ethics within the police force.This problem is also related to limited career prospects and lack of incentives, as few forces have a sustained and reliable motivation scheme for their members. Police staff often languish in their positions for long periods of time without due credit for good performance. This furthermore deprives the police service of the visionary and talented police officials who are needed to strengthen the quality of service provided. Poor administration and insufficient training Shortfalls in supervisory and managerial competence and insufficient human resource management lead to lack of discipline, ineffective management and poor administration.Further,the police are generally under-trained and many critical functions are consequently performed by incompetent personnel. Lack of resources and mismanagement of funds Police services are generally severely under- resourced and suffer from lack of basic amenities and tools. Also, poor resource management 124 Programming for Justice: Access for All 64 Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative.2004.\u201cPolicing \u2013 A Human Rights Perspective.\u201dFebruary 2004: p.6-7.New Delhi.Seminar organized by the Ministry of Home Affairs in association with the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative and the Delhi Police,February 12,2004. 125 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies capacity within the police force makes it difficult to sustain various reform measures.

Further, the police often lack appropriate strategies for engaging communities in crime prevention. Poor coordination Lack of coordination among police, prosecution, courts and other relevant agencies is another obstacle for ensuring access to justice.For example, police should be able to refer to the appropriate branch of the judiciary or even refer cases to ADR systems as opposed to the formal courts. Capacity Development Strategies to Enhance Access to Justice within the Police Often access to justice problems stem from the fact that police have a responsibility to enforce judicial decisions and maintain security, law and order at the same time as ensuring that human rights are upheld and respected. In order to improve access to justice, strategies for police, reform should subsume traditional \u201cpublic administration reform\u201d activities under more human rights focused activities, specifically with regards to enhancing accountability, inclusion and adherence to human rights standards. Law reforms \ufffdRevise laws, regulations and procedures that do not correspond to principles of good policing, or are directly in conflict with international human rights standards. To this end, collaboration with the Ministries of Law or Justice and/or Law Commissions should be encouraged. Depending on the political will for reform in the country, strategies could support coalition building to bring about public pressure for reform, while direct support from the legislative branch and civil society can bring about legal reform that ensures police conduct adheres to international human rights standards. For more specific suggestions, refer to the earlier section in this chapter on Ministry of Justice and National Human Rights Institutions. Accountability and transparency/access to information \ufffdStrengthen processes and procedures. Organizational elements for strengthening accountability could include specific departmental policies and procedures, precise job descriptions as well as inspection systems and performance evaluations to ensure that rules are observed and undue and excessive use of power is curtailed including unnecessary \u2018locking up\u2019.65 Standard operating procedures are important to improve accountability, efficiency, uniformity and transparency.

Police Reform and Strengthening the Police Force \u2013 Bangladesh A key lesson learned from the police project in Bangladesh is the need for political will, determination for reform, high-level project management skills and conditional and sustained support from development partners to improve governance, the rule of law and equitable access to justice. It is crucial to detect change agents within the police force and build an internal constituency for reform through formal and informal discussions. Effective and independent monitoring and evaluation of reform progress is also essential. Police procedures should be monitored to ensure that they are poverty- sensitive and pressure from outside (e.g., CSOs) can ensure that procedures are implemented properly and in a sustainable manner. Addressing professional concerns and problems, for example, recruitment, posting, promotion, career management, strategic decision-making, intelligence-based investigation, oversight, future directions and planning, and managing politic interferences, etc., can also help build confidence within the police force and encourage the adoption of human rights in their work.

Their mandate is to take disciplinary action and identify organizational conditions that may contribute to misconduct or poor efficiency. In addition, a periodic performance evaluation could help in monitoring individual officers, and it could also encourage improvement in services as they would be rated on the types of services they provided. \ufffdInvolvement of Police Commissions and quasi-judicial institutions. Support could be given to the setting up, or strengthening of, a Police Commission. A Police Commission is an independent agency with the mandate to investigate citizens\u2019 complaints about misconduct of municipal police officers. A Commission provides administrative and investigative support services and is empowered to hear and determine appeals against disciplinary penalties or dismissals and to conduct hearings into public complaints. Involvement of quasi-judicial bodies such as women\u2019s commissions and human rights commissions could also help in monitoring police conduct with regard to disadvantaged", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46e387a1-c030-4d39-8313-4e1363293425": {"__data__": {"id_": "46e387a1-c030-4d39-8313-4e1363293425", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "38433c56ff8abecd5e9bf9449554dbaf0012fbb12d48e94f07fba7285310d50f"}}, "hash": "38433c56ff8abecd5e9bf9449554dbaf0012fbb12d48e94f07fba7285310d50f", "text": "groups. See National Human Right Institutions in this chapter for more information. \ufffdExternal oversight mechanisms. As discussed in the previous section, civil society oversight as well as parliamentary oversight is critical to ensuring the accountability of the police. Initiatives to strengthen interaction between police officers and the community can help to identify officers who are misbehaving, and reward those who are performing well.66 In addition, the media can also play a role in enhancing accountability, and access to non- confidential police information should be increased through the development of a police-media relations strategy. \ufffdVisiting systems. Support could be given to independent custody visiting systems that allow volunteers from the community (NGOs, CBOs, etc.) to visit police stations to check on the treatment of detainees and to observe the conditions under which they are held. Similarly, support could be given to NGOs to help with the protection of witnesses in collaboration with the police system.However, these visits should only be conducted by appropriately qualified persons and with due discretion and confidentiality. Additional protection measures need to be put in place for witnesses under witness protection. \ufffdAccess to information. Maintaining proper records of cases brought before each police station can ensure suspects have access to information about their case, enabling records to be readily available for examination on request. To ensure that confidentiality is respected, ethical principles and control mechanisms should be developed. \ufffdInvestigation of police misconduct. Efforts to strengthen accountability should also include oversight mechanisms to ensure that any deaths, disappearances, or serious injuries of persons while in police custody (or shortly after the termination of police custody) are thoroughly investigated.67 In addition,a system should be developed for the reporting and reviewing of all incidents involving the use of force by police. 68 Improved human rights/gender sensitive approach \ufffdTraining and sensitization programmes. To counter discrimination in the police force, the development and implementation of training and sensitization programmes on human rights, especially with regard to the specific needs of disadvantaged groups should be supported (e.g., gender sensitization, awareness of needs of people with disabilities, concerns of people with HIV/AIDS, constraints facing Internally Displaced Persons, etc.). Initiatives in this direction could also include support for curricula/training material development for national police academies and training institutions.UNDP Bangladesh,for example, has developed a detailed human rights training manual for the police. \ufffdStrengthening the role and numbers of women and minority groups in the police force. This could be done both by targeted 66 Numerous examples exist from around the world of civilian oversight bodies vested with the responsibility to deal with citizens complaints of alleged police misconduct.These include the Civilian Complaint Review Boards of the USA,Independent Complaints Directorate (ICD) of South Africa, the Independent Police Complaints Commission of the UK,and the Peoples\u2019Law Enforcement Board of the Philippines. 67 Principle 34,Body of Principles for the Protection of All persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment.(General Assembly Resolution 43/173,9 December 1988). 68 Principles 22-26,Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.(Adopted by the Eight United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders,Havana,Cuba,27 August to 7 September 1990. Civilian Police Commissions In Sri Lanka, a National Police Commission has been established where only civilians can be part of the Commission. The Commission, with the Inspector General of Police,has disciplinary control over police officers and controls the appointment, promotion, transfer, and dismissal process. It has the power to investigate public complaints of the police as well as individual cases brought against particular police officers or the police service and provide redress in accordance to the law. The Commission also sets the codes of conduct and standards as well as establishes schemes for recruitment, training, improving efficiency and independence of the police service. The Commission is ultimately accountable to the Parliament to which it has to report on its activities annually. 127 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies recruitment procedures as well as by giving special training to police officers from disadvantaged groups, and by supporting networks of these officers across police stations. To make the police more sensitive towards minority groups, strategies could include advocating for a more diverse police service and supporting the development of strategies to this effect. \ufffdEnhancing society-police linkages through community policing. Community policing is a philosophy and an organizational strategy that promotes a partnership between police and the wider community. It is based on the premise that both the police and the community should work together as equal partners to identify and solve problems of crime. Supporting community policing can be an effective strategy to make police services more responsive", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e04c94b6-81cf-4476-b99a-31f1188b5011": {"__data__": {"id_": "e04c94b6-81cf-4476-b99a-31f1188b5011", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "891420f5987aae540defdf49d057f8be787c5f533bed8f26f738c3ed25946e4f"}}, "hash": "891420f5987aae540defdf49d057f8be787c5f533bed8f26f738c3ed25946e4f", "text": "to community needs and more service oriented. In community policing, it is important to ensure the involvement of women and a diverse representation from the community. It is also important to ensure that checks are in place to prevent abuses of power. Further, there is a need to ensure that community groups do not inappropriately become substitutes for official law enforcement, and that members are properly trained and monitored in their new roles. \ufffdDialogue and baseline surveys. Based on the above points, UNDP entry points to improve human rights within the police force could include strategies to encourage dialogue with government and police authorities. Other initiatives could include the development of baseline surveys of citizens\u2019perceptions about policing and the police service. Greater involvement of local governments in formulating crime prevention policies (along with oversight functions) can also improve police services and encourage them to be responsive to the needs of the local community. \ufffdModel police stations. Strategies to develop \u201cmodel police stations\u201d that can function as lead agencies in demonstrating how pro- people policing can benefit the community can be undertaken. In India, such initiatives have included the development of training- of-trainers programmes on good policing directed at potential \u201cchange agents\u201d, who are then given the responsibility of moving the change agenda forward in their respective police stations. Enhanced professionalism and service orientation \ufffdPublic administration reform interventions. Increasing professionalism can result in a stronger adherence to human rights standards. Professionalism within the ranks of the police can be increased through training as well as public administration reform. Regular public administration reform interventions contribute to the performance of the police by strengthening management, IT-systems, financial capacity and strategic planning. \ufffdHuman resources. To strengthen the management of human resources in the police force, strategies could include support for revision of recruitment processes, modernization of training curricula, development of professional trainers and police instructors, and development of quality training modules and training materials. To improve leadership in the police, extensive leadership training programmes could also be supported.Any strategy directed at improving the performance of the police should ideally be backed by the institutionalization of effective complaint mechanisms to monitor activities and performance of police services. \ufffdImproving work conditions.Initiatives directed at improving incentive structures and working conditions for police could also be supported. Pay, work conditions and allowances for police officers need to better reflect the complexities and challenges of their work. Promotion and career prospects for capable officers should also be increased and organization and rank structures should be flattened to more accurately reflect contemporary policing practice. Establishing a separate pay commission for law-enforcing agencies could be an inception strategy in this area.In order to reduce human rights violations and inappropriate working conditions for police staff, it is crucial that police practices are demilitarized \u2013 both in terms of organizational structure, function, and the type of training and weapons they are provide with. Community Policing in India Community policing is characterized by greater interaction between communities, the police and local governments in formulating and evaluating strategies for crime prevention and reaction. In India, several innovative community-policing efforts have been supported by UNDP. For example, members of some residential colonies conduct joint patrols with the police, facilitating communication and interaction between the two groups.This type of police-community interaction helps not only in combating crime, but also improves relations between the two groups and helps to increase the level of trust in the police. 128 Programming for Justice: Access for All \ufffdStrengthening of investigation processes. To address inadequacies in criminal investigations, there is a need to strengthen investigation processes. Improving criminal investigation can help in fighting impunity in all fields, such as human rights violations,police abuses, corruption and also common crimes. Impunity leads to a lack of confidence in both the police and the judicial system. Strategies could include: \ufffd Support for an adequate legal and policy framework, including respect for human rights in the course of criminal investigations, greatly increased technical and managerial competency and improved equipment and physical facilities.69 \ufffdExamining of intelligence-gathering methods, which are critical to crime investigations and ensuring that they follow human rights standards. \ufffdCoordination between intelligence agencies and the police and clear demarcation of jurisdiction and authority of the different agencies. \ufffdEnsuring access to the police at regional and local levels. Police services should not just be available in important urban centres but should be made available in remote areas and at the village level as well. Better police force deployment is an important means of ensuring improved access to law enforcement.

Effective and independent monitoring and evaluation of reform progress is also essential. For example, a programme for police reform can focus on capacity development to enable police to effectively perform their duties. A well-designed and implemented programme based on a larger access to justice and human rights framework can make a meaningful contribution to improving the image, efficiency and effectiveness of the police as a service provider and protector of human rights.It can also act as a means through which states can implement international human rights obligations they have ratified. 4.5.2 PRISONS The nature of prisons and of prison systems varies from country to country. The UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Rule 8) requires segregation of prisoners by sex, age, criminal record, the legal reason for their detention and necessities of their treatment. More specifically,men should be separated from women, untried prisoners should be separated from convicted prisoners, persons imprisoned for debt and other civil prisoners should be separated from persons imprisoned by reason of a criminal offence and young prisoners should have their own facilities. In the domain of criminal justice, prisons are used to incarcerate convicted criminals, but also to house those charged with, or likely to be charged with an offence. Custodial sentences are sanctions, which are authorized by law for a range of offences. A court may order the incarceration of an individual found guilty of such offences.Individuals may also be committed to prison by a court before being tried in court, generally because the court determines that there is a risk to society or a risk of absconding prior to a trial taking place. Incarceration is designed to mitigate the likelihood of individuals committing offences: thus prisons are in part about the punishment of individuals who transgress statutory boundaries. Prisons also serve to protect by removing individuals from society, who are likely to pose a threat to others. Prisons can also have a rehabilitative role in seeking to change the nature of individuals in order to reduce the likelihood that they will re-offend upon release. Prisons and Access to Justice The concept of imprisonment from a human rights perspective is complex,since by definition,keeping people in prison infringes on one of the most fundamental human rights \u2013 the right to liberty.70 From a human rights perspective, imprisonment must be guided by the following three principles: \ufffdAny infringement of a person\u2019s liberty should only be a last resort and options for non-custodial alternatives should always be exhausted; \ufffdImprisonment should only be utilized in criminal matters and in strict accordance with international law related to securing prisoners\u2019 rights and consistent with the presumption of innocence; \ufffdDefendants should be granted release pendingtrial and excessive use of pre-trial detention should be avoided.71 69 Principles 22-26,Basic principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.

The court is also empowered to review the continuance of a prisoner\u2019s detention and it can have an important role with respect to the re-entry of prisoners into society. In some countries, the legal framework enables prisoners to petition the Supreme Court when they have a grievance with respect to their imprisonment, giving prisoners an important forum for the enforcement of their rights. Once imprisoned, all persons deprived of their liberty should be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.72 The rights of prisoners are protected through various international law instruments The International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) prohibits", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffd1a5da-04e1-4b88-a7b2-c94a3e32769a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ffd1a5da-04e1-4b88-a7b2-c94a3e32769a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7177cf5ccc0fefcdb298c2daa1ae214342f3e11f304d8ff0f6077cf26a1db515"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5389d2e-ebcf-4597-94f3-d86f572479c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "182277ff70d9170ea7a8d754e414609695e32703826ca1f5307a7be4b4c1d9f1"}}, "hash": "b7c284077b561fdc78b9076f84cd242f7052e89fa19aecd41dd009e8f4f0c18a", "text": "torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, without exception or derogation.

Several international legal instruments specify the rights of prisoners and the duties of the prison administration of which the most important ones are: \ufffdStandard Minimum Rules for Treatment of Prisoners \ufffdBasic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners \ufffdBody of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment \ufffdUnited Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-Custodial Measures [The Tokyo Rules] Despite these legal instruments, violations of prisoners\u2019human rights remain of great concern in all regions and most countries in the world. From an access to justice point of view, this is particularly concerning, since the large majority of prisoners come from disadvantaged groups who, due to imprisonment, are further marginalized and made vulnerable. Prisons have an important role to play as an institution of the integrated justice system. They act as a mechanism to hold lawbreakers responsible for their actions, thereby protecting citizens against violations of their rights. The actions and duties of prison staff are directly linked to the rights of prisoners, therefore, any prison reform intervention should look at both securing the rights of prisoners and the capacity of prison staff to fulfil their duties. Challenges in Ensuring Access to Justice within the Prisons System Outdated prison and penal legislation Outdated prison and penal legislation govern the administration of prisons in many countries. In Bangladesh, for example, the Penal Code dates back to 1860. Such legislation tends to favour confinement and safe custody through punitive measures, with few alternative mechanisms to imprisonment, such as rehabilitation and social reintegration or parole/probation and community service. Excessive use of pre-trial detention Even though the international legal framework prescribes strict criteria for the use of pre-trial detention, the laws of many countries lack the necessary mechanisms for granting pre-trial release. Excessive use of pre-trial detention often leads to detainees being imprisoned for years before having their case processed.73 In some countries, un-sentenced prisoners make up the majority of the prison population. 72 This is articulated in Article 9(3) of the ICCPR.Interpreting this provision,the UN Human Rights Committee has ruled that detention before trial should be used only to the extent it is lawful,reasonable and necessary.Necessity is defined narrowly:\u201cto prevent fight,interference with evidence of the recurrence of crime\u201dor \u201cwhere the person concerned constitutes a clear and serious threat to society which cannot be contained in any other manner.\u201d 73 See Human Rights Watch [http://www.hrw.org/prisons/pretrial.html] for a discussion on excessive pretrial detention. Francies Corale Mullin vs.the Administrator In India,the right of prisoners\u2019to file a petition with the Supreme Court has led to some landmark judgments. One such judgment is the case of \u201cFrancies Corale Mullin vs.the Administrator,Union Territory of Delhi & Others\u201d in which the Supreme Court explained the elements of personal liberty under the Indian Constitution (Act 21). The case arose because the detainee\u2019s access to his family was restricted to one visit a month and he was only allowed to meet his lawyer in the presence of an officer of the Customs Department. The Supreme Court ruled that the right to life and liberty included his right to live with human dignity and therefore the detainee was entitled to have interviews with family members, friends and lawyers without such severe restrictions. 130 Programming for Justice: Access for All Disqualification from provisional liberty In some countries, large categories of prisoners \u2013 such as persons charged with drug crimes or crimes of violence, or repeat offenders \u2013 may be disqualified from obtaining relief under the terms of provisional liberty. Excessive imprisonment for petty crimes Imprisonment is often used for offenders such as civil debtors,fine defaulters and those who commit petty crimes, who should ideally be dealt with through non-custodial options.As a result,the num- ber of people imprisoned has dramatically increased in recent times. 74 Violent and discriminatory practices Violent and/or discriminatory practices in prisons towards certain groups of disadvantaged people such as women, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), children and juveniles, minority groups, people with disabilities,people with mental illness- es, drug addicts, etc., are a general concern in the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5389d2e-ebcf-4597-94f3-d86f572479c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5389d2e-ebcf-4597-94f3-d86f572479c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7177cf5ccc0fefcdb298c2daa1ae214342f3e11f304d8ff0f6077cf26a1db515"}, "2": {"node_id": "ffd1a5da-04e1-4b88-a7b2-c94a3e32769a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7c284077b561fdc78b9076f84cd242f7052e89fa19aecd41dd009e8f4f0c18a"}}, "hash": "182277ff70d9170ea7a8d754e414609695e32703826ca1f5307a7be4b4c1d9f1", "text": "Poor prison administration and lack of professionalism Poor administration of prison services leads to poor provision of services and entitlements and exacerbates the poor physical and psychological conditions in many prisons.A contributing factor in this is the inadequate training given to many prison staff.

Lack of professionalism also stems from low pay, poor entitlements, limited career and capacity development opportunities. These factors lead to demoralization, lack of incentive and low levels of professional pride. In addition, high staff turnover in prisons prevents systems and procedures from functioning smoothly and efficiently. Lack of accountability and oversight mechanisms A lack of mechanisms to monitor prison conditions effectively and ensure accountability in respect to human rights is a general phenomenon. Prison administrations are generally reluctant to open up prisons and the situation of prisoners to public scrutiny. Inadequate access to information The lack of transparency and accountability is exacerbated by the fact that it is difficult to get access to reliable information on the situation of prisoners, data on the number of pre-trial detainees, the health of prisoners and accurate prison records, etc. Maintaining complete, accurate and regularly updated records is crucial for ensuring respect for human rights of prisoners. 75 Poor prison conditions Lack of access to adequate food and drinking water can constitute a human rights violation. Severe overcrowding can lead to low physical standards in terms of floor space, ceiling height, lighting and ventilation. Access to private and hygienic sanitation in the cell and opportunities to use external sanitation is not always available when necessary. Basic health care facilities are generally not available for people with mental illness, people living with HIV/AIDS and pregnant women, leading to deterioration of a prisoner\u2019s general health as well as contributing to the spread of tuberculosis, hepatitis and HIV/AIDS. In addition, poor conditions can also lead to criminal offences within prisons and additional violation of human rights. For example, lack of separate facilities for women and juvenile inmates may expose them to sexual abuse and violence. Insufficient coordination and knowledge sharing Insufficient coordination and knowledge sharing between justice actors such as the police, courts and prisons can lead to ineffective processing of criminal cases. In some countries, the escort of prisoners to court is the responsibility of the police and when there is a lack of cooperation between the police and the courts and/or the prisons, this 74 Penal Reform International and International Centre for Prison Studies.A New Agenda for Penal Reform - International Penal Reform Conference. Royal Holloway College,University of London,Surrey,United Kingdom.12-17 April 1999.[www.penalreform.org/english/models_egham.htm]. 75 See Principle 12 of the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment (General Assembly Resolution 43/173,9 December 1988) and Rule 7 of the Standard of Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.(Adopted by the First United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders,Geneva 1955,and approved by the Economic and Social Council in resolution 663 (XXIV),31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977). The Process of Imprisonment \u2013 The Short Story When an individual has been arrested by police,he or she must be brought promptly before a judicial authority, such as a judge, whose function is to assess whether a legal reason exists for that person\u2019s arrest. The period of time between the arrest and the presentation before a magistrate depends on the national legal framework. During this period the defendant may be held in police custody.Once presented before a judge,the judge then determines the necessity of pre-trial detention for the person and the preliminary charge and detention order is issued or the person is released. Depending on the law pertaining to the offence, the defendant may file an application for bail, but if it is not granted, the defendant becomes a remand prisoner and the custody is usually transferred from the police to the prison authorities. According to international standards, remand prisoners are to be kept separate from convicted prisoners. All individuals who are charged with a criminal offence are entitled to be tried within a reasonable time. If the person is found guilty and sentenced to incarceration, he or she then becomes a convicted prisoner and will be transferred to a regular prison. The type of prison usually depends on the type of conviction. 131 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies can lead to delays and bottlenecks within the sys- tem. Lack of coordination can also increase the risk of unlawful deprivation of liberty, as information about legal status with respect to documents regulating the enforcement of judgments may be inaccessible. In addition, lack of infrastructure, adequate transport and adequate means of communication between the different agencies can also pose as barriers.

Therefore, there is a need for better preparation for release and training of prisoners to assist them to live as normal a life as possible within their society following their release. Widespread corruption in the penal system This can lead to discrimination,impunity,inefficiency and increased human rights violations. For example, living conditions of prisoners are likely to vary according to their ability to bribe prison officials and reform initiatives are less likely to succeed due to resistance from people who are privileged through corrupt practices. Special consideration for disadvantaged groups Many of the problems outlined above are exacerbated for disadvantaged groups. Therefore, the protection of these groups needs particular attention in prison reform interventions. See Chapter 6 for further strategies. Capacity Development Strategies to Enhance Access to Justice within the Prisons Normative legal framework-penal legislation (also see Chapter 3) \ufffdAdvocate for a revision of provisional liberty laws since they often do not contain provisions to ensure that persons charged with drug crimes or crimes of violence are eligible for provisional release. Further, they often do not allow judges to grant pre-trial release for non-bailable offences.76 Since poor people are generally at an disadvantage even when liberal bail acts are in place,advocacy efforts could also be directed at strengthening or introducing the practice of granting bail on personal recognizance. Reviews of the power and practice of arrest and detention by the police could also be undertaken to address the habit of exaggerated arrests. \ufffdReview of penal legislation. The reform of the formal legal framework should also address the revision of penal legislation to ensure enhanced emphasis on rehabilitation and social reintegration. \ufffdLimit pre-trail detention. Support should also be provided for legislative reforms to discourage and limit pre-trial detention. \ufffdEstablish clear disciplinary rules and procedures. Clear disciplinary rules and procedures that apply to convicted persons within the prisons should be established. The lack of clear disciplinary rules (or inappropriate disciplinary rules) could be a source of abuse and human rights violations. Building coalitions for reforms \ufffdReform in the prison system should be seen as part of a larger justice reform agenda where the cooperation and involvement of other judicial actors such as the police, the court system, paralegal institutions, etc., is extremely important. Moreover, civil society involvement should be addressed. See other sections on Police, Courts, NHRIs, Civil Society Oversight, etc. in this chapter. \ufffdEngage the media, civil society, government and parliamentarians in building partnerships to strengthen the reform agenda and support pressure from below. This could include initiating dialogue on how to hold perpetrators of human rights violations in the prison system accountable for their actions (see the section on Civil Society for more information). Strengthen accountability of the prison system \ufffdAddress corruption in the prison system by enhancing transparency and accountability, externally as well as internally. Support could be given to the development of an internal complaints mechanism which would give prisoners an opportunity to register their grievances and report on any human rights violations taking place.These mechanisms are mandatory under international human rights instruments.77 It is necessary to ensure that these mechanisms ensure anonymity to avoid prisoners being penalized for lodging complaints. External accountability measures could include the introduction of processes by which prisoners can appeal directly to the court. Further, support should be given to the establishment/strengthening of mechanisms 76 See Human Rights Watch [http://www.hrw.org/prisons/pretrial.html] for a discussion on excessive pretrial detention. 77 See Principle 33 of the Body of Principles for the Protection of All persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment and Rule 36 of the Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.(General Assembly Resolution 43/173,9 December 1988) 132 Programming for Justice: Access for All to ensure that any deaths,disappearances,and serious injuries of persons while in custody (or shortly after the termination of detention or imprisonment) are thoroughly investigated.78 Also see the sub-section on Accountability and Integrity in the section on The Court System in this chapter. \ufffdOngoing monitoring by civil society, i.e., community groups, NGOs, para-legal institutions, National Human Rights Institutions and media, is essential for the protection of prisoners from ill-treatment and for the promotion of decent detention conditions. Support should be given to these actors in the development and strengthening of monitoring programmes in prisons. Such monitoring programmes have been developed in India and Cambodia, where NGOs have established visiting schemes for regular consultations with the inmates. 79 Civilian participation in prison commissions \ufffdAdministrative capacity and the performance of prison officials. \ufffdSupport for material improvements in prison facilities and conditions. \ufffdSupport the development of prison regulations according to international standards as well as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d32da5ef-fe02-48b0-abbe-64836f874be7": {"__data__": {"id_": "d32da5ef-fe02-48b0-abbe-64836f874be7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51082397b417b4d46d5dd03768c0f46ecfce59380886fd39d71f3fbfa58ca507"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5818414-8fda-484c-8f06-ad4049d5d7bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3115265fee85047e0245cb1ea16a43a76f2cc092c25fcd60eccda1ddc0b85be8"}}, "hash": "77ea6f19865f02791e829b7eb71c4e8532bcb578694cddce1ecebd844a8cdb0f", "text": "the development of job descriptions and a code of conduct for prison staff with clear guidelines for disciplinary proceedings for misconduct etc. Initiatives in this area could also include management training for prison staff. \ufffdSupport the development and implementation of training and sensitization the programmes in the areas of human rights and gender to counter the widespread discrimination against disadvantage groups in prison. Gender sensitivity and respect for human rights needs to be infused into all aspects of training from training on administrative tasks to the use of force by correctional officers. \ufffdSupport the creation of effective, merit-based and transparent recruitment mechanisms, and the establishment of career development plans as a means of developing pride in, and loyalty to, the prison service and responsibility for the duties within the system. Also, recruitment of female correctional officers and those from minority and other disadvantaged groups is also recommended. \ufffdSupport the development of communication and information-sharing mechanisms between all criminal justice system agencies and stakeholders such as police, prison officials, judiciary, bar association, probation and welfare service, health service, local leaders, defence counsel and directorate of public prosecutions. \ufffdStrengthen the IT-capacity of prisons by supporting the development of prison databases in which important court dates and details of sentences can be registered. In relation to this, it is also important to restrict access to the information by developing clear guidelines on who can retrieve confidential information. In cases where IT resources are absent or limited, support should be given to the development of manual record-keeping procedures to ensure that accurate, complete and regularly updated data regarding prisoners is maintained. Rehabilitation of prisoners and restorative justice \ufffdDevelop prisoners\u2019 rehabilitation agencies and livelihood programmes.80 This could be done by supporting coordination activities between health and psycho-social welfare, vocational training and educational departments. The purpose and justification of imprisonment is ultimately to protect society against crime. This end can only be achieved if the period of imprisonment is used to ensure that upon their return to society, the offender is able to lead a law-abiding and self-supporting life. \ufffdRestorative justice is a systematic response to wrongdoing that emphasizes healing the wounds of victims,offenders and communities caused or revealed by criminal behaviour. Support could be given to practices and programmes responding to crime through interventions directed at victim-offender reconciliation/mediation, victim assistance, ex-offender assistance, restitution81, and community service.82 Strategies in this area could also support the integration of the principles of \u201crestorative justice\u201d into the curriculum of law schools/academies and other educational institutions. As imprisonment generally has damaging rather than constructive consequences, restorative justice 78 See principle 34 of the Body Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of detention or Imprisonment.(General Assembly Resolution 43/173,9 December 1988) 79 For more see Common Wealth Human Rights Initiative in India [http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/programs/aj/prisons/prisons.htm],and the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights [http://www.licadho.org/programs/monitoringoffice.php]. 80 There are good examples of initiatives involving civil society in prisoner rehabilitation initiatives such as the UNDP programme on judicial reforms in the Philippines,which facilitates the reintegration of offenders into the community after their release by allowing people who can relate their own life experience with the inmates to visit the prison.[http://www.undp.org/dpa/choices/2004/march/philippines.html]. 81 In its traditional sense,restitution has been defined as a monetary payment by the offender to the victim for harm reasonably resulting from the offence.However,restitution can embody both monetary payments and in-kind services to the victim. 82 For more information on restorative justice,see [http://www.restorativejustice.org]. 133 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies mechanisms should be explored and adopted in appropriate instances as a preferred form of criminal justice bearing in mind the right of both victims and community. See also the section on Informal Justice Systems in this chapter. Advocate for support to non-custodial alternatives \ufffdAlternative dispute resolution provides options that may take disputes out of the penal justice arena and thereby can help to limit punitive measures and reduce the number of arrests. Therefore, potential ADR options should be explored and supported. See also the section on Informal Justice Systems in this chapter.

Legal aid and legal awareness \ufffdInitiate activities to provide legal aid to prisoners, as prisoners on remand may be innocent or they may have been held in prison longer than the possible penalty for the offence they are charged with.Legal aid can be supported through links with bar associations, lawyers associations and legal aid clinics etc. These groups can provide support in submit ting bail applications and expediting trial. The Government also needs to fulfil its responsibility and ensure that prisoners who do not have counsel of their own choice (particularly when they cannot afford it) are assigned a counsel to assist them. 83 \ufffdEnsure that prisoners are aware of their rights and entitlements. It is equally important the prisoners themselves are aware of their rights and entitlements vis-\u00e0-vis the criminal justice processes and judicial agencies. All prisoners have a fundamental right to be informed.84 The development of legal iteracy programmes for prisoners should, therefore, be supported. Besides training, this could include the preparation of manuals to be used as guidelines as well as literacy work on the ground by NGOs or paralegal institutions. See the Civil Society Oversight section earlier in this chapter. Focus programme interventions on disadvantaged groups It is necessary to recognize that it is often the poor and the most disadvantaged that are found in prisons. Often the more advantaged parts of society will find a way to avoid imprisonment and it is usually people who may not have been able to afford lawyers or those who may not be aware of their rights that are imprisoned. It is not uncommon to find people who may be innocent or those who have not been sentenced to languish in prisons for long periods of time.As a disproportionate number of prisoners are from disadvantaged groups, UNDP needs to engage in reforming the prison system to ensure that it follows international standards that discourage discrimination as well as protects and guarantees the rights of prisoners. 83 See Principle 17 of the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment (General Assembly Resolution 43/173,9 December 1988) and Rule 43 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Adopted by the First United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders,Geneva 1955,and approved by the Economic and Social Council in resolution 663 (XXIV),31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977). 84 See Principle 13 of the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention (General Assembly Resolution 43/173,9 December 1988) or Imprisonment and Rule 35 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Adopted by the First United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders,Geneva 1955,and approved by the Economic and Social Council in resolution 663 (XXIV),31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977). 5 CAPACITY TO DEMAND JUSTICE REMEDIES C H A P T E R Overview of the Chapter 5.1 Legal Empowerment 5.2 Legal Awareness 5.3 Legal Aid and Counsel CHAPTER 5 1 For an extensive overview of legal empowerment in development efforts see Golub,S.2003.\u201cBeyond Rule of Law Orthodoxy:The Legal Empowerment Alternative\u201d.

OVERVIEW OF THE CHAPTER This chapter deals with activities aimed at strengthening people\u2019s capacities to seek out and demand justice remedies.Such activities are referred to as \u201clegal empowerment\u201dstrategies.1 Legal empowerment of disadvantaged people is necessary to complement activities under the other two areas of the access to justice service line - normative protection and capacity to provide justice remedies (see Chapter 3 and 4). However, legal empowerment can also have a beneficial impact beyond access to justice. For example, when people have adequate capacities to seek justice, they are better able to hold government officials accountable for the implementation of the law, and to participate in governance processes. Justice remedies are not always available, yet even when they are available, either formally or informally, people may not always make use of them. This section examines the critical capacities needed to seek a remedy through the justice system, focusing particularly on poor and disadvantaged people. Capacities needed include: \ufffd Legal awareness, including effective access to legal information, and particularly government obligations to provide legal awareness. \ufffd Legal aid and specific strategies to strengthen access to it, including improving legal education while expanding services for the poor, strengthening", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac0aeda5-739a-4325-8056-73de18210c65": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac0aeda5-739a-4325-8056-73de18210c65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4fda42c68e02f4b4e55d8a97deace411cd15465fdc3a1cdbebb4d1fda9f4ca43"}}, "hash": "4fda42c68e02f4b4e55d8a97deace411cd15465fdc3a1cdbebb4d1fda9f4ca43", "text": "public defence systems, promoting pro bono lawyering, expanding paralegal activities,supporting alternative lawyering and developmental legal aid and expanding the concept of legal aid to include other necessary forms of financial and psycho-social support. \ufffd Other necessary capacities to seek justice include the ability to overcome external obstacles at institutional and structural levels, as well as factors specific to poor and disadvantaged groups themselves. Chapter 5: Capacity to Demand Justice Remedies 137 137 137 5.1 LEGAL EMPOWERMENT Legal empowerment2 is central to people\u2019s ability to seek and demand remedies from the justice system. Different strategies can be adopted to ensure that people, especially those from disadvantaged groups,have the means to demand justice. Empowering people by strengthening their capacity to demand justice remedies can have a substantial impact on poverty reduction and on overall institutional accountability. Legal empowerment has the potential to not only reduce poverty and improve the material circumstances of poor and disadvantaged groups, but studies show that legal empowerment also impacts other important development issues. For example,legal empowerment can contribute to the reduction of domestic violence, the successful implementation of land reform programmes, and so on. Legal empowerment helps to mobilize disadvantaged people\u2019s participation in development and decision-making processes. This in turn helps to improve responsiveness and accountability in the system. It is important, however, that access to justice strategies include legal empowerment-related components systematically, particularly when trying to strengthen accountability of institutions. Challenges to Enhancing Legal Empowerment Improving people\u2019s capacity to seek a remedy Education and training alone is not sufficient to develop effective capacities to demand justice remedies. Education must go hand-in-hand with other strategies, such as community development, advocacy, mediation and litigation. Education is an important component in legal empowerment and can increase awareness,but it needs to be part of a broader legal empowerment strategy. Integrating legal empowerment strategies Poor and disadvantaged people\u2019s capacity to seek remedies is affected by a number of factors that need to be addressed through an integrated approach. A legal awareness campaign that does not take into account the constraints of the formal legal system, or the difficulty of obtaining an institutional response, or the insecurity in which disadvantaged people live, is likely to have a very limited effect at best. Integration can be strengthened in two ways: \ufffdLinking actors at different levels, from government institutions, non-governmental organizations, universities and communities; \ufffdBuilding on existing development activities, such as micro-credit schemes, family planning or land reform. Strengthening community-level capacity Obstacles at the community level are the most immediate factors preventing people from seeking justice. They are also often the most critical obstacles and the ones most easily addressed by affected groups. For UNDP, decentralization provides an opportunity to engage local government in legal empowerment initiatives. Similarly, coordinating various actors\u2019 efforts at national and local levels can result in the greatest impact for community-led initiatives. Sustaining legal empowerment initiatives Legal empowerment initiatives are not easily sustainable (especially from an organizational point of view), but they can achieve sustainable impact. Legal empowerment strategies usually require a long-term perspective, but legal services 2 The lessons and recommendations in this section are gathered from experiences of UNDP, the Asian Development Bank, the Ford Foundation, the International Council on Human Rights Policy,the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,and other development agencies.

However, sustainability is not necessarily critical in all circumstances. Legal empowerment activities can take place in response to specific problems or in the context of ongoing development activities. They can also be oriented toward ensuring accountability in programme implementation, by enhancing people\u2019s capacity to understand and act on their responsibilities under the programme and under relevant regulations and laws. Therefore, sustainability of impact may be achieved even in the absence of organizational sustainability.

NGO partnerships and NGO-Government cooperation can also produce significant impact. Cross-cutting measures are necessary The complexity of obstacles constraining the capacity of disadvantaged people to seek remedies requires different responses in different areas. Cross-practice development is necessary to ensure a meaningful and comprehensive legal empowerment effort. Further, legal empowerment strategies may impact on a wide range of non-legal development activities, and for this reason should be mainstreamed into ongoing development efforts. Table 8 summarizes some of the obstacles affecting people\u2019s capacity to seek remedies beyond legal aid and awareness: Obstacles Affecting Poor and Disadvantaged People\u2019s Capacities to Seek Remedies External Obstacles External obstacles can be found at the institutional level or within the economic, social and political structures in which people and institutions operate.Distinguishing institutional obstacles from structural obstacles is often difficult, as they are closely related. Underlying both may be a lack of political will to address such problems. Institutional Obstacles \ufffdNormative/institutional bias and discrimination. Institutions and legal and policy frameworks may reflect the perspectives of powerful groups and may be inadequate for the specific needs and circumstances of disadvantaged people. \ufffdInadequacy of formal structures. Even when disadvantaged groups may be aware of their rights, they may be unwilling to claim them using formal structures. These structures may often seem alien and intimidating to them, as well as distant, corrupt and costly. \ufffdWeak accountability systems. Accountability mechanisms within the justice system are sometimes weak or even on occasions, nonexistent.This lack of accountability may be aggravated by poor coordination among agencies and a culture of corruption, patronage or nepotism. Structural Obstacles \ufffdGrowing inequalities, invisibility and disempowerment. Social, political and economic structures at national and international levels may favour the \u2018better-off\u2019 and neglect the disadvantaged, resulting in further disempowerment. Inequality reinforces disadvantaged people\u2019s exclusion Table 8: Obstacles Affecting Poor and Disadvantaged People\u2019s Capacities to Seek Remedies Beyond Legal Aid and Awareness EXTERNAL OBSTACLES Institutional Structural \ufffd Normative/institutional bias and discrimination \ufffd Growing inequalities, invisibility and disempowerment \ufffd Isolation \ufffd Inadequacy of formal structures \ufffd Social discrimination \ufffd Illegality \ufffd Weak accountability systems \ufffd Growing insecurity \ufffd Weak organizational capacities \ufffd Technical and financial constraints \ufffd Culture of impunity \ufffd Technical and financial constraints \ufffd Corruption, patronage, nepotism \ufffd Insecurity INTERNAL OBSTACLES Chapter 5: Capacity to Demand Justice Remedies 139 139 139 139 from, or invisibility in, government programmes and activities and from the development process. They are often excluded from decision-making processes that impact on their lives, seen as \u201cothers,\u201d or only paid lip service in participatory forums. 3 \ufffdSocial discrimination. Many people find themselves excluded from access to justice without necessarily being poor. They may be discriminated against for reasons that have more to do with the attitudes and beliefs of those around them \u2013 e.g., discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, or religious groups. Often, an effect of discrimination is to increase vulnerability to poverty. \ufffdGrowing insecurity. Since the 1990s, the world has experienced a concerning rise in threats to individual security and safety, such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, environmental hazards, terrorism, violent conflict and other threats to security. These prevent disadvantaged people from taking risks in seeking justice, while further eroding the already insecure contexts in which they live. \ufffdCulture of impunity. A prevailing culture of impunity discourages poor and disadvantaged people from seeking justice. Sometimes a single conviction may be more effective than a large-scale training in obtaining attitudinal change within the system. \ufffdCorruption, patronage, nepotism. Corruption may occur at any level of governance, justice or legal enforcement. Corruption within the justice system is a powerful impediment to people seeking remedies for grievances and further alienates those who do not have the resources or networks to engage in corruption and benefit from it. Patronage systems are another strong disincentive, as services that should be available to all as a matter of right are converted into \u201cfavours\u201d based on kinship, personal networks, indebtedness or political affiliation.

The majority of the poor live in rural areas at great distance and remoteness from justice remedies. Other internal obstacles \ufffdIllegality. Sometimes a contradiction exists between the ideal of the rule of law and the reality of poverty. As a result, poor and disadvantaged groups often find themselves in situations of \u201cillegality\u201d, for example, informal labour, immigration, indigenous practices, that alienate them further from the justice system. Illegality also makes them vulnerable to abuses in the context of campaigns to counter criminality and strengthen national security. This can, in turn, aggravate existing social conflicts,as poor and disadvantaged groups in developing countries may have a weak notion of the State and of the nation. \ufffdInsecurity. Disadvantaged people often live in situations of high insecurity (physical, psychological, social and economic), in which they cannot afford to take risks or require immediate benefits when they do so. Insecurity also makes them vulnerable to risks resulting from asserting their rights, such as threats, job dismissal, lawsuits or deportation. Similarly, those living within politically oppressive systems or in situations of violent conflict may decide not to claim their rights, simply as a survival strategy. \ufffdWeak organizational capacities. Because of historical oppression, disadvantaged groups may lack a culture of self-organization for collective claims. They may also mistrust outsiders and have low expectations of the benefits of participation. Although informal structures of self-organization may exist, these too may also be hampered by discrimination, patronage and nepotism. Lack of networking with other organizations at the local, national and meso-levels can limit organizational effectiveness as well. \ufffdTechnical and financial constraints. Technical and financial limitations are powerful impediments to seeking access to justice, and often result in denials of justice for those who do not understand or cannot afford long, costly, complex and cumbersome processes of justice. 3 International Council on Human Rights Policy (ICHRP).2004.\u201cEnhancing Access to Human Rights\u201d.Geneva,Switzerland. 140 Programming for Justice Access for All Capacity Development Strategies to Facilitate Legal Empowerment Ensure short-term benefits within long-term strategies Risks are involved in seeking justice. Due to the insecurity in which disadvantaged people live,their ability to take risks is limited, and they require immediate benefits when they do so. Therefore, strategies aimed at strengthening their capacity to seek remedies also should deliver immediate and useful benefits for the communities concerned. Strategies that depend on taking cases to court, or engaging in processes of legal or institutional reform, are unlikely to attract the attention or the support of very poor communities, unless they are accompanied by actions that bring immediate, tangible results that increase the security of their lives. 4 Build on collective organization and action Poor and disadvantaged people may know their rights but remain powerless unless they work together to assert common interests or to protect members of their group.Organization is power,and acting as a group may be critical if they wish to assert their rights effectively and obtain a response from government. Building on community organization and partnership is an effective entry point for legal empowerment, once the group has achieved a certain degree of acceptance and cohesion in the community.Similarly,strengthening national and regional mobilization of government and non-government actors can help in the push for fundamental reforms. Focus on justice systems preferred by poor and disadvantaged people The capacity to seek justice remedies can be strengthened by allowing disadvantaged people to use their own preferred system of justice, if feasible. These systems may include those based on traditional or informal mechanisms. Litigation may be considered as a last resort for people distrustful of the justice system. Strategies, therefore, should include a combination of judicial and non-judicial forums (see Informal Justice Systems in Chapter 4). Expand the role of non-lawyers Lawyers\u2019 and their technical skills are important components of access to justice; however, non-professionals can also play a significant role. For example, the use of paralegals rather than lawyers can often improve cost effectiveness, quality of communication, and accessibility for disadvantaged people. Allow programme innovation and experimentation Assessments show there is no standard \u201cbest practice\u201dfor legal empowerment and that the most effective strategy depends on the specific needs of the group targeted. Therefore, the involvement of target groups in programme design and decision-making is critical for impact and success (see Chapters 1 and 2). Legal empowerment strategies are quite new for many development institutions and should ensure that they allow for experimentation and learning.

Therefore, there is a need to examine the risks and costs of strengthening people\u2019s capacity to claim rights. A practical assessment of risks should be undertaken by poor and disadvantaged people themselves. 5.2 LEGAL AWARENESS Legal awareness is critical to seeking justice. Poor and disadvantaged people often do not make use of laws, rights and government services because they simply do not know about them. This following section deals with strategies to expand legal awareness, and the responsibilities of government in expanding awareness. Legal awareness is only one element of legal empowerment, but it is an important one. The degree of a person\u2019s legal awareness can affect their perception of the law and its relevance to them, as well as influencing their decisions on whether and how to claim their rights. Access to legal counsel and other forms of legal aid can increase an individual\u2019s legal awareness and assist them to make informed decisions and choices (see section on Legal Aid later in this chapter). Lack of legal awareness is a powerful impediment to those seeking access to justice. Those who are subject to grievances cannot seek a remedy unless they are aware that such a remedy exists. For awareness to be present,sufficient information has to reach people in ways they can understand. Governments have an essential role to play in making this information available. 4 Garling,M.2003.\u201cEnhancing Access to Human Rights: Draft Report\u201d.International Council on Human Rights Policy. Chapter 5: Capacity to Demand Justice Remedies 141 141 141 141 Strategies to promote legal awareness may be undertaken by both government and non- government actors. In the case of government, ensuring timely access to legal information when it is sought is a fundamental duty of all agencies and departments at all levels (local, regional and national) and in all branches of government (legislative,executive and judicial).However,such a fundamental duty is often not defended at constitutional or legislative levels.In contrast,some institutions have specific mandates to promote awareness on laws and rights, for example, National Human Rights Institutions and electoral commissions, but sometimes these agencies have inadequate capacities to carry out their functions in this regard. Non-government actors undertake legal awareness activities in different ways. They may establish legal clinics or legal aid centres, or they may conduct awareness raising campaigns at the community level, or through the use of mass media. Although they may be able to provide information targeted explicitly at disadvantaged groups, non-government actors face substantial obstacles such as uncoordinated efforts, dispersion, weak sustainability of initiatives, and limitations on large-scale impacts. Challenges to Enhancing Legal Awareness Lack of communications policies and procedures A lack of sound communication policies and procedures within government agencies can be an obstacle that prevents citizens from understanding their entitlements regarding government services. It also reduces their awareness of new laws and legislation which may be relevant to them, and constrains their ability to monitor the Government\u2019s performance. There may also be an absence of normative provisions regarding access to information. Reluctance to provide information Governments may be reluctant to assist access to information on issues that they do not consider in the public interest or regard as sensitive information, for example, data on the jail population, HIV/AIDS and so forth. Lack of outreach of legal awareness campaigns If legal awareness campaigns stop at the middle level and do not reach down to the grassroots and community levels, they will be unable to reach the entire community especially the most disadvantaged. Awareness programmes should, therefore, be applied consistently, and with sufficient resources so as to reach all levels within the community. Inadequacy of available information Even when legal information is available, it may be inaccessible in physical or economic terms. It also may be incomprehensible to poor and disadvantaged people. Geographic distance, poverty and illiteracy pose serious obstacles for disadvantaged groups (see Chapter 6). Capacity Development Strategies to Facilitate Legal Awareness Enhance government communication policies,regulations and mechanisms Developing guidelines for the implementation of legislative or constitutional provisions on access to information offers a valuable opportunity for change. Communication strategies should be responsive to the needs and aspirations of disadvantaged groups. Strategies may include employment of paralegals,production of information in user-friendly formats,proactive dissemination of information to those who face substantial physical or economic barriers to access, and establishment of information desks or kiosks. Training of government officials Even when laws and regulations on access to information exist, government officials may", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f232a6d-a132-4bca-b6fa-9e4ee1ab7ae3": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f232a6d-a132-4bca-b6fa-9e4ee1ab7ae3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3575f1083a2678a78d62c942280412cf9b4647b2851e623646a394b02c8594cd"}}, "hash": "3575f1083a2678a78d62c942280412cf9b4647b2851e623646a394b02c8594cd", "text": "not be aware of them or may be reluctant to fully implement them. Training and sensitizing government officials will help to overcome resistance, and can also reveal obstacles officials may have in disseminating information to the public. Effective dissemination of information may require building government capacity to respond to new demands generated for legal awareness. Adopt a demand-driven orientation Assessing the specific information needs of people allows for better targeting and greater participation in legal awareness activities. In many cases, people need information on specific laws and regulations affecting them rather than general knowledge of international or constitutional human rights. Mapping legal awareness needs is critical for meaningful impact. Produce and disseminate information that is accessible for disadvantaged groups Language, culture and literacy factors require legal information to be tailored to the specific needs of disadvantaged groups.This may involve the use of popular education methodologies and other strategies, such as fliers and posters containing information about rights; school programmes for rights education; radio or television information shows; street theatre and role playing; self-help packages or kits for legal action without a lawyer; legal information kiosks;and website resource centres. Programming for Justice Access for All 142 Involve non-lawyers in design and delivery of community education programmes Good communications skills are often more important that specific legal expertise.The role of a non-lawyer in selecting, interpreting and packaging legal information for disadvantaged people can enhance the communication process if the individual has specialized understanding or experience of the needs of the affected group. Experience indicates that social scientists, community organizers, teachers and others with non-legal specialized skills can substantially contribute to legal dissemination efforts. Use information and communications technology (ICT) Strategies using ICT can be useful in assisting individuals with limited literacy, e.g., through the use of graphical and audio interfaces. For an effective strategy, combine ICT with more traditional means of accessing information. Community radio,for example,is particularly useful for reaching rural women, illiterate people, or physically impaired members of the community. Encouraging community-level information Explaining to people the importance of accessing information that directly affects their well-being (e.g., how to apply for a license or how to obtain a subsidy) is relatively easy. Communicating the importance of community-level information (e.g., information on the construction of sewers and public toilets, or the installation of water pumps) is much more difficult. It may take several months or perhaps longer, for community members to realize ownership of their communal services and press for their right to information about them.However, taking ownership of these public services is an important step in achieving political self- awareness and demanding accountability from the Government. Use existing social networks to mobilize community members Disseminating legal information among poor and disadvantaged groups is a significant challenge, as many are illiterate or politically marginalized.Using existing social networks such as saving groups or other community-based formal and informal networks is an effective entry point for larger community awareness and mobilization, as these groups already enjoy trust and familiarity among the community. Further, many of these groups are often comprised largely of women, which can facilitate women\u2019s active participation in legal awareness campaigns. 5.3 LEGAL AID AND COUNSEL Legal awareness can help people understand they have a right to claim remedies against infringements of their rights \u2013 such as protection from forced evictions, not to be forced to work without pay, or not to be tortured.Yet, as discussed earlier in this chapter, people do not always know how to reach these remedies, or may require professional help to do so.When seeking remedies through the justice system,legal counsel may assist them in making informed decisions and choices. However, inability to pay for litigation costs, or to communicate effectively, or the risk of traumatic consequences are all critical concerns when navigating the legal process. Legal aid relates to all necessary capacities in this regard, including not only legal counsel, but also financial options and various forms of psycho-social support. Challenges to Accessing Legal Aid and Counsel Access is physically difficult Legal aid services are usually concentrated in downtown/urban areas and are not easily accessible to those in suburban/rural areas (also see section on the Rural and Urban Poor in Chapter 6). Lack of case-specific support Pre-trial counselling and appropriate advice to avoid unnecessary processes are often lacking. Legal counsel also may be denied in the process of detention, often with impunity (see Chapter 4).

Similarly, public hearings can be an effective means of demanding accountability, although these require a high level of technical preparation, and careful monitoring and conflict management at the actual hearing. UNDP\u2019s experience also shows that future access initiatives should adopt a more demand-driven orientation and focus on the information needs of people in order to achieve meaningful impact. Specific needs and obstacles of marginalized groups need to be considered explicitly. Quantitative and qualitative data that enables the targeting and monitoring of access to information initiatives are a critical component for success. Chapter 5: Capacity to Demand Justice Remedies 143 143 143 143 Strict eligibility criteria Those who need legal aid services can find themselves denied support if they do not meet the court\u2019s criteria. Therefore, it is important that criteria are carefully established. Scarcity of resources requires applying certain restrictions for access.6 The specific combination and nature of the criteria used for eligibility can have a major impact on the communities and groups affected. Unaffordable legal counsel Alternatives to free, state-provided legal counsel are usually beyond reach of poor and disadvantaged people. The quality of legal assistance has traditionally been related to the payment of lawyers\u2019 fees, and legal fees increase with delays in justice. Insufficient funding for legal aid services Long-term, sustained, and permanent state funding for essential legal services for disadvantaged groups is necessary.While civil society organizations can provide additional legal aid services and can target specific disadvantaged groups, the State should be responsible for providing basic legal aid services to those who need it but cannot afford it. Provision of legal aid services is obligatory only for criminal cases Legal aid services take a specific rather than general approach, aiming to protect certain rights only. Under international law, free legal counsel is required only for criminal cases.The reality for poor and disadvantaged groups however, is that to access their rights, they require legal counsel to be expanded to other areas as well, from civil and commercial matters to administrative and labour relations.Many countries have expanded the scope of free legal counsel by constitutional law (see Chapter 3). Complexity of the legal system and legal counsel is intimidating The type of legal information and advice sought by most people is usually not complicated. Sometimes, however, legal practitioners overuse technical phrases and jargon making the justice system appear unnecessarily complex. This can be problematic for groups who do not understand the official language of the justice system. Clients may be reluctant to seek legal counsel for fear that lawyers will not understand them, or will not provide explanations in ways they can understand, or will even blame them for their situation. Limited legal aid services Legal aid should provide not only financial support but also other forms of support to navigate the legal process. Other support may include gaining exemptions for clients from legal and court fees, subsidies for bail, or provision of refuge and psycho-social support, such as in domestic violence cases. Such components of legal aid systems are often weaker than legal counsel services, placing an unnecessary burden on individual legal support providers. Capacity Development Strategies to Enhance Legal Aid and Counsel Capacity development strategies to address the obstacles described above can be classified into six groups: \ufffdImproving professional education while expanding services for the poor \ufffdStrengthening public defence systems \ufffdPromoting pro bono lawyering \ufffdExpanding paralegal activities \ufffdSupporting alternative lawyering and developmental legal aid \ufffdEnhancing professional bar associations \ufffdOther legal aid components: financial and psycho-social support For additional capacity development strategies within the formal and informal justice institutions see Chapter 4. For specific strategies relating to particular disadvantaged groups see Chapter 6. Improving professional education while expanding services for the poor Professional legal education may affect access to justice by poor and disadvantaged groups in a number of ways: \ufffdQuality of lawyers. In many countries, formal legal education does not sufficiently address the type of legal knowledge and skills that disadvantaged clients require from lawyers, such as knowing how to deal with discrimination, human rights and poverty- related cases. Lawyers also may not have adequate practical skills to gain trust and understanding from clients. 6 There are generally three types of criteria that can be applied to provide free legal counsel: (i) the means test \u2013 free services are provided to individuals whose income falls below a certain level; ii) substantive restrictions \u2013 free legal assistance is available only for certain types of criminal and civil cases, and iii) budgetary restrictions \u2013 when demand goes beyond what the public budget can", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "975aef4c-946d-488f-93fe-31adaec61e0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "975aef4c-946d-488f-93fe-31adaec61e0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c470fe61ec09e28622027df21391c188681cefcdc626ee07e354707737cad7e1"}}, "hash": "c470fe61ec09e28622027df21391c188681cefcdc626ee07e354707737cad7e1", "text": "support,the Government establishes restrictive eligibility criteria,such as not granting legal aid to women in divorce cases when there are no children involved.Legal aid schemes may have a combination of all three types of criteria. 7 McCutcheon,A.2000.\u201cUniversity Legal Aid Clinics: A Growing International Presence With Manifold Benefits.\u201dMany Roads to Justice: The Law-Related Work of Ford Foundation Grantees around the World.The Ford Foundation. Programming for Justice Access for All 144 \ufffdAccess to the legal profession. Scarcity of education and law scholarships for disadvantaged people limit their access to the legal profession. Compulsory periods of apprenticeships for law graduates can improve the quality of lawyers; however, hiring for apprenticeships in some countries is subject to patronage, social privilege, and other forms of discrimination,7 blocking access by poor and disadvantaged groups to professional opportunities. Improved legal education can have an impact on access to justice if it is translated into more and better services to those who cannot otherwise reach them. Strategies to simultaneously achieve both qualitative improvements in the legal profession and expanded services to the poor may include: \ufffdStreet and university law clinics. Law clinics are university-based or affiliated centres, where law graduates receive a combination of classroom and lecture components with practical exercises and actual client service. Not all clinics seek to serve poor and disadvantaged groups; however, some target such groups explicitly. Clinics of this type have compelling potential to impact on access to justice, as not only do they provide free legal services to those who most need them, but they also encourage future work in pro bono and public interest lawyering. Further, they often generate broader social impact through policy advocacy and cooperation with NGOs.8 \ufffdCommunity services for law graduates and retired professionals. Community service may be a means to obtain the necessary experience to enter the legal profession, to develop specific skills, or to continue working for access to justice after official retirement.For example, community service can be performed in local government, public defence systems, NGOs, neighbourhood committees, trade unions, human rights institutions and so forth. Support for community service may not only improve the legal profession and facilitate access to it, but also provide poor and disadvantaged groups with the experienced advice of senior and committed professionals. Incentives to community service, such as sufficient budget to conduct activities, fee deductions, training opportunities, learning credits and other merits, are necessary components of strategies in this field. Partnerships with universities and professional associations may help governments to expand legal services for poor and disadvantaged people. \ufffdLegal research. Research can foster access to justice by identifying issues in need of reform, uncovering injustices and providing concrete proposals for improvement. It also can contribute to drafting of legislation or reform of judicial proceedings. Legal research can provide a factual basis for litigation in specific cases.However, research does not always yield immediate results; its impact is often long-term and indirect, and it may depend on factors such as the existence of \u2018champions\u2019 at the highest levels, or mechanisms for continuous advocacy and technical support.9 Lessons and recommendations for improving professional education while expanding services for the poor \ufffdIntegrate legal aid programmes into law schools. This can help to develop future legal professionals with a strong sensitivity to public interest and social justice and increase the availability of services for the poor. \ufffdEducation should be sensitive to social issues and students should be exposed to community realities. Clinical legal education that includes topics related to discrimination, diversity and human rights can be better guided toward social justice goals. A community presence should be pursued to assist client access, while exposing students to a better understanding of the context of the problems. \ufffdMaximize outreach and impact of law clinics by cooperating with community- based organizations and NGOs. Some university clinics have increased their impact by concentrating on specific legal issues or population groups. Other clinics seek broad impact through class-action suits. Both non- governmental organizations and community based organizations can provide legal clinics with adequate knowledge on the challenges faced by poor and disadvantaged clients, as well as encourage the use of clinics among community members. \ufffdDevelop strategies for sustainability. Law clinics can improve sustainability by tapping the resources and talents of the university, placing clinic instructors at the level of the law faculty, and developing a second tier of leadership for the clinic at early stages. \ufffdCombine legal research with other strategies.Legal research may have a minimal impact as a stand-alone strategy, but it can be a powerful tool for social change when combined with advocacy, litigation and other strategies. 8 For a detailed overview of university law clinics\u2019potential and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74c70f8d-a4f6-4381-a563-22b391a7d018": {"__data__": {"id_": "74c70f8d-a4f6-4381-a563-22b391a7d018", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "723dde961d148a53940523164aa40363309c83ea997c793ac1bf7cac4b2768dd"}, "3": {"node_id": "05649ab4-7472-4fd5-bd64-a3d10a11447f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8481ed5389da1c250159e2463265eb7ec01a7e77353ac8cdac098288f07944d"}}, "hash": "4c29be3c894de3a8f0d6417ce048a212bf0828152abcee4d1a647d1c212ecd1f", "text": "strategic recommendations,see McCutcheon. 9 The potential of legal research is illustrated by a UNDP Philippines-supported study on gender bias in the court system,whose findings and recommendations formed the basis for the establishment by the Philippine Supreme Court of a Programme of Action to mainstream gender in the judiciary. 145 Chapter 5: Capacity to Demand Justice Remedies 145 145 145 Strengthening public defence systems Public defence systems result from the State obligation to ensure legal assistance for those who cannot afford a lawyer. In developing countries, public systems often suffer from insufficient budget allocation,insufficient staff,high case loads and weak coordination with non-state-funded legal aid providers (pro bono attorneys, paralegals, university legal clinics), in a context of increased demand for services. State-funded legal aid programmes may adopt a variety of models (see Table 9 for an overview of the different systems): \ufffd Salaried public defenders. Public defenders are full-time state employees,usually under a Public Attorney\u2019s Office situated under the Department of Justice. \ufffd State-funded private lawyers (judicare system).The State funds the private sector to provide services to individuals. Private attorneys apply to be placed with indigent defendants for a fixed fee.This system may be managed by the Department of Justice or directly by the courts. \ufffd Contracting. The State subcontracts the provision of mass casework to a private law firm. \ufffd Mixed systems. Mixed systems combine two or more of the above components. For example, they can consist of a combination of full-time state employees supervising and referring some cases (e.g., non-criminal matters) to private attorneys contracted to represent individual defendants. Lesson and recommendations for strengthening public defence systems: \ufffdDevelop adequate skills and competencies to meet needs of poor and disadvantaged groups. Particularly focus on areas such as criminal, family and administrative law. Training in paralegal skills and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms should be strengthened. \ufffdEstablish mechanisms for client feedback and improve communications strategies. The creation of \u201creport card\u201d systems can help monitor the performance of public defence systems from the perspective of the clients. In addition, improving information on how to access legal services and the type of alternatives available can help increase efficiency in the system. \ufffdDecentralize services. In countries undertaking decentralization processes, devolving direct legal service functions to local government may increase accessibility of services while allowing the national central offices to better plan, coordinate and monitor. \ufffdEstablish low- or reduced-fee systems. For those who cannot be considered \u201cindigent\u201d but who cannot otherwise afford to pay for private legal services. \ufffdReview compensation packages and strengthen performance-based systems. Good compensation packages can facilitate recruitment and retention of quality lawyers; compensation packages should be coupled with performance-based systems. Adequate compensation packages may require granting higher degrees of fiscal autonomy so public defence systems are able to raise funds and accept donations. \ufffdStrengthen public-private partnerships. Public defence systems can partner with private entities (law clinics, alternative law groups) in order to address the needs of disadvantaged people in particular areas. \ufffdCoordinate through intermediary bodies. Setting up intermediary bodies between government and service providers can help manage legal aid systems in some contexts. These bodies can be called \u201clegal services commissions,\u201d \u201clegal aid boards,\u201d or be quasi-autonomous non-government organizations. They help to separate the Government from the defendants and the practitioners, and they provide a professional base for developing the provision of services. Strengthening the Legal Aid System in the People\u2019s Republic of China In 1999, UNDP started cooperating with the Chinese Government to strengthen the legal aid system through a multi-pronged strategy that included professional training, public awareness raising, legislation and rule-making, and institutional development. In early 2001, only 21 per cent of counties had legal aid centres, with about 500 trained legal aid practitioners. By the end of June 2003, more than 80 per cent of counties had established legal aid offices. UNDP\u2019s assistance further contributed to the enactment of local regulations on legal aid services; the Government built on these regulations to establish national rules on legal aid. 146 Programming for Justice Access for All Promoting pro bono lawyering Pro bono lawyering defines the provision of free legal services by private practitioners to clients who could not otherwise afford them.

Firms\u2019 willingness to undertake matters in administrative law, an area where disadvantaged clients have significant needs and many firms do have expertise, can be diminished due to perceived \u201ccommercial conflicts of interest\u201d. For example, firms may worry there will be repercussions in securing government legal work in the future. \ufffdWeak monitoring systems. The difficulty of monitoring pro bono work, to ensure it is provided to those who most need it, makes it vulnerable to inefficiency and abuse. Lessons and recommendations to promote pro bono lawyering \ufffdPro bono practice is not a substitute for state responsibility to provide legal aid. Although it is a key source of assistance for the poor and disadvantaged, pro bono practice cannot and should not be a substitute for publicly funded services. It is essential to distinguish lawyers\u2019 professional/ethical obligation to do pro bono work from the Government\u2019s responsibility to provide adequate legal aid. However, given the high level of unmet legal need of poor and disadvantaged people, pro bono lawyering can be a key source of legal assistance in the absence of an adequately funded legal aid system. \ufffdPro bono lawyering can be established by mandatory, voluntary and mixed systems. Pro bono systems can be mandatory or voluntary, or a combination. Compulsory systems point to the wide gap between professional rhetoric and actual practice; they propose strategies such as mandatory internship programmes, a minimum number of pro bono cases per year to allow professional practice, and so forth. Critics of compulsory approaches believe that the cooperation of lawyers is key to the success and quality of pro bono work. Their suggestion is to ensure greater encouragement by professional bodies and to establish systems to facilitate referrals, matching client needs with adequate expertise. Mixed systems include both compulsory and voluntary approaches. \ufffdResponding to client needs requires systems that link skill and demand. Design and provision of pro bono services should be driven by client needs,not by what lawyers can offer.

Systems that combine the available skills of pro bono lawyers with the demand for pro bono services are also necessary. For instance, the establishment of \u201cclearing houses\u201d and other systems at national,regional and local levels may facilitate adequate referrals, although flexibility should be allowed as this may otherwise result in unnecessary bureaucratic delays. \ufffdEnsure quality and ethical standards in the provision of services. Pro bono clients should expect, and receive, the same high quality of service as all other clients \u2013 pro bono services should not be considered as \u201csecond-rate justice,\u201d or the exclusive domain of young lawyers. Professional associations need to clarify the ethical framework for pro bono legal work. Common problems that may inhibit or compromise the delivery of pro bono services,such as conflicts of interest,also need specific treatment. \ufffdInvolvement of the judiciary is key to strengthening pro bono lawyering. Involvement of the courts/judiciary is key to promoting and facilitating pro bono lawyering. Strategies may include: \ufffd Facilitating case handling to pro bono lawyers, for example, through court rules granting waivers of the filing and other court fees, accommodating pro bono cases first on the docket,and so forth; \ufffd Outreach activities, such as encouragement by the Supreme Court,training seminars for pro bono lawyers and awarding merits. \ufffdGovernments play an essential role in ensuring quality and effectiveness in the system. Governments can promote pro bono services by: \ufffd Assisting the judiciary in removing barriers such as court fees and translators; \ufffd Promoting a pro bono culture among professionals; \ufffd Improving outreach services and community education; \ufffd Providing tools and training to willing lawyers; \ufffd Providing \u201cmatchmaking\u201d opportunities to enable skills and resources to be sent from wherever they are located to wherever they are most needed; Programming for Justice Access for All 148 \ufffd Developing standards for professional practice; \ufffd Facilitating partnership opportunities across different parts of the legal profession, as well as between lawyers and other professional groups (doctors etc.) and community organizations; \ufffd Adequately regulating compulsory, voluntary or mixed systems. \ufffdBetter sharing of information and closer ties with communities and community organizations. This can improve the effectiveness of pro bono services and provide opportunities for joint advocacy through, for example, exemptions of court fees. \ufffdInter-professional cooperation and tapping the expertise of paralegals can strengthen the quality of pro bono work. By working with paralegals and other professionals such as doctors, accountants, engineers, etc., clients, especially those from disadvantaged groups, can be provided with all the different types of services they require. \ufffdMonitoring and accountability are needed in pro bono systems. A common problem in the provision of pro bono work is the difficulty and cost of monitoring, even in the case of mandatory systems. When pro bono work is voluntary, effective rules or social or economic incentives are needed to ensure compliance. Transparent information and reporting to professional bodies is an option. Expanding Paralegal Activities Although lawyers\u2019 skills are fundamental to the process of formal justice (e.g., representation in court proceedings), they are not always adequate to deal with the everyday needs of poor or disadvantaged people. Disadvantaged groups frequently require advice and assistance that will avoid the need for cases to be tried, including alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and other informal settlements. They also may require advice on whether and where to reach a lawyer (see Chapter 4: Informal Justice Systems). Such activities can be undertaken by paralegals. Paralegals are persons with specialized training who provide legal assistance to disadvantaged groups, and who often are members of these groups.10 The use of paralegals has been increasing in many areas of legal practice. Paralegals work together with public defenders, private lawyers or alternative law groups, and with government agencies, community-based organizations, NGOs and other entities. When paralegals are themselves members of the community or groups whom they serve, they are more familiar with local concerns and able to enjoy the trust of the community. The argument for expanding the role of paralegals in the provision of legal services is threefold \u2013 accessibility, quality of communication, and financial and non-financial costs.

Although private lawyers employ paralegals in many instances, they can also resist supporting paralegal work. Lawyers may perceive expansion of paralegal services as a threat to their income, or to the quality of legal advice unless they are involved and sensitized on the benefits of paralegals for access to justice. Wherever lawyers are sufficiently available and unemployed in the labour market, training and involving them in paralegal work may be another choice. Paralegals, on the other hand, will always need to have links with lawyers, as it is necessary to receive advice and opinions about legal options. \ufffdParalegal activities should be combined with widespread legal awareness, community organizing, and development efforts.The impact of paralegals\u2019activities can be maximized when they respond to issues prioritized by the community (for example, landlord-tenant disputes, children\u2019s well- being), and are complemented by community organizing and livelihood activities. Supporting alternative lawyering and developmental legal aid Legal aid is usually divided into two types, \u201ctraditional\u201d legal aid and so-called \u201calternative\u201d lawyering. Whereas traditional legal aid seeks to assist people in the process of reaching a justice remedy; alternative lawyering, or developmental legal aid, tries to demystify the law by bringing it closer to people, and to empower disadvantaged groups to use justice remedies in defending their interests. Alternative or developmental lawyering seeks to enable people to understand the rules they are told to respect,to abide by them when they seek to defend their fundamental rights, to participate in their modification if they exclude or threaten them, and to draft or participate in the drafting of these rules if they do not exist.11 As alternative lawyering is fundamentally empowering, it may be particularly appropriate in the context of poverty reduction efforts.

Bar associations can be instrumental in promoting legal reform, justice and the rule of law;securing an independent legal profession with high standards,and safeguarding lawyers\u2019interests and rights. Professional bar associations can work to improve human rights and access to justice for poor and disadvantaged groups in society in the following ways: 11 Agir le Droit.\u201cView Law as Practiced by the People.\u201d[Retrieved from http://www.agirledroit.org/en/droitsenmain.php]. Programming for Justice Access for All 150 \ufffd Increased awareness amongst practicing lawyers and authorities of obstacles to access to justice for poor. Bar associations can increase awareness amongst their members of social issues and of the impact of lack of access to rights and justice on disadvantaged groups. They can also increase understanding of how laws, law practices and regulations contribute to preserving these existing inequalities. Bar associations can advocate for the removal of obstacles to rights and entitlements of vulnerable groups (e.g., through a designated work group/committee), and mobilize lawyers and authorities to improve the situation. Encouraging members to take up community services after retirement,advocating for the removal of court fees and working to improve information about court cases in relevant languages, are some of many activities that could be undertaken by bar associations. \ufffd Fee-limitations and oversight. Members can report lawyers who commit malpractice, thereby helping to ensure that ethical norms and professional standards in the profession remain high. Bar associations issue a code of conduct to which their members must adhere to and can discipline members if they do not. For instance they monitor the fees set by members, and adjudicate over allegations of improper fee setting and charges. Expulsion from the bar association due to misconduct can seriously tarnish a lawyer\u2019s professional reputation. \ufffd Provide incentive systems that promote pro bono lawyering. Bar associations can provide incentives to encourage pro bono lawyering, such as prizes or awards to the institution, lawyer or firm that has made an important contribution in this regard in the course of the year. Bar associations can also emphasize the \u2018duty\u2019 of individual lawyers and firms to contribute to the public interest. \ufffd Draw attention to laws that disadvantage vulnerable groups. Bar associations are often considered an important partner and resource by authorities, law-making bodies and educational institutions and are often consulted and invited to hearings about legal reform. Bar associations can also lobby parliamentarians and other politicians to make them aware of weaknesses in proposed laws and the judicial system, hence pushing for legal reform. Lessons and recommendations for enhancing professional bar associations In countries with weak judiciaries, bar associations often need support. In particular, it is necessary to ensure that they are engaged in issues of access to justice and realize their wider responsibilities to the community as well as to the members of their association. Involving bar associations in reform efforts is crucial for the sustainability of reform and for strengthening democratic institutional development efforts. If given a chance to work to eradicate inequalities and enhance access to justice for poor and vulnerable groups, professional bar associations will often rise to the occassion,but it requires an enabling environment. An enabling environment can be created through the following: \ufffdCapacity-building of bar associations. Facilitate exchanges between bar associations from different countries in order to further legal reform and enhance the quality of legal representation. \ufffdIncreased understanding of authorities of therole of bar associations. It is important to work with authorities to increase their awareness of the important role that professional bar associations can play in promoting legal reform and in overseeing professional standards and ethics amongst legal professionals. Bar associations can also play an important role by keeping lawyers informed about new laws and regulations, for example, through meetings, debates/ information on websites, and by regularly publishing and distributing journals to members. Bar associations provide a permanent platform for advocacy and the promotion of legal reform and should not be overlooked as potential \u2018agents for change\u2019: \ufffdSustainability. Bar associations have the potential to become an important resource and channel for access to justice and reform efforts. Their members include most legal practitioners in a given country. Such wide membership gives them an authority which enhances their chances of successfully lobbying decision-makers. \ufffdA partner for rights-based legal education. As an interest-organization, bar associations contribute to the shaping of the conditions in which their members practice, and can also influence the development of the system in which they learn. One important way bar associations can use their influence in the legal education system is by encouraging the inclusion of access to justice issues and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b75292d-79fe-48fd-b6ad-f4ba8493a0c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b75292d-79fe-48fd-b6ad-f4ba8493a0c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8659c12f1439cf194bf389a027163924076287c301fd2c0cda29a39aa8c96fe"}}, "hash": "a8659c12f1439cf194bf389a027163924076287c301fd2c0cda29a39aa8c96fe", "text": "rights-based approaches throughout the legal curriculum. They can also provide support in terms of access to education by assisting poor and disadvantaged groups through scholarships and laws. Other legal aid components: financial and psycho-social support Legal counsel is essential to strengthen people\u2019s capacity to navigate the justice system. However, the situation of poor and disadvantaged people may make legal counsel insufficient in the absence of financial and psycho-social support. Physical security may also be fundamental (e.g., through witness protection programmes). Although financial support and psycho-social sup- port during the legal process are elements of legal aid that do not derive directly from international obligations, they can be critical factors for seeking remedies through the justice system. \ufffdCosts of litigation. Legal counsel may be insufficient when poor and disadvantaged clients are compelled to pay for a range of liti gation costs, including bail, transcript and filing fees, service notices and pleadings. Together with these costs, other costs include transportation and loss of income for attending the court as witnesses. Most legal aid systems include provisions exempting indigent litigants from paying some of these costs (e.g., filing fees) when assisted by public defendants. Such exemptions may not apply, however, to pro bono cases and usually do not cover important expenses such as court transcripts and expert witnesses. \ufffdPsycho-social support. People with physical disabilities may be unable to communicate through the legal process,while persons with a mental disability may not be identified as such and risk being mistakenly imprisoned. For many litigants (e.g., victims of domestic violence or rape), the process of seeking a remedy may be traumatic and require additional psycho-social support such as counselling or shelter before they will be willing to take on the physical and emotional risks that such a process implies. Psycho-social support may be enhanced through strategies such as: \ufffd Support to crisis centres. Provide more linkages to, and support for, legal aid centres offering a combination of legal and psychological counsel. \ufffd Enhancing coordination. Between public defence/prosecution systems and government departments in charge of social welfare. \ufffd Build linkages with legal NGOs and other CSOs working on psycho-social counselling and support. Strengthening coordination between legal NGOs and other organizations providing psycho-social support can make it easier for clients seeking legal assistance to access the different types of services they need. Although some strategies have been developed to address these issues, research and comparative analysis are still insufficient to provide a clear set of lessons and recommendations. Most experiences have so far been attempted by non-government organizations, for example, through the establishment of crisis centres. Cross-practice interventions Several strategies within UNDP\u2019s Access to Justice service line of good governance may serve to overcome some of the barriers highlighted above. However, most obstacles require capacity development strategies in other aspects of governance as well as in other UNDP practice areas, such as poverty reduction, gender equality, HIV/AIDS, conflict prevention or environmental 151 Chapter 5: Capacity to Demand Justice Remedies 151 151 Partnering with Bar Associations A useful and potential partner for UNDP country offices is the International Legal Resource Centre which was formed by the UNDP Legal Resource Centre and the American Bar Association in 1999, \u201c\u2026to support and promote good governance and the rule of law around the world\u2026\u201d It does this largely by assisting UNDP Country Offices to identify suitable legal expertise to undertake various projects in this field. The International Bar Association (IBA) is a potential partner for reform activities and projects. The IBA is a global law organization for individual legal professionals, bar associations and law societies, and seeks to provide a unique platform for professional development and legal education, networking, and strategy for world law. The IBA's Human Rights Institute works across the Association, helping to promote, protect and enforce human rights under a just rule of law, and to preserve the independence of the judiciary and the legal profession worldwide.

This chapter focuses on the poor and groups who may suffer discrimination (on the basis of gender, ethnicity, disability, etc.). Poverty and discrimination can prompt disadvantaged groups to pursue justice remedies. However, poverty and discrimination can also impede people\u2019s ability to access justice remedies, making them more vulnerable to poverty and conflict.This vulnerability can be further exacerbated if they do not receive the necessary support when approaching institutions to assist them in addressing their grievances. Who is disadvantaged depends on the context; therefore it is necessary to conduct in-depth analysis of each situation. Some specific disadvantaged groups found in the Asia-Pacific region are discussed within this chapter. However, in each situation, the most disadvantaged will need to be identified and other groups (such as the elderly, children, sexual minorities, etc.) may emerge as those who face the most obstacles in accessing justice. It is also important to recognize that the issues faced by different groups may overlap, and multiple disadvantages can compound the barriers to access to justice. Chapter 6: Disadvantaged Groups 157 157 157 6.1 GENERAL OBSTACLES AND CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES FOR DISADVANTAGED GROUPS While each disadvantaged group faces specific barriers in accessing justice, there are some strong similarities between them. Below is a list of common barriers that face disadvantaged groups:1 Economic barriers Poverty exacerbates the problems facing disadvantaged groups in accessing justice. The costs of court fees, lawyer fees, form fees, etc. may be too high for disadvantaged groups. In addition, transportation costs, food and living expenses, and accommodation during the trial can be costly, especially if there are court delays. The potential for loss of income/livelihood when involved in a trial is also a deterrent for many disadvantaged groups.Such costs add up and may prevent people with limited financial means from going through the formal court systems. Further, when the judiciary is corrupt, the poor are significantly disadvantaged as they cannot afford to pay bribes. Legal and institutional discrimination Laws may also discriminate against disadvantaged groups. They may ignore the special needs of certain groups or else actively discriminate against them, preventing them from seeking justice through the formal system. Even when laws themselves are not discriminatory, systematic or de facto biases and discrimination against disadvantaged groups may result in unfair rulings, inappropriate conduct or inadequate services for disadvantaged groups. Informal systems can be as equally discriminating against certain groups, as traditional laws may benefit those who are in positions of power. Insensitivity/lack of awareness of particular needs Even when disadvantaged groups are able to access the formal system, they may not receive the services they require or may be mistreated by legal professionals or law enforcement officials. Legal personnel may not be aware of the particular needs of disadvantaged groups or the institutions may not be equipped to provide disadvantaged groups with the services that they need. Insufficient outreach to disadvantaged groups The formal justice system may be too far removed from the realities of many disadvantaged groups who may not even be aware of their rights or how to seek justice when their rights have been violated. It is part of the duty of the formal justice system to reach out to disadvantaged groups and provide them with access to information through legal awareness and literacy programmes so that they know what services are available and how to seek remedies for their grievances. Insufficient support for alternative mechanisms Alternative mechanisms include civil society organizations, formal and informal Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) methods, as well as traditional and indigenous justice systems. These mechanisms are an extremely important component of access to justice programmes as they may be more widely available and disadvantaged groups are able to use them more easily. Civil society organizations can be effective in targeting and reaching disadvantaged groups, especially when working at the grassroots level. While formal and informal ADR methods as well as traditional justice systems can provide easier access for disadvantaged groups, it is necessary to make sure that monitoring mechanisms are put in place to oversee these alternative mechanisms in order to protect the rights of disadvantaged groups and prevent elite capture (see Informal Justice Systems in Chapter 4). Limited communication Language and literacy is a significant barrier for most disadvantaged groups. Disadvantaged groups may not only be intimidated by formal court processes and language (the courtroom atmosphere may be too formal or the legal jargon too complicated), but they also may not be able to communicate in the official language.

Legal aid and awareness programmes can target their activities and information to particular disadvantaged groups. For example, if women\u2019s legal aid programmes focus on laws that are relevant to women,it arms women with knowledge of what to do to lodge a complaint. Insensitive comments by legal personnel may discourage disadvantaged groups from seeking their assistance. Nepal is a party to 16 international human rights instruments, including the CEDAW, yet it still has at least 118 legal provisions in 54 different laws, that are discriminatory towards women. Forum for Women,Law and Development,Nepal Programming for Justice Access for All 158 many members of disadvantaged groups may be illiterate which poses a huge obstacle when court procedures require forms to be filled out. Fear/lack of trust of formal institutions Because of existing or perceived discrimination, disadvantaged groups often fear formal justice systems. Fear and the lack of trust in formal institutions may cause them to not exercise their right to remedy even when their rights have been violated. Despite enduring grievances, they may fear that if they turn to the formal system, not only will they not receive remedies for their grievances, they may face additional violations.For example,in many rape and sexual abuse cases, women are reluctant to report the crime,as they fear their own reputation will be tarnished. Fear of reprisal/social ostracism Social stigma can be a significant barrier for many disadvantaged groups. While they are already in a vulnerable position in society, they fear that if they make a complaint or seek redress for a grievance (especially if they oppose someone more powerful) through the formal justice system, they may face further social pressure or ostracism, or threats of reprisal. In addition, they may be ostracized by their community or they may be accused of destroying \u2018social harmony\u2019. Intangible costs such as these can prevent disadvantaged groups from seeking out formal systems. Lack of physical access Physical access to formal justice systems is another difficulty for members of some disadvantaged groups. Courts can be far away and claimants may need to travel long distances to get to them. Further, for people with disabilities, physically getting into the courthouse may prove to be difficult. Designing and Implementing Capacity Development Strategies In order to address the challenges mentioned above, capacity development strategies need to utilize a rights-based approach to specifically address the problems of disadvantaged groups and work with them to create solutions (for example, through participatory consultations). When doing this, it is necessary to adopt a holistic approach to providing support, since legal advice is often not the most pressing need of disadvantaged groups. For example, those suffering from torture or rape should be immediately provided with medical and psychological support along with options for legal assistance. Other assistance such as literacy programmes, food, health services, drug counselling, employment schemes, housing support, credit, etc. need to go hand-in-hand with legal aid. For those who suffer from harassment or other human rights abuses, counselling and victim services as well as medical services should be provided along with advice on how to file complaints. Civil society can also be a powerful actor in facilitating access to justice for disadvantaged groups. They can help to fill organizational, networking and technical gaps within and among disadvantaged groups. As the needs of disadvantaged groups are sometimes neglected by the State, civil society organizations can play an especially important role in developing strategies to address problems facing disadvantaged groups. See the section on Civil Society Oversight in Chapter 4 for additional information on the role of civil society in promoting access to justice. Chapters 4 and 5 also list different types of capacity development strategies that can be undertaken to enhance the ability of disadvantaged groups to demand and receive justice remedies. Even when people use their own strategies to overcome obstacles to accessing justice (such as collective organization, social integration, strengthening of collective institutions, and economic emancipation),there is often a lack of recognition of their initiatives . Communication is a problem for many migrants and various minority ethnic groups and indigenous peoples. It may also be a significant barrier for people with sight, hearing,or mental disabilities. In 1996, a young woman was abducted and sexually assaulted by 42 men in Kerela, India.

Access to Justice in Viet Nam \u2013 Survey from a People\u2019s Perspective The UNDP Access to Justice Survey conducted in Viet Nam in May 2004 revealed that only 6% of interviewees had used the services of a lawyer. Of those that had used lawyers, 13% were from high-income groups, while only 3% were from low-income groups. The rural-urban divide is also significant \u2013 12% of those living in urban areas had accessed lawyer services, compared to only 2% living in rural areas and 1% in mountainous areas. A further 35% of those interviewed thought lawyers\u2019fees were too high. UNDP Viet Nam 6.2 THE RURAL AND URBAN POOR The poor are not a homogenous group and it is necessary to recognize that even within the categories of the rural poor and the urban poor, there are distinct groups of individuals who have specific concerns. For example, the urban poor include homeless people, those living in slums, street children, beggars and street vendors, people struggling with addictions, commercial sex workers, etc. In rural areas, the poor can include peasants, migrant labourers, livestock herders and subsistence agriculturists. Though there may be some overlapping concerns for both the urban and rural poor (e.g., economic constraints prevent both groups from seeking justice), each group has their own particular legal needs and distinct sets of barriers that they have to overcome. It should also be noted that there is a higher likelihood of disadvantaged groups being poor as their disadvantaged situation keeps them in poverty. Hence, the linkages between poverty and discrimination need to be taken into consideration when developing programmes on access to justice. International human rights instruments The International Bill of Human Rights2, consisting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and its two Optional Protocols,applies to all human beings and sets the basic level of rights and protection that should be guaranteed for all (see Chapter 3). For the rural and urban poor, as well as for all other disadvantaged groups, this cluster of rights should be the starting point from which national laws are derived and the framework under which legal protection is extended. Article 2 of the UDHR recognizes that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the declaration without distinctions of any kind. Additionally, the UDHR specifically states that everyone should be provided the protection of the law (especially from discrimination, arbitrary arrests, detention, exile, etc.), presumed innocent till proven guilty, and have access to remedies and receive a fair trial (see especially Articles 6 through Article 12 of the UDHR). The ICCPR builds on the UDHR and recognizes that every individual has the right to life (Article 6), to liberty and security of the person (Article 9) and to additional protection during the judicial process including the guarantee of equality before the law (Article 14). The ICESCR outlines basic social, economic and cultural rights including provisions for just and favourable work conditions, the right to join trade unions, the right to an adequate standard of living (food, clothing, housing, etc.), the right to the highest attainable standard of mental and physical health and the right to education. The rural and urban poor need to be aware of, and know how to, claim these rights in order to ensure their survival and well-being. In addition, the Declaration on the Right to Development was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution 41/128 on December 4, 1986.3 Although it is non-binding, it outlines people\u2019s right to development and the State\u2019s responsibilities in providing for those rights. In particular, Articles 5 highlights the responsibility of the State to eliminate flagrant violations of human rights and Article 6 outlines the importance of protecting human rights, promoting non- discrimination and giving equal importance to social and economic rights along with civil and political rights. Challenges Legal and institutional discrimination Not only individual laws, but the way the legal system itself has been set up may be biased against the rural and urban poor. Existing laws can pose barriers for the poor in claiming their rights. Discrimination can also be perpetuated by ignorance. For example, the rural poor are oftentimes invisible to lawmakers who are based in urban areas.Hence,legal resources and services are rarely made available to them. The urban poor are also often legally \u2018invisible\u2019 because they are not registered (e.g., for voting, births,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52375508-6254-4a4d-b0fa-790978c1aa79": {"__data__": {"id_": "52375508-6254-4a4d-b0fa-790978c1aa79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f605ca53abc7eb27e8f8f22d62968eedf39913c2954f133b3695a44d276a177a"}, "3": {"node_id": "49f40a2a-2dcf-4d1a-a314-2729fd498229", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe7d001ad6f193e2f14cd79ee68eff726eeda733dcb43ba4bddf6616a6d86fb1"}}, "hash": "815161280612c45715df951f42f61fe88eb2e602e508d3aa43beb17d6548e59f", "text": "etc.) and are not accounted for in censuses.

For example, as they do not qualify as slum dwellers, they are ineligible to apply for protection or free housing. As a result they are more vulnerable to abuse and are often ignored by the formal system. Enviro-legal Defense Firm, \u2018Access to Justice for the Poor and Disadvantaged People in India\u2019, January 2004 2 See OHCHR Fact Sheet on the International Bill of Human Rights [http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs2.htm]. 3 UNHCHR. [http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/74.htm]. their actual situation is often scarce and policymakers are unable to target their specific problems. Insecurity,fear and lack of trust of formal systems As a result of negative encounters with government officials (the police, local government, army, etc.), the rural and urban poor may be unwilling to use formal legal channels to resolve disputes. This fear is a significant barrier for the poor in accessing justice. If they believe that the very people that are supposed to protect them (i.e. the police) are not on their side, then the poor may lose faith in the justice system as a whole. For the rural poor, land rights and environmental justice are crucial issues which may be in conflict with more powerful and wealthy interests. Lack of support in challenging these interests may cause disillusionment with the justice system with disadvantaged groups believing that it only assists those with wealth and \u2018connections\u2019. Physical access to information and services For the rural poor,because they are often in remote areas, the formal court system can be too far away for them to access. Even if they can afford the cost of travelling to the nearest district court, court delays may cause them to abandon their claims. Access to information is also a critical barrier as outreach and awareness activities are rarely conducted in rural areas. Similar problems of access (including access to other basic services such as health, education, clean water, etc.) may also arise for the urban poor as they too are often overlooked by governmental institutions. Capacity Development Strategies Poverty poses a huge barrier for the rural and urban poor in accessing their rights. Hence, access to justice programmes need to take into account the root causes of poverty. For example, inequitable land distribution or control of land is one of the main obstacles preventing the rural poor from overcoming poverty. Laws can be put in place to guarantee more land rights for the poor or policies can be promoted that advocate for land reform. Laws and policies that introduce other poverty elimination strategies \u2013 including education and employment \u2013 also need to be put in place. For example, support for informal sector workers\u2019 rights or micro-credit and small enterprise programmes. More immediate service oriented interventions can include: \ufffdWaiving or subsidizing the cost of various court processes. Court fees and other court costs could take into consideration the financial situation of the litigant before setting the fee. \ufffdProviding housing assistance and transportation to courts. \ufffdSetting up mobile legal clinics to reach those in remote areas (see Chapter 5: Legal Aid and Counsel). \ufffdStrengthening legal aid services in rural areas and in urban poor communities, for example pro bono lawyer and paralegal assistance (see Chapter 5: Legal Aid and Counsel). \ufffdTargeting legal aid to particular groups (even within the urban and rural poor) and establishing legal aid centres directed at specific communities. For example, urban justice centres can specialize in providing advice and services for the homeless, people living in slums, commercial sex workers, people with mental illness, people with addiction, etc. The rural poor also need specialized advice and NGOs working with them need to be knowledgeable about land rights and property law, human rights law, etc. (see Chapter 5: Legal Aid and Counsel). \ufffdConducting legal awareness initiatives among poor groups, focusing on aspects of institutional legal reform that affect them (see Chapter 5: Legal Awareness).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49f40a2a-2dcf-4d1a-a314-2729fd498229": {"__data__": {"id_": "49f40a2a-2dcf-4d1a-a314-2729fd498229", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f605ca53abc7eb27e8f8f22d62968eedf39913c2954f133b3695a44d276a177a"}, "2": {"node_id": "52375508-6254-4a4d-b0fa-790978c1aa79", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "815161280612c45715df951f42f61fe88eb2e602e508d3aa43beb17d6548e59f"}}, "hash": "fe7d001ad6f193e2f14cd79ee68eff726eeda733dcb43ba4bddf6616a6d86fb1", "text": "\ufffdPolice and judicial reform including reducing the corruption of the judiciary (see Chapter 4: The Judiciary). \ufffdInstitutional reforms can also include locating courts at the regional or district level so that the rural poor have easier access to them. \ufffdStrengthening informal dispute", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "279c58a1-4e71-4d54-a0b4-8d47f1f6a421": {"__data__": {"id_": "279c58a1-4e71-4d54-a0b4-8d47f1f6a421", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77d3600c10a9b7429a4defb5cdd5fbe148f83d587b22aee28e735360fa03d817"}}, "hash": "77d3600c10a9b7429a4defb5cdd5fbe148f83d587b22aee28e735360fa03d817", "text": "resolution mechanisms such as ADR and traditional justice that can be more easily accessed by the rural and urban poor (see Chapter 4: Informal Justice Systems). \ufffdInitiating reforms within prisons and police so 160 Programming for Justice Access for All Intimidation and Repression in Urban and Rural Areas In Bangladesh,in order to intimidate slum dwellers off public land, the police were accused of attempting to evict and arbitrarily arrest them despite a ruling that alternative accommodation must be provided for the slum dwellers beforehand. In rural areas, governments may also act brutally to repress the population, as is alleged in the case of the suppression of demonstrations by the Montagnards in the Central Highlands of Viet Nam. that the poor are not arbitrarily arrested and detained (see Chapter 4: Enforcement). 6.3 WOMEN The barriers faced by women in accessing justice are many and often overlap. Different issues often work in conjunction with each other preventing women from using the formal justice systems to address their problems. Since any programme to counter discrimination faced by women and to strengthen their access to justice will always challenge existing patriarchal power structures,it is important to be aware of the ways in which the interventions might be considered threatening for men. Therefore, strategies to deal with such perceptions should be developed at the same time. To implement successful access to justice programmes for women, it is important to understand culture,tradition,gender-relations,and the roles of important non-state and local actors. Additional research on the particular obstacles faced by women and the manner in which they cope with injustice or resolve conflicts is necessary in order to develop strategies in this area. International Human Rights Instruments Discriminatory laws and denial of equal rights not only impedes women\u2019s access to justice, but also exacerbates women\u2019s vulnerability to abuse and exploitation. International human rights instruments protect the rights of women. Specific instruments have also been established to address particular vulnerabilities faced by women all over the world. One example is the Convention for the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).4 CEDAW is the main convention that seeks to protect and promote the rights of women. It was adopted in 1979, and 178 states are party to the Convention.5 CEDAW is supported by an Optional Protocol that came into force in 2000. While CEDAW focuses on the roles and responsibilities of the State with regard to guaranteeing the rights of women, the Optional Protocol establishes a complaint mechanism for individuals. Challenges Legal discrimination/lack of legal protection The formal legal framework of many countries reinforces discriminatory practices towards women. Laws can actively discriminate against women and condone violations of women\u2019s rights through the lack of adequate legal protection. Some areas of concern are: \ufffdPersonal Status Laws or Family Law. For example, discriminatory provisions relating to marriage, inheritance, and custody of children. \ufffdCriminal Law/Penal Codes. Many violations of women\u2019s rights are not considered as crimes despite international legal standards. Other concerns include criminalization of female victims of violence and the differential principles of defence and evidentiary requirements applied to men and women. \ufffdLabour Laws. For example, discriminatory provisions with regard to maternity leave, childcare, and lack of regulation in the informal sector. \ufffdLack of Domestic Violence Legislation. This includes the lack of recognition of rape within marriage, laws on incest and sexual abuse, etc. Gender insensitivity in the justice system A woman\u2019s decision to seek legal remedies can involve huge risks and costs:financially,socially and psychologically.Even when they do overcome their fears and attempt to seek justice,women often face an additional hurdle because of institutionalized gender discrimination at all levels of the justice system. For example: \ufffdStereotypical views about women can lead to discriminatory judgements being passed in the courts. Sanctions for crimes committed against women are often not comparable to those for other violent crimes. Principles of defence may discriminate against women,and defences such as honour or provocation allow perpetrators to escape criminal responsibility. Women may face further victimization by court proceedings, which do not comply with international standards for victim and witness protection. \ufffdSystemic gender discrimination is evident among the police, who are often negligent in responding to reports of crimes against women (particularly in cases of domestic violence), and often do not take action to 161 Chapter 6: Disadvantaged Groups Reporting on CEDAW CEDAW requires that States that are party to the Convention report on the activities they have undertaken to implement CEDAW in their countries.

Victims may suffer harassment, physical and sexual assault when reporting cases. \ufffdInformal justice systems often promote traditional patriarchal values and traditions which may violate women\u2019s rights and reinforce existing gender discrimination. \ufffdPrisons and correctional facilities may not have adequate facilities to protect female prisoners from abuse. Additionally, despite the fact that women in detention are vulnerable to sexual abuse and rape, they often have no means of complaining when such crimes are committed against them. Such discriminatory attitudes and practices mean that women often have very little faith in the justice system and therefore are reluctant to take their complaints to courts or the police.6 Lack of institutional technical capacity and services There is a general lack of understanding of gender-based violence in the police, a poor quality of police investigative techniques, and little protection of the crime scene or collection of forensic evidence.These are all serious barriers that prevent women from obtaining remedies. In addition, the lack of facilities and services responding to women\u2019s needs such as one-stop centres where victims of violence can receive legal, medical and other services, special women\u2019s desks at police stations, medical and psycho-social support and shelters serve as obstacles. Women who are victims of rape, sexual assault and domestic violence are generally treated insensi- tively, and are not provided with legal advice or given access to necessary support services. Fear of reprisal or social ostracism The cultural values and norms of many countries in the region may consider it shameful for women to seek a remedy in the justice system especially with regard to sexual crimes. Women wanting to go to court are therefore not supported by their families and may face outright resistance.This results in fear of social ostracism, which is especially widespread in cases of rape, sexual assault and domestic violence where there may be social pressure to preserve the victim and her family\u2019s honour rather than to punish the offender.Sometimes, families of the victim and the perpetrators negotiate a settlement among themselves in order not to involve the authorities and public.7 Further,in cases of sexual crimes,women may be unwilling to bring charges against the perpetrators for fear of being publicly labelled and ostracized by their communities. Inadequate public services and outreach of NGOs The lack of social support combined with the lack of information and economic independence means that women whose rights are violated need greater support from national institutions, and programmes and policies for the promotion and protection of their rights. The most successful initiatives are ones that involve partnership with civil society and women\u2019s organizations (also see Civil Society Oversight in Chapter 4). Lack of economic independence Women are among the poorest of the poor in most Asia-Pacific countries.Control of family resources is most often in the hands of the male head of the house. This can lead to women having a lack of power in household decision-making and priority setting. Their disadvantaged economic situation can lead them to becoming dependant on others and mean that they cannot contest violations of their rights in the context of the family, the workplace, government institutions, etc. Capacity Development Strategies Support legal reform programmes to change discriminatory laws and regulations An effective and impartial legal framework is a good starting point in recognizing gender equality and women\u2019s rights. International treaties and conventions such as CEDAW and the Optional Protocol, ICCPR, etc. provide international standards on women\u2019s rights which countries should be encouraged to sign, ratify and implement. Accordingly, the national legal frameworks should be reformed so that women are ensured protection and their rights are guaranteed under national law. Antiquated laws (e.g., unequal inheritance laws) should be reformed and new laws (for example, recognizing rape within marriage) should be established to protect the 162 Programming for Justice Access for All 6 Asian Human Rights Commission-Human Rights Solidarity.2000.\u201cImpact of Corruption on the Criminal Justice System on Women.\u201d [http://www.ahrchk.net/hrsolid/mainfile.php/2000vol1onoo2/191]. 7 Such settlements have a risk of violating the rights of the victim,for instance when it is decided by the family of a girl who has been raped that she must marry her rapist to save her,as well as the family\u2019s,honour.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "451cecb4-aa79-43ce-b478-92680002e928": {"__data__": {"id_": "451cecb4-aa79-43ce-b478-92680002e928", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2715558739894aff415a5e445aebed69d53d3e9cef1ccbc093cfc1e63e6e57d"}, "2": {"node_id": "83148025-ab37-49cc-bb68-19119cc949ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84ea07a00f7a1b4ee5c1857169af99f19f9996f9dd5ed12bf5078ff8278c4e2d"}}, "hash": "7b33c19722c3f6d7d3de935888a1bb45e8ca3c770186913bedbdd01bb9b196f9", "text": "Reaching out through Civil Society and the Media Women\u2019s Aid Organization (WAO), a Malaysian NGO,not only provides shelter and counselling for victims of domestic violence, but also works on raising awareness and conducting advocacy work to promote law reform.

As radio reaches out to around 800,000 Malaysians, it has resulted in more people seeking assistance and information about addressing domestic violence. \u2018Education through Radio\u2019,Isis International rights of women. To promote these types of reforms,advocacy programmes can be undertaken in partnership with United Nations agencies such as OHCHR and UNIFEM to encourage the Government to take a progressive attitude towards legal and institutional reform. Support to legal reform programmes to change discriminatory civil and criminal justice laws and regulations,including reconciliation between international instruments and national laws should also be considered (see Chapter 3). Support could also be given to research into court judgments to highlight gender insensitive verdicts. Capacity development of law enforcement personnel and agencies Police, judges, prosecutors, prison staff and other judicial staff need to receive training on gender and women\u2019s rights.Training and educating judicial personnel can help to make them more sensitive and responsive to crimes suffered by women. However, training may not always be sufficient for attitudinal and behavioural change and other measures may need to be put in place. For example, incentives could be offered to encourage law enforcement personnel and agencies to adopt gender sensitive approaches, with appropriate mechanisms put in place for oversight. Support could also be given to specialized programmes that assist police officers and medical personnel in handling sexual assault, rape and domestic violence cases, especially in areas such as human rights, gender and violence, investigation and the use of forensic evidence. (Also see Chapter 4, particularly sections concerning Enforcement and the Court System). In addition, it is important to recruit people within law enforcement that are gender sensitive.Specific gender focal points and gender desks could be established to support women through the justice system.Links to protective services such as witness protection, women\u2019s shelters and victim support, could also be established to facilitate women\u2019s access to the formal legal system and assistance. Family courts could also be established that would expedite the legal process for women as well as reduce case backlog in other courts. Support NGOs and CSOs for better legal service Since NGOs are generally better able to work at the grassroots levels, support should be given to them to tailor their services to meet the legal needs of disadvantaged women. Support to strengthen networking between women\u2019s groups and NGOs working in the legal sector should also be facilitated. In general, partnership building between civil society and public agencies is most effective in addressing challenges from a more holistic and integrated approach. Financial support could be provided for civil society-based organizations (such as self-help groups) since these groups are often the first place women turn to when they have a grievance. Promoting champions from within the system In order to accomplish widespread reform, more investment needs to be made in terms of both financial and human resources and it is necessary to have \u201cchampions\u201dwithin the judicial system who are willing to support these reforms and investment of resources. Strategies can include promoting positive discrimination by placing women in decision-making positions. For example, in India, laws were passed \u201creserving\u201d a third of parliamentary seats for women. This provides women with the opportunity to reform laws and invest in building capacity of institutions so that they may become more gender sensitive.However, it is equally as important to cultivate male champions both within and outside the system so that they can support gender sensitive policies and refrain from blocking reforms initiated by female representatives or from pressuring them to vote a certain way. Ensure that the judicial system is responsive to women\u2019s needs by establishing accountability mechanisms Institutions such as National Women\u2019s Commissions can work with other civil society organizations to monitor the performance of the judicial system with respect to women and promote effective affirmative action policies. Reporting on implementation of CEDAW to the CEDAW Committee, and reporting to other treaty bodies, is another way to facilitate dialogue and ensure accountability. States that have ratified CEDAW are required to report on their compliance at least every four years. Civil society and the Government could work together to ensure that their country adheres to these reporting requirements by submitting the National CEDAW report as well as a shadow report prepared by NGOs.

However, ADR and traditional systems can also be problematic as they may perpetuate gender biases, therefore clear guidelines should be introduced and mechanisms should be put into place to monitor these systems.Further,formal and 163 Chapter 6: Disadvantaged Groups informal systems should establish clear links and should be able to refer to each other. Serious crimes, such as rape, domestic violence and sexual abuse,should be referred to the formal system as it has better enforcement mechanisms as well as services such as witness protection, victims\u2019 assistance and shelters (see section on Informal Justice Systems in Chapter 4). Increase representation of women in the legal system To improve women\u2019s access to justice, it is impor- tant to ensure that women are represented in the justice system \u2013 both in formal and informal processes. For example, it often makes a difference if women police officers or female counsellors and psychologists are available for women victims of violence. Female judges, mediators and lawyers may be better able to understand and relate to women victims and be better able to support them through legal process. Judicial reform should seek to equalize the gender balance of judicial personnel, including recruiting women in leadership positions. At the same time, gender balance must be pursued with the ultimate goal of ensuring that the unique problems facing women are understood by the justice system.In order to do so, it may be important in some cases that a gender balance is achieved by recruiting women who are from vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities rather than assuming that all women are willing and able to represent other women. Design and support legal programmes with cross-practice linkages Legal literacy programmes should be designed in an integrated way so that they empower women and can assist them to organize and mobilize for change. Legal literacy can be a powerful tool in developing women\u2019s capacities to understand, reflect on and critique laws and to take action to change those laws that limit their rights. Legal literacy is a process in itself; therefore, flexibility and innovations are important for any successful legal literacy programmes. Legal literacy cannot be promoted in a vacuum, and cross-practice linkages to assist women in claiming their rights must be encouraged as well. For example, establishing literacy classes, micro-credit programmes or promoting entrepreneurship along with legal literacy programmes may be more effective than conducting legal literacy programmes alone. Legal education should not merely provide legal information. Even women who know their rights may lack the self-confidence and support to exercise them in the face of social and family pressures.8 To overcome such social and cultural obstacles, legal programmes should combine legal education with awareness raising and other activities so that legal knowledge can be translated into action (e.g., community organizing, mediation, or litigation).9 Chapter 5 on Legal Empowerment discusses these issues in further detail. 6.4 INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND MINORITY GROUPS Indigenous peoples and minority groups (ethnic, religious, linguistic, etc.) are often marginalized by the State and society. Their culture and traditions are commonly ignored, or worse, systematically erased.Dominant groups have historically pursued various policies of assimilation, apartheid, oppression or discrimination. The rights of indigenous peoples and minority groups are often unprotected and they face considerable obstacles when they attempt to seek justice through formal channels.Indigenous peoples and minority groups often live on the margins of society, enduring disproportionately high levels of poverty relative to the rest of the society.This is directly related to high rates of crime and victimization. A disproportionate number of people from minority groups are accused of crimes and face trial and there tends to be a high number of them imprisoned. This may result in a deep sense of alienation from a justice system that seems to them foreign and inaccessible. Their movements may be restricted, traditional laws disregarded or violated, and rights to ancestral land ignored.

ILO Convention 169 Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (1989) revised the earlier ILO Convention 107 Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention and Recommendation (1957).10 It seeks to ensure that indigenous peoples stand on an equal footing with other members of society. It also aims to promote the realization of the rights of indigenous peoples with respect to their identity, customs, traditions, and institutions. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination seeks to address all necessary measures for eliminating racial discrimination in all forms and manifestations, to prevent racist doctrines and practices, and to promote an international community free from all forms of racial segregation and discrimination.11 Its provisions include revising national laws and policies, amending or eliminating discriminatory legislation, and promoting and enforcing non-discrimination especially in public institutions, and guaranteeing the right to equal treatment before the law. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination monitors compliance with the Treaty. General Assembly Resolution 36/55 proclaimed the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief on November 25, 1981. This declaration affirms the freedom of thought and beliefs, advocates for tolerance and calls for repealing discriminatory laws. Challenges Lack of legal protection Laws and the legal system in many countries may be biased against indigenous peoples and minority groups and provide little protection for the rights of minority communities. In many places, even when their rights are legally protected, the Government does little to uphold the rights of such groups. In the Philippines, for example, the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act was passed in 1997; however, many challenges still remain to be overcome with regard to reconciling local/ customary laws with formal laws. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous Peoples visited the Philippines in 2002 and reported that while there were many complaints and some cases have gone to court, adequate remedial measures had not been taken by the authorities to redress the grievances of indigenous peoples. Further, while the Indigenous People\u2019s Rights Act provides protection for indigenous peoples, it is not consistently applied. Lack of awareness and cultural sensitivity/ negative social attitudes In addition to unprotected rights of indigenous peoples and minority groups, there is a general lack of awareness and sensitivity to the needs of diverse cultures, a mindset that tends to be institutionalized within justice systems. In cases where indigenous peoples demand recognition, the State may even go as far as to arrest, threaten, and pursue other aggressive policies against the indigenous community. Seeking redress for such violations through official channels is often difficult since the official channel may not be impartial or may be corrupt. Further, indigenous peoples may be in direct conflict with business and other more powerful interests (for example, in land disputes) and as they may not have the economic means to pursue litigation, their situation is often left unresolved. Indigenous peoples and minority groups may also be negatively stereotyped and the prevailing political climate may be biased against them. Indigenous laws and customs may be ignored, there may be racial profiling by law enforcement officials, they may be negatively portrayed in the media,or there may be aggressive campaigns against movements by indigenous groups. As a result, there can be high levels of disillusionment on the part of indigenous peoples and minority groups and they may mistrust and avoid the formal justice system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6c50741-2f7a-4d50-8e22-dee63ccdb3cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6c50741-2f7a-4d50-8e22-dee63ccdb3cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "13dc2e790eca34de58d9c8faece6126564c9ac1d285930c84a2eaaa8313a4df6"}, "2": {"node_id": "4bc308b1-2746-480f-9068-ebde43f97cfd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8eaf5c58c63ca6590502af8c94543bda4ec0153f8b8796a45b9b5e0c80c831ad"}}, "hash": "3375e8284cd11fe3006ec1c3a850e96bae15f16e9275b2d1750b7906e97ff0d1", "text": "165 Chapter 6: Disadvantaged Groups Reaffirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \u201cDiscrimination between human beings on the grounds of religion or belief constitutes an affront to human dignity and a disavowal of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and shall be condemned as a violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and enunciated in detail in the International", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "436edcae-f794-42b8-893e-42052d5e00c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "436edcae-f794-42b8-893e-42052d5e00c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e03a84e686bc1b12645871f7a74f6b3eae308dc09d12a2008c56db8f0e75ee65"}}, "hash": "e03a84e686bc1b12645871f7a74f6b3eae308dc09d12a2008c56db8f0e75ee65", "text": "Covenants on Human Rights, and as an obstacle to friendly and peaceful relations between nations.\u201d Article 3,Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief,Proclaimed by General Assembly resolution 36/55 of 25 November 1981 10 Adopted on June 27,1989 by the General Conference of the International Labour Organization at its seventy-sixth session; came into force September 5,1991.[www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/62.htm]. 11 Adopted and opened for signature and ratification by GA resolution 2106 (XX) of 21 December 1965; came into force January 4,1969 in accordance with Article 19.[www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_icerd.htm]. Institutional discrimination Minority groups may be discriminated against by members of the judicial system itself, which can also prevent them from seeking redress for their grievances. They may be mistreated in police custody,abused in prisons or may not receive a fair trial because of prejudice against them. In situations of conflict, animosity between different minority groups can result in an increase of discriminatory practices: there may be arbitrary arrests based solely on the ethnic or religious identity of the individual, basic rights might be denied, people may be segregated along ethnic/religious lines, etc. All these discriminatory practices pose an additional, and often insurmountable barrier, for members of minority groups seeking justice. Language/literacy barriers As most court proceedings are undertaken in the official language, indigenous peoples and minority groups commonly face a linguistic barrier as they often have their own languages and may not be able to understand or follow the official court language very well. Even if they understand the language used, they may not be able to speak or write it fluently,limiting their ability to fill out forms or to express themselves in court. Services, such as interpreters or translated legal information material, may also not be readily available. Capacity Development Strategies Establish clear laws protecting indigenous peoples and minority groups To ensure that the rights of indigenous peoples and minority groups are respected,the State needs to first make sure laws are put into place that protects their rights. For example, states can be encouraged to ratify ILO Convention No.169 and to adopt the UN Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as a sign of their commitment to protecting the rights of indigenous peoples. Along with guaranteeing protection and recognizing the specific situation of indigenous peoples and minority groups, it is necessary for governments to outline their own responsibility and role in ensuring that these laws are enforced. Committees can be set up to monitor the Government\u2019s activities and to make sure that the interests of indigenous peoples and minority groups are represented.Advocacy campaigns for legal reforms and combating negative social attitudes towards indigenous peoples and minority groups can also be promoted. Sensitize legal and law enforcement personnel on their duties and responsibilities Law enforcement personnel, judges, lawyers, etc. need to be sensitized to the particular issues and concerns of indigenous peoples and minority communities. Courts should be established at the local level for easier access and personnel should be aware of issues related to the indigenous/ethnic communities in which they work.Police and prison officials also need to be trained not to discriminate against people of different religious or ethnic backgrounds. Advocacy for and establishing multi-ethnic justice institutions The State needs to have the political will to commit financial resources to promote access to justice for indigenous peoples and minority groups. Judges and lawyers from minority groups should be encouraged and members from under-represented backgrounds should be actively recruited into the legal system. Work with traditional and indigenous justice systems Indigenous communities may also have their own laws and traditions. Ignorance of traditional laws on the part of legal aid providers can also become an obstacle in their capacity to provide appropriate services. Developing paralegal capacities among indigenous peoples may help in documenting traditional laws and practices. Indigenous peoples and minority groups may trust and prefer to use internal dispute resolution mechanisms rather than formal court systems.It is,therefore,necessary for legal aid providers to understand the traditional justice system and ensure that in applying the formal system, the cultures and customs of indigenous peoples and minority groups are taken into account. Reduce the number of indigenous peoples and members of minority groups in prison Incarceration is a key issue as a disproportionate number of people from minority backgrounds are imprisoned. These high rates of imprisonment point to flaws in the official system in providing adequate access to justice.Below are some ways to address the high incarceration rate: \ufffdAddress language barriers.

Technical details such as limited capacity to maintain proper records may keep many indigenous people within prisons. By maintaining clear records and ensuring that minority prisoners receive legal aid, it may help to reduce the number of prisoners that overstay their prison sentence.

These commissions could play a role in monitoring the activities of the State and holding it accountable to the international treaties it is party to and to national legislation.They can investigate human rights violations by the State and serve as a means through which minority groups and indigenous peoples can file complaints against the State and can advocate for changes to improve the situation for minority groups (see National Human Rights Institutions in Chapter 4). 6.5 MIGRANTS, REFUGEES AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE All over the Asia-Pacific region people are moving across borders \u2013 through both legal and illegal means. They may be smuggled across in boats by human traffickers, pay large sums of money to employment agencies promising them a future in foreign lands, forcefully trafficked to be sold as sex workers, or as victims of conflict who have been forced to leave their homes. They find themselves in situations where they are exploited and have no way of addressing their grievances. Along with being in new and unfamiliar environments, migrants, refugees and the internally displaced12 face many constraints \u2013 from racial/ ethnic/religious discrimination at the community and policy levels, to exploitation by those seeking to make a profit at their expense, to lacking access to health and education facilities because of their irregular status or because they are poor. Migrants and internally displaced people may have to endure inhumane living and working conditions, physical and sexual abuse and degrading treatment. As the disadvantages faced by both migrants (legal and irregular) and internally displaced people are similar this section addresses their concerns together. 167 Chapter 6: Disadvantaged Groups Key Issues Concerning Indigenous Peoples Include: \ufffd Cultural Integrity \u2013 Right to their own language, culture, religion, traditional practices and freedom from outside cultures being imposed or being forced to assimilate. \ufffd Land and natural resources \u2013 Right to own land (individually or collectively) that has traditionally been theirs and right to access all resources within that land. For indigenous peoples, land is more than possession of property. It signifies a deep cultural connection and intangible value placed on the land. Land is very much linked to survival and survival of the community and traditions. Control over the management and conservation of land and resources that are part of indigenous property should be placed in their power. Additionally, the State should allow for varying definitions of property and recognize indigenous ways of defining property rights. \ufffd Participation \u2013 Right to participate within their traditional structures as well as the choice to participate in the State system, especially in all issues that concern indigenous peoples. Participation goes beyond merely consulting indigenous peoples, and implies decision-making power is vested in the indigenous peoples. Any policies affecting indigenous peoples should only be pursued with their informed consent. \ufffd Indigenous knowledge \u2013 Safeguard indigenous knowledge of the natural world, their customs and practices. Intellectual property rights issues over indigenous music, stories, scientific knowledge, etc. may be a serious concern as non-indigenous people may gather this knowledge and accrue the benefits from it,while indigenous communities themselves may not receive anything in return. \ufffd Self-determination and self governance \u2013 As a part of their right to self-determination indigenous peoples seek devolution of power from the central government and a recognition by the State of the traditional governance and judicial institutions within indigenous communities. \ufffd Collective rights \u2013 Respect collective rights of indigenous peoples as a group along with individuals. Indigenous peoples seek to be recognized as a people and not just as individuals. Even within the community, often priority is given to the welfare of the group over that of the individual. This also is relevant for issues of land, where land is often collectively owned.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a8bb2ba-1304-47b1-8af3-90ca69491ced": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a8bb2ba-1304-47b1-8af3-90ca69491ced", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e1753c7493ba526708d272a1f36a14cdab7d12e608eef2c3011f19c34724a9b"}, "3": {"node_id": "f105380a-ec62-473b-83da-6f911c94440c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72aa6fa0d461b85e3a62e0f4b6b352e6f63f64c42bc440419d427b7ea1642d1e"}}, "hash": "3635f74537736d69d8a3f2bee476227830ac45e8825df1858ae9372c28d4487e", "text": "For example, communal land rights over forests and grazing lands should be respected. International Human Rights Instruments The International Convention on Protection of Rights of the Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families was developed within the framework of prior International Labour Organization conventions concerning forced labour and migration for employment.13 It entered into force in July 2003, however many States have yet to sign it. The Convention establishes norms and lays out basic principles concerning the treatment of migrant workers and members of their families. It also reiterates the fact that migrants are guaranteed their fundamental human rights and member States need to ensure that these are not violated. In particular, Part IV of the Convention (Articles 64-71) encourages States to promote policies and laws that protect the rights of migrants and clearly outlines the responsibilities of different parties including the responsibility of the State to provide adequate information and appropriate services (see also ILO Convention No. 97 on Migration for Employment and ILO Convention No. 143 on Migrant Workers - Supplementary Provisions). The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement seek to protect the rights of internally displaced people.14 They were developed over several years, pursuant to the 1992 mandate by the Commission on Human Rights. The principles address the specific needs of internally displaced people worldwide and establish the duty of international authorities to provide protection and humanitarian assistance to these individuals. They serve as an international standard to guide governments and international humanitarian and development agencies in providing assistance and protection to internally displaced people, ensuring that they enjoy the same rights and freedoms as other persons in their country. It also details the responsibility of the State to prevent displacement, protect internally displaced people during displacement and rehabilitate them, including compensating for loss and lack of access to property. Challenges Legal and institutional discrimination Legal and institutional discrimination of migrants (particularly irregular migrants) and internally displaced people exist at many levels. Xenophobia may be deeply rooted in the countries that receive migrants (including within the police, legal system and judiciary), which may manifest itself in the stringent immigration policies or lack of protection for migrants. Even where international protections for migrants exist, States receiving migrants are reluctant to sign on to treaties or conventions. Similarly, though there are Guiding Principles for Internally Displaced People, governments may not have the capacity to provide adequate protection or services to them or may even be hostile towards them. 168 Programming for Justice Access for All Designing Innovative Approaches Tailored to Enhance Access to Justice In Kosovo, efforts were made to promote a professional, independent, impartial and multi- ethnic judiciary and prosecution service. A multi-ethnic judiciary, especially at the local level, can help in taking action against ethnic bias and to build trust between different communities. For example, the Judicial Integration Section (JIS) was, \u201ctasked with increasing minority participation in the judiciary and prosecution service, ensuring access to justice for minorities and tracking the treatment of minorities by the justice system.\u201d Other ways in which the JIS addressed obstacles facing ethnic minority communities included: \ufffd Shuttle services to and from the community tocourts in order to overcome restrictions on freedom of movement. \ufffd Court liaison officers to facilitate access to courts by providing advice and outreaching to different ethnic groups. \ufffd Oversight bodies to monitor investigations, court processes and judges to ensure impartiality. \ufffd Victim assistance units to provide comprehensive assistance including legal services, shelter services, psycho-social support, medical assistance, education, income generation and compensation. United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) 12 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are defined in the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement as \u201c\u2026persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence,in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict,situations of generalized violence,violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters,and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.\u201d 13 UNHCHR.[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/m_mwctoc.htm]. 14 UNHCHR.[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/7/b/principles.htm].

They see migrants as a liability and they often become scapegoats during economic downturns \u2013 and are blamed for taking away jobs and for increasing criminality. Anti-terrorism policies may also heighten tensions between migrants and local communities making it more difficult for migrants to live and work within the community. Internally displaced people are also subject to negative perceptions from local populations who may be hostile towards them as they may see them competing for jobs or humanitarian aid. Economic constraints Migrants and internally displaced people are among the most vulnerable members of society. They tend to live in the poorest neighbourhoods and do not have adequate support systems.Due to their economic vulnerability,they may have to take any work that is available including that which is abusive or exploitative. Despite abuses committed against them, they may refrain from using the formal justice system because of the fear of being deported or because the costs associated with lawyers and court processes may be too great for them. For example, immigration lawyers may be unaffordable for those working without the necessary papers even though they may be the ones who need them the most. Inability/lack of political will to provide services Governments are often unable to provide the necessary legal services to migrants and internally displaced persons,and in times of conflict,often do not consider it a priority to address the legal needs of their internally displaced populations.Even after conflict, the police and the judiciary may not have the capacity to properly investigate and address issues of property rights, gender-based violence or other kinds of human rights violations against the internally displaced.Migrants also need specialized services to deal with immigration concerns. However, government agencies are often constrained by limited resources \u2013 both human and financial. Also migrants and internally displaced people may be reluctant to seek out the formal system to voice grievances or to receive services because of the fear of being caught, deported, or blacklisted. Capacity Development Strategies Support for legal reforms to eliminate discrimination To address discrimination against migrants and internally displaced people, it is first necessary to ensure that the laws in place follow international human rights standards and norms. After reviewing the laws, efforts can be made to repeal discriminatory laws and ensure that laws are put in place that guarantee and protect the rights of migrants and internally displaced people. For example, governments can be encouraged to adopt international conventions and treaties protecting migrant workers as well as incorporate the Guiding Principles into their policies regarding internally displaced people. Capacity development of law enforcement personnel and agencies Police, judges and lawyers can be sensitized to be more aware of the rights of migrants and internally displaced people. Law enforcement personnel and agencies should also be sensitized to avoid discriminatory attitudes and actions (e.g., racial profiling). This can be done through workshops and training programmes that encourage them to think through the consequences of their actions. For example, in Europe, the European Commission has set up a programme called NGOs and Police 169 Chapter 6: Disadvantaged Groups Conflict-induced and Development-induced Displacement \u201cThe two forms of internal displacement of critical concern in Asia are conflict-induced displacement and development-induced displacement. Indeed, the two are often linked. Forced displacement caused by development policies and projects often produces internal conflicts and violence within societies, especially over land and resources, directly leading to conflict-induced displacement. Violations of human rights, whether civil, political, economic,social or cultural,often accompany both kinds of displacement.\u201d Summary Report,Regional Conference on Internal Displacement,Bangkok Thailand,Feb 22-24,2000 Basic Human Rights for Migrants and Internally Displaced Peoples As the International Convention on Protection of Rights of the Migrant Worker and the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement note, these instruments merely reaffirm that migrants and internally displaced people are entitled to the same basic human rights guaranteed to all. Though States may have different policies regarding immigration,they still need to adhere to overall human rights standards and follow their guidelines in developing laws and polices related to migrants and internally displaced peoples. Against Prejudice (NAPAP), which seeks to educate police about migrant issues by encouraging members of minority ethnic groups to take part in the training courses, as well as encouraging local immigrant groups to run day courses for the police, promoting social integration of immigrants within the community, and making police more aware of the problems that arise in a multicultural society.15 Support and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74f3d676-8e00-4bd0-9a3c-6010a6202f41": {"__data__": {"id_": "74f3d676-8e00-4bd0-9a3c-6010a6202f41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c48961c5090f310a3111c28d3033e67ec607456504f3eee124e2ef483f6e6740"}, "3": {"node_id": "3ad5da4c-cc45-4fa7-b757-c158f69b1a07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "011276fd7a6a4883eb1a53cfbac9f6f7ef8569c12d384947a3e1a9800097ce8d"}}, "hash": "4ad73d84938cca59ef83dc00ee0913a68369f5bc802869f5c2b2d04042603514", "text": "strengthen community dispute resolution mechanisms Migrant and internally displaced communities may have their own dispute resolution mechanisms that they prefer to use rather than pursuing formal legal mechanisms. Decentralized non-formal justice systems can be encouraged, especially within the community, as long as they don\u2019t contradict the justice system already existing in the country and conform to human rights standards.In addition, specific courts can be set up that are more accessible for migrant and internally displaced populations. Support for civil society organizations that work with migrant and internally displaced populations As migrants and internally displaced people can be hard to reach populations,civil society organizations (CSOs) can be useful in providing assistance to these populations, especially when they need to navigate their way through the justice system.They may already have a presence in migrant communities and in camps for internally displaced people and may be trusted by the population there. Specifically, they can provide pro bono services, raise awareness and disseminate information about the rights of migrant and internally displaced people, set up help desks that specially cater to the needs of migrant or internally displaced populations, and work to organize these populations so that they are better able to claim their rights from the State. In addition, CSOs can also conduct public education programmes for communities and government personnel on tolerance and respecting diversity as well as counter negative myths and stereotypes (see Chapter 4: Civil Society Oversight and Chapter 5). 6.6 PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS In Asia alone,5.2 million men,2 million women and 168,000 children are living with HIV.16 However, HIV/AIDS is not just a public health issue, it is also a human rights issue.Therefore,HIV/AIDS should also be addressed within a human rights framework. This means recognizing the vulnerability of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and the additional measures that need to be taken to ensure that their needs are addressed and their rights are protected. Unless measures are taken to protect them,PLWHA are likely to face discrimination, be stigmatized, and be denied access to the same opportunities and rights as everyone else. For example, hospitals may refuse to admit them or they may be mistreated by hospital staff, they may face discrimination in hiring practices, they may be reluctant to go to courts for fear of being publicly labelled and stigmatized. Further, when implementing prevention measures that seek to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS, policy makers should ensure that they do not violate the rights of PLWHA.Below are some obstacles faced by PLWHA and some capacity building measures that can help in addressing these obstacles. International Human Rights Instruments The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in 2001 that declared the commitment of States to undertake a coordinated effort to address the problem of discrimination against PLWHA which is also detrimental to social and economic development and compromises human dignity and enjoyment of human rights.The Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS recognizes that HIV/AIDS particularly affects people in developing countries and that those from disadvantaged groups are even more vulnerable to its effects.17 In particular, paragraphs 58-61 of the Declaration make specific references to HIV/AIDS and human rights. The International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights is also a useful document that is relevant when working on programming for access to justice for PLWHA.18 The Guidelines explains the kinds of obligations applicable to duty bearers (especially governments) to which capacity building strategies could be directed. 170 Programming for Justice Access for All 15 L\u00f3pez,Asbel.1999.\u201cPolice Against Racism.\u201dUNESCO Courier.

Fear of consequence of institutional bias HIV high-risk groups such as commercial sex workers (CSWs), injecting drug users (IDUs) and men who have sex with men (MSM), may be reluctant to use the formal justice system when their rights are violated for fear that they will be penalized for their activities. In addition, fear of discrimination by lawyers, judges and other court officials on the basis of their HIV status may prevent PLWHA from seeking remedies from the formal systems. There also may be an inherent bias against PLWHA on trial, thereby influencing the opinion of the judge or jury. Long court processes constitute another institutional barrier for PLWHA in many Asian countries, as sufferers may not be able to attend court proceedings because of their illness, or they may not live to the end of their trial, as the lack of access to proper treatment means many have a greatly reduced life span. Negative social attitudes Negative social attitudes towards PLWHA pervade all sections of society and the justice system is no exception.19 PLWHA may be stereotyped and marginalized because of their HIV status. Law enforcement personnel, judges, lawyers, doctors, and so on may be biased against PLWHA, placing them at an unfair disadvantage when seeking assistance from the justice system. These attitudes may prevent PLWHA from receiving adequate care and support, especially when they need it the most. The stigma faced by PLWHA exists in many variations. The stigmatization they feel may be further amplified if they are also a member of another marginalized group. Members of other disadvantaged groups can also discriminate against PLWHA, even if they are part of that group (e.g., if a woman is also HIV positive, she may not receive the support of other women who are not HIV positive). In addition, PLWHA may also be stigmatized and discriminated against even when they do not belong to other stigmatized groups, e.g., the assumption that all men who have AIDS are MSMs or that all women who are HIV positive are commercial sex workers exacerbates discriminatory attitudes towards them. Lack of technical capacity to provide remedies Legal aid services that are aware of and well versed on the issues facing PLWHA should be established. Support for NGOs conducting outreach programmes to communities that are vulnerable to HIV/AIDs need to be encouraged. Laws, once reformed, also need to be publicized. Further, the lack of adequate facilities for PLWHA needs to be addressed -- not only do PLWHA suffer from outright discrimination, but they are often not provided with the facilities they require within the judicial system.One area in particular that needs to develop greater sensitivity to PLWHA is the prison system. When people from high risk groups are arrested, e.g., injecting drug users or commercial sex workers, the limited prevention measures taken in prisons may increase HIV infection within prisons, through sharing of needles or through unprotected sex. Economic constraints The cost of going through official legal channels often serves as a deterrent for PLWHA in accessing justice, especially when they are already facing high medical costs for their treatment or are unable to work due to discrimination or physical weakness or illness as a result of AIDS. Capacity Development Strategies Support for legal reforms to eliminate discrimination Widespread legal reform should be encouraged in order to protect PLWHA. Non-discrimination and equality before the law are basic protections that should be available to PLWHA. Laws should follow 171 Chapter 6: Disadvantaged Groups Targeted Violence Against People Living with HIV/AIDS Police and powerful criminals in Bangladesh target abuse at commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men and injecting drug users \u2013 all who are at a high risk of HIV infection. Human Rights Watch has recorded cases of abduction, beatings, rape, gang rape, and extortion on the part of the police force. Victims of such types of violence are unable to make official complaints, as their complaints are not taken seriously. They are ostracized from society and have little support when they face such abuses.These types of human rights violations not only expose the corruption of the law enforcement system, but can also serve as a setback in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

These polices should be publicized so that the general public is aware of them and the consequences of discriminatory practices against PLWHA. Confidentially of PLWHA also needs to be protected and adequate measures taken when these rights are violated. Partnership strategies with CSOs and other organizations working on HIV/AIDS, such as UNAIDS, should be promoted. 20 Capacity development for law enforcement personnel and agencies Along with establishing non-discriminatory policies and laws, it is just as important that once these policies are in place they are enforced. Law enforcement personnel and other employees of the judicial system need to be educated about HIV/AIDS and internal policies need to be in place that do not discriminate against PLWHA. In addition, prison systems need to be evaluated to ensure that they protect the rights of PLWHA, i.e. protection of confidentiality, HIV/AIDS education, and access to condoms, clean syringes and treatment. Further, prisoners with HIV/AIDS should not be stigmatized or isolated, while at the same time measures must be taken to protect other prisoners from infection (also see section on Prisons in Chapter 4). Establish a complaint body A complaints body, such as a Commission on HIV/AIDS, could be set up as an oversight mechanism to protect the rights of PLWHA. Further, in addition to monitoring laws to ensure they do not discriminate against PLWHA and working to mainstream HIV/AIDS prevention into government policies, the Commission could also work as a complaints body. This would provide PLWHA with a means through which they could file complaints, which could be faster and less costly than going through a court process. It could also allow them to file complaints anonymously, which would protect their privacy.HIV/AIDS Commissions could work in conjunction with the National Human Rights Commission to lobby the Government to protect the human rights of PLWHA (also see National Human Rights Institutions in Chapter 4). Encourage involvement of PLWHA in the justice system PLWHA should be encouraged to overcome the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS and to become actively involved in promoting the rights of PLWHA including access to justice.For example, they could work with police and law enforcement officials to ensure that sufficient training and education about HIV transmission and prevention as well as on the rights of PLWHA is provided to police officers on a regular basis. Other areas of involvement could include participation in National HIV/AIDS Commissions to promote issues and concerns related to them.They could also become involved in promoting legal aid and raising legal awareness for other PLWHA as well as the community in general, and they could participate in informal systems and be trained as mediators so that community mediation boards become more inclusive. Reforms to Protect the Rights of PLWHA National Human Rights Institutions, NGOs and government agencies working on HIV/AIDS need to lobby for the recognition of HIV/AIDS as not just a medical problem,but as a development problem that has a human rights dimension as well.PLWHA often have their rights violated and organizations should work to reform the legal framework to protect PLWHA from stigma and abuse (i.e. anti-discrimination policies and legislations), investigate complaints of discrimination (in order to enforce the law), as well as educate and advocate for the rights of PLWHA. In India, for example, the National Human Rights Commission organized a conference on National Human Rights and AIDS in 2000 and produced a report with recommendations and action points in order to address HIV/AIDS and human rights.More recently, the National AIDS Control Organization has begun working with a Member of Parliament to develop comprehensive laws that protect the rights of PLWHA and those vulnerable to infection. The process involves, 1) comparative research of other countries\u2019 HIV/AIDS policies, 2) drafting legislation based on the research, 3) undertaking consultation with stakeholders about the legislation, and 4) submitting the legislation to Parliament. To bring about legislative changes and to ensure that laws that have been reformed are enforced, it is necessary to build coalitions across organizations (recognizing the cross cutting nature of HIV/AIDS) and to work towards building political will to implement changes. 172 Programming for Justice Access for All 20 Also see UNAIDS site on HIV/AIDS,human rights and law.[http://www.unaids.org/en/in+focus/hiv_aids_human_rights/unaids+activities+hr.asp].

The sharp increase in HIV prevalence among those who have been in prison points to the urgent need for prison systems to develop clear policies on HIV/AIDS including measures to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS among prisoners. 6.7 PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES People with disabilities include those with intellectual, physical, sensory (hearing, vision, and/or speech), psychiatric/mental illness, or acquired disabilities. People with disabilities are often marginalized and socially excluded. They tend to be older21, poorer, less educated and have less employment opportunities than those without disabilities. In countries like Viet Nam, Laos, Cambodia, and Afghanistan, many people are disabled as a direct result of conflict \u2013 either as a result of combat wounds or due to landmines. Access to justice for people with disabilities often means overcoming obstacles of discrimination, communication, and physical access. They are at a higher risk of becoming victims of crime and exploitation, they may be unknowingly used by others for criminal purposes, they may be denied opportunities because of their difference, and they may lack access to facilities and resources they need, including courts and other legal institutions. International Human Rights Instruments Several international instruments have been formulated to address the rights of people with disabilities, which go beyond just providing social services and rehabilitation. On December 20, 1971, in resolution 2856 (XXVI),the UN General Assembly proclaimed the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons.22 This was followed by UN General Assembly Resolution 3447 (XXX) on December 9, 1975 with the proclamation of the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons.23 Both these Declarations affirm the commitment of member states of the UN General Assembly to protect and promote the rights of people with disabilities and provide the appropriate legal framework and policy measures to ensure that they are guaranteed rights equal to that of non-disabled people.24 The Overview of International Legal Frameworks for Disability Legislation lists a number of additional international human rights instruments relevant to people with disabilities. 25 Challenges Absence of adequate laws and policies to protect people with disabilities As with other disadvantaged groups, people with disabilities need laws that protect their rights.They are some of the most vulnerable members of society and without specific guarantees of their rights, their needs may be overlooked and they may not have any means of protecting themselves when faced with discriminatory practices. 173 Chapter 6: Disadvantaged Groups 21 The elderly are more vulnerable to disease that can result in range of mental and physical disabilities. 22 UNHCHR.[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/m_mental.htm]. 23 UNHCHR.[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/72.htm]. 24 Exceptions for people with mental disabilities can be found on paragraph 7 of the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons.PGeneral Assembly resolution 2856 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971. 25 UN.[http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/disovlf.htm]. Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), access to justice,and the right to health The experiences of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) in South Africa provide vivid illustrations of how access to justice strategies can save lives in the context of promoting the right to health and fighting the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In response to continued pressure by civil society groups and to the rising AIDS crisis,the government of South Africa amended the Medicines and Related Substances Control Act 1965 in an attempt to reduce the price of publicly available drugs, and encourage pharmacists to provide cheaper generic drugs. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA) and 39 drug companies challenged these amendments, arguing that they violated the WTO\u2019s intellectual property rights agreements. TAC then intervened, counter-claiming that the legislation was valid and necessary in light of the government\u2019s positive duty to fulfill the right to health. With the public pressure following TAC\u2019s intervention, the PMA and the drug companies withdrew their case. An indirect result was that the price of anti-retroviral medicine fell from about 4,000 rand a month to 1,000 rand a month. TAC also moved on to try to compel the national and provincial governments to provide antiretroviral drugs to pregnant women to prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to their children.The government appealed to the Constitutional Court, after TAC secured a successful decision. The Constitutional Court acknowledged that it was impossible to provide antiretrovirals to all HIV sufferers immediately, but that the government must make reasonable steps to fulfill constitutional socio-economic rights on a progressive basis.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37b46ff3-1cc9-4213-91af-ae14ff5101fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "37b46ff3-1cc9-4213-91af-ae14ff5101fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "24987212d732395f62f2d5b80330ec27440bf97b18e04bfc665d354157e0638a"}, "2": {"node_id": "02ddbcac-da43-4c29-b2e4-c94a5d7c43c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da8ee685b290eee892c3d996d5b1fecd96a4ed022fd8fb9a38addeec2558ac0c"}}, "hash": "343ff92ad354ec0149bc85e8490ac6de150bc378f947ebfc666a895e1dbc2cb6", "text": "It found that the state policy of not making antiretroviral available at hospitals and clinics was unreasonable.The court ordered the government to take reasonable steps to rectify the situation and to provide testing and counseling services at the hospitals and clinics in question.

Discrimination and exclusion People with disabilities are often negatively stereotyped and marginalized by the rest of society. They are isolated and often made to feel their participation in activities, programmes or public life is not welcome. Law enforcement officials and other employees of the justice system may also have discriminatory attitudes towards people with disabilities, which may serve as a disincentive to using official channels. Also, because of the negative public perception and the social attitudes others have towards people with disabilities , \u2018issues of prejudice, low self esteem, fear of discrimination and retribution and communication problems\u2019 are exacerbated and often crimes committed against them go unreported.26 Lack of adequate facilities The lack of physical access to buildings, public transport, etc. is one of the major obstacles for people with disabilities, preventing them from being able to access the justice system. Introstructure barriers, like the lack of wheelchair ramps or lifts, mean that it is difficult for people with disabilities to even access the court premises and processes. Even if laws are in place calling for all public buildings to be accessible for people with disabilities, it is necessary to facilitate and enforce implementation of these laws. This includes providing funds to make these buildings accessible. Barriers in communication For people with disabilities, especially those with psychiatric, mental, speech, or hearing disabilities, communication with legal practitioners can be very difficult.Legal practitioners may not be able to understand or communicate with their clients, as they may not have the adequate interpretation facilities. \u201cHidden\u201d disabilities such as mental, psychological, and intellectual handicaps may go undetected by legal practitioners, presenting a danger of misrepresentation and inappropriate sentencing. In such cases, it is important to include psychologists or social workers so that when people with disabilities talk to prosecutors they do not implicate themselves unknowingly. Mechanisms should be put in place to conduct proper assessments, especially for people with mental disabilities. For people with hearing or vision-related disabilities participating fully in court proceedings can be very difficult unless interpreters are provided.Further,the formality and adversarial nature of court proceedings may intimidate and hinder people with disabilities from communicating their complaints. This can be compounded by the lack of experience people with disabilities have participating in public life. Lack of awareness/information People with disabilities often suffer from a lack of awareness of their rights and appropriate procedures to demand justice when their rights have been violated. They may not be aware of the options available to them and, if they suffer from psychiatric disabilities,they may not understand or may not be able to make a decision even when their rights are explained to them. They may also be used in criminal activities without being aware of it. In some cases, they may be dependent on family members or be housed in an institution and they may not know who they should get in touch with or how when their rights are violated. Capacity Development Strategies Legal reform To facilitate the ability of people with disabilities to access justice, it is necessary to prioritize the concerns of people with disabilities. Laws need to be instituted that guarantee their basic rights and include special considerations for their needs so that inappropriate sentencing can be avoided. Types of legal and institutional reform include: \ufffdEnsuring unhindered access to public facilities. \ufffdRequiring signage and communication that is sensitive to the needs of people with disabilities. \ufffdInstituting anti-discrimination laws. \ufffdProviding access to professionals such as interpreters and psychologists at all points in the judicial process. As a first step, consultations with people with disabilities about their needs and concerns is one way that the State can get the information 174 Programming for Justice Access for All \u201cDisabled persons shall be able to avail themselves of qualified legal aid when such aid proves indispensable for the protection of their persons and property.

Simplify court procedures Court procedures can be confusing in general, but they are even more intimidating and complicated for people with disabilities (especially mental disabilities).The language used in courts should be as simple as possible and legal advisors must learn to communicate in a way that can be understood by their clients. If necessary, interpreters and social workers should be present to make the client comfortable and facilitate the process. Legal personnel need to be trained to be sensitive to the needs of people with disabilities, avoid discriminatory practices and attitudes, and be aware of the issues they face in order to refer them to appropriate agencies and services. In addition, court delays should be avoided and systems need to be put in place that will expedite the court process. This is a crucial issue for people with disabilities as they often need extra support and care,which the State may not be able to provide for an extended period of time. Offer a range of services for people with disabilities Along with legal support for people with disabilities, it is necessary to ensure that other services are available to them as well.Psycho-social assistance for people with disabilities who are victims of crime, medical psychiatric care for those in need, and economic support for those who are homeless or have no way of supporting themselves are also issues that need to be taken into consideration when addressing the problems of people with disabilities. Facilities for people with disabilities should also be provided for people in prisons and alternative institutions for people with mental disabilities. It should also be recognized that the disadvantages faced by people with disabilities are often compounded by the fact that they face many other obstacles simultaneously. People with disabilities are often poor, can be women, internally displaced persons, HIV positive, and so on, and in such cases, overcoming these other obstacles is even more challenging. It is necessary then, for State and non-State actors, to support people with disabilities and assist in protecting their basic rights so that they are able to access the justice system when they need it. 175 Chapter 6: Disadvantaged Groups Asia and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons The Asia and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons which was originally intended to end in 2002 has been extended for another decade (2003-2012) to ensure that the momentum and progress of the previous decade will be built upon.The Biwako Millennium Framework for Action towards an Inclusive,Barrier-free and Rights-based Society for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the Pacific (BMF) that emerged out of the 1st Decade of the Disabled Person includes specific strategies that nations need to adopt, including those promoting rights-based legislation for disabled people.The strategies include: \ufffd Reviewing and adopting non-discrimination policies \ufffd Encouraging national human rights institutions to protect the rights of people with disabilities \ufffd Actively involving persons with disabilities in policy formulation \ufffd Promoting the ratification of international human rights treaties \ufffd Calling for governments to support the Ad Hoc Committee on a Comprehensive and Integral International Convention on Protection and Promotion of the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities \ufffd Consulting and including the persons with disabilities in drafting laws and procedures that affect them Focus on Ability,Celebrate Diversity: Highlights of the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons,1993-2002 Social Policy Paper No.13,2003 ST/ESCAP/2291 7 JUSTICE IN POST-CONFLICT SITUATIONS C H A P T E R Overview of the Chapter 7.1 The Justice System in Post-Conflict Situations 7.2 Access to Justice and Post-Conflict 7.3 Programmatic Challenges for Access to Justice in Post-Conflict Situations 7.4 Strategic Entry Points in the Post-Conflict Context CHAPTER 7 1 Adapted from UNDP and Chr.Michelsen Institute.2004.\u201cUNDP Background Paper for Working Group Discussions: Governance in Post-Conflict Situations - Justice,Security and Human Rights.\u201dBergen Seminar Series.Tomas,Amparo.2004.\u201cBackground Paper for UNDP Indonesia\u201d,UNDP Indonesia. OVERVIEW OF THE CHAPTER Many countries in the Asia-Pacific region are either facing an ongoing conflict or are recovering from a conflict. This chapter focuses on the specific types of obstacles experienced in post-conflict situations and suggests some entry points for UNDP in improving access to justice in the context of conflict and post-conflict. 1 Post-conflict refers to the aftermath of a conflict and usually applies to post-war situations, but can also include internal rebellion against an authoritarian regime.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be9259b1-db24-478b-9ae7-6ddbae3fd107": {"__data__": {"id_": "be9259b1-db24-478b-9ae7-6ddbae3fd107", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d12b8dc8774e094a14885e99c42c8c90b499c04073fcee4bdaf81b2f481df35f"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb307268-dd16-4d14-8c2f-59cbf4bbfd8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2fe781f462d89497acee3af04148765a8125075e012bfd150dc91a90c67ba22"}}, "hash": "22e6f402e8fc8ef553d483310c74dfc262a87ead64f5c9ac058ae12f944b7cda", "text": "Post-conflict conditions in a country where much of the infrastructure and capacities of the State have been dismantled or severely weakened create a challenging situation for UNDP.

Often in post-conflict situations, there is the added dimension of dealing with human rights violations that may have been the cause of the conflict and have inevitably been exacerbated during the conflict (torture,illegal detention,rape, murder, etc.). For the society to confront the legacy of, and recover from, these human rights abuses it is often necessary to set up a transitional justice system that holds perpetrators accountable and plays a role in addressing the violations of the past and ensuring that the most disadvantaged have access to these transitional systems of justice. If there is no justice accessible in the aftermath of conflict,or if there is only unequal access,the risk of a re-emergence of violent conflict increases. Root Causes of Conflict \u201c\u2026many conflicts are rooted in the real or perceived breakdown of justice where individuals and groups are not able to obtain a fair remedy for their grievances; where political, legal and institutional biases marginalize segments of the population such that they resort to violence. Even where the justice system per se may not be the cause of the conflict, with the continuation and the escalation of the conflict over time, the judicial and legal system generally becomes less able to cope with the injustices of war,thus compounding the perception that the judicial establishment is either unable or unwilling to fulfil the demands for justice. As such, any attempts to facilitate a process of moving from conflict to democratization and/or peace,if they are to be successful,must take into account the causes of the conflict including the absence of an effective justice and human rights mechanism that allows the aggrieved to claim their right to redress.To be sure, the success or failure of UN peacekeeping missions has often hinged on whether a preparatory process involving issues such as criminal justice and human rights protection has been implemented\u2026\u201d From \u201cGovernance in Post Conflict Situations: Justice,Security and Human Rights\u201d,UNDP and Chr.Michelsen Institute,Bergen Seminar Series,Norway,5-7 May 2004. Chapter 7: Justice in Post-Conflict Situations 179 179 179 7.1 THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN POST- CONFLICT SITUATIONS Previous or existing problems faced by the justice system are compounded in situations of conflict, leading to even greater difficulties in being able to provide justice remedies. Court closures, destruction of infrastructure, drastic decreases in the numbers of cases filed as a result of restricted access, and the departure of legal personnel from conflict-affected areas due to fear or intimidation are typical effects of conflict on the justice system. The lack of a functioning system affects the poor and other groups in conflict zones in a number of ways: \ufffdIt creates an environment where small, solvable disputes can lead to broader social conflict; \ufffdThe presence of vigilantes generates localized village-level violence and legitimizes acts of revenge; \ufffdLegitimate grievances of internally displaced populations remain un-addressed, particularly in regards to land and other assets in places of origin; \ufffdAbuses by military, officials, or extremist groups against individuals or groups of individuals are overlooked and the perpetrators are allowed to act with impunity; \ufffdCommunities have limited avenues to claim basic rights such as land, or access to basic services;and \ufffdThe formal court system is perceived as biased on the basis of political and/or ethno-religious identities, and as a result communities do not trust their neutrality, perceive them as unfair, and are reluctant to deal with them. The following sections will begin by exploring access to justice issues in post-conflict situations, then examine programmatic challenges for access to justice in post-conflict situations as well as strategic entry points for UNDP, and conclude by offering some long-term considerations. Direct Impact of Conflict on the Justice System \ufffd Debilitating impact on local governance institutions, including government infrastructure and departure of staff \ufffd Segregation of bureaucracy along ethnic or religious lines \ufffd Militarization of civil administration and decision-making \ufffd Refocusing of policy, programmes and funds on conflict \ufffd Lack of credible institutions through which to channel grievances \ufffd Lack of participation in decision-making increases disenfranchisement \ufffd Lack of faith in policing apparatus leads to militia formation Some General Strategies to Overcome the Challenges: \ufffd Strengthening institutions of democratic governance and increasing participation, accountability and transparency \ufffd Enhancing access to justice to enable disputes to be resolved peacefully \ufffd Strengthening of conflict-sensitive development planning and service delivery 7.2 ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND POST-CONFLICT Access to justice is an integral element of any peace-building and long-term development", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5cd691fb-eb60-433d-9f87-db737a8de715": {"__data__": {"id_": "5cd691fb-eb60-433d-9f87-db737a8de715", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "13768f29cad705bcf1bb59f23f2e13408a3cc5052a606fbd2610dd06bbe1662a"}}, "hash": "13768f29cad705bcf1bb59f23f2e13408a3cc5052a606fbd2610dd06bbe1662a", "text": "process after conflict. Concepts of redress and justice are central to peace, trust and confidence- building. Immediate results need to be balanced with long-term goals and an overall strategy needs to be in place to coordinate recovery efforts. Access to justice is a cross-cutting issue which is present in three major components of conflict prevention and recovery: \ufffdStrengthening mediating institutions. Neutral, transparent and accountable institutions in the justice system are key for effective conflict management and the establishment of trust and confidence among communities deeply affected by conflict \u2013 by assuring them there is no impunity for those who commit major grievances and offences. \ufffdDeveloping capacities in civil society. This allows civil society to manage its own mechanisms for conflict prevention. Informal conflict resolution mechanisms in communities are fundamental for preventing the recurrence of violent conflict. Transparency and accountability of such mechanisms (e.g., through community leaders, and a greater involvement of civil society in reform processes) are critical to ensuring successful peace-building efforts. \ufffdJustice and reconciliation. There is a debate on the extent to which justice and reconciliation objectives in a post-conflict context may undermine each other. However, such goals need not be seen as oppositional, but rather as reinforcing each other. Impunity and the deterioration of the justice system put peace and development at risk in the long-term. At the same time, reconciliation goals demand a careful analysis of the type of \u2018justice\u2019 needed and for whom, taking into consideration the legitimate demands and aspirations of the communities affected. Capacity development of institutions to provide justice and for people to claim remedies needs to go hand-in-hand with strategies aimed at minimizing critical risks influencing the justice process. The significant risks of justice include \u2013 economic loss, physical or emotional injury, social ostracism,etc.Even when the capacities to perform key functions (e.g., legal awareness) exist, people may still consider the risks involved in seeking or delivering justice remedies too great. Risk becomes particularly acute in conflict and post-conflict settings. The influence of risks (such as threats or intimidation) is significant not only for poor and disadvantaged populations, who often live in situations of high insecurity, but also for individual and institutional operators in the justice system \u2013 judges, lawyers, prosecutors, police, etc. Other risks include: \ufffdRisk of recurrence of conflict. This risk increases if the main stakeholders are interested in destabilizing the situation in order to avoid being held accountable or brought to justice. They might also press for amnesties. \ufffdIgnoring the violations committed. This runs the risk, firstly, of not meeting victims\u2019 expectations and thus diminishing their trust in the State, and secondly, of inconsistency with the international framework which outlines the obligations of States and the entitlements of individuals. The longer the abuses are ignored, the more likely they are to damage hopes for peace. 2 Access to justice programming needs to be part of a comprehensive approach towards justice and security sector reform, particularly in post-conflict settings. Therefore, access to justice-related strategies may also involve security bodies such as military and other armed groups. 180 Programming for Justice: Access for All Access to Justice and Conflict Prevention and Recovery in Indonesia The \u2018Strengthening Access to Justice and Rule of Law for Governance, Conflict Prevention and Recovery\u2019 project implemented by the Government of Indonesia and supported by UNDP seeks to undertake an access to justice assessment in five provinces in Indonesia.The assessment has a strong orientation towards conflict prevention and recovery. From a recovery point of view, the assessment aims to clarify what has been the impact of conflict on the capacity of the justice system to deliver speedy, fair and impartial justice, particularly for poor and disadvantaged groups. On the other hand, conflict prevention requires building sufficient capacities in the justice system so that it can provide effective remedies to offences that may breed violent conflict. Thus, from a conflict prevention point of view, the assessment should provide a concrete picture of what are the existing capacities in the justice system with regard to offences that pose risks of outbreaks of inter-ethnic and inter-community violence. 2 International Crisis Group.2003.\u201cAfghanistan: Judicial Reform and Transitional Justice.\u201dInternational Crisis Group Asia Report 45.

The call for immediate results can,however,detract from long-term reform and capacity building. For this reason,efforts should be made to reconcile the need for immediate results with long-term structural reform efforts. While many immediate post-conflict interventions focus on short-term capacity building, infrastructure rehabilitation and transitional justice initiatives (e.g., truth commissions), these initiatives should be part of a broader strategy aimed at developing a legal and institutional framework that focuses on the rights and access to justice of the poor and underprivileged in the mid to long term. How to balance the relationship between traditional and formal/official justice when justice is weakly institutionalized or perceived as alienating by poor and disadvantaged populations Post-conflict justice reforms tend to focus on the formal institutions at the expense of national human rights institutions, traditional justice, customary law and civil society organizations. This is not only likely to diminish the overall impact of reforms (by overlooking critical components of the justice system); it also limits opportunities to strengthen the access to justice of poor and conflict-affected communities \u2013 by ignoring mechanisms which are used by, and are more accessible to, these groups. Poor and conflict-affected communities often prefer traditional forms of justice, which are largely conciliatory, as they help to preserve social cohesion.However,it is important to recognize that traditional justice may not be rights-respecting and is not always consistent with basic human rights norms, e.g., in terms of access by specific groups (e.g., women), due process or punishments. Although the need to balance the relationship between formal/official justice and traditional justice is now widely recognized, development experience in this field is limited (See Chapter 4: Informal Justice Systems). In line with its UN mandate, UNDP\u2019s support to traditional systems should be guided by minimum standards, particularly with regard to non-discrimination, transparency and 181 Chapter 7: Justice in Post-Conflict Situations Key actors in the Justice and Security Sector (JSS) Community Criminal justice organizations: Police, judiciary (including courts, prosecutors, and defence counsel), traditional conflict resolution mechanisms, and correctional services; Management and oversight bodies: Executive branch of government (presidential and/or prime ministerial); legislative branch of government, including national, provincial, and municipal legislatures/assemblies, their committees and commissions; ministries of internal affairs, justice, defence; financial management bodies (ministries of finance, budget offices, auditor general\u2019s offices); other oversight bodies such as human rights ombudsman, police commissions; civilian review bodies; Military and intelligence services: Armed forces, paramilitary forces, coast guards, militias, and intelligence services; and Non-core institutions: Customs and other uniformed bodies. The above four categories of actors comprise the JSS. However, it is important to also take into account: Non-statutory security forces: Liberation armies, guerrilla armies, traditional militias, political party militias, private security companies; and Civil society: Professional organizations, research institutes and think tanks, advocacy groups, religious organizations, non-governmental organizations, and the media. accountability, and adequate process and punishments. Strengthening linkages between formal and traditional systems (e.g., through appeal to and oversight of the judiciary) can enhance due process and reduce the likelihood of impunity. How to reconcile the need for a comprehensive approach towards justice reforms with a scarcity of resources and limited capacity A holistic approach goes beyond merely strengthening adjudication mechanisms. It also focuses on improving access to these institutions, especially by the disadvantaged; ensuring the establishment of a sound legal basis; and the institution of adequate enforcement mechanisms. Such an approach should involve numerous entities: from the executive to the legislature and from the judiciary to civil society. Scarcity of resources may, however, increase the tendency towards \u2018piecemeal\u2019 reforms. This could not only lead to a less than optimum use of resources, but also to a situation where disadvantaged groups entering the justice system could fall through the cracks and be subjected to serious human rights violations. In many, if not most, crisis and post-conflict countries there is a gap between the level of reforms recommended and the capability of national governments to institute the changes implicit in the reform agenda.3 This may increase citizen\u2019s frustration with the system and exacerbate the potential for conflict.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d616c4c7-8a87-47e5-8d80-d859e98c6baa": {"__data__": {"id_": "d616c4c7-8a87-47e5-8d80-d859e98c6baa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82f5a2f78e1b6ec655c19554b2f92f9dd08a713f2e00a5299e47dcfd148ab335"}, "2": {"node_id": "3593ec6b-0189-42d7-945c-790af3cb1f6d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "01bcf47054d22236741e2c8c063ed92bbd8b69b9e6515fd2d0733f19ea6c2e40"}}, "hash": "7b4001fc7e9807cedd8525896fbc59efbd7280666438b96b876a556d40969ba2", "text": "It is, therefore, of critical importance to focus attention on coordination mechanisms among the different components of the justice system, particularly when these are undergoing simultaneous processes of reform.

Disadvantaged Groups and Situations of Conflict Conflict exacerbates the vulnerabilities of disadvantaged groups. During conflict situations, disadvantaged groups are under increased pressure and stress, and the few social networks for support they may have had often break down. As violence and insecurity increases, there is little protection available for the most disadvantaged and human rights abuses against them increase sharply. For example: \ufffd Ethnic and religious tensions can be heightened; \ufffd Violence against women rises (domestic abuse as well as rape and other gender specific violence); \ufffd Displacement and migration increases as people are driven away from their homes; \ufffd People suffer from increased disabilities as a direct result of conflict, e.g., victims of land mines, psychological trauma, victims of violence, etc., \ufffd Increased spread of HIV as a result of an increase in prostitution during conflict or the use of rape as tool of war; \ufffd People living with HIV/AIDS no longer receive the support or care they need; \ufffd Indigenous peoples and other minority groups may be specifically targeted for violence; \ufffd Women may face additional burdens within the household as many of the men may have left to fight, or may have been killed or may be disabled; and \ufffd Shifting priorities and increased responsibilities of girls results in their being less likely to attend school. In conflict situations, and in the aftermath, strategies that the Government and the donor communities develop need to focus on the least privileged and worst affected section of society which are invariably from disadvantaged groups (see Chapter 6). Lack of Coordination between Judicial Institutions In Timor-Leste, for example, prisons have been flooded with persons whose detention orders have long expired because of the lack of coordination between the courts, the prosecutors, the public defenders and the prisons. resistance to substantive reform processes, particularly by elites and groups whose positions of power may be eroded or subject to stricter controls, as a consequence of such processes. At the same time, political controversies may inhibit donors from engaging in substantive reform processes, creating a tendency toward \u2018superficial\u2019 reform that does not alter the structural conditions under which the justice and security systems operate. A failure to engage in meaningful reforms can aggravate social and political tensions, jeopardize chances for sustainable development,and increase the risk of a reoccurrence of violent conflict. Therefore, there is a need to identify \u2018change agents\u2019 within the justice and security systems in order to strengthen their role and capacities to promote and sustain reform processes. Similarly, potential \u2018losers\u2019or \u2018spoilers\u2019of reform programmes need to be identified, and strategies for their positive engagement or neutralization set in place.

However, the concept of registering private property may vary according to culture, therefore, representatives from local communities must participate in determining appropriate solutions. For example, in the Philippines, UNDP supported the implementation of the Indigenous People\u2019s Rights Act by assisting the National Commission of Indigenous Peoples to map land titles and assist civil society through the provision of paralegal support to communities to enhance their understanding of the law and how to use it. appropriate to the particular setting, such as mobile courts, may be needed, as well as the setting up of legal services and providing human rights protections to returning refugees and internally displaced persons (e.g., citizenship rights, obtaining records, facilitating return, etc.). \ufffdIdentifying critical risks faced by those working in or accessing the justice system (e.g., threats, intimidations, and reprisals), and establishing strategies for minimizing those risks. UNDP could, for example, facilitate dia logue on these issues in order to strengthen protection to judges, prosecutors, defence counsels, police officers, as well as victims and witnesses. \ufffdStrengthening law enforcement as weak enforcement is a critical impediment to sustainable peace-building. However, police reform processes can be extremely difficult and highly political (see Chapter 4: Police). \ufffdFacilitating coordination between institutions in the criminal justice system and disseminating information on ongoing reform processes. Encouraging the establishment of a coordinating committee to address mutual problems can lead to a more holistic approach, enabling reform of the entire justice system. \ufffdEvaluating the impact of training activities related to pro-poor and human rights legislation, and supporting systems for the dissemination legislation and court decisions. A strategic niche for UNDP support may be in (a) ensuring training on pro-poor and human rights related legislation and procedures is incorporated into the professional curriculum of relevant institutions, and (b) evaluating the impact of donor-supported programmes on policy and attitudinal change, and identifying other necessary strategies (e.g., reforms in recruitment systems, improvements in working conditions, etc.). Support Transitional Justice Mechanisms (TJM) Initial considerations when developing activities to support TJMs should include \ufffdAn understanding of the needs of the people who will have to live with the consequences of any agreement on the utilization of TJMs. It is up to each society to negotiate its own path toward truth and reconciliation, and the international community should pursue a policy of \u201csolidarity not substitution\u201d in facilitating justice and peace.4 Therefore, the consultation, participation and empowerment of marginalized groups are crucial for designing effective TJMs. This would also ensure that TJMs have relevance and legitimacy for those they aim to assist. \ufffdAwareness that a single TJM may fail to address all the objectives of transitional justice. Therefore, a combination of TJMs, which consider that the failings of one may impact the other, is advisable. Any combination of TJMs should also take into account existing justice mechanisms and coordination of donor assistance. \ufffdDefining clear and realistic goals - otherwise the danger of unmet expectations could diminish the positive influence of TJMs. \ufffdEnsure due process standards. Realization that in implementing a strategy to provide accountability and justice for past abuses, there is a risk that further human rights violations will be committed. Therefore, respect for due process standards has to be ensured. \ufffdNeed for external oversight of TJMs. Until national civil society bodies are able to effectively carry out this function, oversight presents an entry-point for international involvement. 5 184 Programming for Justice: Access for All Building Support to Undertake Rights-based Police Reform Police reform is part of the mandate of UNDP as it is crucial for ensuring the rule of law.

In addition,the International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) provides suggestions on steps that could be taken to strengthen civil society\u2019s ongoing efforts on transitional justice. These include supporting the networking capabilities of civil society (e.g., through the establishment of a transitional justice coalition,or a transitional justice newsletter). Further, communicating information to affected populations about how violence erupted, without necessarily seeking to lay legal blame, can be critical to preventing the eruption of violence in the future. These types of initiatives may adopt different forms, including the establishment of truth commissions. UNDP access to justice assessments should aim to understand the specific aspirations of conflict affected communities with regard to transitional justice.The ICTJ report from Indonesia,for example, concluded that while almost all civil society institutions consulted agreed that truth-seeking measures are an important part of addressing Indonesia\u2019s legacy of abuse,investigations into past violations are not listed as a priority.The ICTJ report also found that activists had different perceptions of reconciliation. For example, some rejected the idea because they felt it meant forgiving and forgetting the role of the perpetrators and colluding with the political elite. Others felt that human rights violations were a part of the past and must be forgotten if Indonesia wishes to avoid reawakening of old trauma and national disintegration. 6 The existence of militia groups is a powerful impediment to peace building efforts and a major threat to access to justice. The operation of militia groups in post-conflict areas jeopardizes the success of ongoing reform and peace efforts. Exploring the potential initiatives for disarmament, demobilization, resettlement and reintegration (DDRR) of militia groups and initiating dialogue on this issue may constitute a strategic entry point for UNDP support. 185 Chapter 7: Justice in Post-Conflict Situations Types of Transitional Justice Mechanisms (TJMs) Criminal prosecutions: Domestic courts, international tribunals, hybrid judicial mechanisms. Transnational justice mechanisms: Criminal prosecutions and civil suits in foreign courts. Quasi-traditional justice mechanisms: Incorporation of mechanisms or processes that exist outside the formal state framework, as elements of a transitional justice strategy. Commissions: Primarily truth commissions set up on a temporary basis to investigate specific human rights abuses. Lustration/vetting processes: Excluding certain individuals from holding public office or employment through dismissal, forced retirement or establishing certain criteria which must be met by future candidates for public positions. Reparations: Relieving suffering of, and affording justice to, victims to achieve satisfaction through restitution, compensation, rehabilitation and guarantees of non-repetition. Amnesty: Act by which an individual or a group of people is granted immunity from criminal prosecution, and in some cases civil liability, for a crime committed in the past.

Focus on Long-term Stability In post-conflict situations, sustainable capacity building and just self-governance are central to long-term stability.Therefore, the emphasis should be on the development of human resources and on institutional reform which focuses on the most disadvantaged people. Achieving such goals requires the adoption of a constitution to provide legal protection for all individuals and to define the competencies and responsibilities of the State. Further, legal drafting should specify the roles of State actors. Emphasis should be given to drafting the necessary procedure codes to ensure non-discrimination and inclusion of international human rights standards. Not only is it necessary to establish a legal framework which adheres to international standards, it is also important to ensure such a framework can be implemented effectively. This requires that all key actors are accountable, that independence of the judiciary is ensured, and that governance is democratic.It also requires that legal aid systems are in place to assist people in seeking justice, and that citizens have the capacity to monitor the justice system. CSOs also play a key role, and strengthening them will enhance their ability to monitor the judiciary.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc8b7ce0-a8e6-49d7-a45e-d442690cb4b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc8b7ce0-a8e6-49d7-a45e-d442690cb4b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "caade69eacc2fccce29ce6d8289ce514c01e495e0ab27f48fc449e6e1e730064"}, "2": {"node_id": "feda9821-dcbd-4dc8-8cc6-f7b5d5f88fb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "354fefc6ba1c29dd070b9c97ec0237d337c8db66264a97200eb247c6e6c9b92a"}}, "hash": "5ecfdf5de56934c9d709a6499b902cecb1e8d96d3d0e62a4b4bee36bee235e47", "text": "A rights-based approach to programming in post-conflict countries is crucial.

Participation, that is, national ownership of all reforms has to be ensured right from the beginning. Although there may be a lack of capacity, e.g., due to death or displacement of qualified people, meaningful participation is fundamental to sustaining the reforms. \ufffd Enhancing the capacities of duty-bearers to enable them to be accountable involves defining their tasks, improving their administrative capacities and raising their awareness through training. Duty-bearers include staff of ministries, judiciary, prosecutors, quasi-judicial bodies, traditional justice mechanisms, police and law enforcement. \ufffd The principle of non-discrimination calls for a focus on marginalized groups and their needs, as well as their participation and empowerment. The most disadvantaged tend to be minorities, refugees, internally displaced, prisoners, ill and disabled people, widows and orphans. For these groups, formal justice processes may be hard for them to access,perhaps due to lack of knowledge or lack of financial resources. In these cases traditional justice mechanisms may be more appropriate. Further, a gender perspective needs to be introduced into programming as women face particular challenges as refugees or as dependants of ex-combatants (see UNSC Resolution 1325). \ufffd Linkages to international human rights standards are necessary to ensure that basic human rights, especially those of disadvantaged groups, are protected. Linking any approaches to human rights standards means familiarizing those who are part of the justice system or are implementing TJMs with the relevant standards. 189 189 189 GUIDING PRINCIPLES IN HUMAN RIGHTS-BASED PROGRAMMING GUIDING PRINCIPLE WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PROGRAMMING?

The assessment also seeks to find out what has been the impact of conflict on access to justice.That is the reason why the assessment includes both non-conflict and post-conflict areas. \ufffdThe purpose of this mapping is to find out what type of initiatives in access to justice-related fields have already been done by non-governmental organizations in the country, so the assessment can build on existing knowledge. By access to justice, we broadly mean the extent to which people can access the justice system to seek solutions when they are victims of crime,human rights violations and other offences;as well as the extent to which the justice system can provide people with adequate remedies, that is remedies that are in conformity with human rights.

disputes and reach adequate remedies for grievances, using formal or traditional justice systems. The justice process has qualitative dimensions, and it should be in accordance with human rights principles and standards. Adjudication Describes the process of determining the most adequate type of redress or compensation (remedy).Means of adjudication can be regulated by formal law, as in the case of courts and other quasi-judicial and administrative bodies, or by traditional legal systems. The process of adjudication in the formal system includes stages such as (i) investigation, (ii) prosecution, and (iii) decision-making. A basic guarantee in the justice process is that decisions of lower bodies can be appealed at a higher level if one of the parties is in disagreement. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) An adjudication mechanism in which a third party acts as a arbiter, conciliator or mediator between two (or more) parties involved in a dispute. The goal of ADR is to seek conciliation or negotiation among the parties, rather than solving the dispute throughthe involvement of a court. ADR systems can be attached to administrative bodies or to the courts, or they can exist in the community in an informal way (e.g. through village or religious leaders). Traditional systems are generally based on alternative dispute resolution.The use of ADR is a voluntary choice of the parties, who are also free to reject the ADR decision and take the dispute to a formal court of law.In certain instances, the initiation of court procedures requires that ADR has been attempted previously, without success. Capacity Describes the ability to solve problems, perform functions, and set and achieve objectives. Capacities exist at individual, social and institutional levels. Defence Party in the judicial process that seeks to defend a particular person, group of persons, or institution, from the charges presented by the prosecution against them, or to mitigate such charges. Development programming Describes the process of designing and implementing a development initiative through a set of activities that seek explicit goals. Development effectiveness Extent to which development processes produce results that are pro-poor and promote equity. Enforcement Relates to the implementation of orders, decisions and settlements emerging from formal or informal adjudication. Enforcement bodies include police and prisons, and administrative bodies in particular cases. Traditional systems may also have specific mechanisms of enforcement. Enforcement systems are key to ensure accountability and minimize impunity, thus preventing further injustices.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25177365-dabc-4150-a378-2e4a8c595213": {"__data__": {"id_": "25177365-dabc-4150-a378-2e4a8c595213", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "619e9ef63f46c282042880e79a0b5f716a85606d2b6a82380425225a3a73c8eb"}, "2": {"node_id": "d83166ff-635d-415d-8bac-23784db5fc8a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4b286e2d1db566a9252bb324b8c5a952c7a55a28d262bc4f26a0f92238d14a7"}}, "hash": "64cd9f228a8d69c62aa54487e502b3f48ba576f30500711f70a841829bd8bac7", "text": "Enforcement systems are key to ensure accountability and minimize impunity, thus preventing further injustices.

Human rights claims give rise to corresponding duties in others to act in a way that ensures protection. Human rights approach to development A framework for the process of human development that is normatively based on, and operationally directed towards, the development of capacities for the protection of human rights. Investigation Relates to the process of collecting the necessary evidence to initiate justice proceduresagainst a particular person, group of persons, or institution. Investigation can be conducted by the police, or by the police with the involvement of the prosecution. Some institutions (such as ombudsman offices and National Human Rights Commissions) also perform investigative functions. Justice system Includes formal justice institutions and procedures,such as police,prosecution,courts and prisons,as well as Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), and other informal and traditional systems (e.g. a council of elders). The justice system includes coordinationand other arrangements among its different components that influence overall outcomes on access to justice Justice remedy Redress provided by the justice system to a particular grievance. Justice remedies are legal remedies that typically involve a third party (the justice institution or mechanism), whose functioning is also regulated by norms, in settling the dispute. Justice remedies in civil and in criminal justice are different. Civil justice remedies can involve restitution, compensation and other forms of redress. Criminal remedies may also result in penalties and punishments that seek preventive and restorative purposes (e.g. incarceration and community work). On some occasions, civil justice may also involve the award of punitive damages. Legal aid Includes legal counsel and other facilities (e.g.financial facilities through reduction in court fees,translation services for deaf-mute litigants,psycho-social support to victims of trauma) that people need to navigate the legal process. Legal aid is fundamental to reducing the economic, social and emotional risks involved in the process of seeking justice. Legal awareness A person\u2019s knowledge of the possibility of seeking redress through the justice system, whom to demand it from, and how to start a formal or traditional justice process. Legal counsel Includes the capacities (from technical expertise to representation) that people need to initiate and/or pursue justice procedures. Adequate legal counsel serves to facilitate in the case of public defence systems and pro bono lawyering), laypersons with legal knowledge, who are often members of the community they serve (paralegals) or both. Legal counsel is one component of the wider concept of legal aid. Glossary 215 215 Legal protection Provision of legal standing in formal or in traditional law,or both.It involves the recognition of people\u2019s rights within the scope of justice systems, thus giving entitlement to remedies either through formal or informal mechanisms.Legal protection determines the legal basis for all other stages in the access to justice process. Legal protection can be enhanced through:(a) treaty ratification and their implementation in domestic law, (b) constitutional law, (c) national legislation, (d) implementing rules and regulations and administrative orders, and (e) traditional and customary law. Litigant Person,group of persons,or institution,who use the justice system in order to resolve a dispute. Prosecution Party in the judicial process that seeks a decision condemning a particular person, group of persons, or institution. Remedy Measures that redress some of the harm caused by people, institutions or private entities, in the context of disputes and conflicts of interests.

However, such resolve may not be forthcoming in countries where areas outside the capital have long been excluded or marginalized from political power. Local elections can be highly contested, passionate and divisive. Local elections may also have a greater impact on the daily lives of citizens compared to national elections. Indeed, many countries in the Asia-Pacific region have large percentages of voters residing outside major cities in small towns, villages and even islands, where local citizens have personal relationships with candidates and engage with political representatives on a regular basis. Hence, a critical issue for local elections involves trust towards elected officials as well as the election management body/ies. In fact, in order to ensure a sustainable democratic process, all actors in local elections must trust that the administration of an election is free and fair and that the will of voters will prevail. Local election administrations have the ability to be highly visible to local citizenry, and as such supporting, augmenting and ensuring effective and transparent local election management plays an important role for solidifying local democratic processes. On a broader scale, effective electoral administration and organisation can have a positive impact on a country\u2019s democratic health and political stability. It is therefore prudent not only to focus on national events but also on locally managed events as Stringer/Reuters 2 \u2018in democratising societies, without a viable system of local elections, the transition to democracy remains incomplete\u20191. More countries than ever before have sub-national elections at one or more levels in the Asia-Pacific region, with the Maldives and Bhutan holding local level elections for the first time in 2012. However, despite the progress made in establishing these democratic institutions and decentralization frameworks, women continue to participate unequally as candidates, as representatives within the institutions, and also as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ede20578-188e-4292-bc47-45ac96a841d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ede20578-188e-4292-bc47-45ac96a841d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting Local Election Management as Part of an Electoral Cycle Approach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a02cdd9a243c5259e3ff0ca7ff26cb064c53b59fb9a184ee07e5c4e2b937c69"}}, "hash": "2a02cdd9a243c5259e3ff0ca7ff26cb064c53b59fb9a184ee07e5c4e2b937c69", "text": "deliverers of democracy through employment in Electoral Management Bodies (EMB). The Universal Declaration on Democracy adopted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union states that \u201cthe achievement of democracy presupposes a genuine partnership between men and women in the conduct of the affairs of society in which they work in equality and complementarity, drawing mutual enrichment from their differences\u201d.2 While work continues on developing participatory and representative democracies in the Asia-Pacific region, \u2018the transition from a closed to open political system is inherently a long-term and difficult process. National level elections are critical in starting or culminating this process, but they are not enough. Local elections play a critical role in democratization.\u20193 Consequently, effective local election management is crucial to this process. The delivery of technical assistance, capacity building initiatives, and policy advice to EMBs, stakeholders 1 Sisk, Timothy D \u2013 Democracy at the Local Level: The International IDEA Handbook on Participation, Representation, Conflict Management and Governance, 2001 2 http://www.ipu.org/cnl-e/161-dem.htm 3 Sisk, Timothy D \u2013 Democracy at the Local Level: The International IDEA Handbook on Participation, Representation, Conflict Management and Governance, 2001 and other actors involved in election management in the Asia-Pacific region is often viewed from a national standpoint: national, legislative, parliamentary and constitutional processes have tended to be main areas of focus, while the management of local elections has often been underrepresented. To date, only a few UN technical assistance programs have been designed to specifically support local election processes in the Asia Pacific region. Examples include: UNDP\u2019s 2003 Assistance Project to Support Suco (village) Elections in Timor-Leste; and the 2005 Aceh Local Elections Support (ALES) project.4 A broader understanding of the differing modalities of local election management \u2013 beyond an election event \u2013 can lead to strengthening local election institutions as well as play an integral role in enhancing broader national governance. Well managed local elections as well as increasing transparency and credibility at the local level may also strengthen a state\u2019s broader democratic standing. While the election event itself is the most visible part of an election process, capacity can only be built around the electoral cycle and outside the event itself. Mapping local election management, gathering lessons learned, identifying best practices and creating a south to south local election reference tool will hopefully lead to enhancing local electoral cycles. However, it must be noted that modalities for supporting local election cycle development, processes and administrations will vary in different country contexts. For example, most countries in the Asia-Pacific region are at different stages of decentralization, electorates massively vary in number and election timetables differ. Also, local electoral 4 A number of projects, as part of a broader national approach, refer generally to local elections, though only a limited number of projects are tailored specifically for local elections. 3 administrations \u2013 even within one country \u2013 may have contrasting mandates as well as varying levels of independence, local election administrations can be permanent or temporary, local electoral law is often at different stages of development and varying security environments prevail. Countries such as Timor-Leste or the Maldives are at early stages of decentralization and face challenges relating to staff capacity, civic education, and legislation. Both countries have concurrent local election cycles and due to their size, both nations are in a position to receive targeted, lower cost and hands-on technical assistance beyond the capital if necessary. As of 2012 Afghanistan was yet to hold constitutionally required local elections and issues relating to constituency boundaries, the electoral timetable, voter registration, civic understanding as well as capacity for local administrative and election staff all require attention. Indonesia \u2013 which has seen two rounds of local elections \u2013 faces legal, capacity, transparency and voter registry issues. Some provinces in Indonesia have received a large degree of technical support with other provinces receiving very little. In Pakistan, all four provinces are developing a new legal framework for local elections which may decentralise local election management to independent local bodies. Pakistan\u2019s election commission will therefore need to balance any new framework and associated timetable with its national election obligations. Pakistan also faces voter turnout issues, security concerns and gender challenges. In June 2012, Nepal\u2019s constituent assembly was dissolved followed by proposed plans for a new elected constituent assembly. Therefore significant uncertainty remains in regards to aspects of Nepal\u2019s future local election processes and new federal structure. Clearly, each country in the Asia-Pacific region has a set of characteristics that make every local election unique. However, there are always processes in election management that are cross cutting from which best practices and lessons learned can be determined.

The case studies illustrate how and by whom local elections are managed and include a codified account of lessons learned on local election management. The report also attempts to identify factors contributing to effective electoral management at the local level and provides specifics on best practices by local EMB\u2019s in addressing electoral violence, conducting electoral dispute resolution, gender mainstreaming in EMBs and promoting gender sensitive activities in relation to voter and civic education and voter registration. Approaches suggested in this paper may seem entirely specific or vastly generic. However, countries of similar size yet in different stages of democratic development may have much to learn from each other. This paper identifies common areas of best practice and describes examples of best practices that may be shared in a regional context to enhance the management of local elections, avoid electoral violence and fortify gender inclusion. This will in turn promote inclusive processes and effective electoral institutions within the broader context of democratic governance. 4 Overall the following six policy recommendations are presented in the paper: (1) Analyse election laws. Suggest creating a unified election law and/or reducing inconsistencies between laws. Produce an analysis of practical considerations on how electoral management bodies are able to implement elections aligned with legislative requirements in terms of timing and resources. (2) Build local level capacity and use broader recruitment criteria. If those tasked with implementing local elections have the capacity to deal transparently and maturely with stakeholder grievances, electoral violence can be avoided without required experience and capacity. Mismanaged minor grievances can quickly spiral out of control often leading to unnecessary violence. (3) Focus on civic education. Establishing an effective local government through credible elections often leads to local communities becoming increasingly active in demanding services and holding local authorities accountable. Local elections are therefore a means to achieve the promise of development. In this regard, civic education, as it relates to the responsibilities of local government and the local citizenry, must be maintained as an important strategic activity in both national and local EMB planning. (4) Scrutinize the timing of elections. Unsynchronised election events can lead to election fatigue, difficulties in allocating electoral assistance, challenges in observing and monitoring multiple elections, opportunities for fraud, high costs and decreased transparency. Synchronisation of local elections can lead to enhanced training of staff between election events, improved monitoring, and a reduction of election fatigue. (5) Use local elections as a springboard for introducing new techniques and practices in national elections. Running local elections can be a good entry point to provide opportunities for national election management bodies to pilot activities such as electronic voting and biometric registration. Local elections can also consolidate experience prior to engaging in a national event. (6) Emphasize gender equality in electoral management bodies. It has become international practice to promote women\u2019s participation in elections as political candidates for achieving balanced representation in national parliaments. Even though increasing women\u2019s participation in the development and democratic agenda through political representation has gained legitimacy, a lack of ownership amongst women still exists in the delivery of democracy through elections at the local level. Gender mainstreaming, including recruitment and career development paths targeting women in electoral management bodies, is vital for ensuring gender equality in all stages of the electoral cycle. 5 Defining local elections and who manages them and executive positions occurring outside regularly scheduled local elections are included in the definition. The nature of the EMB, in terms of power concentration or devolution, depends very much on the system of government and frameworks vary broadly both domestically and from country to country. The type of local election system and body responsible for administering local elections will be framed in either national or local legal frameworks. The legal framework may distinguish between powers and functions given to a central or national EMB and The term local election, when used in this paper, can be defined as legislative and executive elections conducted at the sub-national level5.

One main challenge is that local elections are often administered on a different timeline and/or according to a different framework with the division of electoral responsibility for local elections divided between bodies at different levels. As such there are many different models that local elections can be administered through and a complex myriad of EMB models exist. For example, EMBs at the local level may either be decentralized, centralized, permanent or temporary. In federal countries, separate EMBs may exist at the national level and in each state/province, often operating under different legal frameworks and possibly implementing different electoral systems. Both the national-level and provincial-level EMBs may have separate, devolved structures. The nature of the relationship between such EMBs and the powers and responsibilities of each EMB depend on the provisions of the law. In addition, local executive and legislative elections may also be overseen by different bodies. In some cases, local elections may be entirely community run, falling outside of any formal legal framework. Elections at the local level may also be direct or indirect, with electoral colleges being created wielding the power to make local government appointments. And finally some countries have EMBs that exist in the election period only, or rely on skeleton staff to take them through non-election periods. There are advantages and disadvantages for permanent and temporary EMBs at both the national and the local level. For example, while permanent EMBs might cost more to run they have the advantage or being able to implement a broader electoral cycle mandate more efficiently and effectively. Temporary EMBs are also less likely to have organisational continuity and not maintain the \u201celection memory\u201d from previous electoral cycles and events. In short, the management of local elections presents specific challenges that need to be more readily understood so that EMBs are better able to manage all elections as part of a broader electoral cycle approach. 7 Objectives of this paper: Operational management vs. local electoral system design the modalities of local electoral management are governed by a legal framework from which an EMB will ultimately develop operational practices. Tasks falling within this domain include: developing budgets; human resources; staff recruitment and retention; training; capacity building; planning for and undertaking field operations; voter registration; voter registry updates; political party registration; candidate nomination; campaign management; civic and voter education; polling operations; complaints; Prior to presenting an analysis of local election management and specific case studies, it is prudent to set out the area of local election management this paper will focus upon. Two priorities to choose from include operational and administrative management by an EMB during the full electoral cycle, or local electoral system design and its impact on election management. Both areas have an important but different impact on local democracy and electoral management. First, Stringer/Reuters 8 counting; results management; and audits. Each of these tasks forms part of the electoral cycle. They are governed by election law and are integral to local election management. They are easily observed and the design and timing of their implementation can have a great impact on the quality and transparency of any given election, whether local or national. Second, the electoral system6 used to elect local governments will affect the type of local government elected (inclusion/exclusion of minority and ethnic groups, political or apolitical administrations, levels of autonomy, etc.). For example, legislation guaranteeing seats to women has been the chosen method by some countries in the region to ensure gender balance in local legislatures. Countries with sub-national quotas such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and India all have higher levels of women\u2019s local political participation than countries without quotas. In line with this, local governments often have the ability to introduce new legal frameworks \u2013 whether executive or legislative \u2013 which alters the modalities of running an election or the type of election system. This can potentially affect electoral impact as it relates to areas of ballot design, election timing, EMB secretariat composition, budgeting and even EMB independence. Thus, the link between election systems and the type of local government elected cannot be overlooked when considering management of local elections, particularly when decisions by local governments impact the legal framework governing election operations. 6 Electoral systems may include: plurality/majority systems (First Past the Post, Block Vote, Part Block Vote, Alternative Vote, and Two Round Systems); proportional systems (List Proportional Representation, and Single Non Transferable Voting); mixed models (Mixed Member Proportional and Parallel systems) and others such as SNTV.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e97031f-9aff-4bc9-a6a7-66fa577de2fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e97031f-9aff-4bc9-a6a7-66fa577de2fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting Local Election Management as Part of an Electoral Cycle Approach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "392ad3198214cfa362e7409bc43e6ff6344a8d0ecc16ed145c5129749169f7f7"}}, "hash": "392ad3198214cfa362e7409bc43e6ff6344a8d0ecc16ed145c5129749169f7f7", "text": "However, it is beyond the scope of this paper to analyse local electoral systems and laws vis a vis the form of local governments elected in the Asia Pacific region. It is also an issue that has been examined in the second edition of the UNDP publication Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions: A Practitioner\u2019s Guide. This report will instead cut across sections of the who, what, when, and how of local elections7: The who, referring to individuals standing for office, voters, and \u2013 significantly for this paper \u2013 election officials, the media, civil society and observers; the what, referring to the institutional forum for which elections are held (executive or legislative bodies); the when, referring to the timing of elections and finally, the how, referring to how voting occurs, i.e. the election system of choice \u2013 but also significantly for this paper \u2013 the administrative aspects of running an election. This paper will therefore refer to all four elements, but look specifically at election management vis a vis election officials, media, civil society, election timing and administration. Within this framework, the report also focuses its scope on gender inclusion at the local level in two areas: first, the presence of women in local election administrations and second, the participation of women as candidates in local elections. In particular, the report investigates how election commissions in the Asia-Pacific region have augmented the number of women serving as election officials as well as best practices used by local electoral authorities to encourage women\u2019s participation in elections as candidates. 7 Sisk, Timothy D \u2013 Democracy at the Local Level: The International IDEA Handbook on Participation, Representation, Conflict Management and Governance, 2001 9 Challenges with providing support to local elections another.8 In some countries, the timing of assistance is further complicated by local elections in various regions not occurring on the same date. The impact of election schedules is discussed further in the next section. 8 Local elections for legislative bodies are often held on the same day, nationwide. Local executive branches of government are often elected on separate days and on separate cycles. For example, in Indonesia, governor and mayoral department elections will often fall on separate months or years in varying provinces and districts. Additionally, different EMBs manage the executive and legislative elections, respectively. Different countries employ different modalities of administering local elections. This can impact on the delivery of elections and the provision of technical or other assistance through an electoral cycle approach. Election timing: Local elections may be out of sync with national election cycles and fall between national events. Local elections for executive or legislative bodies may also be out of sync with one Nayan Tara/UN Photo 10 Mandate for local elections: In some countries such as Afghanistan and Indonesia,9 different bodies are responsible for administering local and national elections. The task of managing a local election can therefore fall to varying actors, including the national election management body, the MoI, or independent local election commissions. As such, consideration must be given to methods for running two concurrent cycles and support extended to bodies responsible for managing these elections. This will affect where, how and to whom an Electoral Support Program \u2013 especially one with limited human and financial resources \u2013 should provide technical assistance around the electoral cycle. Timings and mandates \u2013 multiple interactions: When looking at the management of local elections and the delivery of technical assistance, single or double interactions within one or multiple time- tables should be considered. National and local elections may be held simultaneously or in isolation. Such elections may be run by the same national election management body (NEMB) or by multiple local election management bodies (LEMB). As such, these two axes can interact in different ways: \u2022\ufffd One cycle one EMB: one election manage- ment body (NEMB) may run all elections at the same time \u2022\ufffd One cycle, multiple bodies: multiple authorities (NEMB and LEMB) may run national and local elections at the same time 9 In Afghanistan, Community Development Council elections (while not the constitutional bodies for district governance) are administered through the Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development and in Indonesia, the KPU administers national, and legislative elections, though independent provincial bodies administer local executive and village elections. \u2022\ufffd Multiple cycles multiple bodies: multiple authorities (NEMB and LEMB) may run national and local elections at different times (multiple cycles, multiple bodies).

Consideration must be given towards implementation of other support activities such as BRIDGE10 trainings or other capacity development work, GIS mapping exercises, reviews of electoral legislation, advanced strategic planning, lessons learned workshops, linking civil and voter registries, south-south exchanges, and study trips. Depending on who administers an election as well as forthcoming elections, any assistance provider may have to prioritise their focus on supporting either national or local events. Multiple bodies running multiple cycles, particularly at the local level, will impact management, budgeting and planning. For example, should voter registration take place at the national level to coincide with national elections or will frequent, tailored, localized efforts be required?

Educational assistance programs will also be affected. A technical assistance provider may have to support geographic training programs rather than national programs, requiring additional human resources and increasing costs. The principle question regarding use of the electoral cycle will be whether and how to support general programs as opposed to local programs. Producing an answer to this question will be easier if an Electoral Support Program has to work with a single administrator such as a NEMB and its local offices. If working with the MoI, the assistance provider may have to work around existing cycles of ministry work. If working with independent local bodies, assistance programs may have to focus on smaller individually tailored programs. 12 Factors affecting local election management in the Asia-Pacific region elections; the prevailing security environment; media and stakeholder relations; the presence of gender policies; EMB permanence; EMB oversight; and coordination mechanisms. A summary is outlined below. Period since decentralization: The distance a country has travelled down a decentralization path will have a direct impact on its local election management capacity and practices. While many Methods ensuring effective local election management such as incorporating gender into EMB administrative structures, developing gender sensitive activities, communication between layers of electoral management, addressing electoral violence, and conducting electoral dispute resolution will vary from country to country. These thematic areas may be affected by such factors as: time-frame since decentralization; municipality size; uniformity of electoral law; election timing; mandates for running Navesh Chitrakar/Reuters 13 countries in the Asia-Pacific region have a history of controlled decentralization and forms of executively appointed local governments, no country in the area has a long history of direct local elections. However, some are more advanced than others. Sri Lanka (1987), the Philippines (1991), India (1993), the Republic of Korea (1995) and Thailand (1997) are examples of countries with established decentralization laws and democratically elected local institutions. They have undertaken several local election cycles during which each election management body has been able to incorporate lessons learned and best practices into their respective management models. These countries are often leaders in South-South best-practice exchanges and have experimented with technological approaches to administering elections. They have also undertaken significant steps in pursuing gender sensitive practices, espoused independent models for running elections, and have established professional secretariats. However, having a (recent) history of decentralization is not necessarily an indicator of effective local election management. Recent violence and patronage networks influencing Thailand\u2019s local elections exemplify the importance of transparency in election management, effective dispute resolution and avoidance of violence. Questions over local poll rigging and electoral violence, as experienced in the Philippines and cases of unregulated campaign financing and a lack of accountability in the Republic of Korea also raise questions. Countries such as Indonesia (2004) and Timor-Leste (2004) have recently passed decentralization laws and are both now entering the second cycle of local elections. In these examples local administrative and electoral laws are being designed and adapted, capacities of local institutions/secretariats are being built and physical infrastructure is being constructed. Other nations are either starting or re-starting direct local elections. For example, following the establishment of a democratic republic in 2008, the Maldives administered its first local elections in 2011 by replacing executively appointed island chiefs with democratically elected local councils. The elections experienced a high voter turnout even with limited human resource capacity, inefficient counting procedures and low levels of civic education.

However, local elections have yet to be administered as of October 2012, as scheduling issues and low voter turnout have proven to be major barriers. Afghanistan,11 with its unconstitutional district community development councils and Nepal, which is deliberating a new federal structure have also not held elections as of 2012. Number of municipalities and population size:12 Seven of the world\u2019s fifteen most populous countries lie in the Asia-Pacific Region. It also holds some of the world\u2019s smallest nations.13 In countries such as the Maldives, Timor-Leste, the Solomon Islands, and Fiji, a small electorate spread over a small number of administrative divisions makes micro-election-management at the local level possible. In Indonesia, which has provincial, regency, district, sub, district and village layers, 11 With the exception of Provincial Councils elections held in 2005 and 2010 12 See Annex 1: Local Election Matrix, for more details on the administrative set up and challenges of a selection of EMBs in the Asia-Pacific region 13 The largest: China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Vietnam to the smallest: American Samoa, Tonga, Kiribati, Samoa, the Maldives and the Solomon Islands 14 even the lowest level (village) could be larger (area and population-wise) than the entire Maldivian or Fijian nation. The Philippines, Pakistan and Bangladesh also have multiple, highly populated, administrative divisions. Therefore, if an EMB secretariat of limited size is overseeing an election for a 400,000 person constituency as opposed to a 900 person constituency, management standards and communication will likely be affected, particularly when EMB secretariats are freshly recruited and inexperienced. Additionally, larger countries require larger numbers of EMB staff who need to be recruited and trained. In such circumstances, finding sufficiently qualified or adequately educated staff may be an issue, particularly at the polling station level. For example, in Afghanistan and some areas of Pakistan, illiteracy rates amongst female populations prove to be an obstacle for recruiting female polling staff. Furthermore, in countries with multiple administrative and election management layers such as Indonesia and Bangladesh, communication and coordination will become increasingly complex, especially with involvement from governmental departments. Challenges in countries with smaller populations also exist. In the Maldives, the EMB has had difficulty maintaining core local election staff. In some island constituencies, a combination of high staff turn-over and small constituent populations led to hiring officials from \u2018outside\u2019 an island, rendering the expansion of local capacity for future elections difficult. However, the Maldivian EMB has been able to hire a greater proportion of women at the local level though this is not reflected in upper levels of senior management. Uniformity of election law: While existing legislation for general and local elections will affect local election management, remaining laws under legislative or parliamentary consideration may indefinitely delay local elections. This has been the case in Timor-Leste, where the delivery of municipal elections has been delayed for several years. Similarly in Pakistan, draft local election acts, awaiting promulgation by provincial assemblies, have set-back union council elections. Late promulgation of legislation may also not allow sufficient time for new procedures to be communicated to the local level, creating space for the manipulation of election procedures. This is exemplified in Indonesia where updated regulations for the complaints body (panwaslu) were only put in place mid-way through the local electoral process. Moreover, the continued revision of electoral laws may produce a profusion of laws resulting in contradictory procedures communicated to lower levels of election management within given timeframes. A set of non-unified laws may permit contradictory technical processes or allow for political interference in the form of quick reforms favouring an incumbent candidate, thereby undermining the credibility of the election. Local elections in Aceh, Indonesia in 2012 exemplify this situation. The incumbent governor who was elected in 2006 on an independent ticket14 was a member of the officially recognised Party Aceh. In the lead up to local elections the said candidate was pushing reforms that would only allow politically aligned candidates to stand for election, thereby blocking his principal rival who remains unaligned. 14 The law on political parties in Indonesia at that time only allowed political parties that were nationally based, and the incumbent governor, then a member of the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), would not have been permitted to stand in the 2006 elections. To counter this problem, faced by many potential candidates, the local election law was amended to allow independent candidates to stand for election. 15 In Timor-Leste, the theme of unified laws resurges as Presidential, Parliamentary and Village (Suco) elections require the passing of a separate piece of legislation prior", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14b0c39f-6990-438f-be82-5457ba2365ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "14b0c39f-6990-438f-be82-5457ba2365ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting Local Election Management as Part of an Electoral Cycle Approach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87f556048214d05e5fd3495b094cbc03650ae3fa6c9d18883e76d86f1569d1a1"}}, "hash": "87f556048214d05e5fd3495b094cbc03650ae3fa6c9d18883e76d86f1569d1a1", "text": "to each election. The pending of the municipality election law has delayed the start of official local electoral processes. In Pakistan, a \u2018currently inaccessible and fragmented set of laws make up the country\u2019s election legislation15\u2019 thereby impacting the electoral processes and their administration. Therefore, it is likely that a single electoral law would not only foster stability, but would also assist the EMB in fulfilling its mandate more efficiently. Regardless of whether a single or a set of separate electoral laws exists, the need to establish rules and regulations well in advance of an election as well as not permitting changes or amendments in the run up to an election will enhance electoral integrity. Election schedules: Regardless of the size of a country, decentralised structures accompanied by staggered local election schedules may lead to problems with oversight as well as communication between layers of election management. Local election administration may often be deemed as free, fair and transparent. However, without systematic monitoring, it is often difficult to ascertain if this is actually the case. Such was the situation during the 2004/2005 village elections in Timor-Leste and in more recent Indonesian local elections. Polling processes taking place over multiple phases were not entirely unobserved but lacked thorough and comprehensive oversight. However, staggered election schedules are not the only reason for poor oversight. During Afghanistan\u2019s 2006/2007 Community Development 15 FAFFEN \u2013 Election Law Reform Project \u2013 A Unification of Pakistan\u2019s Legislation including Model Provisions for Electoral Reform Council elections, a lack of basic capacity limited domestic observation16. Holding multiple elections over a drawn out period also increases costs. If current schedules are adhered to, Afghanistan will only have three election free years between now and 2025, duplicating efforts and increasing electoral expenses.17 While the 2004/2005 Suco (village) elections in Timor-Leste were staggered by twelve months, the 2009 process was completed in one day, greatly increasing efficiency and reducing costs. Between 2005 and 2008, Indonesia held nearly 500 staggered local elections. While the immense scale of the country makes this situation somewhat understandable, it still generates a high price for holding local elections. In addition to these points, if a local electorate is bombarded by multiple local executive and legislative elections, in addition to national elections all staggered at different times, it creates perfect conditions for election fatigue and voter apathy. This outcome also stands true for assistance providers. Security: While not pertinent to most countries in the region, the prevailing security environment will certainly influence the ability of election management bodies to undertake voter registration updates, implement effective civic/voter education, train staff, schedule and hold local elections. While the non- establishment of new district divisions in Afghanistan has been stated as a reason for local elections being postponed, eleven EMB staff were killed during 16 The Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan (FEFA) has undertaken four national observation missions (2004, 2005, 2009 and 2010) 17 The Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan in announcing the 2014 electoral calendar, has shifted the Provincial Council elections from 2013 to be held jointly with the 2014 Presidential elections, citing reduced costs. 16 one district election officer out of seventy five was female illustrating how the Elections Commission of Nepal has a long way to go to ensure gender equality in its management practices. Media relations: An election management body\u2019s relationship with the media is fundamental, not only for reasons of transparency but also to raise public awareness of, and confidence in, the electoral process. By utilising the media, an EMB can also have an important role as provider of gender sensitive coverage during elections and mitigate electoral violence. During Aceh\u2019s 2006 local elections in Indonesia, the EMB utilised an Information and Media Centre to hold regular press conferences, press tours, and public events. It also produced a wide range of voter information materials. However, media centres tend to be dependent on donor funding and for the 2012 local elections, with less donor support, the Aceh media centre appears to be a shell of its former-self. Moreover, in less \u2018high profile\u2019 Indonesian provinces, EMBs do not have such a tool. Most local EMBs in the region will neither have funds nor resources to set up physical media centres, though coordination with local media can and should be maintained. EMB professionalism and outreach to stakeholders: Insufficient outreach by local election commissions, poorly trained staff, biased local election organisers and inexperienced local EMB commissioners, are factors contributing to electoral violence. During Indonesia\u2019s local elections, violent incidents have been linked to shortfalls in administrative and management leadership.

Gender focal points: Long standing cultural and religious biases have been obstacles towards the participation of women as electoral administrators in the Asia-Pacific region. As a result, gender mainstreaming policies within election management bodies are unusual at the national level and even rarer at the local level. Even where these policies formulate official parts of an EMBS strategic plan, the policy implementation process is usually slow and not granted priority. In Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea and Pakistan, EMBs have made efforts around election events to call for female polling stations and encourage female polling staff. However, these reforms were not reflected in the EMB leadership and management positions. The Maldives is a unique example as no internal gender quota for EMB or poll worker staffing exists, yet the majority of local level polling booth staff are female. However, when moving up the management chain, few Island commissioners are female and a lesser number are present within the decision making bodies of the national commission. The establishment of gender focal points within EMBs to advocate for the appointment of women as election administrators is an implemented measure in some Asian countries. The appointment of local level gender focal points within Afghanistan\u2019s provincial election commissions and the establishment of a gender focal point within the Election Commission of Nepal are examples of EMBs beginning to take the issue more seriously. However, in March 2012, only 17 Many countries have taken steps to address these issues. In Bangladesh, the lack of adjudication of complaints had been a consistent weakness in the local electoral process, yet in 2009 when evidence was found which questioned the independence of local officials overseeing sub-district (upazila) elections, the EMB was able to bring neutral employees from other geographic areas of the country. This practice restored public confidence in the complaints process. Similarly, following allegations of fraud during Afghanistan\u2019s 2009 provincial council elections, efforts were made to remove and rotate local staff. Moreover, as a result of high levels of intimidation and in reaction to heavy criticism for the manner in which complaints were handled during the 2002 Commune Council Elections, the Cambodian National Elections Committee engaged with political parties and civil society to clarify the complaints process. It also targeted local offices with specific complaints training. Oversight, transparency and coordination: Transparency and oversight are important to civic and political confidence in local election processes. Monitoring is normally the premise of national and international civic or governmental organisations, though election management bodies should also have their own, internal, monitoring and evaluation structures. Some countries also use oversight bodies, such as the Panwaslu18 in Indonesia and National Election Commission (CNE) in Timor-Leste. Transparent election management bodies will increase the confidence of monitors, civil society, the media, citizens, and political parties in the process. No matter the quality of an election management 18 Some commentators have noted that the presence of state supported oversight and monitoring bodies in Indonesia, actually discourages civil election monitoring organisations. process, if access is denied, purposefully or as an unplanned oversight, the quality of the election and trust in the electoral process will be diminished. The extent to which all stakeholders (political parties, civil society, media, police and judiciary) have access and \u2018buy-in\u2019 to any given election process will not only increase public trust but will also enhance the ability of a local EMB to engage in dispute resolution. Transparency, or just as importantly the impression of transparency, throughout the election cycle is critical. No matter how well an election is administered or technically executed, an election process will be criticised by stakeholders if they not adequately engaged in the process. During the 2008 and 2009 Presidential and Parliamentary elections, the Maldivian EMB, through its National Advisory Committee for Elections19, opened its doors to stakeholders for several months prior to and after the election date. Despite administrative and technical shortcomings, these elections heralded as transparent thereby augmenting trust in the transition to democracy. In contrast, during the 2011 local elections, the EMB established an advisory committee just three days prior to election-day. While the 2011 elections were administratively and technically improved, they were criticised heavily for a lack of transparency.

Civil society, political party, human right commissioners and police representatives were invited to be committee members. As well as bolstering the transparency of the electoral process, the commission proved to be a strong platform for resolving electoral disputes. 18 and effective. Therefore, a major component of a functioning local electoral system is a transparent and fair process for resolving electoral disputes. EMBs should play a key role in the preliminary adjudicative process for complaints, especially as inadequate mechanisms for political parties, candidates and citizens to channel grievances, complaints and allegations of fraud can impact local election management and destabilise a broader democratic process. Some countries in the region have well established processes and mechanisms while others lag behind in this regard. Electoral disputes often occur beyond an election event creating significant problems as complaints bodies are often temporary structures, particularly at the local level. In countries such as Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and the Maldives, local complaints bodies have been established one month prior to an election which limits their effectiveness. Despite such shortcomings, since Afghanistan\u2019s first round of provincial council elections in 2005, the EMB has strived to enhance its dispute resolution processes and has given greater autonomy to provincial electoral complaints commissions who have since become empowered decision makers at the provincial level. Additionally, whereas no effective mechanisms were in place to receive and adjudicate complaints, resolve disputes or enforce criminal offences during Indonesia\u2019s first round of elections in 1999, local complaints bodies (Bawaslu) have been established. These do, however, have limited enforcement capacity and are staffed by officials limited to investigating administrative issues, particularly relating to candidate nominations (declarations of health etc.). Another example of handling complaints comes from India, Sri Lanka and Thailand, where in 2011, dedicated call centres were established by the EMBs to receive complaints of electoral fraud for local election processes. 19 Conclusions and General Recommendations Most aspects of local election management including electoral dispute resolution, complaints processes, and gender sensitive practices are similar to those of national election management. National and local election management both present similar challenges and needs. Levels of support may depend on which body is responsible for managing local elections and if an assistance provider has the capacity to work with one national body or multiple independent local bodies. A top to bottom approach, through a national EMB with subordinate sub-national The timing of local electoral events, the scale of a local election, assessments of the political impact of a local election, and the body tasked with managing local elections may influence support provided to local election management bodies and processes. Support to local elections is more likely to be forthcoming if local election stakes are high. This may affect a country\u2019s stabilisation process as exemplified in Aceh, Indonesia where international support to the 2006 Aceh pilkada local elections was greater than support to the entire 2009\u20132012 pilkada in all of Indonesia. Bobby Yip/Reuters 20 offices, may be a preferable system for assistance providers to operate within. This has been the case in Indonesia, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and East Timor for both national and legislative elections. However, in countries such as Indonesia, Bangladesh and potentially Pakistan & Nepal, where a large number of local executive elections take place or are planned to occur over a staggered cycle, the main issues when considering the provision of support and technical assistance relate to how and where support should be given and what priorities exists. Hence, the selection of national versus local events will have to be considered. If local elections are to receive support, a choice may have to be made between areas of conflict/post-conflict, marginalised or deprived areas, parts of a country with large indigenous populations, etc. If a local area is not in crisis, support to the management of their elections may be marginalised. Support to local level election management may have to be tailored and perhaps can\u2019t be as \u2018encompassing\u2019 as desired. However, when considering the management of local elections \u2013 defined oversight mechanisms, transparent management practices, active coordination, empowered complaints bodies, unification of election laws, enhanced voter registration, synchronised election schedules, effective stakeholder and media relations, and the overall technical capacity of the local election management body must be considered as benchmarks for support and assistance. As such, suggested approaches for future policies in enhancing local election management are outlined below.

Moreover, constant revisions of election laws may further complicate the delivery of elections, particularly as new procedures, legal provisions and systems may impact the transparent delivery of elections. An analysis of election laws and suggestions on possibilities for the production a unified election law covering all elections may assist with building election management capacity bodies and increase transparency of elections. Focus on enhancing EMB capacity at the local level: Training of commissioners, secretariats and polling committees/returning officers is crucial to effective local election management. The establishment of local cadres and a focus on building capacity between election events is a significant element in supporting effective local election management and mitigating electoral violence. As highlighted in the paper, human solutions may be better and more cost effective than technological solutions. Additionally, electoral violence may be readily avoided if local commissions have the capacity to deal transparently and maturely with stakeholder grievances. Without required experience and capacity, minor grievances may be mismanaged and can quickly spiral out of control, leading to unnecessary violence. Gender mainstreaming in electoral administration: A concerted effort to engage women, not only in participating in electoral processes as voters and candidates, but as deliverers of democracy is important to ensure all segments of society have a role in all stages of the electoral cycle. EMBs with gender recruitment and career management policies as embedded components within their strategic plans would strengthen their ability to engage all segments of the community in electoral processes, 21 including engagement with local communities to promote women\u2019s participation at election events. Focus on civic and voter education: With the establishment of effective local government through credible elections, local communities are likely to become increasingly active towards demanding services, holding local authorities accountable and looking at local elections as a means to achieve the promise of development. In this regard, it is imperative that civic education \u2013 in regard to the responsibilities of local government and local citizenry \u2013 is maintained as an important strategic activity in both national and local EMB planning. As such, expectations can be managed, local governments understood, and the importance of peaceful elections underscored. If such steps are taken, participation in local elections is likely to remain non-violent and high. As civic activism tends to be higher in urban as to opposed to remote areas, civic education should have a rural focus. Synchronisation of election timetables: Unsynchronised election events may lead to election fatigue (both amongst the electorate and donor community), difficulties in choosing where assistance may be provided, challenges in observing and monitoring multiple elections, opportunities for fraud, high costs and decreased transparency. Synchronisation of local elections can lead to enhanced training of staff between election events, improved monitoring, and a reduction in election fatigue. Linking local election support and decentrali- zation/governance programming: Where decentralization devolves important service delivery functions to local government, it is important that civic education relates to both the responsibilities of local government and the local citizenry. This is an important strategic activity which should be coordinated between both national and local EMB planning. It would also tie the implementation of elections more closely to broader outcomes of ensuring effective local democratic governance. Balanced support-local vis a vis national elections: Countries with multiple staggered local elections and with an overriding requirement for support to national elections at the expense of local election events should be supported. Areas of conflict/ post-conflict that are marginalised or deprived, or where large indigenous populations reside should also be considered for local election support. The identification of areas where local elections may provide a spring board for new techniques and practices in administering national elections may also be considered. Running local elections can sometimes be a good entry point as they provide opportunities for a national election management body to consolidate experience prior to engaging in a national event. As local elections may have less overall impact, this may provide opportunities to test new practices and programs (such as electronic voting, biometric registration etc.) on a geographic basis. 22 Case Studies Afghanistan Under the Afghan constitution, presidential and parliamentary elections are held every 5 years; provincial council elections every 4 years; and district, municipal & village assembly elections every 3 years. Of these, two rounds of presidential, parliamentary and provincial council elections have been held since 2004. The next tier of local elections beyond the provincial level will require substantial planning and additional capacity strengthening within the electoral commission\u2019s local secretariats.

These districts are further divided into sub-districts containing over 30,000 villages which are often geographically isolated and difficult to access. For multiple reasons such as security concerns, difficult access and the sheer number of remote communities, local level governance and democratic development has been somewhat neglected. As stated in a recent paper by the Afghan Research and Evaluation unit, \u2018substantial resources and effort have been applied to the development of central government structures, though local government has not received nearly the same level of attention.\u201920 This includes strengthening local election secretariats and preparations for management of local elections. With the country still struggling to emerge from decades of conflict, building local electoral capacity 20 Saltmarshe, Douglas and Medhi, Abhilash \u2013 Local Governance in Afghanistan, a View from the Ground, Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit Synthesis Paper, June 2011 Sin Chiu/Reuters 23 will require attention to many aspects of the election cycle. Consideration must be given to: development of legal frameworks enhanced operational planning, further training and educating of staff, extensive public outreach and civic education, the production of accurate voters\u2019 lists, and transparent local complaints mechanisms. Managing a staggered local election cycle also presents significant operational and logistical challenges for election commissions entrusted with administering local elections. The Election Management Body Afghanistan has a nascent and centralised electoral system with one Independent National Election Management Body responsible for national and local elections. The Independent Election Commission (IEC) uses thirty four provincial election offices to hire and train electoral staff, administer elections, undertake voter registration updates and carry out voter education. Presently, IEC administered local elections have only extended to the provincial level with provincial councils elected in 2005 and 2009. The most significant permanent election official at the local level is the provincial election officer (PEO). The next layer of election administrators are district field coordinators (DFCs) consisting of temporary officials recruited prior to an election event. With high levels of illiteracy, no former experience, and limited recruitment oversight, the capacity of local level election officials may be limited. Decentralization and Local Elections While no constitutionally elected bodies currently exist below the provincial level, the constitution makes provisions for election of district, municipal and village councils. Provincial and district governors are executive appointments but the constitution states mayors are to be directly elected. The election law tasks the IEC as the independent body responsible for administering mayoral elections however officially coordinated elections have yet to take place. Some mayoral elections were supported by provincial IEC offices in 2008 and 2009 though most mayoral appointments continue to be direct executive appointments.21 Also, district council elections slated to take place in 2004 and again in 2010 have been left unimplemented largely due to lack of consensus on creating formal district divisions.22 The Government of Afghanistan\u2019s National Solidarity Program (NSP), led by the Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development, undertook a series of local elections for community development councils (CDCs) from 2006 to 2008. These CDCs have effectively functioned as district councils and performed the tasks of local government. CDC elections were implemented by local NGOs and heavily adapted electoral systems to suit local political, gender and security sensitivities. CDC elections fall outside any constitutional framework and have been incorporated into national legislation through by- laws which expand the role of the CDC and provides coordinating and administrative functions beyond the original scope of CDC activities. Challenges and Best Practices Effective local management and commutation between levels of election management: Following the 2005 parliamentary and provincial council elections, local provincial election bodies were essentially cast adrift by support providers as well as the IEC. A majority of the trained secretariat was dismissed. Assets were removed including tools 21 During president Karzai\u2019s inauguration speech in December 2009 he promised that district and mayoral elections would be held, however as noted, a lack of clear district delineation has prevented such elections taking place. 22 Responsibility for such boundary delineation lies with the Ministry of Interior and any new or adapted constituencies will subsequently be communicated to the IEC. 24 for communication with the national IEC. Salaries were slashed and rental payments for offices were discontinued. As such, a skeleton team consisting of a PEO & small administration staff as well as a finance officer remained with no office to base themselves nor coordinate from. This lack of foresight left provincial commissions poorly equipped to administer the 2009 provincial council elections. After a three year pause in local IEC activity beginning with the registration update in early 2009, capacity and assets had to be rebuilt basically from scratch.

Rather than assisting two-way communication between central IEC and the provinces, the new structure often disrupted communication and hindered the activities of provincial officers. During the election events of 2009 and 2010, the IEC\u2019s provincial offices received capacity support in the form of international technical advisers. However, until recently support programs continued to be Kabul centric with only limited workshops targeting provincial offices. From 2012 the United Nations capacity development assistance to the IEC encompassed provincial office staff as well. The provision of provincial offices and warehouses is critical to establishing the IEC as a permanent institution and ensuring a cost-effective and efficient contribution to future national and local elections. This is now being addressed, and by the end of 2013 several provinces will have IEC offices and ware houses built. Each provincial office will be in a position to operate around the electoral cycle if it is provided with a permanent office, sufficient staff and adequate tools. Frequency of elections: The constitution of Afghanistan calls for multiple elections including national, legislative, mayoral, provincial, district and village elections. Currently, these all fall on different cycles. Elements such as limited IEC capacity, reduced budgets, a volatile security situation and the withdrawal of NATO troops (and associated logistic support) also present a significant burden to the IEC and Afghan government. Assuming elections beyond the provincial level proceed, the years 2012, 2018 and 2023 could theoretically be the only election-free years between now and 2025. With turnout for the 2009 provincial council elections hovering around 40 percent, overburdening local communities may induce election fatigue. If the said electoral schedule is pursued, district, village and municipal elections in addition to improved operational and administrative capacity will call for the implementation of additional layers of voter and civic education. Improvements to the dispute resolution practices of the 2009 provincial council elections were relatively successful as the 2010 parliamentary elections experienced increased decentralization of the complaints process. Greater autonomy was given to provincial electoral complaints commissions (PECCs) who no longer served as \u2018mail boxes\u2019 for delivering complaints to the ECC. Instead, PECCs became empowered decision makers at the provincial level. Positively, the PECCs also employed professional law makers. However, short set-up time and rushed training did limit some PECCs ability to effectively adjudicate complaints. During the 2010 elections, PECCs allowed two layers of appeal to increase transparency. The first was carried out at the provincial level and if necessary, a second review was conducted at the central level. No formal complaints of dispute resolution processes were established for local CDC elections. As a recommendation, new policies and structures endorsed by the IEC in 2010 should be adopted for future local election cycles. Staff capacity and institutional strengthening: To combat power and patronage networks 25 experienced during the 2009 provincial council elections, the IEC has introduced a policy of rotating Provincial Election Officers. The IEC has also attempted to centralize recruitment of 83,000 temporary staff including District Field Coordinators (DFCs), voter educators, and polling staff. 6,000 staff members have been subsequently blacklisted due to alleged involvement in electoral misconduct in 2009. While the effectiveness of these measures can be debated, they should be lauded as broad (or even radical) attempts to create an increasingly transparent process. However, such clean-up operations will have limited impact considering the administration of local elections where stakes are higher and centralised oversight increasingly difficult. Therefore, prior to any local election events, it is crucial increased support be provided for staff training and capacity building outside the election event. Implementing a policy mandating the creation of polling staff cadres should also be considered. The training of staff, in particular women, can be undertaken during interim election periods when security or other political limitations may not be prevalent. Women\u2019s participation in local elections: Long standing cultural and religious biases have presented barriers to the participation of women in both the election administration and political landscape of Afghanistan. To increase women\u2019s political participation, a quota system was devised for the 2005 provincial council elections. In 2010, the IEC established a separate gender unit to oversee the process of promoting women\u2019s participation in elections. A system of gender focal points was established alongside placement of a gender specialist in every province. Positively, these specialists conducted consultations, gave lectures and delivered training programs in local communities. However, future gains may be achieved if gender focal points continued to engage with communities beyond election events.

Eric Kanalstein/UN Photo 26 Indonesia Following the decentralization Acts of 1999 and as outlined in Article 18 of the Constitution, regional and local governments are granted autonomy. Over the past decade, Indonesia\u2019s districts have become major administrative units providing most government services. Since 2005, heads of local government (governors, regents, and mayors) have been directly elected by popular election. However, Indonesia\u2019s huge population, multiple administrative divisions, decentralised local government structures, and mix of election systems present considerable challenges to the management of elections at the sub-national level. Each of Indonesia\u2019 33 provinces23 have their own government and legislative body. Members of the \u2018Provincial Legislative Assembly (DPRD Provinsi)\u2019 are elected every five years on the same day as national legislative elections. Executive heads of provincial government, in the form of a governor and vice governor, are elected in pairs on five year cycles with elections staggered between provinces. Provinces are subdivided into 370 rural districts or regencies (Kabupaten) and 95 urban districts or cities (Kota). Both Kabupaten and Kota have their own local governments and legislative bodies. Each Kabupaten and Kota has a District/City Legislative Assembly (DPRDK Kabupaten/ Kota)\u2019 directly elected for a five year term on the same day as national legislative elections. Executive heads in the form of a Regent or district head (Bupati) in rural districts and a Mayor (Walikota) in urban districts are elected on five year cycles with elections staggered between districts.

Between national elections, provincial and district legislative elections, provincial and district executive elections, and local village elections, it is clear that a staggering number of elections are held with each election requiring a high standard of technical capacity. The Election Management Body Indonesia\u2019s Law 22/2007 created a hierarchical chain of election management from the national to the village level. The law gave the National Election Commission (KPU) and its subordinate \u2018local\u2019 offices, administrative and financial responsibility for administering \u2018local\u2019 legislative elections. This included polls for Provincial Legislative Assemblies (DPRD Provinsi) and District/ City Legislative Assemblies (DPRD Kabupaten/Kota) Subordinate offices of the national KPU, responsible for administering provincial and district assembly elections at the local level include: the Provincial Election Committee (Provincial KPU) and Regency/ Municipal Election Committee (Regency/Municipal KPU); the Sub-District Election Committee (PPK) established by the Regency/Municipal KPU to conduct these elections at the sub-district level; the Village Polling Committee (PPS) established by Regency/Municipal KPU to conduct these elections at the village level; and the Polling Station committee (KPPS) established by the PPS to conduct these elections at the polling station level.

As of December 2011, the Aceh case was being considered by the constitutional court, and had twice caused the postponement of local elections. In addition to city and district KPUD, a local election oversight committee or complaints body, known as the Panwaslu, has been established. Moreover, since 2008, losing candidates can also launch electoral complaints to the Constitutional Court. Further complicating local election management, provincial KPUs in Aceh and West Papua have special status. As provincial KPUs are independent from the central KPU, provincial KPUs have a set of local election laws adapted for local settings. Decentralization and Local Elections Following the passing of Law No. 32/2004, the first cycle of direct elections for local heads of government began in June 2005 and continued until late 2008. With the exception of local elections in Aceh (2006) and West Papua (2011), local electoral processes have been largely unobserved nor supported by both the international community and donors. The first cycle of local elections was generally deemed to be free and fair though a number of violent incidents and complaints were principally linked to the quality of voter registration lists and poor election administration. Despite relative successes, the legal basis for disputing elections results was deemed to be weak and the effectiveness of local oversight committees were called into question. The second cycle of local elections commenced in 2010 and commentators continue to stipulate that poor election administration and coordination with stakeholders are causal factors behind most incidents of electoral violence. Challenges and Best Practices Effective local management and institutional strengthening: Most members of a KPUD secretariat are civil servants. No formal core of election officials exists in title, salary or grade. These officials are often seconded to temporary KPUDs and managed by Commissioners. Local election commissions can therefore be considered deformed in structure. Commissioners, who should be decision and policy makers, are often over involved in the day-to-day micro-management of elections thereby obstructing the development of a technically equipped secretariat which survives the tenure of election commissioners. Instead, after a period of leadership, commissioners leave and take with them valuable skills that local secretariats should have acquired. This negatively affects the quality of future local election management. Additionally, an overly bureaucratic selection process often leads to the recruitment of young under-qualified commissioners. With no permanent secretariat, the significance of the commissioner\u2019s role is heavily augmented. However, as positions are sometimes filled by under qualified or overly young officials with little or no community 28 standing, the ability to lead the secretariat and effectively coordinate with stakeholders is limited. Similar to the Nepalese context, staff rotation in and out of the secretariat poses significant challenges to electoral administration. Only reform of civil service practices will encourage the creation of a dedicated elections \u2018core\u2019 secretariat. However, the appointment of commissioners is an area where the KPU can augment its local practices. By ensuring accessible and non-bureaucratic recruitment, the KPU can encourage diplomatic candidates who may also be good technocrats with good community standing. Hence, these individuals are also in a position to address potential triggers undermining the election process. Electoral dispute resolution and electoral violence: Indonesia\u2019s first rounds of parliamentary elections and two presidential elections, both held in 2004 and 2009, were widely praised by the international community for being conducted in a relatively peaceful and free environment. However, the Pilkada process has witnessed greater levels of conflict and violence. Of the 282 Pilkada\u2019s held between 2005 and 2007, violent incidents occurred in 41 districts, four local commissions burned down and eighteen commissions were damaged.24 Moreover, in some areas of the country, reports have indicated the 2010 Pilkada was also affected by on-going conflict and violence. It is highly likely the grass roots nature of the Pilkada as well as the proximity of candidates to the electorate and personalised local commissions can cause emotions to run high, particularly if local election management is perceived to be unjust or non-transparent. While the immaturity of local democracy may be a causal factor of violence, a number of electoral complaints and outbreaks of violence during 24 http://www.crawford.anu.edu.au/acde/ip/pdf/ lpem/2011/20110906_ppp.pdf both Pilkada cycles have been linked to poor election administration, biased KPUD staff, and a lack of outreach.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "370be69b-c33b-4afd-bb58-f8247c5d88e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "370be69b-c33b-4afd-bb58-f8247c5d88e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting Local Election Management as Part of an Electoral Cycle Approach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d00479e47cf39d41dc92f774aeceaa1435e070a402738269d4b252c40845d994"}, "2": {"node_id": "7451491b-403c-40dd-8537-70996dada56c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "86d052d2ffefba50753fd1b8ac1dddffbd419251e4eac3d5a5ac57db7d1b2ce4"}}, "hash": "58244d5f0d8e6b8479b5bc7dabd242aa59d88605b1524e58c1393123979eaabe", "text": "Several commentators refer to inexperienced KPUDs headed by young staff as well as the mismanagement of local disputes allowed grievances to spiral out of control.

Moreover, with most disputes and incidents taking place after Election Day, ineffective results management has also contributed to electoral violence during several Pilkadas. However, positive practices exist. During the 2004 parliamentary elections, the Poso district KPUD in Central Sulawesi Sumatr was commended for its success in implementing violence free elections and despite on-going religious and ethnic tensions, the KPUD held a positive trend throughout the 2005 and 2010 local elections. Led by an active and locally respected commissioner, the KPUD responded quickly to complaints, regularly engaged with candidates, coordinated with security forces, and met with local leaders in efforts to address potential triggers that undermining the election process. The KPUD also encouraged the pairing of Muslim and Christian candidates. Moreover, at each stage of the Pilkada, developments were communicated to the media. During the 2006 Pilkada in Aceh, the KPUD, along with support from donors, created a media centre which was used as a means for mitigating electoral violence and ensuring transparent electoral processes. However, a reduced donor presence negatively affected media centre activity. With reduced funding to produce and disseminate material, the centre played a lesser role during the current Pilkada. However, on-going media engagement has been a critical element for keeping citizens updated on delays to the current local election process. 29 Complaints: In 1999, no effective mechanisms were in place to receive and adjudicate complaints, resolve disputes or enforce criminal offences during Indonesia\u2019s first round of elections. However, local complaints bodies (Panwaslu) have since been established. These bodies function for both legislative and local elections as ad-hoc temporary bodies are largely toothless and staffed by under qualified officials. Panwaslu are limited to investigating administrative issues, particularly relating to candidate nominations (declarations of health etc.) while cases of fraud and intimidation can only be addressed directly through the police and judiciary. The EMB also has no authority to follow up on these cases. Further limiting factors exist such as a citizen\u2019s inability to lodge a complaint three days from the date of an alleged offence. This is compounded by the temporary nature of the panwaslu which are often only set up mid-way through an election process. For example, during the 2012 local elections in Aceh, Panwaslu were set up after voter registration updates had been completed. This limited the ability of the Panswaslu to adjudicate cases brought forward by persons not included on the voters list. Commentators have frequently remarked on the increase of grievance levels spurred by the late establishment of these bodies. This situation places limitations on the ability of parties, candidates and the electorate to raise complaints. Legal framework and administrative procedures: Several updated election laws govern elections in Indonesia: Law 32/2004 (as amended by Law 12/2008) governs local elections, Law 22/2007 governs election administration, Law 10/2008 governs legislative elections, Law 27/2009 governs national and regional legislatures, and Law 2/2008 governs political parties. In 2004, Indonesia\u2019s first general elections in the Reformasi era for legislative assemblies were held at the national, provincial and regency/ municipality level. An inadequate legal framework, unclear administrative procedures, and inefficient organizational structures led to problems with the administration of elections. However, improvements were made during subsequent electoral cycles following a corruption scandal in 2005. The aforementioned series of updated laws were passed as a means of providing increased oversight to the Ministry of Home Affairs. This in turn affected the capacity and mandate of the KPU to run elections. Implementation of the election laws created inefficiencies in administrative procedures resulting in a lack of coordination and communication between levels of election implementing committees, between election committees and their Secretariats (government staff) as well as between election officials and other state bodies. As an example, instead of the KPU establishing their own voters\u2019 lists, the sub national offices have become reliant on the Ministry of Home Affairs to provide population data which often lacks quality. As such, the watering down of responsibility has increased the number of complaints received during the current local election cycle with the majority of complaints involving eligible voters missing from voter lists. Additionally, election laws are sometimes implemented unequally. Candidate eligibility citing discrimination on the grounds of education, health and wealth are often called into question by candidates, civil society and political parties. During the current cycle of local elections, cases of electoral violence reporting alleged unfair disqualification of candidates has been reported. Moreover, in regard to complaints and appeals, a lack of clarity in the role of the Panwaslu has also led to lack of enforcement of decisions made by the election supervisory body.

Approximately 200 of these islands are inhabited. A third of the population lives on Male, the capital island, and other islands host between a few hundred to as many as ten thousand citizens. The Maldives has only recently established itself as a multi-party democratic republic. Presidential elections were held in 2008 and parliamentary elections in 2009. The first cycle of local elections administered in February 2011 were hailed by both national and international observers as a significant step towards consolidating democracy. Local elections were held for 188 island councils, 20 atoll councils and 2 city councils.25 Of the 2,332 candidates who ran, a total of 1,091 were elected as members of these councils.26 While the election commission\u2019s management of local elections was widely praised, instances of non- transparent processes were reported by local civil society organisations and international observers. This led to a noticeable regression in the transparency of the commission when compared to the 2008 and 2009 presidential and parliamentary elections. The Maldives presents an interesting case study for the management of local elections. Many electoral constituencies comprise 1,000 voters or less and when compared to larger nations such as Indonesia, Bangladesh or Pakistan, best practices and shortcomings are still applicable to all contexts. While the small population does not detract from 25 Depending on the population of an island, local councils consist of five, seven or nine members.

The Election Management Body Similar to many countries in the Asia Pacific region, the Maldives has a nascent electoral management body. The Election Commission of the Maldives (ECM) is an independent institution with an extensive mandate outlined in the 2008 constitution, the General Election Bill and the Local Government Election Bill. The election commission is responsible for administering national and local elections, registration of voters and maintaining voter lists. It also recruits and trains election officials, produces and provides all election materials, announces results, reviews boundaries and constituency names, registers political parties and initiates civic & voter education campaigns. The election commission has a full time staff at central level, 12 temporary Atoll election offices and 194 temporary Island offices. Prior to local elections, local election committees must be established. Each Island and atoll committee consists of three members headed by Island and Atoll Election Officers respectively. City committees consist of five members and are also headed by a City Election Officer. Out- of-country election committees responsible for expatriate voting in Colombo, Trivandrum and Kuala Lumpur also consist of three members. In addition to Island and Atoll committees, ten member polling station committees have been established. There are 398 polling or \u2018booth\u2019 committees in total. 27 The February 2012 the alleged forced resignation of president Nasheed, following street protests by the supporters of the former autocratic president Abdul Gayoom, is an indicator of serious challenges in the countries democratic development. 31 Decentralization and Local Elections The Law on Decentralization and the Local Councils Act specifies responsibilities and timeframes for candidate registration, voter registration, polling, counting, results tabulation and results announcement. Additionally, the 2010 regulation governing the conduct of local elections, sets out guidelines under which atoll, island and city committees coordinate the conduct of local council elections. Local commissions are temporary but when active, they fall under the leadership of the National Election Commission with a reporting chain flowing from Island, to Atoll, to Capital. Local elections are held simultaneously in all 194 Islands and are to be held every three years as stipulated in the constitution. In an example perhaps unique to the Maldives, the size of a municipality may affect the progression of local elections as well as their management. Not surprisingly, in some of the Maldives\u2019 less populated islands28, the multi-party democratic system has politicised local communities. According to some actors, implementing the new electoral system created fractures within former tight-knit communities confined to small islands consisting of a few square kilometres.29 Such divisions have reportedly led to citizens questioning the purpose of the new councils as well as decreased support for future local", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72250395-99ac-4263-aa6c-385963c6196f": {"__data__": {"id_": "72250395-99ac-4263-aa6c-385963c6196f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting Local Election Management as Part of an Electoral Cycle Approach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4453ceccaa9a8515b53fd3c50b428d8ed63c64c5c06518f6414effbc45e7c8e7"}}, "hash": "4453ceccaa9a8515b53fd3c50b428d8ed63c64c5c06518f6414effbc45e7c8e7", "text": "elections. Some community members as well as other senior government officials have deferred to former community based decision making. In such cases, the importance of civic education cannot be overlooked. Through extensive outreach, the government of the Maldives as well as the election commission must play an important role in re-building confidence in the electoral process. 28 Island municipalities that have electorates of between 300 and 900 citizens 29 Based on interviews on Huraa Island, November 2011 Challenges and Best Practices Effective local management and communication between layers of management: During the 2011 local elections, Island Committees faced difficulties recruiting qualified polling staff. Apathy and low remuneration discouraged individuals who had worked on previous election events. As such, island election commissions resorted to the recruitment of inexperienced polling officials who, as well as being limited in overall capacity, were ill-equipped to manage the out-of-constituency voting process. While the practice of allowing citizens from any constituency to vote on any island (so long as pre- registered) must be lauded for its inclusivity, island officers lamented having insufficient capacity to manage the out-of-constituency count, results tabulation and results transmission. This was particularly the case in islands linked to tourist resorts where Maldivians from as many as a hundred constituencies may be based for work. Under these circumstances, a single team of inexperienced polling officials managed multiple counts and results paperwork, often taking an entire night to complete the process. Moreover, communication tools in the shape of single feeder fax machines, were inadequate for transferring large volumes of results forms to the ECM. To address this issue, the election commission is considering adopting e-voting and counting systems. While such systems will certainly enhance the speed and efficiency of delivering results, in a country of 325,000 citizens based largely in small constituencies, this initiative on a vote by vote basis will be prohibitively expensive. Bearing this in mind, building cadres of well trained and remunerated staff on Islands holding multiple out-of-constituency voters may prove to be a more cost effective measure. Women\u2019s participation in local elections: While candidate eligibility criterion is equal, only seven 32 percent of candidates contesting local elections were women. Despite such low levels of female participation, local council election multi-member constituencies with a first past the post system is more conducive to increasing female participation than the parliamentary system. Promotion of gender sensitive policies: As with many other commissions in the region, gender balance within the ECM is not representative. While many polling officials are female, senior management positions are predominantly filled by men. At this stage, the ECM has no official gender policy nor does it intend to enact one. Electoral dispute resolution and electoral violence: While a national complaints bureau exists, local mechanisms for electoral dispute resolution are almost non-existent. An Island, atoll, capital processing chain for complaints exists. However, beyond voters not appearing on the voter\u2019s list, most electoral complaints are communicated to the national complaints bureau for adjudication rather than being resolved by bodies at the local level. Nearly all incidents of violence reported on election- day stemmed from poor administrative practices and were linked to queuing issues, obstacles to observers, and to inaccurate voter\u2019s lists. A smaller number of administrative issues and ensuing altercations related to the poor physical layout of polling booths and insufficient numbers of ballot boxes allocated to some polling stations. Most commentators point to inadequate training for local polling officials as the main cause of complaints and incidents of violence. Moreover, the centralised nature of decision making led to delays in election-day decisions. This provoked incidents that further inflamed local level tensions. During the 2008 and 2009 national elections, the Maldivian EMB invited civil society organizations, political party representatives, human rights commissioners, and police officials to sit on its National Advisory Committee for Elections. These stakeholders assumed committee member positions for several months prior to and after the election date. This inaugurated a forum to raise concerns and played an influential role for dispute avoidance. In contrast, during the 2011 local elections, the EMB established its advisory committee just three days prior to election- day. While the elections were administratively and technically improved, the EMB wasted an opportunity to build trust with stakeholders and avoid violent incidents on election-day.

Nepal is divided into 75 districts, 58 municipalities and 3915 villages. Prior to 2002, village, district and municipal council members were selected through direct elections supervised by the Election Commission\u2019s district offices. In 2002, the terms of office expired and no direct election at the local level has been held since. As a substitute to directly elected local bodies, in September 2006, political parties agreed to form interim local bodies at the district, municipality and village level in order to allow the release of development funds. This arrangement was included in the 2007 Interim Constitution. However, due to a lack of consensus, the bodies were not formed and local ad hoc arrangements have prevailed. At present, interim ad-hoc local bodies elected though ad-hoc elections have replaced formally elected local councils. The on-going debate over constitutional arrangements means a significant uncertainty regarding most aspects of future local election processes exists. This includes the federal state structure, offices to be elected, the electoral system, the timing of elections and responsibility for the voter registry and list. The election commission is therefore currently operating in a difficult context. The Election Management Body The Election Commission of Nepal (ECN) is a govern- mental body currently responsible for managing local and national elections. Since 1990, the commission has run four general elections and two local elections (1992 and 1997). Following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005, the ending of the armed conflict and the adoption of the Interim Constitution, the ECN continues to be empowered. Despite local elections never actually being held, the ECN still conducts, supervises, directs and controls elections to local bodies at the village, town and district levels. Also, the ECN is currently engaged with preparing voter\u2019s lists for local elections. Two key commission positions exist at the local level: the District Election Officer (DEO), who is the commission appointee in charge of overall preparations and the returning officer, who oversees polling and counting in each constituency. In districts with multiple constituencies, a chief returning officer is appointed. The chief returning officer acts as returning officer in a constituency but also coordinates returning officers in other constituencies. Returning officers are drawn from the judiciary (although in past local elections, chief district officers have filled the role). Each polling centre will have a polling officer and as many assistants as necessary, drawn from the civil service or state corporations. DEOs are currently overseeing a biometric voter registration operation forming the basis of much of the ECNs local level activity since early 2010. Decentralization and Local Elections With the promulgation of the new Constitution, Nepal\u2019s peace process will reach its formal conclusion. This will effectively transform Nepal into a federal state and will fundamentally change the way the diversity of Nepal\u2019s population is reflected in law and governance. As such, decisions on decentralized or devolved powers granted to local bodies require finalising. This includes the body responsible for administering local elections, delineating boundaries, undertaking voter registration updates, updating the voters roll, administering complaints bodies, 34 engaging in civic education and setting electoral calendars. As of December 2011, the constituent assembly provisionally decided on a mixed electoral system. The system incorporates a combination of direct first past the post, single round elections and proportional representation at the national, provincial and local levels. With no decision on a federal structure, the impact of this decision on local election management is unknown. Challenges and Best Practices Effective local management: For the 2011 voter registration process at the district level, voter registration was composed of: a multi-level, multi- media voter education campaign; a door-to-door campaign to identify, inform, and document individuals who were eligible to register; and on-site registration at more than 8,000 voter registration places at which eligible individuals were physically registered. At the same time, continuous voter registration occurred at District Election Offices to accommodate individuals who had missed voter registration their location of permanent residence. Communication between layers of election management: The voter registration process program wholly utilised the ECNs local structures and called for effective communication between the field and centre. While the ECN stopped short of establishing a fully-fledged field operations department, procedural, legal and operational updates were regularly communicated to and received by district offices. Likewise, a system for sending weekly registration updates from the DEOs to the ECN HQ was established. Moreover, on several occasions, all 75 DEOs visited Kathmandu for training and workshops. Staff capacity and institutional strengthening: As experienced ECN staff often rotate on to other government agencies, the commission is considering developing its institutional memory based on experiences of running previous", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8239b6fc-f2a3-4924-bfc7-7cb57cbe5b84": {"__data__": {"id_": "8239b6fc-f2a3-4924-bfc7-7cb57cbe5b84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting Local Election Management as Part of an Electoral Cycle Approach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03426f2839f65e08a8d31d9f0355fcb2f16d20f896c89c0160046297b5897af9"}}, "hash": "03426f2839f65e08a8d31d9f0355fcb2f16d20f896c89c0160046297b5897af9", "text": "elections. The issue of staff rotation is most pertinent at the district level, where the DEO is often the only representative with election experience. During the recent voter registration program, fifteen qualified district election officers were moved to other ministries and replaced by civil servants with no election management experience. This limited the commission\u2019s capacity to administer any future national or local registration of election related events. Positively, the ECN is considering developing hand-over and archiving modalities. However, the creation of permanent ECN positions is a strategy to be developed in cooperation with the Government of Nepal. Promotion of gender sensitive policies: A decrease in women\u2019s representation within all levels of the ECN was noted between 2009 and 2011. In early 2012, only 109 of 583 ECN staff were female. Of these 109 women, only 16 work at the central ECN level. The ratio of female to male officers is also low with a current standing of two out of twenty-seven officers. Moreover, only one of the seventy five DEOs is female. Some specific efforts, such as developing a concept for gender inclusion, are being made to enhance female participation. In 2010, the ECN published a report entitled, \u201cGender mapping in the field of elections\u201d which identified gender gaps in electoral processes and suggested recommendations for addressing gender disparities. While these efforts have made varying degrees of progress, achievements have been more limited at the local level. Some targets have been set to increase women staff levels. However, no separate unit has been established to focus on gender issues and no mechanism has been instituted to track gains for increasing employment among women. Electoral violence: Examples of electoral violence in Nepal include Mahsessi and Limbuwan party altercations with registration staff, destruction 35 of registration equipment and obstructions to registration processes. However, local ECN offices as well as high level dialogues helped engage successful outreach efforts to end electoral obstructions. A parallel approach involved local offices engaging in dialogue with political parties. Also, central ECN lobbying with party leaders was a positive initiative which allowed for early 2012 re-commencement of voter registration in formerly obstructed districts. Pakistan Since the first Constitution of Pakistan was adopted in 1956, the country has faced a myriad of challenges in regards to managing national and local elections. Successive military governments either suspended the constitution or rigged national, provincial and local polls to ensure regime survival. The military government also suppressed or colluded with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). Local elections have been held on an intermittent basis, enacted by military regimes to devolve power from the centre. They have been curtailed by civilian governments wishing to ensure longevity by retaining power and resources at the national level. State, tribal and sectarian violence marred electoral processes. Women either failed to vote or were prevented from voting. Legal provisions in support of elections became increasingly complicated and general public trust in electoral processes collapsed. In the face of such challenges, tools retained by the ECP ensuring the conduct of transparent, inclusive and non-violent local election processes have been blunted. Local government is the third tier of government in Pakistan after the Federal and Provincial Government respectively. Three types of administrative units of local government exist in Pakistan: District Government Administration, Town Municipal Administrations and Union Council Administrations. Union council administrations are essentially village councils though may be labelled town councils in urban areas. Union councils are the only directly elected bodies at the local level. District Government Administration and Town Municipal Administrations are indirectly elected from the Electoral College. The Election Management Body The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is a centralised, independent, election management body. In addition to the Secretariat in Islamabad, the ECP has 4 Provincial Election Commissioners\u2019 Offices, 26 Deputy Election Commissioners\u2019 Offices Tanveer Shahzad/UNDP 36 (at divisional level) and 124 Assistant Election Commissioners\u2019 Offices (at district level). All are permanent structures responsible for overseeing national and local elections. The ECP and its subsidiary offices are responsible for delivering multiple outputs including: voter registration and the updating of voters rolls; election operations; complaints and dispute resolution; training; public outreach; voter education; and ensuring the inclusion of marginalised groups. The ECP has 1,800 permanent personnel working out of 155 offices. For elections to provincial legislatures and unions councils, the ECP appoints a district returning officer for each district and a returning officer for each constituency within a district. The returning officer is assisted by an assistant returning officer. These non-permanent staff number approximately 1,200. In addition to the 1,200 officials, 70,000 temporary presiding officers and some 500,000 temporary poll workers are recruited", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b554fcd-4718-4df3-b690-a5b7a663d061": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b554fcd-4718-4df3-b690-a5b7a663d061", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting Local Election Management as Part of an Electoral Cycle Approach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a5d0212d17c5347bf54afe7f0bda984a7bc460ebdb5a3382459bd432774955e"}}, "hash": "5a5d0212d17c5347bf54afe7f0bda984a7bc460ebdb5a3382459bd432774955e", "text": "for election events. Therefore, the scale of each election operation is massive. Decentralization and Local Elections Although Pakistan has undergone several waves of decentralization30, the devolution plan introduced by President Musharraf\u2019s government in 2000 represents the most comprehensive initiative to date. Analysis of political motives for decentralization under a military regime are beyond the scope of this paper however postponement of the 2009 30 Between 1947 and1958 local governments in Pakistan operated under administrative decentralization. Two subsequent attempts to devolve power in Pakistan were made, but neither survived the regime that promulgated the reforms. In each case, it was a military regime that introduced decentralization reforms (the Basic Democracies Order in 1959 under Ayub Khan and the 1979 Local Government Ordinance of General Zia ul Haq) that were subsequently dismantled by elected civilian regimes. The most recent decentralization policy was once again initiated by a military regime. Current decentralization initiatives are the first under a civilian government. local election process is a hallmark of former civilian governments. Positively, the current civilian government of Pakistan is seeking to enhance local governance and electoral system reforms. Union Council elections are scheduled to be held every four years and are overseen by the Election Commission of Pakistan. The 2005 Local Elections were held in three phases. Phase-I took place on August 18 and included direct elections for 3074 Union Councils in 53 districts. Phase-II occurred on August 25 and included direct elections for 2974 Union Councils in the next 56 districts. Phase- III included indirect elections for district government and municipal administrations. Phase-III was scheduled for September but was subsequently postponed to October 2005. Local elections were not held in 2009 and at the current juncture, the ECP, being the designated body for running these elections, faces multiple challenges within the management of future local elections. Challenges and best practices Effective local management: Under new legal provisions, provincial election commissions may become increasingly decentralised. Given the expiry of the 2001 local government ordinances, provincial governments are revising Local Government Acts and are free to determine the governing model for future local elections. As of June 2012, only Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have passed local government bills. However, all four provincial assemblies are in the process of considering acts that may shift the responsibility for conducting local elections away from the ECP to provincial electoral authorities who report directly to the provincial government. Implementation hurdles may ensue if each province adopts varying local government legislations such as election administration, voter roll updates, and electoral procedures. 37 As pointed out during a 2009 IFES study of the local government electoral system, \u2018The potential establishment of four new Provincial Election Management Bodies is a massive operational and financial task.\u201931 Such warnings were echoed by the Election Commission itself. For example, during a Democratic Reporting International seminar, the commission stated, \u2018A minimum level of operational uniformity could make the administration of elections easier and thereby ensure higher quality and more credible elections\u2026 Major differences in electoral management procedures amongst the four provinces would create a burden on the election management body, both in terms of cost and administration.\u201932 As of late 2011, the 2001 local governance ordinances still prevail in three of Pakistan\u2019s four provinces. Baluchistan\u2019s provisional act was submitted to the ECN though subsequently returned to the provincial assembly for revision. While the provisional act alters the number of members elected to all three local councils, it does not reform the administrative structure of election management nor calls for the creation of a separate management body. In all four provinces, when the new acts are promulgated, provincial assemblies will request the ECP to conduct local elections. Such a request must be made within 30 days of the promulgation of each act after which the election commission will have between 90 and 120 days to implement the election. Therefore, while electoral management procedures are likely to remain the same, it is quite likely local elections across each of Pakistan\u2019s four provinces will run at different cycles. Furthermore, due to the high number of union council elections and similar to the 2001 and 2005 processes, these elections are to be 31 IFES Pakistan \u2018Local Government Electoral System in Pakistan\u2019 June 2009 32 ECP Joint Secretary Syed Sher Afghan speaking at the All Provinces Forum, August 2010 held on a staggered schedule. In terms of timing and resources, local elections will place a great burden on the ECP, especially as it prepares for very important national elections.

Ill-equipped offices will affect result, complaint and general communication. In fact, during field level research for this paper, local ECP officials lamented a lack of reporting tools, standardised reporting structures and \u2018field operation\u2019 awareness. Communication with district offices is ad-hoc and frequently based on personal rather than professional reporting structures. Poor communication strategies will directly affect the quality of electoral management at the local level. Staff capacity and institutional strengthening: In addition to highlighting the impartiality of some poll workers, past election observation missions have identified training of poll workers as a shortcoming of recent electoral processes. Tellingly, the commonwealth expert team report on the 2005 local elections stated, \u2018Training sessions observed bore little resemblance to the written materials provided, and left a great deal to be desired\u201933. While many of the commissions 1,800 permanent staff have received training at the National School of Management, specialised courses in election administration have not been delivered. Moreover, district and constituency returning officers, as well as poll workers, are temporary recruits who are often drawn from existing branches of government. Many will serve for the first time and will require training. Additionally, a program of cascade training will need to reach at least 33 Pakistan Local Bodies Elections 18 and 25 August 2005, Report of the Commonwealth Expert Team 38 70,000 presiding officers, preferably some 500,000 poll workers as well. Given the short fallings of the 2005 process, the importance and challenges of cascade training must not be overlooked. A newly-revived Federal Election Academy may lead to better in-service training for ECP officials, both permanent and temporary. Nonetheless, there is a requirement for continuing career training for ECP officials at the local level. While some of this may be met through a combination of BRIDGE and other efforts, a shift in focus to building institutional capacity at the local level is required. Women\u2019s participation in local elections: Overall turnout during past local elections was low, hovering around the 45 percent mark.34 A turnout target of 64 percent was set in the ECP\u2019s strategic plan but to reach this, the commission will have to undertake extensive outreach. The commission will also have to commit considerable time and effort towards engaging and enabling women to vote. According to the commission\u2019s 2005 figures, 36 percent of registered female voters cast ballots during the 2005 union council elections compared to a 57 percent turnout for men. A tense security environment may affect the ability of the ECP to enhance women\u2019s representation and participation. The commission\u2019s five year strategic plan aimed to complete a study into the engagement of female enumerators with an intention of appointing women enumerators to better serve the female population by December 2010. However, no progress was made and in May 2011, a taskforce for the revision of electoral roles decided not to engage female enumerators due to heightened elements of risk. This may lead to eligible women not being registered and 34 40 percent in 2001 and 47 percent in 2005 diminish the ability of the ECN to reach its goal of increased women\u2019s representation and participation. Regarding women\u2019s participation as candidates, the 2001 devolution of power plan allowed for 33 percent representation of women in all three tiers of local government. During the 2001 local election process, a portion of reserved seats remained uncontested and unfilled. This was somewhat rectified in 2005 when local civil society organisations played a significant role by engaging outreach to women, encouraging higher female participation, and pursuing a 98 percent occupancy rate. Electoral dispute resolution and electoral violence: Pakistan conducts a near invisible complaints process which, according to observers of the 2005 local elections, was poorly understood by local staff, \u2018who were either unable or unwilling to resolve complaints due to a lack of training or initiative.\u2019 The election commission itself recognised, \u2018a need for serious attention to complaints processes\u2019. Hence, standardised complaint forms were adopted with support from international agencies and utilised by the Election Commission of Pakistan for the 2008 parliamentary elections. Training was conducted not only for election officials but also traditional community leaders and political party representatives. A radio public service announcement campaign was also carried out nationwide to improve public understanding of the election complaint process.

The scale of both National and local elections in the Maldives and Timor-Leste does not detract from the issues faced by their respective electoral commissions in administering elections. Addressing electoral violence, encouraging female participation, engaging in public information campaigns, and coordinating between varying levels and bodies of electoral management continue to pose significant challenges. The Election Management Bodies Timor-Leste\u2019s election management system has evolved gradually since the country\u2019s 2001 and 2002 transitional elections administered by over 400 UN election officers working closely with East Timorese counterparts. The electoral management system in Timor-Leste is a mixed model where two EMBs exist; a policy, monitoring or supervisory EMB (Comiss\u00e3o Nacional de Elei\u00e7\u00f5es do Timor-Leste, CNE) independent of the executive branch of government and an implementation EMB located within the ministry of State, Administration and Territorial Management (The Technical Secretariat for Election Administration, STAE). STAE was originally the country\u2019s sole election management body responsible for implementing elections but in 2004, the Comiss\u00e3o Nacional de Elei\u00e7\u00f5es do Timor-Leste (CNE) was created to oversee the first round of Suco elections. The CNE\u2019s term ran out in 2006 and in 2007 and in the context of the General Election, Timor-Leste established a second structure of CNE with a mandate of six years (2007-2013). Both EMBs continue to be supported by a large number of international technical experts. STAE has a permanent staff of 22 individuals based in the capital and an office in each of the country\u2019s 13 districts. STAE is an operational body tasked with the management of voter registration and education. They are entrusted with the formulation of election rules and procedures, ballot design and production, the identification of polling centres, hiring and training polling officials, the deployment of electoral materials, the facilitation of voting, and preliminary results tabulation. The CNE is an independent body also based in the capital consisting of fifteen permanent commissioners serving a maximum of two six year appointments. CNE has permanent district presence through thirteen district focal points which are expanded during election periods. The CNE is essentially a supervisory body overseeing all phases of the electoral process implemented by STAE. Its principal roles are to ensure constitutional and legal provisions relating to the elections are enforced, regulation and monitoring of political parties\u2019 budgets, support access to civic education, approve election rules and procedures as well as codes of conduct, and handle electoral complaints by ensuring the public prosecutor is aware of offences. Following results tabulation by STAE, it also prepares provisional national results for submission to the court of appeal. Decentralization and Local Elections The Government of Timor-Leste began developing a framework for decentralization and local government in 2004 which included planning for Suco (village) and municipal (district) elections. Since the promulgation of the Suco Election Law in mid-2004, two cycles of Suco Council elections 40 have been held. Administered by the STAE in 2004/2005, elections were held in 442 Suco\u2019s across the country. Ten councillors were elected in each Suco as well as hamlet chiefs Chefe de Aldeia (the number change from Suco to Suco). The first cycle was phased and took one year to complete. These were the first elections organized after the 2002 restoration of independence. The STAE team moved district by district, slowly rolling out the electoral process Suco by Suco. The process was also monitored by the first CNE. In contrast, the 2009 Suco elections were administered by STAE and supervised by the CNE but took place simultaneously in 13 districts and 442 Sucos on the same day. Prior to the 2009 elections, the Suco election law was altered, prohibiting political parties from fielding candidates.

Such set-backs are directly linked to the non-promulgation of Municipal Elections Law which is also inherently linked to the draft laws on local government. While political will for decentralization exists, debate over the draft law and allocation of powers has elongated the implementation process. Draft laws give nominal powers to local government and include the option for central government review of any decisions made by locally elected legislative (municipal) assemblies. In early 2009, a parliament dominated by individuals wishing to retain power at the centre sought to host a one-day public consultation on a complicated eighty-four paged legal text. However, regulations on the proposed purpose and functions of local governments were unclear so the ruling collation decided to allow more UNDP Timor-Leste 41 time for deliberation of the draft laws. As such, an initial series of public consultations commenced in May 2009. While enhancing citizens\u2019 involvement in local decision-making processes through the implementation of local elections and establishment of local municipal government is accepted, the political will to push the process forward is convoluted. In view of the on-going debate over the type of local government, the national parliament has sought more time by delaying the municipal elections until 2015. Challenges and Best Practices Effective local management and communication between layers of election management: Absence of a defined municipal election law directly affects the ability of EMBs, whether STAE or the CNE, to plan for local municipal elections. CNE and STAE strategic planning encompass all election events with preparations currently extending to 2030. While not specific to local elections, the CNE and STAE are looking ahead to future election cycles and identifying areas such as legal frameworks and management strategies that require additional resources, budget expansion and capacity strengthening. However, any new municipal government structures during election periods will certainly contribute to STAE field operations requiring additional capacity strengthening. Women\u2019s participation in local elections: Political parties are obliged to include at least one woman in every group of four parliamentary candidates. In the 2012 National Parliament election women gained 38.46 percent of the 65 seats in the National parliament compared to 29 percent in 2007. However, high level women\u2019s participation in national level politics is not reflected at local levels. Participation in the 2004/2005 Suco election process was low. Only seven of sixty six women who ran for 442 posts of Suco chief won the seat (1.6% of Suco chief posts) and only twenty seven of the 2,228 who ran for Aldeia (sub-village chief) were successful in their bid.37 During the 2009 Suco elections, female participation almost doubled and just over a quarter of all elected officials were women. However, only ten women were successfully elected to the position of Suco Chief comprising 2% of Suco Chief\u2019s in Timor-Leste. This was a fractional improvement on the 2004/2005 results. Commentators highlighted a lack of training for candidates and limited civic education as key reasons for low female participation. While three seats were guaranteed for women during the 2004/2005 Suco elections, the 2009 introduction of a packet law38 reaffirmed temporary special measures seeking to further strengthen women\u2019s ability to occupy Suco and Aldeia leadership positions. However, the new law was introduced just before the 2009 elections and the minimal time-frame between the guarantee of the packet law and the elections was seen by some actors as a contributing factor to continued low levels of female representation.39 Electoral dispute resolution and electoral violence: Since independence in May 2002, Timor-Leste has held four national and two community elections. Throughout this period the 37 ipsnews.net \u2013 Matt Crook, East Timor: Politics, Women Take the Plunge. 38 The \u2018package system\u2019 law allowed voting for grouped councils, rather than individuals, with a blanket ban on candidates representing political parties standing for election. 39 Vice President of National Parliament Deputada Paix\u00e3o speaking on the topic of securing women\u2019s participation in the future municipal elections, January 15th 2010. 42 incidence and severity of election violence has varied considerably. Outside the 1999 referendum on independence, the most significant electoral violence was experienced during the parliamentary elections campaign period between May and August 2007. The 2004/2005 Suco election process was deemed to have passed without significant intimidation or violence. The phased approach40 to delivering elections may have contributed to lower levels of violence. However, this contrasts with the 2009 Suco elections which were held concurrently on one day and also passed without significant levels of electoral violence. While the Suco elections processes in 2004/2005 and 2009 passed with little evidence of intimidation or violence, this should not be taken as a bench", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b3a188f-c754-443e-8e14-d563c496052b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b3a188f-c754-443e-8e14-d563c496052b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting Local Election Management as Part of an Electoral Cycle Approach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-local-election-management-part-electoral-cycle-approach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68784af5dd900b05e6c1fd7f9b2dda8c89de203ddc9981fed606b23389ffd8e2"}}, "hash": "68784af5dd900b05e6c1fd7f9b2dda8c89de203ddc9981fed606b23389ffd8e2", "text": "mark for when future community or local elections take place at the Municipality level. Suco Councils have no legislative role and elected individuals are not part of any formal government structure. Instead, Suco Councils are an extension and formalisation of pre-existing leadership structures charged with overseeing local administration. This framework effectively reduces levels of competition. In addition, the 2009 exclusion of political parties from Suco elections led to a more benign process. Municipal elections will most likely involve higher stakes and a greater degree of competition. Successful municipal election candidates will be given access to government positions and control over state resources. With political parties returning to the fore, the types of campaigns fought will be very different to those at the Suco level. This 40 As the 2004/5 polling process was phased and drawn out over the period of one year, it lacked the systematic monitoring of international and national groups. Given the inclusion of politically aligned candidates, this could signify that while intimidation or violence may have occurred, it went unobserved. presents a significant challenge to EMBs to ensure civic education encourages peaceful agendas and prevents intimidation. If the proposed phased approach to municipal elections is adopted, it will also be important to establish systematic monitoring mechanisms with national or international observation bodies if necessary. The EMBs will also need to regulate political party finance in local campaigns. Positive measures include the proposal to undertake phased municipal elections. Additionally, district level tabulation and reporting of results will protect the identity of voters in small communities. Moreover, the production of complaints legislation to deal with electoral disputes and the creation of codes of conduct for political parties, observers and media are positive steps towards maintaining a peaceful agenda. However, enforcing codes of conduct remains a challenge and further measures such as comprehensive, routine, standardized monitoring of all election phases, including voter registration, campaigning, balloting and results tabulation must be encouraged. Transparency: The government of Timor-Leste will need to undertake broad civic education and voter information campaigns in order to raise citizen awareness regarding local election processes including realisation of rights and responsibilities in the context of municipal elections. Hosting consultations on the decentralization process involving current Suco Council members are positive steps. However, in order to encourage greater female participation in local government, outreach will also require a gender component. Engagement with civil society must also be encouraged to educate citizens on the value and importance of municipal elections processes and to lessen the impact of political provocation. 43 Annex 1: Local Elections Matrix Country Type of EMB: (Decentralised, or Centralised) EMB Responsible for?

World Bank v Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific Executive summary i. Responding to climate change and development are inseparable. The Fourth Assessment Report of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change1 identi- fied that the emissions of greenhouse gases are having real impacts on our environment. The Earth is already locked into significant climate change that will impact on all communities and economies. Such impacts have the potential to roll back many of the gains in develop- ment made to date. Our challenge is clear; we need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases without harming development, and adapt to the impacts of global warming so that any potential damage", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db684f8c-f995-4acd-9339-c27c165c0eb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "db684f8c-f995-4acd-9339-c27c165c0eb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Realising Development Effectiveness: Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6de586c8a4eb117e3760a87d3a09ea5cabe259a4b242f94b3d90dc019201d084"}, "3": {"node_id": "84f33049-0eba-40de-b691-233737c465c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3d81018c6cbc4c56d031c2c5eb3e332fdad1ef05e4cf1237d7aad63ddb036f8"}}, "hash": "5eed998783f94c41fe13b3999bc4842ad56bcedf0717680906c1055cbf8d247c", "text": "is reduced. ii. Using the experience of five countries in Asia (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam), this report considers whether funding for cli- mate change is being managed in the most effective manner, based on the long history of lessons learnt from development assistance over the last 60 years. iii. Much climate financing is in the form of global funds (also called \u2018vertical funds\u2019). As the World Bank has noted \u2018global funds need to support country-led strategies and priorities\u2019 to be effective and sustainable. The report sug- gests that, although global agreements to fund climate change have emerged over the last 20 years, challenges remain to making this finance fully effective and sustain- able. Indeed, funding channels for climate change are proliferating, there are increased signs of fragmenta- tion, and evidence that administrative and institutional requirements burden recipient countries unnecessarily. Whilst it is recognised that providing external financing for any development activity is complicated, it appears that climate change financing is more complicated than most. iv. In the diverse contexts of the 5 case study countries, some common themes emerge. a. It is hard to quantify the external financing for climate change received. It is simply not adequately recorded. 1 IPCC. Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis (eds Solomon, S. et al.) (Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, UK, and New York, 2007), also here http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ ar4/wg2/en/contents.html b. All of the case study countries have climate change plans, in one form or another, albeit at different stages of progress. c. However, in all cases there is a level of role confusion as to who in government oversees climate change funding. d. Some of this confusion arises from the specific insti- tutional requirements of the external funds, which may be out of step with the roles and responsibilities of institutions in recipient countries. e. Accessing funding is often a challenge; there are diverse channels, with specific processes and pro- cedures requiring specialist knowledge. f. In some countries, were it not for the international focus on climate change and the demands of the international climate change architecture, it is unlikely that climate change would yet be part of the political discourse. g. Much climate change financing is, in operation, supply driven. It is not yet truly needs based. As respond- ents in one of the case study countries noted \u201cWhen donors state that their initiatives are aligned to [our] policy priorities, the reality is that often the actions are pre-set objectives for support, which are subse- quently modified to make them seem to be aligned with government policy priorities.\u201d h. Systems are not yet in place to record climate change financing (following on from i. above). At the same time, there are no specific commitments from funders to use country system for climate change financing. i. Whilst co-ordination mechanisms exist that might enable funders to harmonise their assistance, co- ordination and information sharing mechanisms particular to climate change financing have yet to be fully formalized. j. In none of the case study countries does it appear that representatives of all external funders of climate change assistance sit together to co-ordinate their funding. k. In all the case study countries, results management and reporting systems are inadequate, either in terms of the specific requirements for UNFCCC funding or in 1 Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific the broader terms of satisfying the Paris Declaration commitments. l. None of the countries had a dedicated forum for dialogue where funding partners, recipient govern- ment and other stakeholders such as civil society could meet around climate change assistance and financing. 5. Following on from these findings, the report includes the Bangkok Call for Action which are the recommen- dations arising from the Climate Change Finance and Aid Effectiveness Dialogues meeting which took place 19\u201320 October in Thailand. It recommends that we apply what we know of how to manage external financing effectively more robustly to climate change funding.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84f33049-0eba-40de-b691-233737c465c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "84f33049-0eba-40de-b691-233737c465c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Realising Development Effectiveness: Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6de586c8a4eb117e3760a87d3a09ea5cabe259a4b242f94b3d90dc019201d084"}, "2": {"node_id": "db684f8c-f995-4acd-9339-c27c165c0eb5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5eed998783f94c41fe13b3999bc4842ad56bcedf0717680906c1055cbf8d247c"}}, "hash": "e3d81018c6cbc4c56d031c2c5eb3e332fdad1ef05e4cf1237d7aad63ddb036f8", "text": "Among other things it recommends that we need: a. to reduce fragmentation and manage the proliferation of climate change funds, globally and in recipient countries, b. to commit to delivering climate change financing according to agreed aid effectiveness principles, c. to delegate where possible the management of funds to representatives in country, d. to ensure, where possible, funding is mainstreamed into development activities and budgets, using local systems and processes, e. to improve local co-ordination mechanisms, and f. to ensure the management of results is effective. 2 Realising Development Effectiveness Introduction We have less than 10 years to halt the global rise in greenhouse gas emissions if we are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a167a3e-a795-4d94-9eb2-f23c0935714a": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a167a3e-a795-4d94-9eb2-f23c0935714a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Realising Development Effectiveness: Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cdc7d0c2c780b8f8104dfdd6bdc44797ce23362b259ecd46d752b9a0463e737b"}, "3": {"node_id": "d25c1595-bf53-4f12-b9d2-337709236245", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "745ec443422371b43b9b42c1f2525db81b428c1f37f589c48e48b7253bacd104"}}, "hash": "082dc6b76cc5f2daea4344b47669cea53e9c015bb3cb621e8c68d4b39b483246", "text": "to avoid catastrophic consequences for people and the planet. It is, simply, the greatest collective challenge we face as a human family. \u2014Ban Ki-Moon, 2009 Poverty and climate change are the two great challenges of the 21st century. Our responses to them will define our generation, and because they are linked to each other, if we fail on one, we will fail on the other. \u2014Lord Nicholas Stern, 2010 Climate Change and Development are inseparable 1. During the last decade, we have recognised the threat that global warming poses to development. The climate change that results from increased global tempera- tures will impact on the environment, communities and economies. The 2007 Stern Review suggested current patterns of climate change would reduce global GDP by between 5 and 20%2 (figures Lord Stern now sees as conservative). Yet it is economic growth (the key goal of development according to many) that has brought with it increased emissions of the greenhouse gases which have caused global warming. 2. Through observing changes already taking place, we have become increasingly confident of what effects global warming is having. It is highly likely that we are already locked into a 2 degree centigrade rise in global temperatures by 2100. The 2007 Fourth Assessment Report of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change3 notes this will result in a sea-level rise of 2 See \u201cThe Stern Review: The Economics of Climate Change\u201d Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury 2007, UK http://webarchive.nationalarchives. gov.uk/+/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/stern_review_report. htm 3 IPCC. Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis (eds Solomon, S. et al.) (Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, UK, and New York, 2007), also here http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_ data/ar4/wg2/en/contents.html between 69cm and 1m (depending on location across the world). The consensus of subsequent modelling is that the sea level rise will be higher4. Seasons are changing, glaciers are melting, snow-fed rivers see increased run-off, marine ecosystems are transform- ing, seas are becoming more acidic5. If we carry on emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases at current rates, global temperatures could eventually rise by over 5 degrees centigrade, to levels not seen on earth for more than 30 million years6. 3. At the heart of global debates on climate change is the recognition that global warming is the result of emissions from countries already advanced in their development, and that the countries most vulnerable to its impacts are also the least developed. If developing countries are to respond to challenge, they will need assistance. 4. The international community has recognised the scale of the problem; we need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases without harming development, and adapt to the impacts of global warming so that the 4 Stefan Rahmstorf \u201cA New View on sea level Rise\u201d Nature Reports Climate Change Published online: 6 April 2010 | doi:10.1038/ climate.2010.29 5 For further details and levels of certainty see the IPCC 4th Report 6 See Nicholas Stern, \u201cClimate: What you need to know\u201d June 24 2010, New York Review of Books, 3 Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific \u201c \u201d \u201d \u201c potential damage is reduced. And for the reasons set out above, action is needed urgently. 5. Debates (as seen at the COP15 meeting in Copenhagen in December 2009) continue around the level of funding required, measured in the hundreds of billions of dol- lars. Similarly, discussions continue about the form of the funding, and in particular how much of the finance for climate change should be in addition to \u2018traditional\u2019 Overseas Development Assistance (ODA). 6. While making sure that there is enough funding will be key to implementing the global response, it is also essential that the funds provided are put to the best use possible, that they are fully effective. 7. We have 60 years\u2019 learning on what has and has not worked in the world of development co-operation (\u2018traditional\u2019 ODA).

It is part of a regional dialogue process, also being supported by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and the OECD DAC. 7 More information on the CDDE Facility can be found at www.aideffectiveness.org 10. This initiative has lead to a set of recommendations around the programming of climate change finance at the national and international level (the \u2018Bangkok Call for Action\u2019 \u2013 see below). It is intended that these recom- mendations should be useful to donors, partners, and the institutions involved in the global governance of cli- mate change financing, for instance to the December 2010 Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Cancun, Mexico and at the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness to be held in Busan, Korea in late 2011.

Fieldwork was undertaken by three different individuals, each with complementary experience and skills relating either to climate change or development effectiveness. The methodology for each case study was similar; a review of documentation followed by question- ing of key respondents either face to face or in writing, using the review framework as a reference. Findings were then collated in order to identify any emerging patterns or differences. 12. This report summarises these findings, placing them in the context of the broader experience relating to the delivery of climate change finance and principles of external development assistance. The recommenda- tions in the Call for Action arise from discussions around these findings held in Bangkok 19th\u201320 October 2010 by representatives from the region8. 8 See here for details http://www.aideffectiveness.org/cdde 4 Realising Development Effectiveness Funding the Response to Global Warming Global Agreements to fund climate change have emerged over the last 20 years 13. The 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro produced the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It established the principle that industrialised countries (termed \u2018Annex II countries\u2019 \u2013 principally members of the OECD) should pay for the costs of reduc- ing emissions in developing countries. 14. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol9 for the first time set targets for global emissions of greenhouse gases. In particular it limited the permitted emissions of coun- tries, and created market-based financing mechanisms to help countries meet emissions targets; \u2022 Emissions Trading (the \u2018carbon market\u2019 which allows countries with \u2018spare\u2019 emission units to sell them to countries over their targets), \u2022 the Clean Development Mechanism (which allows emitting countries to implement emission reduc- tion projects in developing countries, and thus earn Certified Emission Reduction Credits \u2013 CER), and \u2022 the \u2018Joint Implementation\u2019 process where particular countries could undertake projects in others and gain emissions credits. 15. Article 11 of the Kyoto protocol was clear where the burden should fall; developed countries should \u201cProvide new and additional financial resources to meet the agreed full costs incurred by developing country Parties\u201d. 16. A year later, the Buenos Aires Plan of Action10 was agreed. This made the Global Environment Facility (on behalf of the UNFCCC) responsible for managing the funding of activities supporting adaptation in developing 9 see http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.pdf 10 see http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/cop4/16a01.pdf countries, specifically technology transfer and capac- ity-building. The GEF had been set up as a trust fund (administered by the World Bank) to provide funding for the four Rio conventions (United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity \u2013 UNCBD, the UNFCCC, the Stockholm Convention and United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification \u2013 UNCCD).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2c84508-c7e1-44e7-8496-93627ad2bb41": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2c84508-c7e1-44e7-8496-93627ad2bb41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Realising Development Effectiveness: Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e2dbe4d6e80dc32834a4201d67b83e127ee6cde6c128cc5a4bdb43c25af97f5"}, "2": {"node_id": "50fc1a13-0c43-4d6e-bdb4-f5064012668a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f51c7e4cfadd8e35ded85f71d34a6fb0b012e9690bb0c2f1a36f9fec18112360"}}, "hash": "b3dde2fcc20398f59001a858875cb20432d0efaf91874a4e9a1cecc47f343ae0", "text": "In 2001 the UNFCCC decided to establish a Special Climate Change Fund11 (SCCF) and a Least Developed Country Fund (LDCF) to finance projects relating to climate change adaptation, technology transfer and capacity building.

By 2010, the following global funds had been put in place. (See annex 2 for a diagram how these funds relate to each other). 19. With some notable exceptions (e.g. the Congo Basin Forest Fund and the Amazon Fund) Asian countries are able to apply for funding from all of these sources. 20. Each of these funds has its own criteria for dis- bursement. Some are sector specific (such as REDD \u2013 Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, the Forest Investment Program and the International Forest Carbon Initiative). Others are less defined in their scope. However, applications for funding and reporting of performance take place through spe- cific mechanisms, usually directly to the administrative headquarters of the funds. 21. The Adaptation Fund is seen by many as signifi- cantly different14 in its governance, administration and operation. Unlike the other global funds, its board has a majority from the developing nations15, and the fund is set up to allow countries \u201cdirect access\u201d to funds for adaptation.

In particular, ensuring that such international funding supports country planning and objectives and relates to other sources of finance such as domestic resources and foreign direct investment have long been recognised as key challenges. 9 Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific The international community has developed collective approaches to improve effectiveness 30. After years of debate, the 2002 United Nations International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey provided the foundation of current interna- tional development co-operation arrangements. Signed by more than 200 countries, the Monterrey Consensus sought to ensure that all international finance for devel- opment is provided in a coherent way (whether in the form of bilateral or multilateral assistance, or as pri- vate investment, or through other forms). In particular, the Monterrey Consensus emphasised the need for a partnership approach between all stakeholders, and committed funding partners to increased financial sup- port and technical co-operation, and recipient countries to prioritise development funding. 31. In 2003 the heads of the multilateral and bilateral development institutions deepened this commitment through the Rome Declaration on Harmonisation. It emphasised the need for all donors to work together in support of country-led priorities, and notably called for further delegated co-operation to donors\u2019 country based staff. 32. In February 2005, the Government of France hosted a High Level Forum of donor and recipient countries. It was convened to take stock of global progress in making aid more effective since Monterrey, and to identify the areas in which more could be done. Out of this meeting came the \u201cParis Principles\u201d. 33. In September 2008, a further meeting was held in Accra, Ghana restating the global commitment to aid effectiveness and the Paris Principles, and setting out an \u201cAccra Agenda for Action\u201d. This sought to acceler- ate progress, particularly improving the use of partner country systems to deliver aid. Additional emphasis was placed on ensuring predictability of funding, that donors remove prescriptive conditions placed on how funds might be spent, and that all aid must be \u201cuntied\u201d (free from restrictions on where goods and services which are funded by aid can be bought23). 34. Indicators were developed to help assess progress in implementing the Paris principles and the Accra Agenda for Action. These are monitored periodically. In addition, evaluation of the implementation has been undertaken. 35. In 2010, the Dili Declaration by the G7+ countries emphasised that the principles needed to cover fragile and conflict-affected states. Dili committed signatories to the development of an International Action Plan on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding. The action plan will be tabled at the next High Level Forum, to be held in Busan in late 2011, where progress against the aid effective- ness agenda to date will be assessed. Climate change financing has been recognised as a key element of external development finance 36. In 2006 the OECD agreed a Declaration on Integrating Climate Adaptation into Development Co-operation. This commits OECD members to \u201cwork to better integrate climate change adaptation in development planning and assistance, both with their own governments and in activities undertaken with partner countries.\u201d 23 See OECD Website at http://www.oecd.org/document/18/0,3343, en_2649_3236398_35401554_1_1_1_1,00.html What are the agreed principles for international climate change financing? 10 Realising Development Effectiveness 1. Ownership Ownership is the foundational principle of the Paris Declaration. Development is something that must be done by developing countries, not to them. Policies and institutional reforms will be effective only so far as they emerge out of genuinely country-led processes. External assistance must be tailored towards helping developing countries achieve their own development objectives, leaving donors in a supporting role. 2. Alignment Under the Paris Declaration, the principle of alignment refers to two important changes to aid practice. The first is that donors should base their support on the partner country\u2019s development priorities, policies and strategies (\u2018policy alignment\u2019). The second is that aid should be delivered as far as possible using country systems for managing development activities, rather than through stand-alone project structures (\u2018systems alignment\u2019). 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3581c20b-7310-4bd4-a948-b6aa1031fa80": {"__data__": {"id_": "3581c20b-7310-4bd4-a948-b6aa1031fa80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Realising Development Effectiveness: Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3bb7e9ba33a506adbf83f309ab7129918ca0ade8a6e0e4bf54ed8481e8a36b25"}, "2": {"node_id": "bccb50cb-2eb3-4e91-ae91-f323a2daac87", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "435c54e20b959a81e78cd4997a58df8aef7ec7084a59e67b83d2db37b06045f2"}}, "hash": "7b67c3aab5715d3e6e01f01da0eb9513f7f075e6e1633d999d502c45c5cca2fb", "text": "3. Harmonisation Harmonisation refers to cooperation between donors to improve the efficiency of aid delivery. Donors are aware that multiple initiatives by different donors, each with their rules and procedures, can be very draining for developing country administrations. To reduce the transaction costs of aid, donors have been developing a range of new approaches, including programme-based approaches, pooled funding arrangements, joint country plans and other common arrangements. 4.

In the development field, it means ensuring that all development activities are orientated towards achieving the maximum benefits for poor men and women. It means ensuring that all initiatives, from individual aid projects through to national development strategies, are designed so as to generate performance information and use it for continuous improvement. 5. Mutual accountability Mutual accountability is perhaps the most controversial of the Paris principles, and the most difficult to put into practice. It suggests that, in a true development partnership, there are commitments on both sides of the relationship, and both donors and partner countries should be accountable to each other (\u2018mutual\u2019 accountability) for meeting those commitments. However, there are also many other accountability relationships involved in the development process that need to be taken into account. One of the innovative aspects of the Paris Declaration is that the commitments are reciprocal in nature, applying both to donors and to developing countries. This is an advance on its predecessor, the Rome Declaration, where the commitments were all on the donor side, and to traditional aid practices where the obligations were mostly on recipients. Reciprocal commitments create for the first time the possibility of mutual accountability. The Principles of the Paris Declaration 11 Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific It specifically mentions the Paris Declaration as the benchmark for providing such assistance. In 2009, this commitment was further articulated through policy guid- ance24 that reinforced the relationship between external climate change finance and the international commit- ments to aid effectiveness. 37. The OECD DAC now collects data on both mitigation and adaptation funding25, (the so called \u2018Rio Markers\u2019). As the DAC noted in July 2010, whilst COP15 committed funders to provide \u201cnew and additional\u201d resources for adaptation and mitigation, it did not define what this meant, nor specify whether qualifying projects would need to have climate action as their principal, or only a significant, objective. This makes capturing the quantum and range of climate funding difficult. 24 See OECD Website at http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/0/9 /43652123.pdf and annex 5 25 See OECD website for the specific definition http://www.oecd.org/ dataoecd/33/60/45906157.pdf 38. There is a further challenge. Most investments relate to investing in activities that deal with possible (not cer- tain) climate change scenarios and impacts in the future. If we wait until we know what the precise impacts will be (for instance by observing the actual sea level rise) it will then be too late to respond effectively; we may already be under water. Equally, general development (the achievement of the MDGs, achieving poverty targets) needs to be similarly \u2018future proofed\u2019 using appropriate investments now to ensure that future development is not impeded. This is termed the \u2018no regrets\u2019 approach, and requires management of uncertainty. It also requires that all development activities, whether identified as cli- mate change related or not, are \u2018future proofed\u2019, which often will require additional funding. \u201cOur support to developing countries to address the new challenges of climate change adaptation will be guided by the commitments of the Monterrey Consensus, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action. Country ownership is key. Consequently our assistance for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into development co-operation will be aligned to partner countries\u2019 long-term visions and their development plans and programmes. The majority of Least Developed Country Parties to the UNFCCC have or are developing National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). These and similar plans and strategies developed by other countries can provide a useful starting point. To the maximum extent possible we will seek to use our partners\u2019 own systems and harmonise our approaches. Our assistance should accordingly be administered by the relevant national authorities in partner countries. It will be accompanied by capacity development support to enable our partners, at various levels, to lead and manage all aspects of climate change adaptation. We will use a variety of aid modalities, considering each country\u2019s situation, and will make the maximum use of programmatic instruments such as programme-based and sector-wide approaches.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed111de1-e7aa-4275-9914-85dc54387a31": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed111de1-e7aa-4275-9914-85dc54387a31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Realising Development Effectiveness: Making the Most of Climate Change Finance in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d916aa54b1a3b182683af6e46267e11def39babb99eab4a91585b7bc16c1669"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e3d5fb9-b357-4839-8545-0c94f7b10f04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/realising-development-effectiveness-making-most-climate-change-finance-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e39f3d424686d805e58a3b0590ac89eee3bcf1c1a3c84d250d2d60eedb42e11"}}, "hash": "42887dc6f3845f3e3f414533f60fb046967e5e9338460c2930e5dd41ee6a53a6", "text": "We will provide our assistance in an efficient and effective manner in line with the principles of Aid Effectiveness and we will mobilise private sector support.\u201d OECD Policy Guidance: Integrating Climate Change Adaptation into Development Co-operation 12 Realising Development Effectiveness 39.
