acts can be targeted against objects, buildings and structures as well as people . For example, the targeting or deliberate destruction of campaign materials, vehicles, offices or ballot boxes may deter targeted communities from exercising their vote in a free and fair manner . The third indicator, threats and intimidation, relates to forms of coercion that are just as powerful as acts of violence . Indeed the \u201cthreat\u201d of violence, especially where there is a history of previous conflict, can 2 UNDP, \u2018Elections and Conflict Prevention: A Guide to Analysis, Planning and Programming\u2019, 2009; Sisk T, \u2018Elections in Fragile States: Between Voice and Violence\u2019, paper prepared for the International Studies Association Annual Meeting in San Francisco, California, on 24\u201328 March 2008, 2008; Fischer J, \u2018Electoral Conflict and Violence: A Strategy for Study and Prevention\u2019, Washington D .C ., International Foundation for Electoral Systems, 2002 . 6 have just as strong an impact on participation in, or even the outcome of, an election as actual physical violence . This can include targeting supporters of political parties with threats of harm if they campaign for specific candidates or even threats of physical violence to candidates for advocating on certain issues (e .g . human rights or land rights) . From a conflict-management perspective, violent discourse may also have a serious impact by polarizing the electorate along conflict lines and, in extreme cases, cause new outbursts of violence that exacerbate deep- rooted social conflict . Following from this in all the case studies for this volume there exists a linkage between election violence and perceived or alleged cheating . Massive cheating or fraud such as conspiracies to bribe voters, tampering with ballots, dishonest counting or rigging voter lists can be the stimulus for a violent reaction by those, including the general public, who believe they have been cheated .

A lot is at stake in elections . In Thailand for example one of the main precipitators of violent street protests has been allegations from both political sides that the other has somehow unfairly manipulated the electoral process . And in Bangladesh the political crisis of 2006\u20132007 was precipitated by high levels of violence and a lack of public confidence in the electoral system . As an example the collapse of the election process in January 2007 revealed that 12 million voters were illegally on the electoral role . Thus the independence of the election process and electoral administration, and how they are perceived to be designed, managed and implemented, have a strong bearing on electoral violence: those elections considered to be adequately free, fair and transparent (remembering that no elections are perfect) are less likely to experience electoral violence than those where allegations of mismanagement or deliberate cheating are prevalent . Unfortunately, electoral management bodies often do not have the capacity or political neutrality to ensure this best-case scenario . Electoral management bodies may also work in an environment where political parties display little willingness to accept the results of an election . In this scenario, even if publically legitimate elections have been implemented by a competent and independent electoral commission, its ability to mitigate electoral violence perpetrated by political parties will be extremely limited . Therefore holding free and fair elections is just as dependent on the cooperation of the government and the behaviour of political parties as it is on the technical management of elections . 7 The Electio The election cycle and violence Elections are not in themselves sufficient mechanisms for managing political change when the players have not bought into the rules of the game . In such circumstances elections can act like a piece of tinder in a hayfield and just as easily ignite violence or conflict as enable a peaceful transfer of power . The assassination of Pakistani political leader Benazir Bhutto on 27 December 2007 as she was campaigning in a tense election slated for 10 January 2008 (subsequently postponed) serves as an example, as do the 2009 Iranian election protests that saw scores of people killed as the re-elected President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad defended his win against allegations of election fraud . But just as important as the recognition that elections can trigger violence is the understanding that elections do offer the opportunity to manage political change in a participatory and peaceful manner . Electoral processes are very much about the management of social conflict through public dialogue, vigorous debate (itself often divisive) and the authoritative selection of leaders through electoral rules . At its core, and in line with the principles of democratic development, when people perceive that they have had an opportunity to be heard in a procedurally fair election, they are more willing to accept the results and grant legitimacy to the elected government to implement its policy and programmes .3 So just as we have cyclical policies and procedures to deal with long, hot, dry summers to ensure that the potential for a fire to break out in a hayfield and cause destruction is limited, if not completely negated, election management specialists including UNDP have come to regard election planning as a cyclical rather than an event-driven field, to ensure free, fair and peaceful elections .4 Under this approach the electoral cycle is divided into three interdependent stages . The pre-electoral 3 Elkit J & Svensson P, \u2018What Makes Elections Free and Fair\u2019, Journal of Democracy vol . 8, no . 3, 1997; Finley SA, \u2018An Identity-based Understanding of Intergroup Conflict\u2019, Contemporary Justice Review, 2010 . 4 Other electoral assistance organizations also use a cyclical approach to addressing conflict and violence in elections . See, for example, Bardall G, \u2018A Conflict Cycle Perspective on Electoral Violence: Taking the Long and Broad View on Electoral Violence\u2019, Monday Developments, 2010, accessed at http://www .ifes .org/Content/ Publications/Articles/2010/A-Conflict-Cycle-Perspective-on-Electoral-Violence .aspx . 8 phase focuses on electoral preparations including planning, training and registration, and the election period focuses on operations such as candidate nomination, voting and results management . The post- electoral phase then re-focuses on strategy such as reviews, strategic planning and legal reforms . This cyclical approach also serves to indicate when electoral violence is likely to occur and of what type . For example, threats and intimidation may be used to interfere with voter registration in the pre-electoral period, voter turnout may be influenced if", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6365c58-5642-4144-abdf-18b5c99479d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6365c58-5642-4144-abdf-18b5c99479d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Understanding Electoral Violence in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ccc3c5c9bf2c150949c8796bb8cf76eeb4b125612d3c5277b855859ffa246af"}}, "hash": "2ccc3c5c9bf2c150949c8796bb8cf76eeb4b125612d3c5277b855859ffa246af", "text": "large sections of the population refrain from casting their votes for fear of violence or its actual occurrence in the electoral period, and violence may erupt after the polls in the post-electoral period if voters believe the elections were illegitimate or fraudulent . A focus on violence around the electoral cycle has the advantage of being better suited to identifying all instances of electoral violence . The 2010 special rapporteur report on election-related violence and killings found that only 11 percent of fatalities occurred on election day, with 46 percent occurring in the pre-election period and 43 percent in the post-election period .5 These results illustrated how a focus on election day violence is likely to miss the majority of violent incidences that occur in the three months before and after the election . 5 Alston P, \u2018Report of the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions: Election-related Violence and Killings\u2019, 2010 . 9 Actors in Actors in electoral violence An electoral cycle perspective helps to create an awareness of the broad variety of stakeholders that can be perpetrators and/or targets of electoral violence . Extending well beyond electoral management bodies the influence of political actors, government agencies, security bodies, civic and media groups, religious organizations and student movements can have both positive and negative impacts on a county\u2019s attempt to deepen democracy through elections .6 The following actors have been highlighted in the seven country case studies as vital to preventing or perpetuating electoral violence . As the media was not a main concern rising out of the studies, an analysis of its role is not included in this section . However it is noteworthy that the media has an important role in circulating accurate information about elections . Where the media becomes politicized or is simply irresponsible it can fuel mistrust in the electoral process and destabilize it . Electoral management bodies The selection and functioning of the electoral administration, as well as the legal framework that establishes its independence, can have a direct impact on electoral violence . Electoral management bodies are at the fulcrum of issues related to impartiality and independence, efficiency, professionalism, and transparency .7 Where any of these are questioned, either through a lack of capacity, authority or actual fraudulent activity, a context of suspicion and mistrust can arise that destabilizes confidence, precipitates violence and often characterizes elections in conflict affected areas . For example, despite a solid constitutional and legal framework in Pakistan, the Election Commission has been accused of failing to stand up for its independence, impartiality and integrity . As it has been unable to withstand the pressures and manipulations of an overbearing executive, elections in Pakistan are characterized by a deficit of public trust and the lowest rates of voter turnout in South Asia . This is particularly acute in the North West Frontier Province, where the Election Commission has not been able to address or rectify political parties\u2019 violation of women\u2019s electoral rights . 6 http://www .ifes .org/Content/Publications/Articles/2010/A-Conflict-Cycle-Perspective- on-Electoral-Violence .aspx . 7 Lyons T, \u2018Demilitarizing Politics: Elections on the Uncertain Road to Peace\u2019, Lynne Rienner Pub ., 2005 . 10 Political parties Because they channel, aggregate and express political demands, political parties play an important role in managing conflict in societies, especially those divided along cultural, linguistic, religious, regional or other lines . If their maturity and commitment to democratic ideals is not high, and if the electoral system and the laws governing political parties are not effective, political parties can narrowly serve the interests of competing elite groups, enforce social cleavage, sideline women and pursue divisive agendas to secure power . In Nepal the high stakes following the end of the civil war in 2006 reinforced a winner-takes- all mentality among political parties . While freedom of movement was limited in the lead up to the 2008 Constituent Assembly elections to curtail violence by illicit armed groups, violence and harassment by all parties increased in the campaign period directly before the election as they sought to influence the outcome of the elections through threats and intimidation . This had an impact on women candidates who were deterred from campaigning by the hostile environment . Research suggests that institutionalizing an effective party system depends on four factors: the regularity of party competition, the depth of parties\u2019 roots in society, the extent to which parties and elections are widely accepted as the means of determining who governs, and the strength of parties\u2019 internal organization .8 By contrast, in juvenile or weak party systems, political party organizations are generally weak, electoral volatility is high, party roots in society", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27a46875-a629-46f4-bbee-031971b27274": {"__data__": {"id_": "27a46875-a629-46f4-bbee-031971b27274", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Understanding Electoral Violence in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a20d334530c4751a4d842aafafe9ac18d3cec21abd204c8006080f870bcfdbe1"}}, "hash": "a20d334530c4751a4d842aafafe9ac18d3cec21abd204c8006080f870bcfdbe1", "text": "are inadequate and individual personalities dominate parties and campaigns . In the Philippines a weak party system has benefitted political dynasties composed of families and close allies . The existence of political dynasties effectively excludes marginalized groups from participating fully in elections and other political processes, as running for office requires huge amounts of money, connections to government and electoral bodies, and even access to the police and military . Political party supporters In a number of the case studies, political party supporters were the main instigators and perpetrators of actual physical violence . In many 8 \u2018Building Democratic Institutions: Party Systems in Latin America\u2019, Mainwaring S & Scully TR (eds), Stanford University Press, 1995 . 11 instances they targeted their political rivals rather than the state or party leaders, especially during campaign events . For example, election violence in the 2008 election in Bangladesh reported by the human rights organization Odhikar was perpetrated overwhelmingly by supporters of the two main political party alliances contesting the election . Together they committed over 90 percent of recorded incidents of election-related violence, with 81 percent of incidents occurring in public areas and 77% involving physical harm or the destruction of property .9 Here, again, the role of the political parties is key, as strong leaders should be able to exercise control over their supporters; indeed, often they are the ones who deliberately or inadvertently incite their followers through aggressive rhetoric . Law enforcement agencies and security forces One of the key contributing factors to election order or disorder is the state itself, particularly its police and military apparatus . In fragile states government agencies and security providers have important roles to play in protecting: electoral stakeholders such as voters, candidates, poll workers, media and observers; electoral information such as vote results, registration data and campaign material; electoral facilities such as polling stations and counting centres; and electoral cycle events such as political rallies . But in instances where security forces are seen to be partisan or corrupt there is a higher chance that they will be purveyors of violence rather than protectors of peace . To address this issue, some countries prohibit the involvement of military forces and require uniformed personnel to stay in their barracks on polling day . In other countries, the military is integrally involved but may function under special arrangements, such as the head of the electoral management body temporarily assuming the mantle of armed forces commander- in-chief .10 In the Philippines electoral violence hot spots are identified before an election and local police and security forces there are placed under the direct administrative control of the Commission on Elections . In addition to playing a specific role around the electoral event, security forces can have an important impact during other stages of the 9 Odhikar & International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), \u2018Final Report on Election Violence in Bangladesh\u2019, Election Violence, Education and Resolution, Dhaka, 2009 . 10 ACE Electoral Knowledge Network, http://aceproject .org/ace-en/focus/elections-and- security/onePage . 12 electoral cycle . For example, in Thailand large demonstrations held by politico-social movements demanding political and electoral change led to clashes with state security forces in April and May 2010, leaving at least 75 people dead and over 1,000 injured . Illicit armed groups Outside of official state-sanctioned security organizations, illicit armed groups are other key perpetrators of electoral violence in situations with sustained violent political conflict . Electoral violence can be used as part of a militant organization\u2019s overall campaign to achieve a political goal . Hired thugs and private armies come from various backgrounds, though many initially began their careers as security guards or policemen assigned to the politician . Others can be former military or police personnel who have gone absent without leave due to involvement in crimes and syndicates and who subsequently attach themselves to local politicians as a protective service . In many cases, private militias include local criminal or gang leaders who are feared in the community . These leaders can be hired to consolidate a candidate\u2019s electoral base by bullying supporters of rival candidates . In the context of ethnic conflict, malpractices also stem from measures that curtail freedom of movement that in turn restrict voting . As an example the Sri Lankan 2005 presidential election saw the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam successfully and violently impose an election boycott in the north and east of the country . In the Philippines, hired thugs, security forces, private armies and armed rebel groups feature prominently in election violence that features abductions, killings, physical attacks, intimidation and other acts resulting in death, injury", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f6f7a2e-76fb-4ac4-b310-533273ba11fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f6f7a2e-76fb-4ac4-b310-533273ba11fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Understanding Electoral Violence in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bbf945e946ad288ad20e71a557e3453fea5da5ad13fbc7d4cfae90cfced4bb95"}}, "hash": "bbf945e946ad288ad20e71a557e3453fea5da5ad13fbc7d4cfae90cfced4bb95", "text": "and property damage . According to military reports in 2001, some 100 private armies were behind about 80 percent of election-related violence in the Philippines .11 And in Timor-Leste in 1999 the Indonesian military recruited, paid and deployed large numbers of local \u201cmilitia\u201d members to violently coerce the population during the referendum on independence, so as to disguise the military\u2019s role in the violence . 11 Patino P & Velasco D, \u2018Election Violence in the Philippines\u2019, Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, Philippine Office, 2004 . 13 Extremist groups Religious extremism is a subject of much attention as it has become one of the major contributors to violence, electoral and otherwise, in the modern world . As groups that pursue narrow interests at the expense of broader political consensus, religious extremists can affect elections by threatening with violence those who pursue diverging agendas or hold different views . In parts of Pakistan\u2019s North West Frontier Province elders, religious groups and local political parties forcibly exclude women from voting in or contesting elections as candidates . There have been examples of decrees and religious edicts being issued from mosques claiming that women\u2019s participation is un-Islamic and declaring that they would forcibly stop women from going to polling stations . In Bangladesh the hard-line criminal element in politics involves extremist groups that employ Islamic rhetoric for their own political interests . The impact of religious extremism in Bangladesh has worsened in recent years, most notably in August 2005, when 500 bombs exploded in a coordinated attack on the judiciary and civil administration in 63 districts . This incident was eventually traced to the activities of the Jama\u2019aetul Mujahideen Bangladesh .12 As this party does not recognize any law but its own version of \u2018God\u2019s law\u2019, the targets of the attack were courts, judges and administrative officials of the government . Youth and student movements The creation of youth and student movements has the ability to shape and reflect larger struggles for social and political change . In 2005 there were 3 billion people in the world aged between 15 and 25, and nearly two thirds of them, 61 percent, lived in Asia .13 Where this bulging demographic is either excluded from participating in and benefiting from the advancement of social economic and political developments, or live in a society that is dominated by corruption and violence they are likely to become perpetrators of violence themselves . In Indonesia widespread public dissatisfaction to the New Order\u2019s handling of the 1997 Asian financial crisis was sparked by student 12 International Crisis Group, \u2018The Threat from Jamaat-ul Mujahideen Bangladesh\u2019, International Crisis Group Report No . 187, 2010 . 13 http://www .unescap .org/esid/psis/publications/YouthRep/Youth%20Report .pdf . 14 movements . These movements accused the government of being incapable of handling the crisis and organized demonstrations throughout the country urging President Soeharto to step down . While the demonstrations were originally peaceful, violence was triggered between security forces and student demonstrators, eventually leading to President Soeharto\u2019s resignation in May 1998 following large riots . In Bangladesh a number of political parties have youth fronts that are led and supported by mastaans or santrashi who are essentially strongmen . There is considerable overlap between local party leaders and mastaans, and political figures have been accused of patronizing mastaans to retain political authority in their constituencies . As a result, these organizations reach deep down into society to exert their influence and ensure electoral victory . 15 Preventing Preventing electoral violence An all-encompassing policy for conflict-mitigation in an election cycle centres on the institutional design, political system and election laws of a given country . The mix of these three factors is especially important in countries that experience political violence . As highlighted above, the mix also rests on the acceptance and willingness of political parties and actors to participate in the electoral cycle and accept results . While this can be partly attributed to the real and perceived independence, transparency and effectiveness of an electoral administration, peaceful elections still rely heavily on a political culture that is motivated by, and respectful of, democratic principles . Institutional design The design of a political system has broad consequences for how different groups, ideologies and interests can be structured into a democratic system . Some systems can present ideological platforms that encourage narrow and divisive interest alongside a winner-takes- all approach to elections . Other systems can assist in encouraging wider policy and ideological platforms, where competing groups have incentives to come together and pursue common interests . For example, providing electoral incentives to campaigning politicians to reach out to and attract votes from", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "408ba6c2-19be-4da7-9c83-543a64b212a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "408ba6c2-19be-4da7-9c83-543a64b212a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Understanding Electoral Violence in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "917b6f51b14f7bf64702b8e9ac16cea06e9e83f284aef549725504dd4fa0dc20"}}, "hash": "917b6f51b14f7bf64702b8e9ac16cea06e9e83f284aef549725504dd4fa0dc20", "text": "ethnic, religious and ideological groups other than their own can encourage candidates to moderate their political rhetoric on potentially divisive issues and force them to broaden their political positions . Indeed, electoral systems specifically designed to bring political actors from different groups together to negotiate positions that move beyond their narrower interests have a better chance of breaking down entrenched social cleavages that promote conflict .14 In Thailand the design of the electoral system has fluctuated in part because of the 18 constitutions that have followed in succession since 1932 . This has been both a cause and an effect of political instability, with many changes in government resulting from army-led coups d\u2019\u00e9tat . 14 Reilly B, \u2018Political Engineering and Party Politics in Conflict Prone Societies\u2019, Democratization vol . 13, no . 5, 2006, pp . 811\u2013827 . 16 These constitutions have been seen by some groups not as instruments of the people to control the government but as instruments by which a government controls its people . Today, how the electoral system is designed to represent different geographical areas of Thailand remains a key concern for all parties involved in the violent street protests of 2010 and elections in 2011 . The legal system Electoral laws can set out legal constraints on the use of violence, the mandate and powers of election management bodies and regulations on who may stand in elections . Laws that are not perceived to be fair (such as being designed to advantage the incumbent) can undermine the credibility of the entire process . Such laws can also stipulate an electoral code of conduct, which can involve agreement on avoidance of hate speech and other activities that may spur violence and polarization . But without adequate procedures or enforceable sanctions against those who break electoral law a culture of impunity undermines the best efforts to mitigate violence .15 However, a positive example of laws being adequately enforced comes from the Philippines, where it is believed that the Philippine National Police\u2019s implementation of a gun ban, checkpoints, chokepoints and the monitoring of suspected private armed groups reduced the frequency of violence in the 2010 elections . Electoral dispute resolution Disputes are a natural part of any transparent democratic competition . However, their effective resolution so that they do not undermine confidence or spiral into violent conflict is key to the electoral process . Mechanisms to resolve electoral disputes should be put in place early enough to deal with challenges that arise during any stage of the electoral process and formal dispute resolution procedures should be clearly elaborated in election law and procedures .16 The objectivity 15 H\u00f6glund K & Jarstad AK, \u2018Strategies to Prevent and Manage Electoral Violence: Considerations for Policy\u2019, Policy and practice brief \u2018Knowledge for Durable Peace (1)\u2019, Uppsala University, 2010 . 17 and impartiality of dispute-resolution mechanisms are central to building public confidence and legitimacy in the election process and democratic institutions . Election observation and monitoring Another important mechanism that raises public confidence in elections and that can therefore prevent violence is the observation and monitoring of elections to guard against manipulation and to record incidents of violence throughout the electoral process . International election observation involves organizations generally recognized as neutral and credible, who can detect and therefore help deter and prevent manipulation, instil confidence in the results and bring international pressure to bear to achieve their acceptance . Domestic election monitoring, while sometimes perceived as less neutral by local or international actors, can deploy large numbers of people with intimate local knowledge to similarly detect and deter manipulation . While election observation groups usually work for only a short time just before and after election day, human rights monitoring organizations collect information about violence on a regular basis and draw attention to election-related rights violations during the longer pre- and post-election period . Other methodologies specifically aim to record incidents of election violence and may document facts such as motives, victims, perpetrators, responses and impacts of violence . In the latter case, such monitoring is done specifically to present findings to electoral commissions, government agencies, security forces, the media and other stakeholders to help craft responses that prevent or mitigate further electoral violence .16 Internal and external observation and monitoring provide both transparency and a means of mapping and tracking incidents to dissuade perpetrators and hold them accountable .17 16 IFES Electoral Violence Education and Resolution: http://www .ifes .org/Content/ Projects/Applied-Research-Center/Cross-Cutting/Election-Violence-Education-and- Resolution/Nav/About/Methodology .aspx . 17 Fischer J, \u2018Electoral Conflict and Violence: A Strategy for Study and Prevention\u2019, Washington D .C ., International Foundation for Electoral Systems, 2002 . 18", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4687635-d19a-4375-bcac-e55f8c0d87f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4687635-d19a-4375-bcac-e55f8c0d87f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Understanding Electoral Violence in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56bf06a17c827bdc2c98ea57e5c6e47ac63a7a5c2770304dc3bd449d2423584e"}}, "hash": "56bf06a17c827bdc2c98ea57e5c6e47ac63a7a5c2770304dc3bd449d2423584e", "text": "Other measures to mitigate electoral violence A number of other strategies can be used to mitigate electoral violence that were not specifically examined in the seven country case studies . As a starting point, building a strong democratic culture is vital to developing a country\u2019s ability to embrace participatory political transition through elections . Civic education is central for this, whether it be through formal school curricula or less formal media strategies that can include television programmes and radio shows . The media can play an active role in creating informed constituencies, but when it is controlled by the government or political identities it can have a destructive role in promoting narrow interests, inflaming political rhetoric and retarding democratic processes . Civil society\u2019s engagement can be a vital component in promoting civic and voter education, electoral monitoring and a forum for conflict mediation for candidates, political party supporters or political parties themselves . All these measures can be used to promote voter education and awareness as a method of clarifying and building confidence in the electoral process and its safeguards . This can include components on the value of democracy, how to cast a ballot, establishing the rules and procedures that electoral stakeholders should abide by, and establishing the electoral justice mechanisms available for voters who have been prevented by violence or other means from casting a ballot in an election . 19 Electoral Electoral violence in Asia: experiences from country case studies Bangladesh This case study examines the political crisis that began in 2006 when the titular president assumed the role of the chief adviser and unconstitutionally declared that Bangladesh had a presidential form of government . This period saw Bangladesh increasingly descend into political violence as a result of the political intransigency of the two major parties and intra-party rivalry for nominations, licenses and other forms of patronage . To end the crisis the opposition parties wanted a revised voter list (as the number of registered voters\u2019 exceeded the actual number of voters by 17 .3 percent indicating massive fraud), a reconstituted and independent Election Commission, and a purge of the civil service and the police . Following domestic and international political manoeuvring, the president declared a state of emergency in 2007 and relinquished the role of chief adviser . A technocratic caretaker government was formed and mandated to deal with the issues that had precipitated the crisis in the run-up to the election conducted in 2008 . In terms of addressing electoral violence, the reforms placed prohibitions on party affiliate groups that had caused problems in the past; implemented a new code of conduct for political parties and candidates to provide a secure and peaceful atmosphere for campaigning; introduced revised campaign spending limits, candidate disclosure requirements and better enforcement provisions; addressed issues regarding the impartiality of the election administration; and created a new and accurate voter list of 81 million citizens . While the political crisis resulted in a reformed electoral system that saw electoral violence abate for the 2008 elections, violence was still mainly tied to political parties when it occurred . The following recommendations can make further improvements: 20 \u2022\ufffd All political parties should refrain from personal attacks on one another and from delivering provocative speeches, following instead the Code of Conduct and Representation of the People Order . \u2022\ufffd The Bangladesh Election Commission still requires resources and systems in place to verify or investigate the expenditure filings of candidates . \u2022\ufffd The commission should have the capacity to implement electoral laws and rules strictly, without fear or bias . \u2022\ufffd It should develop a mechanism to monitor candidates\u2019 and parties\u2019 electoral expenditure and take due legal action in case of any violation . \u2022\ufffd The commission should set examples by disqualifying candidates, if applicable, for violating electoral norms and rules . Crucial questions for the future will be whether the reforms adopted in 2007\u20132008 will prove to be sustainable and, when the current Election Commission\u2019s term expires, whether the government will select new commissioners who enjoy the full confidence of political parties and the public . India While elections in India have meant more meaningful participation across a broad spectrum of society and better representation of all sections in politics, the incidence of electoral violence has grown along with Indian democracy . This trend reflects a complex mixing of socio- political factors and keen competition for political dominance among political parties . Outside recognizing quotas for women, this political atmosphere makes it difficult for women candidates to contest against men .

The case study outlines the electoral system, laws and dispute mechanism in India before focusing on the historical fight of marginalized lower castes in the Indian state of Bihar to exercise their right to vote . Electoral violence in this circumstance is seen as accompanying a social and political movement that sought to empower the poor and landless labourers . The political movement saw resistance from the landowning upper-caste groups in the area, and the jostling for rights through electoral processes multiplied incidences of electoral violence 21 from 1967 to 1995 . Violence such as killings, booth capturing, protests and poll-related violence finally declined in state assembly elections in 2000 as caste-based discrimination and conflict eased . Focus group discussions complement this analysis by detailing individual\u2019s perceptions on the scope and types of election violence . As the world\u2019s largest democracy, India delivers the world\u2019s largest exercise in voter participation and is fast becoming a source for advice on free and fair elections across the globe . The following recommendations aim to ensure that the political rights of the marginalized are realized and further capacity built in the electoral system to prevent violence: \u2022\ufffd New voter registration and the updating of voter lists should be simplified and conducted at regular periods . \u2022\ufffd The Model Code of Conduct outlined by the Election Commission should be incorporated into law, and candidates who violate it should be reprimanded accordingly . \u2022\ufffd A system for the verification of information furnished by candidates in affidavits should be set up, and those providing false information or concealing information should be barred from contesting elections . \u2022\ufffd The speedy disposal of electoral disputes can be achieved by setting up fast-track special courts and tribunals . \u2022\ufffd The Election Commission should be vested with more quasi-judicial powers to settle electoral disputes . \u2022\ufffd Stronger legal provisions should be established to prosecute polling officials found to play a partisan role in elections . Indonesia In the Indonesia case study, electoral violence is described according to three distinct phases of its post-independence electoral history: the Orde Lama or Old Order from 1945 to 1966; the Orde Baru or New Order Regime, which saw a military general assume the presidency and introduce symbolic elections from 1966 to 1998; and the current Orde Reformasi or Reformation Order . This last period, with three elections held in 1999, 2004 and 2009, is best understood as a period of transition, with the country institutionalizing the values of democracy . Under the old model of indirect elections in Indonesia, the pattern of violence was mainly characterized by conflicts among political parties, their supporters, local legislatures and the general voter . 22 Today, under the system of directly electing the president and heads of local government, branches of the General Election Commission (KPU) are among the main targets of violence and conflict . A case study by the Carter Center investigating electoral dispute resolution in the 2009 election provides insight into issues that need to be addressed to maintain a legitimate electoral process . While relatively peaceful, the 2009 legislative elections were marred by difficulties regarding the voter register, with reports indicating that the 171 million-name register was riddled with inaccuracies . While the General Elections Law 2008 provides a mechanism for addressing alleged administrative and criminal violations, it does not provide any recourse for a judicial body to review KPU determinations of alleged administrative violations or KPU decisions involving citizens\u2019 rights . The Carter Center analysis indicates that fine-tuning of this democratic process should incorporate the following recommendations, to increase transparency and accuracy of the electoral cycle process, and reduce the potential of corruption and confusion as contaminants for violence: \u2022\ufffd Improve the training of election officials, especially those managing polling stations where doubts about the legitimacy of elections have previously been raised . \u2022\ufffd Update voter data annually, accurately record it and use stricter law enforcement to prevent and penalize multiple voters, phantom voters and underage voters . \u2022\ufffd Extend the period for receiving administrative and criminal complaints to reduce cases of electoral impunity \u2022\ufffd Bawaslu (electoral supervisory body at the national level) and Panwaslu (electoral supervisory bodies at provincial and district levels) should be granted a mandate to mediate disputes, as this will lighten the burden on the KPU and allow more cases to be processed in a timely manner . \u2022\ufffd To promote more effective investigative measures by Bawaslu and/ or Panwaslu, additional human and financial resources should be provided to these bodies", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7314ef76-69d3-42fd-8a56-fe3f03c29b12": {"__data__": {"id_": "7314ef76-69d3-42fd-8a56-fe3f03c29b12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Understanding Electoral Violence in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0287213feeac36ea6c4a31d3fe1e6949e9116e1968bc06f932b9df67c07f3a54"}}, "hash": "0287213feeac36ea6c4a31d3fe1e6949e9116e1968bc06f932b9df67c07f3a54", "text": "in a timely fashion . \u2022\ufffd A comprehensive electoral dispute-resolution reform strategy should be put in place that can be reflected in a future election law . 23 Nepal This case study investigates the relationship between elections and democracy in Nepal, focusing on political parties\u2019 roles as contestants in electoral politics and a growing scepticism of the electoral system\u2019s ability to guarantee representative democracy . Building on a historical analysis of Nepal\u2019s turbulent democratic history that takes into account the Maoist insurgency, abolition of the monarchy in 2007 and Constituent Assembly elections in 2008, it explores weaknesses in Nepal\u2019s electoral system that perpetuate a winner-takes-all scenario . In particular, the growth in money politics and crime has corresponded with an incremental increase in electoral violence from the 1991 general elections to the 2008 Constituent Assembly elections . Leading up to the 2008 Constituent Assembly elections, freedom of movement was particularly limited in the southern lowlands, or Tarai, largely because of the increased presence of armed groups, and in some hill and mountain areas mainly because of political party violence, harassment and threats . Violence and harassment by all parties increased in the campaign period directly before the election . Security forces suffered a lack of capacity, authority and public confidence in the pre-election period . Measures to prevent and resolve electoral disputes had been introduced, including laws, rules and regulations mandating codes of conduct and financial disclosure for political parties . However, a number of these provisions have been unsuccessful as neither the Election Commission nor other agencies have the capacity to implement them . The Election Commission of Nepal has come under criticism for not having the regulatory teeth or independence needed to ensure that the incumbent government and political parties do not pursue election strategies that may provoke violent responses . As the nation is poised for a fundamental restructuring of the state through the Constituent Assembly, the opportunity exists to strengthen the electoral system in line with the following recommendations: \u2022\ufffd Though the Election Commission is an independent constitutional authority, political parties must support its initiatives to improve the electoral process . \u2022\ufffd Political parties need to be transparent and clear in their financial dealings . It should be mandatory for all candidates nominated by political parties to file their property and income information, and failing to do so should make them liable before the law . \u2022\ufffd The electoral code of conduct should become a law and other bills passed in relation to elections should be strictly enforced . 24 \u2022\ufffd The Election Commission should be empowered to deal stringently with cases of rigging and other election fraud . \u2022\ufffd As the election constituencies are about to be reviewed/changed after approval of the new constitution the election constituency delimitation should be done impartially and not influenced by undue political party pressure . Once the boundaries for representation are established the Election Commission may need to increase polling booths as well as resources to oversee election processes \u2022\ufffd It is imperative that the new government focus on providing a secure environment for Nepali citizens and on properly enforcing the rule of law to limit impunity and corruption . Pakistan This case study examines Pakistan\u2019s troubled political history since independence from British colonial rule in 1947 . A traditional feudal society, weak democratic norms, insufficiently robust modern institutions and continuous power struggles between presidents, prime ministers and army chiefs caused the country to suffer military takeovers four times, in 1958, 1969, 1977 and 1999 . These coups produced regimes that ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 60 years of existence as an independent state . This fragile past has contributed to citizens\u2019 lack of faith in a free and fair electoral process, causing voter turnout to average only 45 percent since general elections in 1947 and producing an electoral commission that lacks the independence or authority to withstand pressure from, and manipulation by, an overbearing executive . Obstacles examined in relation to free and fair elections include inaccurate electoral rolls and difficulties in identifying voters, a lack of faith in official electoral complaint processes and their timely execution, the politicization of electoral boundary delimitation to maintain constituency dynasties, insufficiently trained polling staff, and poor security for polling stations and ballot boxes . The case study outlines how in the North West Frontier Province women are forcibly obstructed from voting or contesting elections as candidates by socio-cultural structures, values and male-dominated politics . An example is illustrated where five major political parties signed agreements on legal stamp papers declaring that they would not allow women", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6729775c-9331-41ca-9346-6947df9e5827": {"__data__": {"id_": "6729775c-9331-41ca-9346-6947df9e5827", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Understanding Electoral Violence in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3605c4782f3ea497c6154984baa3ddd2af7431b01c4e5878a93848296c713a2"}}, "hash": "a3605c4782f3ea497c6154984baa3ddd2af7431b01c4e5878a93848296c713a2", "text": "to file nomination papers or cast their votes in elections . The signatories further threatened to launch a campaign to force 25 women candidates who did file their nomination papers to withdraw and warned civil society organizations to stop mobilizing women and supporting their participation in elections . They issued a number of decrees and religious edicts from mosques, claiming that women\u2019s participation was un-Islamic and declaring that they would stop women by force from going to polling stations . As a result, female candidates and their families were harassed and pressured into withdrawing from contesting the elections . The following are recommendations to rectify the situation: \u2022\ufffd Existing electoral laws should be implemented, and more stringent punishments should be enforced for election offences and violations . \u2022\ufffd The power exercised by the political elites should be curtailed, and the government should be more committed to protecting the rights of women and minorities and mainstreaming their political participation . \u2022\ufffd The Election Commission should assume almost all administrative functions during elections . It should assert its authority and not allow the executive to influence the election process . \u2022\ufffd The commission should set up a complaint-tracking system to more effectively deal with registered complaints . \u2022\ufffd The Election Commission must ensure effective security at polling stations with a special focus on stations for women and non-Muslims . \u2022\ufffd The number of separate polling stations for women at easily accessible locations should be increased, in particular in tribal and remote areas . They require trained female staff and special arrangements for security and privacy . Appropriate facilities such as waiting rooms and washrooms should be provided . \u2022\ufffd The Pakistan penal code should be amended to make punitive actions mandatory against anyone found to stop women voting . The Election Commission should take strong and prompt action against any individual, candidate or group that restrains women from voting or contesting elections as candidates . Philippines The Philippines case study outlines a history of elections and political power that has been dominated by martial law, political dynasties, accusations of fraud and violence . The Philippines has a weak party system that favours political dynasties composed of families and close allies . Parties are often reduced to coalitions of prevailing elites instead 26 of offering inclusive, responsive and responsible representation of civic interests . Unable to command party discipline, leaders and government functionaries are induced to gather legislative and local support through patronage, privilege, pork barrelling and other forms of rent-seeking that can easily spill over into electoral violence . As part of an effort to reduce violence and fraudulent practices, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) declares hotspots, or areas with an observed or expected high degree of violence . Alongside the deployment of additional security forces, exemptions to gun bans are withdrawn in these areas, while in critical hotspots the local police and other security units deployed are placed under the direct administrative control of COMELEC . In light of these measures, election- related violence appears to be becoming more targeted since the 1998 elections . In the 2010 election, acts of violence were generally planned ambushes, assassinations and premeditated shootings of targeted candidates and key campaign operators . However, COMELEC is also subject to political pressure and may make compromises as a result . The vast majority of its personnel are political appointees . Most of its offices are located in local government premises by virtue of the \u2018generosity\u2019 of local incumbents . Problems also arise when police and armed forces are politicized or favour specific candidates . The case study illustrates how fundamental reforms to the system are critical for conflict management and the development of political parties that support the integrity of the election process and reduce the use of violence and fraud: \u2022\ufffd There is a need to professionalize COMELEC by removing political appointees, raising salaries, promoting staffers on merit and training COMELEC personnel . \u2022\ufffd COMELEC should be given the necessary capability to enforce election laws and prosecute violators . \u2022\ufffd The government should ensure that the perpetrators of electoral violence are brought to justice, be they civilians, politicians or government authorities . \u2022\ufffd The government must take proactive steps to dismantle and disarm the private militias that proliferate across the country . \u2022\ufffd The government should implement measures to improve governance and reduce graft and corruption at all levels . Much electoral violence is rooted in struggles for illegal racketeering and patronage opportunities to which government offices provide access . 27 \u2022\ufffd The House Bill 3655, \u2018An Act Strengthening the Political Party System, Appropriating", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f2ff488-91e4-4ba7-9f27-455a3b831d5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f2ff488-91e4-4ba7-9f27-455a3b831d5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Understanding Electoral Violence in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-electoral-violence-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79e0dbb249923f68f07ffea37d60ca19a6c70d3bd850b34796e8852b469fba71"}}, "hash": "79e0dbb249923f68f07ffea37d60ca19a6c70d3bd850b34796e8852b469fba71", "text": "Funds Therefor, and for other Purposes\u2019, should be passed immediately to make political parties more competitive and robust . \u2022\ufffd Once the bill is passed the Commission on Audit should examine the financial reports of the accredited parties on their use of state subsidies . Thailand18 The Thailand case study traces the establishment of Thai democracy from 1932 and illustrates how the system has been characterized by fierce competition, political instability and electoral violence . The establishment of parliament as an effective and integral part of the country\u2019s political system has been constantly disrupted by military coups, and since 1932 the country has had 18 constitutions . The 1997 Constitution shifted the responsibility of administering and supervising elections from the Department of Provincial Administration under the Ministry of Interior to the independent Electoral Commission with quasi-judicial authority . The Constitution also allowed for the creation of a number of other independent bodies to monitor state power holders, including the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court . However, even after the 1997 reforms, it has remained easy for the governing party to intervene in the selection of election commissioners, and political manipulation and threats made to all bodies have raised serious questions about the willingness of all to act independently . With large amounts of money now invested in Thai politics, financial gain has become a major incentive for candidates . The close relationship elections have with power has meant that powerful actors with business interests and old political loyalties have come to split the population . Identity politics has come to define the political landscape, with street protests and violence a common feature, and enduring resolution and reconciliation a vague promise once streets are cleared . The Thailand case study examines this split through an analysis of the political protests and related violence that have occurred on and off 18 For a comprehensive account, see also International Crisis Group, \u2018Bridging Thailand\u2019s Deep Divide\u2019, International Crisis Group Report No . 192, 2010; International Crisis Group, \u2018Thailand: The Calm before the Storm\u2019, International Crisis Group Report No . 121, 2011 . 28 from 2006 . The protests have seen the People\u2019s Alliance for Democracy (yellow shirts) and the United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship (red shirts) step outside the electoral system and blockade Government House, international airports and Bangkok\u2019s central business district to achieve their goals of political change . One step to prevent further violence is to bring all sides back to contesting elections and accepting results under a legitimate and accepted system through the following recommendations: \u2022\ufffd All political parties should abide by the Code of Conduct for the General Election Campaign 2011 to ensure the election campaign is peaceful and the outcome respected . \u2022\ufffd Steps should be taken to ensure that election commissioners and all independent bodies established to monitor state power-holders remain independent and that any political efforts to intervene in their selection or to influence their decisions be punished . \u2022\ufffd Efforts should be made to ensure the integrity of the voter registry so that electoral fraud does not tarnish election results . \u2022\ufffd There should be an equally strong stand against all candidates who cheat and strong enforcement of laws to prevent ruling parties from misusing state facilities . \u2022\ufffd The Electoral Commission should provide extra training to provincial officers to ensure that they have the capacity to judge evidence of irregularities and other faults . \u2022\ufffd To address the perception of inequality that has driven the violence, decentralization reform that started under the 1997 Constitution needs to be pushed forward to strengthen public participation and control over local affairs and resources . 29 Conclusion Conclusion The key to preventing electoral violence is to strengthen the credibility of the election process and its outcomes . Doing so requires not only technical development and transparency but also political and legal reforms, broad public and civil society participation, and education . Taken from the case study on the Philippines, the following passage exemplifies the state of democracy and electoral violence across a number of countries in Asia outlined in this report: The challenge remains for the Government, political parties and civil society to pursue reforms to counter public cynicism about the credibility of the election process. Fundamental reforms in the system are critical for areas as diverse as conflict management, gender representation and the development of political party systems. Without these, it will be difficult to safeguard the integrity of the election process, and reduce the use of violence and fraud.

This situation is exacerbated in countries where internal conflict has further motivated politicians to pursue stability at the expense of democracy . Thus, to curb electoral violence, reforms must tackle the political as well as the technical side of elections . In particular, political parties have a crucial role to play in countries where electoral fraud and violence have become institutionalized .

Development cooperation contributes to the development of the capacities of \u201cduty-bearers\u201d to meet their obligations and/or of \u201crights-holders\u201d to claim their rights. \u2026Since [1997] a number of UN agencies have adopted a human rights-based approach to their development cooperation and have gained experiences in its operationalization. But each agency has tended to have its own interpretation of approach and how it should be operationalized. However, UN interagency collaboration at global and regional levels, and especially at the country level in relation to the CCA and UNDAF processes, requires a common understanding of this approach and its implications for development programming.

September. I u Background This report is based on lessons learned from documenting experiences and programmes that incorporated elements of the human right-based approach (HRBA)1 in several Asia-Pacific countries from 2004 to the present time. The initial observations of such experiences and programmes resulted in the documentation and publication of fourteen case studies in countries as diverse as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Nepal, the Philippines, and Viet Nam under the aegis of the Asia-Pacific UN Inter-Agency Lessons Learned Project (LLP) on the HRBA to Development2. After completion of documentation of the case studies, there was a need to decipher what lessons could be learned for future development programming. Thus, in early 2006, the LLP sent out a call for applications to UN agencies and civil society groups in the region to support innovative ideas on how the HRBA could be used under existing projects to realize human rights, and what lessons could be learned from the process. More than 80 applications were received from across the Asia-Pacific region. After an intensive screening process, the LLP, in mid-2006, partnered with civil society groups, UN country teams, National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) and various line ministries to undertake the exercise. The six pilot projects chosen were located across the Asia-Pacific region in Afghanistan, Fiji, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Thailand and Viet Nam. The projects focused on various sectors including the media, mining, the informal justice sector, non-formal education and housing and land. At various stages of piloting this process, the LLP provided technical assistance as required and also developed capacities of implementing partners to utilize the HRBA by holding capacity development workshops which included training on international human rights. Most of these workshops were held at the inception of pilot project activities and provided an opportunity for different stakeholders to develop relationships and discuss programmatic interventions that could be implemented. Activities under these pilots have now been completed, and lessons have been gleaned, with additional insights resulting from a final workshop/consultation with pilot projects\u2019 partners. Such reflection and documentation has provided a further appreciation of the challenges and opportunities presented by the practical application of HRBA. For the communities involved, such documentation provides a form of knowledge exchange and some evidenced based advocacy that can feed into programming practice. For development agencies, and particularly UN agencies, this documentation feeds into a process of sustainable change and capacity development on the human rights-based approach to programming. Finally and critically, this exercise has provided further information about the implementation of the UN guidelines set out in the 2003 The Human Rights-Based Approach to Development Cooperation: Towards a Common Understanding Among UN Agencies (Stamford Common Understanding) in the Asia-Pacific providing lessons and insights on the implications for policy, planning and programming. 2 Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming II u Introduction This report is one of two publications resulting from the Lessons Learned Project. Each publication focuses on a distinct audience, a reflection that the UN operates at both policy and programme level and that the Human Rights-Based Approach requires that both of these areas need to continue to be engaged in exploring its practical application. This first report is largely targeted at policy makers and strategic planning personnel in the various UN agencies. It reflects not only the implications of the pilot projects on the implementation of the guidelines set out in the Stamford Common Understanding in the region. It will hopefully also shed light on the LLP process itself, particularly the implications of the UN Inter-Agency efforts in this small project that spanned", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8031b348-b29f-4c97-9e0a-77717ea4c542": {"__data__": {"id_": "8031b348-b29f-4c97-9e0a-77717ea4c542", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "24a995257bdb915db7b84c21b4314c4f2dced0451f9a33f93e4643678f749448"}}, "hash": "24a995257bdb915db7b84c21b4314c4f2dced0451f9a33f93e4643678f749448", "text": "over four years. The audience for the second publication is the project based practitioners responsible for embedding the HRBA into programming. The end-of-the project report aims to present lessons learned with respect to the approaches used in claiming rights, the various tools used within the programme process, and how human rights can be realized in practice. It is hoped that both publications will contribute towards the further practical implementation of HRBA, and provide the lay HRBA practitioner with some insights into the issues that need to be considered in the planning and implementation of projects that want to be framed as HRBA projects. This paper would like to serve as a further contribution to the exploration of the practical implementation of the HRBA. It is however, distinguished by its focus on understanding, implementing and moving forward the Stamford Common Understanding on the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development Cooperation to ensure that human rights continue to be central to the work that is undertaken by UN agencies, and that the means to do so are appropriately explored and, most importantly, are shared. A number of caveats must, however, be noted. Firstly, the sample size of the projects is small and therefore it is not possible to generalize the findings and identify specific replicable \u201cbest practice\u201d programmes. Secondly, and reinforcing this point, these projects highlight and attempt to further various human rights with varying degrees of sensitivity in their local contexts. Some of these projects originated at the policy level, some at the community level, and hence they are, in effect, largely non-comparable beyond a common purpose to notionally adopt a Human Rights-Based Approach to programming. What should be obvious from the case studies is that the implementation of the HRBA into practice differs across organizations and contexts. Though a small sample, it should be clear that there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and much about the nature and form of programming and the short term outcomes is ultimately contingent on context, on the constraints and realities on the ground, and, unsurprisingly, on the mandates of the UN agencies involved. This is not to say that variability renders constructive analysis impossible. Rather, it is to say that the HRBA principles can and often are adapted to the different country contexts. There is value in reflecting on the specifics of the geographic contexts, and particularly the social, political and cultural context in understanding the methodological approaches adopted in these HRBA projects and their outcomes and impacts on human rights in the short and longer term. Indeed, the issue of implementation of human rights, local politics and the relation with traditional cultures needs to be explored if HRBA implementation across UN agencies is to be made more transparent. There are a number of issues that are explored in this Lessons Learned Project. The limitations of the pilot projects and indeed the limitations of the LLP itself provide valuable lessons in and of themselves. However, the lessons learned are not just about limitations and challenges. There are projects that, in the implementation phases, in one form or another reflected on the existing international human rights framework. Some have evidenced significant results in the realization of human rights, while there have been components of a number of the projects that have significantly contributed to building capacity to allow for the realization of these rights. While these may not always be strictly transferable, the tools and approaches adopted, and the considerations involved in designing these programmes provide valuable information for the application of HRBA at both the programme and policy level. The following section (Section III) will briefly outline the projects involved before proceeding to explore the implications for both strategic policy and programming. 3 Brief Profiles of the Projects Supported III u Brief Profiles of the Projects Supported 1.

Project Specific Innovations: g Addressing the traditional and formal justice system at the provincial level; g Trainings and relevant information materials were not solely based on the international and statutory human rights notions, but were quite extensively \u201cblended\u201d with the corresponding Sharia principles. This facilitated their acceptance by the beneficiaries. Project Background and Outline: Systematic issues in both formal and traditional justice mechanisms have affected the access to and delivery of justice in most provinces in Afghanistan. In some provinces and districts, a lack of staff and infrastructure meant that courts simply failed to function. Judges, prosecutors, and defence counsel were assigned to these positions but did not come to the office because of fear. Poor compensation impeded professionalism, motivation and integrity for justice officials. At the district level, salaries of judges, prosecutors, defenders, and prison officials were often set at USD$ 35 per month; in reality actual payment was months in arrears. Most justice facilities were destroyed by war or were not in adequate working order from the onset. Local justice in Afghanistan has been in short supply and the project was aimed at increasing that supply. It was also designed to complement other efforts undertaken through UNDP and other projects for reform and strengthening of capacity building of national justice institutions, in particular the National Justice for All Strategy and the Strengthening the Justice System of Afghanistan Project, but with the key difference of being focused on the district level and on vulnerable groups. The traditional justice system in Afghanistan, which in the provinces is a significantly larger justice supply mechanism, is mostly given marginal acknowledgement if any, which contributes to the dichotomy between formal and traditional justice, rather than enabling them to work in synergy. The AJDL recognized the importance and relationship between both justice systems. AJDL activities for traditional and religious 4 Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming leaders aimed to raise their awareness about the rights granted to the citizens of Afghanistan, as well as to build human rights-based delivery capacities within the traditional justice supply side and work to eliminate harmful customs which are a clear violation of international human rights standards or Sharia. AJDL focuses on awareness raising and capacity building within the community at the district level, and is a shift from the notion of the justice service as a centralized resource to the notion of justice as the communal \u201cgoods\u201d, which is accessible and available. The HRBA framework was adopted to help the rights holders and duty bearers to engage in an active dialogue, encouraging the duty bearers to meet their responsibilities and the rights holders to hold the justice delivery mechanisms and state institutions accountable. It aims to strengthen the social cohesion through seeking consensus and applying participatory processes, and focusing assistance on the most vulnerable strata of the society, namely women, children, the elderly, the displaced, the disabled and other minorities. Rights Advanced: AJDL combines awareness raising activities among both duty bearers and right holders, with the improvement of formal justice infrastructure at the district level to facilitate more responsive justice delivery and make it more accessible at the local level. In awareness raising, AJDL focuses on: (1) protection of women and children in criminal law; (2) the constitutional right to defence counsel during criminal proceedings and referral of cases; (3) family and personals status law, and; (4) land law.

Project Background and Outline: One of the most significant forms of systemic human rights and gender discrimination in the Pacific is that of women\u2019s right to adequate housing and land. Addressing both gender discrimination as well as access to livelihoods for Pacific Island women, this pilot project sought to; a) Increase awareness of the systemic, political (racial) and cultural discrimination that Pacific Island women face in accessing housing and land through a pilot national consultation that took place in September 2006 and; b) Equip Fiji stakeholders with a toolkit that utilizes a human rights-based approach to analyzing and mobilizing against systemic, political and cultural discrimination towards women\u2019s right to adequate housing and land. c) Utilize this pilot project to train UN staff to implement successive pilot projects in other Pacific Island countries. 5 Brief Profiles of the Projects Supported This pilot activity was a follow-up to the UN Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non discrimination in this context, Mr. Miloon Kothari\u2019s visit to the Pacific in which a regional consultation on the Women\u2019s Right to Adequate Housing and Land was held in October 2004. During this regional consultation, women\u2019s stories and case studies were developed and a framework for the HRBA analysis of women\u2019s right to housing and land was adapted and utilized. RRRT/UNDP subsequently utilized and adapted a tool kit developed by the Housing and Land Right Coalition (HLRC) for the analysis of WRAHL that could be used on a regional basis. RRRT\u2019s national partner in Fiji, FWRM has identified that WRAHL is a key issue amongst Fiji women and has joined partnership with RRRT/ UNDP in both further developing this tool kit as well as piloting a training and advocacy workshop on WRAHL in Fiji.

This achievement, in line with UNICEF\u2019s policy of continuously advocating and promoting the principles of HRBA within the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) and with government and NGO counterparts, is especially noteworthy given the rather challenging and often sensitive context of human rights in the Lao PDR. A major initiative in taking the HRBA principles forward and in enhancing partner awareness of the approach was a case study in rural water supplies and sanitation services in early 2005. This case study involved a documentation of the UNICEF supported rural water supply and sanitation project in Luang Prabang province as part of a regional LLP documentation effort. Human rights principles guide all phases of UNICEF process and are applied in all programme sectors. WES programmes now concentrate on sanitation, on building institutional capacity, and on raising hygiene awareness. This means working in partnership with the public sector and communities \u2013 especially women and children \u2013 in planning, implementing and maintaining WES systems. UNICEF has worked in close collaboration with NAM SAAT to develop the rights-based strategies integral to achieving project outcomes, and has also supported capacity- building within NAM SAAT and rural communities to implement these strategies. The aim has been to create conditions that would enable rural communities in 14 districts to access and maintain sustainable WES facilities. The development objective has been to supporting a Demand Responsive Approach in rural areas to improve access, use and sustainability of water supplies and sanitation facilities; and, to increase health and economic benefits and reduce infant mortality and morbidity rates. In 2006, the LLP was scaled up in other villages in Luang Prabang province and expanded to Savannakhet province. UNICEF Lao PDR is now in the final stages of undertaking joint programming in three districts in Savannakhet province. The 2006 LLP took into consideration all the recommendations in the 2005 case study and the comments provided by peer review in January 2006. Most importantly, was the recommendation to raise the awareness of rights holders on their right to water. As indicated, there are still a lot of sensitivities regarding human rights-related issues in Lao PDR. Yet, the valuable \u201clearning by doing\u201d approach through actual implementation of human rights-based approach to programming in the WES sector, and subsequent incorporation of the Lao PDR experience into this regional initiative, have contributed to an increased openness and awareness amongst partners regarding building processes and establishing foundations for sustainable and long-term provision of services and mechanisms in order to respond to the rights of children and women throughout the country.

Mining activities in Mongolia have created serious problems of water pollution, diminished surface waters, and caused the destruction of pasture land. At large, the root causes for lack of access to rights could be summarized by the shortcomings in mining legislation that does not take into account the rights of residents in the mining exploitation zones. Also, limited access to justice became evident during public interest litigations at the courts. The herder communities suffer the most and they lack the resources and power for participation and inclusion in the decision-making process that affects their preferred livelihoods. The main objective of this pilot is to reinforce the HRBA concepts while targeting extractive mining practices in rural areas of Mongolia. The pilot aims to achieve a demonstrated level of empowerment of herder communities that are affected by environmentally destructive mining practices. The project sought to educate the judiciary on environmental law, run public litigation programmes and social campaigns to highlight the issue and provide advocacy for change in partnership with the National Human Rights Commission.

THAILAND Name of Project: Building Capacities of Duty Bearers and Claim Holders in Select Community Learning Centres in Northern Thailand via UNESCO/UNICEF Interventions Lead LLP Partners: Buphai CLC, UNESCO Bangkok Partner/s: Buphai Community School, Buphai Sub-District Administration Organization Location: Ban Buphai, Ubon Ratchathani province, Thailand. Human Rights-based Techniques Used: human rights training, focus group discussions, community dialogue, community based participatory budgeting, social mapping, community surveying. Project Specific innovations: g Implementation of initial project site in local community with a history of successful community development work, such as the use of a model community to advocate for HRBA in surrounding communities; g The creation of a community social welfare fund; g The utilization of public land to provide a private resource for poorer families; g The establishment of regular community meetings to discuss project outcomes. Project Background and Outline: In Thailand, since the late 1990\u2019s, UNESCO Bangkok has been supporting non-formal education through local educational institutions referred to as Community Learning Centres (CLC). The centres are set up and managed by locals, and intended to produce social transformation by enhancing development through education. Based on the principle of inclusion, CLCs are designed to reach out to those outside the formal school system including pre-school children, out-of-school children, the disabled, the elderly etc. There are now 8,691 CLCs in Thailand. Concurrently, the UNICEF Office for Thailand has collaborated with the Ministry of Education in piloting the Child Friendly Schools (CFS) Project. The CFS project is based on the concepts and principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It attempts to create and demonstrate a new type of school that delivers quality education that is accessible to all and that focuses on and supports the health and wellbeing of its students. There are currently more than 600 CFS in Thailand. The purpose of the pilot project in north eastern Thailand was to promote a human rights based approach to non formal education through the CLCs in close collaboration with the UNICEF\u2019s Child Friendly Schools project. Involving both students and community members, the project was designed to facilitate and initiate activities based on a HRBA at the local level. The project sought to explore how a HRBA could be practically implemented in provincial Thailand. Rights Advanced: Buphai CLC members framed their work in accordance with \u201cChild Rights\u201d principles including the idea that children must be safeguarded from harm, must be appropriately cared for, must live in safe conditions without any health hazards, while also being able to enjoy their right to an education that enhances their development to the fullest. These ideas underpinned the \u201cCommunity Love Cleanliness Project\u201d, Early Childhood Care and Development Project and the Prevention of School Drop-out Project. Rights with respect to non-discrimination, access to appropriate economic resources and empowerment underpinned the \u201cOne Rai Self-Sufficiency Project\u201d and Vocational skills training for physically disadvantaged persons projects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06205776-8705-4a59-b668-ef7b7fbfb185": {"__data__": {"id_": "06205776-8705-4a59-b668-ef7b7fbfb185", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59c701cc84960856aed1b2e9346ae7dfbdb5777a95c6c0acc13f2aa97aba1c54"}, "2": {"node_id": "152ccb63-5cf6-4f3b-84ba-e5b7cb547185", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b103ba079f29f32f7feff95d4efdee3d05404be835e61e28b8a905b485eaec38"}}, "hash": "2ddd4874469b43262506be153808f2cdf4a529f767428770f2d05916c29a4535", "text": "For further information contact: Asia Pacific Education for All (APPEAL) Unit UNESCO Bangkok Website: http://www.unescobkk.org/index.php?id=15 Tel: +66 2 391 0577 Fax: + 66 2 391 0866 Email: appeal@unesccobkk.org 9 Brief Profiles of the Projects Supported 6.

Project Background and Outline: Viet Nam\u2019s popular press remains very state-centric, with limited reporting on human rights violations. Several newspapers in Ho Chi Minh City have however, recently called for greater journalistic integrity, notably the Saigon Group, Thanh Nien, Lao Dong and Tuoi Tre. The publications of these outlets are now free of all state-issued publishing subsidies. To some extent there has been an effort to re- locate the Vietnamese media in the context of international standards and indeed to embrace new initiatives of training. This is a gradual process, and progress must be measured in the context of other changes in Vietnamese society, but there is a perceptible and professionally discernable process of evaluation of the role of the journalist in Viet Nam, and this is gradually having an impact on media out-put. There is also evidence, though limited, that the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) is encouraging a more independent approach to the press, alongside the increasing emphasis on business enterprise and commercial development in other sectors. It is commonly accepted that these processes will have an influence on journalism. The primary goals for the project were as follows: g To influence the basic and in-service or continuing life-long education of journalists in Viet Nam by appropriately introducing human rights concepts as part of the issues in media training; g To work with the professional journalistic community in the development of methodologies and approaches to handling human rights issues in Viet Nam, and to human rights reporting; g To develop a system of \u201ctraining of trainers\u201d(ToT) which would have a wider impact on the training for, and discussion of human rights in the Vietnamese media; g To inform a wide section of the Vietnamese media about human rights issues and their influence on the substantive subject content and activity of their work; g To contribute to the increased treatment of human rights issues in the Vietnamese media; g Providing training in human rights issues at the level of (1) basic media training and (2) \u201cin-service\u201d or life-long and specialist training which will equip Vietnamese journalists in the handling of human rights issues; g Contribute to increased awareness of human rights issues and respect for human rights in Vietnamese civil society.

Five years later, the LLP with its analysis of HRBA in six UN and bilateral funded projects adds another contribution to the exploration of the implications of the Stamford Common Understanding and its impact on human rights-based programming. While the sample is small, the issues, challenges and successes arising from these projects are important. Their significance is firmly rooted in the necessity for a reinvigoration of discussions on HRBA and its application in the UN. While individual case studies on HRBA in the UN system have become more common, the implications for regional, local and country collaboration and a common understanding of development programming approaches still requires significant work. The findings from these projects have raised as many questions as they have answered. There remain a number of issues that require further clarification and discussion; issues that have existed since the Stamford Common Understanding was reached. These questions include the relationship between human rights and programming and issues that have become more pertinent today such as HRBA and the Millennium Development Goals. The focus of this part of the report is therefore primarily on the UN and how five years down the track policy and strategic planning is, or isn\u2019t, fully realizing the Stamford Common Understanding guidelines and, more particularly, meeting the requirement to clearly link and use human rights instruments as guidelines", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ac1d091-42e2-4e96-90e8-089bd3780918": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ac1d091-42e2-4e96-90e8-089bd3780918", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffa7f425d5b7b0dcbec03064618b4b2cd925d494f8e047841cc6c643efd5c917"}}, "hash": "ffa7f425d5b7b0dcbec03064618b4b2cd925d494f8e047841cc6c643efd5c917", "text": "for programming and programming strategies. Embedding and Understanding Human Rights Defining a Human Rights-Based Approach The guiding principle and differentiating factor of the HRBA as defined in the Common Understanding that distinguishes it from other forms of programming and basic good governance guidelines is the requirement that; \u201cAll programmes of development cooperation, policies and technical assistance should further the realization of human rights as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments\u201d, and, \u201cHuman rights standards contained in, and principles derived from, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments guide all development cooperation and programming in all sectors and in all phases of the programming process.\u201d It can be argued that it is this principle that makes a project distinctively human rights-based. While the other essential components can be seen as critical to good programming and governance4, a human rights-based approach must not only further development and good governance aims but must also explicitly be guided by international human rights instruments. 4 \u201cGood governance has 8 major characteristics. It is participatory, consensus oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law. It assures that corruption is minimized, the views of minorities are taken into account and that the voices of the most vulnerable in society are heard in decision-making.\u201d (OECD 2001) 11 Undertaking a Human Rights Based Approach: Lessons for Policy and Planning Embedding Human Rights The requirement that standards, processes and principles contained in international human rights instruments guide development cooperation and programming, was, in most of the cases the point of reference for the projects at the outset of programming. However, the way these standards subsequently informed the development of the programmes through implementation was inconsistent across the six projects reviewed by the LLP. This can be largely attributable to the selection criteria for the projects which did not demand that projects be chosen conditional on direct and explicit reference and engagement with these mechanisms throughout programming. Consequently, for most of the six projects the primary linkage to human rights instruments was a programmatic focus on a specific right identified within the various conventions, declarations and treaties. The six projects were chosen in part on the basis of the particular mandates of the UN agencies involved and, in part on the successes of previous and pilot projects undertaken. The consequent diversity of the programmes provides an interesting reflection on some post hoc impositions of the human rights-based approach lens. The following sections examine how human rights and human rights mechanisms were embedded in the various components of HRBA programming and the approaches and degrees to which the projects reviewed by the LLP met the principles and requirements articulated in the Stamford Common Understanding. Situational Assessment For a number of the projects reviewed by the LLP the situational assessment had been undertaken prior to the LLP funding and prior to the introduction of a specific HRBA lens. The consequent result is that the situational assessments reflected varying degrees of relationship to human rights instruments. Fiji and Mongolia both adopted HRBA prior to their situational analysis, ensuring an open discussion on human rights and international human rights instruments with rights holders. Notably, Fiji held national consultations in conjunction with the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non discrimination in this context, with a strong and clearly articulated focus on issues highlighted under the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). This was not, however, true for Lao PDR. The Lao PDR WES project did undertake a rigorous situational assessment, however, the reference to human rights and human rights instruments, was less obvious. In this instance a specific human right was chosen and the situational assessment of both micro and/or macro issues/needs was undertaken with limited reference to human rights beyond clear identification of the right involved. This, in part can be explained by the latter imposition of a HRBA lens for this project, but, it also may be argued, particularly in the instance of Lao PDR that the narrowly defined human rights issue was a product of the expediency of working with government and the political context in Lao PDR for exploring human rights issues. The situational assessment in Viet Nam was also significantly influenced by its political context. The \u201csituational assessment\u201d undertaken by the consultant for the project was largely based on discussions and interviews regarding the understandings and attitudes towards reporting of human rights in Viet", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "197ffedb-1aaf-4ae7-864c-0b6da9942d8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "197ffedb-1aaf-4ae7-864c-0b6da9942d8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ec080c2bea54f3d6d26acb030ef8d70b9ab001b5b5ee64d252adffa745609b6"}}, "hash": "9ec080c2bea54f3d6d26acb030ef8d70b9ab001b5b5ee64d252adffa745609b6", "text": "Nam. There was little if no, critical analysis of human rights issues in Viet Nam nor any rigorous critical analyses of the role of the State in limiting reporting in this area. This was taken as an unspoken given. Again, the political context limited the capacity for an in depth human rights based approach to the situational assessment. It should be clear from the above examples, that it was not only the timing of the introduction of the HRBA into programming but also the local context which played a deciding role in the degree to which programming was linked to human rights mechanisms in these projects. For each of the programmes the rights language used and indeed the capacity to fully explore human rights issues within the situational analysis was contingent on the programme partners, the political environment with respect to the human rights discourse and the stakeholders engaged in the situational assessment stage of programme implementation (ie., government, communities, NGO\u2019s etc.). The critical importance of the context for human rights and their appropriate reflection in programming was emphasized by all of the pilot projects. Yet, concurrently, it was argued that though context was critical, international human rights instruments should ultimately provide the conceptual basis and framework for the realization of human rights through programming. In reference to the principles of good programming that are essential to the HRBA, that is, firstly and importantly, that analysis includes all stakeholders and secondly, that situation analysis is used to identify immediate, underlying, and basic causes of development problems, the above mentioned absence of interrogation of rights-based issues at the macro level (Viet Nam, Thailand) and at the micro level (Lao PDR \u2013 while water issues 12 Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming were interrogated, these weren\u2019t framed in a broader human rights context at the community level) appears inconsistent with the principles of the HRBA under the Stamford Common Understanding. However, in the instance of Thailand the issues at the macro level and particularly the policy environment were explored and engaged with at a later date. This was, however, a reflection of the participation of a single government representative who later became a strong advocate of the project at the policy level. While Thailand is a notable exception, the engagement of all stakeholders in the initial situational assessment, where possible should be advocated. This can be argued not only on the grounds that this is requisite to truly understanding the underlying causes and distribution of the non-realization of human rights but also on the grounds that it can encourage the active engagement of government stakeholders further in the programme process. Viet Nam is a clear example of how the dislocation of government from the situational analysis and the process more generally, can ultimately result in a lack of long term viability of a project. In this case, once the consultations with journalists and media representatives had been completed, the project ended with the manual being written to become a component of ongoing training in the course of business as usual for the Vietnamese Institute of Human Rights. Fiji also noted that the limited participation of government in the national workshop presented a missed opportunity for greater advocacy and critically, normalizing and facilitating further dialogue between community and government to support the future realization of a number of women\u2019s rights. A rigorous situational analysis provides a unique opportunity to actively engage multiple stakeholders in the rights issue at hand. The LLP clearly highlighted the value of utilizing both top-down and bottom-up approaches that can support current and future dialogue between stakeholders, empower rights holders to articulate rights and duty bearers to explore impediments or capacity deficits contributing to the non realization of rights. Capacity Building While the choice of programming did not necessarily always reflect an initial focus on HR Instruments, the one consistent thread through all the programmes was the introduction of HR and HRBA education/training. Each and every project had an element of human rights education and/or training on the principles of a HRBA as a key component of capacity building. This is the singular and distinctive commonality across all projects. While the training for some projects was primarily targeted at rights holders (e.g. Thailand), in others it was largely focused on duty bearers (e.g., Viet Nam, Lao PDR). In Afghanistan, Fiji and Mongolia both rights holders and duty bearers were involved, however, in the instance of Fiji, the representation of government as duty bearers was limited due to political and timing factors. This is significant because it gets to the heart of what", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5347e519-f954-42ec-a42a-bb20e950911b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5347e519-f954-42ec-a42a-bb20e950911b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7180753dab7e420ab029481fa46c78ac62eee61b36862ab1411573db57f17fef"}}, "hash": "7180753dab7e420ab029481fa46c78ac62eee61b36862ab1411573db57f17fef", "text": "the various UN agencies believe to be their role in undertaking the human rights-based approach. In the instance where the focus was largely on the rights holders/communities involved, the strategic intent is focused on empowerment and advocacy (e.g. Thailand). In the instance where the focus is greater on capacity development of government, the intent is primarily on duty bearers taking responsibility for the realization of human rights. Ultimately the Stamford Common Understanding rightly advocates for both top-down and bottom-up approaches to be used in synergy, which for various pragmatic considerations was not always possible or not even attempted. The ultimate determination of bottom-up versus top-down approaches to capacity building with respect to human rights education was ultimately influenced by context, by the nature of the human rights issue involved and the initial focus on community/government or both. The issue that is raised is whether the projects that focused only on capacity building with respect to human rights at one end of the government/community spectrum can be considered human rights-based programming. If capacity development on human rights and the HRBA is the sole common consistency across all the programmes that were chosen by the UN and bilateral agencies involved in the LLP to implement the HRBA, after their initial programming parameters were in some part set, then at this critical juncture is HR training/education necessary at both ends of the spectrum? In light of the essential criteria for good programming under the Common Understanding, the simple answer is yes, both top-down and bottom-up approaches need to be used in synergy. The case of Lao PDR is instructive. This highly successful project has realized the right to water and sanitation among other attendant rights that have resulted from the freeing of time that occurred as local access to water improved. Furthermore, the government has been actively engaged in the process and has been trained on the human rights-based approach, on utilizing a participatory approach for monitoring and evaluation and local situational assessment. Furthermore, consultations between government representatives and communities have been established. Communities have also been trained in monitoring and evaluation and are personally responsible for choices regarding the supplier, funding the water supply and monitoring the quality of the 13 Undertaking a Human Rights Based Approach: Lessons for Policy and Planning service delivered. By traditional standards this is a successful development programme. However, little if no capacity has been built within communities to advocate for other human rights. This was in fact, a top-down process where human rights awareness of the community was limited to the right to water. This is despite the incidental realization of other human rights (education, livelihood etc). This is not to dismiss the potential long term value of introducing rights into the government lexicon, however, as acknowledged by the project team involved, as a stand alone project this could not claim to be fully implemented from a HRBA. However, as part of a broader, ongoing strategy that includes the gradual introduction of human rights training for rights holders, this programme could potentially meet HRBA criteria. A final point that was raised by these pilot projects is the critical importance of capacity building activities in complement to human rights training activities to support rights holders to not only be able to identify rights issues but also to be able to seek the fulfilment of rights from duty bearers. Being cognizant of the need for top- down and bottom-up approaches includes ensuring that communities are able to appropriately articulate their rights and have the resources and understanding to navigate formal institutional settings while concurrently ensuring that formal institutions are capacitated to mediate or address these issues. In Thailand, after the initial human rights training had been undertaken and the concept of rights embraced, the community remained uncertain as to how to go about looking for redress for a number of these rights through local administrative channels. They also noted the need for a simplified guide to the national legislation pertaining to various human rights, clearly highlighting an identified capacity gap between understanding and appropriately framing human rights issues through the relevant channels. In Mongolia, herder communities and local administration were taught about the requirement for participatory agreements under the 2006 mining legislation and how to negotiate and prepare these agreements with mining companies. The project undertook non-formal legal education activities during field missions and provided local communities with practical skills to support them to discuss, draft and negotiate such agreements, while concurrently raising the awareness of mining companies and local administration on the provisions in the new law.

In Afghanistan, while the public was educated on human rights issues, local courts were rehabilitated and duty bearers from both formal and informal justice systems were trained on human rights and legal obligations. The projects reviewed by the LLP emphasized the need to not only raise awareness of human rights in capacity building activities but also to complement this training with capacity building of all stakeholders to raise and address these issues within relevant local and national, formal and informal institutions. It is for this reason that in a number of the projects after initial training sessions, human rights were almost exclusively articulated in reference to national and local legislation and customary practice rather than to international human rights instruments. While potentially contradicting the idea of programming being explicitly linked to these instruments, the pilot projects have argued that the critical reference to international human rights instruments should be in the initial training and that recognition is required that constitutions are often the translation of international law and human rights within the national context. Programme Planning and Development There were limited if no obvious linkages to international human rights instruments and mechanisms within the programme planning and development phases of the projects reviewed by the LLP, with Fiji being the notable exception. The others projects, however, did, to varying degrees, reflect the necessary components of the HRBA to programming including participation, empowerment, accountability, non-discrimination, a focus on the most disadvantaged and strategic partnerships. However, the application varied. While Lao PDR focused on communities\u2019 access to water resulting in the incidental realization of other human rights (such as the right to education), other forms of potential disadvantage and discrimination were not directly addressed. Planning and implementation involved creating and embedding formalized, regular consultations between government and village water user groups to ensure the accountability of government to communities and to empower villages to monitor the access to, and the quality of water provision. The local communities were not, however, empowered to articulate other human rights. In Thailand, the site of the project and the initial community were selected because they had undertaken successful community development projects in the past. However, the projects undertaken by the Ban Buphai community and the other communities that subsequently adopted the human rights-based approach were all initially focused on 14 Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming the most marginalized. In Mongolia, while a proportion of the herder communities involved in the project were empowered to address and raise issues of the environmental impacts of mining, the livelihood needs of other members of the community that had adopted artisanal practices dependent on these mining practices were not addressed. Hence while obvious linkages to human rights were not present in all the projects, other necessary, specific, and unique elements of the human rights-based approach were to varying degrees applied. Though there was little uniformity in the programmatic response to ensure that the necessary components of human rights programming such as participation, empowerment, accountability, non-discrimination and strategic partnerships were realized, discussions held at the workshop highlighted that projects believed that each and every one of these issues was critical to the appropriate and successful implementation of HRBA to programming. The extent and implementation of these principles, however, is project specific and hence while recognizing that these principles are necessary, the nature and extent to which they are embedded is, relatively flexibly applied. The importance however, of their application is evidenced when examining the role of strategic relationships and more particularly the engagement of government and other key stakeholders in strategic planning. The degree of government involvement and the establishment of strategic partnerships with relevant government agencies during the planning and development phases was, to some extent, determined by the nature of the human rights involved and largely contingent on the initial engagement of government with the issue at the outset of the project (though not in the case of Thailand where the government became involved at a later stage). Despite the differences across projects, it can be said that those projects that had active government involvement (largely because they were less contentious) were more successful at realizing human rights on a larger scale \u2013 at least in the short term. Advocacy based projects, such as those in Fiji and Mongolia, were viewed as part of ongoing advocacy based strategies requiring longer time frames and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf4e5235-ef30-41bc-9610-f97588dea270": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf4e5235-ef30-41bc-9610-f97588dea270", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45466fe90977cfe2ef107e9867ab0c22cbb99111f37270676ab86d4d4fcecd2d"}}, "hash": "45466fe90977cfe2ef107e9867ab0c22cbb99111f37270676ab86d4d4fcecd2d", "text": "incorporation in broader UN agencies, NGO and National Human Rights Commissions strategic plans. In the case of Fiji, strategic planning requires a longer term advocacy agenda as it involves not only addressing adequate housing and land rights for women, but other women\u2019s rights as well. In Mongolia, long term strategic investment, planning and programming including the pursuit of public interest litigations as well as ongoing media campaigns has been identified as a prerequisite to secure the realization of human rights in the longer term. Critical to both will be the availability of adequate resources to continue to advocate for these issues in circumstances where government funding and resources may, at least in the short term, be less likely. In these instances strategic planning requires clear identification and/or commitment of funding and resources in the longer term, necessitating strategic alliances with NGOs, other UN agencies and where possible with national human rights mechanisms. Further, while government engagement in the initial planning process may not be viable, long term strategies to establish these relationships and to engage government in the planning process in the longer term are likely to be required. In the case of Thailand, short term realization of human rights, such as the right to education, health and a livelihood, have occurred largely due to community will and resources. However, the success of the community in its future efforts to address more contentious issues such as claims on disputed land and demands for increases in the number of pensions for the elderly and disabled is still unknown. Again, it is likely that advocating and engaging government on more sensitive human rights issues will require longer time frames and greater strategic planning. To this end, to create a critical mass for this advocacy and to share the economic costs, strategic partnerships between communities to jointly address this issue are being established. In this way creating strategic partnerships and engaging them in the planning cycle can and is often critical to ensuring the long term success and viability of human rights advocacy programmes. Finally, as initially noted, during the planning phase of the project cycle, ensuring that human rights principles such as participation, accountability, non-discrimination and empowerment are addressed is mostly straight forward and more likely to be considered and embedded in the process (though differentially applied). It is the linkages to human rights instruments that, as highlighted in the projects reviewed by the LLP, may be less likely to be prioritized. As the example of Fiji shows, however, embedding human rights mechanisms into the planning process can in fact strengthen future advocacy through the linkage to formal, internationally recognized processes. This has the potential to support the legitimacy of the programme internationally or at minimum provide a wider audience to advocate for recognition and realization of the particular human rights issues. 15 Undertaking a Human Rights Based Approach: Lessons for Policy and Planning Monitoring and Evaluation The monitoring and evaluation component, particularly as pertains to human rights, is probably one of the most discernible challenges for HRBA projects. Most processes can be, and in the instances of the projects reviewed by the LLP were, relatively well monitored. For example, the community in Ban Buphai would regularly report on the project process in monthly community meetings, while the Lao PDR project regularly monitored and reported on the quality of the water provision for the village. In Fiji, the value of the workshop was ascertained through daily surveys of participants. Process and short term outcome evaluations, though not always straight-forward, are a relatively well developed field, as is monitoring and evaluation of service delivery. Project partners at the LLP workshop unequivocally advocated for regular monitoring and evaluation of both outcomes and processes to ensure project learning and consequent project adjustment. In contrast to monitoring and evaluating processes and service delivery, monitoring and evaluating the realization of human rights during the advocacy process is difficult. While Fiji was able to utilize feedback from national consultations on the value of the consultations, changes to human rights as a direct function of these consultations are difficult to determine in the short term. The requirement that programmes monitor and evaluate outcomes guided by human rights standards and principles can be incredibly difficult in the short term when changes are required to legal, policy and planning processes or to behaviour and cultural mores. Observing the number of individuals trained, the number of villages with piped water systems, or attendance at a workshop is relatively straight-forward.

Monitoring advocacy based projects and their impact on human rights is not. What is clear from the advocacy based projects on human rights that were politically sensitive (notable in the instances of Fiji, Mongolia and Viet Nam) is that there are limited methods for evaluating the change in the human rights landscape and the realization of human rights as a result of short term programming. This is not to say that attendance at a workshop is not a justifiable short term outcome, however, it is difficult to argue for the Human Rights-Based Approach if we cannot monitor the impacts on human rights at minimum in the longer term in this area. This is the very argument for a coherent long term strategy to address the human rights issue in the country and for aligning strategies and programming with issues raised in recommendations from the international HR mechanisms. Without this cycle of recommendations from the international HR mechanisms, UN country planning and programme design, there is no logical link that can be made to the realization of human rights and programme and project implementation. While the work in Fiji was clearly tied in to a broader strategy for change in women\u2019s rights, particularly around housing, the Viet Nam project was not explicitly tied to a broader agenda for advocacy. The absence of connection to broader UN strategic planning in the area of human rights ultimately left this programme adrift, with no opening for government dialogue on human rights and the media, no strategy to create a movement for greater advocacy in this area and no mechanisms tied in with the VIHR to monitor the changes in human rights reporting in the media. The need to establish long term monitoring mechanisms particularly for advocacy based programmes is critical during the programme planning stage. Whether tied in with UN CCA\u2019s or as part of ongoing activities for the key partner organizations, it is difficult to argue that HRBA to programming has been undertaken in the absence of long term planning for the realization and monitoring of human rights. Reinforcing this argument is the case of Mongolia. Pilot partners have noted that the herder communities are, in fact divided. There are those groups who are attempting to claim back their pasturelands from mining companies and to restore water resources, and as noted above, there are those groups who are inadvertently causing environmental degradation as a result of artisanal practices based on resources obtained from the mining process. It is noted by project partners that the projects reviewed by the LLP, and the UNDP Access to Justice programme are ill equipped to address those adjacent issues, e.g., introducing safe and cost-effective technologies for those dependent on income from artisanal work. It was noted that this scenario provides a strong justification for human rights mainstreaming in country programming to ensure greater coherence in addressing the needs of different vulnerable groups. In this context long term country strategies would better ensure that programming reflects the indivisibility of rights, and that the impact of programming on the rights landscape is equitable beyond the scope and the focus of the project itself. A final caveat, however, should be noted, as was evidenced again in the case of Mongolia. The project tied its legislative analysis, fact finding missions and other evidence based initiatives with the timing of the annual human rights report of the National Human Rights Commission. By law the NHRC reports annually to the 16 Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming parliament within the first quarter of the year. Findings and recommendations from these annual reports are reviewed at the human rights sub-committee of the parliament. The 2008 annual report contained a section on the findings and recommendations of the pilot project, and the legislator issued a decree for further actions by the executive. What is highlighted in this instance is that monitoring and evaluation, as a critical component of strategic planning can and should where possible be tied in with national human rights mechanisms and reporting feeding into national planning processes and not just UN planning processes. It can be argued that long term strategic planning for the realization of human rights may be better placed in national institutional practice or in mutually reinforcing UN and national human rights institutional strategies to enhance the probability of long term sustainability and monitoring. Understanding Human Rights Another issue that was consistently raised by project teams was the difficulty in translating and explaining international human rights instruments in ways that were both meaningful and acceptable to the government and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44273056-4d37-4233-8c3e-66fe3e17da4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "44273056-4d37-4233-8c3e-66fe3e17da4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a3976c65b959c0346e366b711bc0c10f15f089fad685e2f1c9c21bcf0bfcded"}}, "hash": "1a3976c65b959c0346e366b711bc0c10f15f089fad685e2f1c9c21bcf0bfcded", "text": "communities involved. Unsurprisingly, the result was that in each project the notion of human rights was conveyed in a different way and the ways in which rights issues were explored and discussed varied significantly. In Lao PDR, they were discussed purely in relation to the right to water and sanitation, while in the case of Viet Nam, human rights discussions were limited to issues such as the rights of children and women and those with HIV/AIDS - issues that are less politically sensitive. The focus on particular human rights issues was in most of the projects determined by the degree of sensitivity to human rights issues in the country. However, as much as pragmatic considerations of national contexts and project viability provide valid justifications for the approaches adopted, this does raise the critical issue of human rights, power relations and the role of the UN, which will be explored further in the following section. The projects reviewed by the LLP did, however, provide examples of managing for the translation of human rights issues to the relevant country contexts. In Afghanistan, rights were explored in direct relation to bridging Islamic and human rights laws. In regards to the acceptance of the notions of the rights by the beneficiaries, both among the rights holders and duty bearers, it was reported by the implementing partners that they were mostly well accepted. However, it should be noted that the trainings and the materials were not solely based on the international and statutory human rights notions, but were quite extensively \u201cblended\u201d with the corresponding Sharia principles which significantly facilitated their acceptance by the beneficiaries. While this \u201cblending\u201d appeared to result in a relatively positive response by the moderate communities of Balkh and Herat, it was noted that NGOs were largely focusing on Sharia law rather than on bringing the two notions of human rights together and that it was necessary to reiterate the AJDL approach (ie the importance of human rights as articulated in international law) in sessions with NGOs. In Thailand, though international human rights laws were discussed, they held little currency and generated genuine fear of conflict until the Thailand Constitution was discussed. It was at this point that the community began viewing rights as legitimate entitlements. The notions of human rights as a fundamentally western concept remains in many countries. It was observed in the Fiji project that human rights were often viewed as being incompatible with customary law. In certain instances, this is the case (the section below will explore this issue in relationship to the role of the UN in greater detail), in others, there are points of commonality that need to be explored and highlighted. Views of rights as highlighted in the Thailand project can be potentially confronting and abstracted from the lives of local communities. References to national constitutions and law may be one way in which to show the direct connection between international human rights instruments and legislation that has direct reference to these communities\u2019 lives. The degree to which human rights training is couched in international \u201crights\u201d language however, raises notions of the importance of human rights principles versus the importance of clear identification and articulation of international human rights linkages. This is yet another area where short term political pragmatism versus longer term human rights agendas can conflict with the determination of programme priorities. While Afghanistan walked a very tight line with respect to this issue, it provides a good example of ways and means to straddle both issues, though responses to the training in less moderate communities will test this further. 17 Undertaking a Human Rights Based Approach: Lessons for Policy and Planning In the end though, the ultimate goal of the programme and the significance of human rights instruments need to be explicitly identified. If the sole purpose of training is to encourage recognition of one specific rights issue, then a pragmatic approach may be valid. However, the larger agenda for human rights, articulated in the Stamford Common Understanding, effectively makes this a moot point. In the UN there is a larger agenda to encourage a broader dialogue on human rights, and, where conflict does arise with customary law that the international human rights instruments are the primary point of reference. This fact, however, should not necessarily prevent programming and training from reflecting both customary as well as international law and where possible and useful, the marriage of the two should be adopted. Similarly, national laws can be used to contextualize human rights education. As was the case in Thailand, it was only when trainers discussed human rights within the framework", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4aaefa4a-cec4-4c03-8786-837e3c4146c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "4aaefa4a-cec4-4c03-8786-837e3c4146c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "156dd7136239c6b53ba2a5602c0ee160bed377abc30b149a6d90e9cc2b4a1549"}}, "hash": "156dd7136239c6b53ba2a5602c0ee160bed377abc30b149a6d90e9cc2b4a1549", "text": "of the national constitution that the community felt comfortable engaging and embracing the concept of human rights. From this position forward, human rights were solely viewed and discussed with reference to the constitution and local law. This may appear at first glance to distance the project from international human rights instruments, however, as noted by a number of the pilot project partners, the national constitution and relevant laws are often the operational expression of the country\u2019s international human rights commitment. Without any references to international human rights laws and mechanisms it would be difficult to argue that HRBA has been adopted in programming. This however becomes more contentious where the programming and training manuals are designed specifically to address human rights as articulated in international human rights instruments but are simply not conveyed in this manner to primary rights holders and duty bearers. The projects reviewed by the LLP largely focused on training that reflected on both international human rights instruments as well as local customary or formal law. The degree to which the international human rights law and mechanisms explicitly permeated programming varied reflecting context and political and cultural sensitivities. The projects, however, were clear that the HRBA required sufficient flexibility to allow context including political and cultural sensitivities to be reflected, and that this demanded that human rights be couched in terms that were relevant and acceptable to stakeholders involved. What the LLP highlighted was that the efficacy of training required explicit recognition of local context and that training could include reference to both international human rights as well as the local expressions of these rights. A final caveat must be added that there are some instances where human rights couched in international human rights language could alienate stakeholders from engagement with the project. At this point, the agency involved needs to make a decision as to the prioritization of the human rights agenda versus a purely development agenda. Where the two diverge the implementing agency needs to reconcile its mandate with the requirement to meet the Stamford Common Understanding and to establish clear guidelines on its preparedness to challenge national power structures and the existing status of various human rights. This is a recurring theme emerging from pilot studies that will be explored in the next section. 18 Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming Human Rights, Power Dynamics and the UN One of the most consistent themes that emerges from the study of the six pilot projects is the ambiguity around the role of the UN system and UN agencies in promoting the further realization of human rights. What becomes clear is that pragmatic approaches versus long term rights advocacy is a project by project consideration and determined in part by both the UN agency and the country context. The result is that the human rights agenda and its premise for challenging power dynamics is inconsistent and at times, pushed to the back of the agenda. The notions of empowerment of rights holders, and free and active participation, particularly of the most marginalized groups in society, may not necessarily be foremost in the mind of programme designers, particularly in large scale programming. What was absent in a number of the projects was active vigilance against reinforcement of traditional power relations and dynamics throughout various stages of the programming process. There is no doubt that these projects resulted in securing or furthering the realization of human rights. There is, however, significant concern that the intention to alter inequitable power relations through the human rights-based approach can be marginalized or merely forgotten in various stages of the programme in attempts to implement project work. Hence, two key questions regarding power relations were highlighted through the case studies. Firstly, what role does the UN play in advocating for addressing sensitive issue that impact on the realization of human rights? Second, to what degree are the power inequities found in a number of cultures in the Asia-Pacific addressed and recognized throughout the programming process? The latter question is perhaps slightly more straight-forward, when it doesn\u2019t converge with the first question of addressing sensitive human rights. The implications of local empowerment is that the structures that exist at the local level within communities may be reinforced or unquestioned through the programme design. That is to say that unless there is a degree of vigilance from project partners, local power structures and their attendant hierarchies can be reinforced with consequences for the marginalized groups within the community or indeed for marginalized communities themselves. The Thailand pilot study presents an interesting example.

Whether they were reluctant or otherwise, these families were effectively asked to provide personal information to members of their own community, in a situation where power relations would have been unlikely to have been equal. The ability of these families to actually deny this information would have been quite limited. While the intentions of the community representatives were undeniably positive, and the survey findings led to programmes that clearly supported these families, the basic right to privacy was violated. In the case of Lao PDR, the question that is raised is whether a programme that does not train or empower rights holders to claim and challenge duty bearers to protect and fulfil rights outside a pre-specified human right can be considered to be adopting the HRBA? The programme was certainly characterized by significant participation, accountability, non-discrimination and a focus on the most marginalized. It had limited links to international human rights instruments and mechanisms, and as noted above, did not in the first instance claim to be fully HRBA compliant. It did, however, embed the elements of good programming that are essential to the HRBA, which the project noted as having a significant positive impact on the development outcomes of the programme. There is no doubt that the project benefitted from most of the essential components of the HRBA lens as defined under the Stamford Common Understanding, however, in the absence of appropriate training and broader human rights education it is easier to argue that this project was a very successful development project focused on service delivery rather than the HRBA. The only caveat to this is that without the explicit adoption of HRBA (no matter how it is applied) human rights would not have been placed on the WES government agenda and the terminology itself would not have entered into governmental organizations\u2019 discourse. At both the UN country and agency level the trade off between introducing and acclimatizing governments to human rights language and the long term integrity of the language of rights needs to be considered. This leads directly to the issue of the role of UN agencies in challenging power relations and advocating for sensitive rights. It raises questions such as whether to raise human rights violations in a training session on human rights for journalists in Viet Nam, or whether to insist that human rights education be introduced for communities in Lao PDR, or whether to tackle strategic policy and planning frameworks and broader legal reform at the national level to address environmental issues and herder rights in Mongolia. There is no consistency across agencies as to whether or not to undertake sensitive human rights issues, as this is often 19 Undertaking a Human Rights Based Approach: Lessons for Policy and Planning determined by the UN country team. The reality is that UN agencies have different mandates, and projects occur within strategic country plans such as the UNDAF (United Nations Development Assistance Framework) / UNPAF (United Nations Partnership Framework). The degree to which programmes do or do not address sensitive human rights issues needs to be viewed within the strategic planning of the UN agency and the broader strategic planning of the UN country team. At these levels the linkages to human rights need to be established with clear strategies for the realization of human rights progressively over time and ongoing recognition and reflection on recommendations coming from international HR mechanisms. The pragmatic approach to programming is just that, it is informed by the understandings of UN experts in the field of the political sensitivities and the space for negotiation. The reality is that the capacity to undertake development programming can be compromised by advocacy based programming in sensitive areas. Further, particularly in HRBA, great sensitivity needs to be given to issues regarding the need to empower local communities and the need to ensure that programming and change at the policy level are able to keep apace of the expectations resulting from human rights training. The conclusion that can be drawn is that a single and clear mandate for UN agencies on the responsibility for undertaking highly sensitive issues related to human rights in projects based on the human rights-based approach is not likely to be forthcoming. However, the basic elements of the human rights-based approach must be considered and, where possible, captured and reflected in various stages of the programme process with international HR mechanisms clearly linked to UNDAF and Common Country Assessments thereby reflecting an ongoing commitment to the progressive realization of human rights.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dfa537f5-f612-4bd3-879a-b2c5509eef3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "dfa537f5-f612-4bd3-879a-b2c5509eef3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f67b82804b4a1e645995a7666cc212d39cb1d1683835d2bcad4dfbea9a4d238"}}, "hash": "8f67b82804b4a1e645995a7666cc212d39cb1d1683835d2bcad4dfbea9a4d238", "text": "Furthermore, with the introduction of the Human Rights Advisors to the UNCTs, this engagement becomes more viable if there is sufficient capacity within their roles to provide a supportive role in the delivery of HRBA projects and in the strategic planning of the country. It should be noted however, that what is considered consistent with the HRBA requires appropriate reflection. These case studies were ultimately problematic because they were not all originally designed as HRBA processes. While some were broadly consistent with the HRBA principles, the question remains as to whether a number of them could legitimately say they had adopted the HRBA in the absence of certain essential programming components including, the training of rights holders on human rights, appropriate monitoring and evaluation, and active engagement of duty bearers. What should be clear is that the LLP, with its particular focus on post-hoc implementation of the Human Rights-Based Approach, in effect reinforces the need for projects to be conceived from the outset within a HRBA framework. The importance of such an approach is that it will allow for consideration of issues such as; appropriate capacity development of both duty bearers and rights holders, planning and monitoring for addressing potential power inequalities and the housing of programmes within broader strategic frameworks. Adopting such an approach can facilitate the incremental realization of human rights regardless of the political sensitivities of the country involved and ensure that these programmes are linked to international human rights norms and standards. 20 Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming HRBA and the Millenium Development Goals In reflecting on the LLP, the HRBA and the UN, a critical issue that needs to be raised is the degree to which rights based approaches and projects are in keeping with the MDGs and, indeed, whether the MDGs are reflecting the rights issues that are challenging the Asia-Pacific Region. It should be stated at the outset that the sample of HRBA projects reflected during the project life of the UN Interagency Lessons Learned Project on the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development Cooperation is small and consists of only 18 (4 LLP 20075, 14 LLP 2005) projects out of a significant pool of possible HRBA projects that have been implemented in the region. As such, this sample simply could not be taken to be representative of the HRBA projects undertaken in the region. To try to further broaden the sample, 81 project applications for the 2007 LLP were considered. However, again a number of caveats exist and are identified and noted below. Even by widening the sample, it cannot be directly generalized to the population of rights-based programmes in the region as the self selection process in applying would have likely introduced bias to the sample, particularly given the relatively small amounts of funding available. However, the sample does cover a range of potential and existing HRBA projects conceived over the past three years and while broad generalizations can\u2019t be made, this sample can provide some insight into the human rights being explored in the region and their relationship to the MDGs. Attachment B provides a mapping of these rights against the various Millennium Development Goals. What should be clear from the mapping of human rights against the various Millennium Development Goals is the absence of programmes for MDGs three and four on maternal and child health. For MDG five there are no non-HIV/AIDS based programmes. Recognizing the qualifications identified above, the questions that this raises are who initiates these projects and is it simply a factor of non inclusion in this sample or do the agencies and institutions that undertake this type of project simply not view them from a HRBA perspective? Similarly for MDG eight that directly addresses the special needs of the least developed countries with particular reference to issues of debt, tariff and trade quotas, the needs of landlocked and small island developing states and providing access to affordable essential drugs in developing countries, there are no related projects in the pool of LLP applications and projects. It should be recognized that these goals are aimed at the least developed countries and hence this MDG has a strong emphasis on African nations. Furthermore, these goals are fundamentally macro goals and largely based on bilateral and multilateral agreements between governments and the private sector. However, issues of debt burden, trade and affordable drugs can all be translated into national and local programming, yet for some reason in this sample of projects these issues were not directly addressed. This again, may merely be a function of this particular sample of projects.

Further questions are raised with respect to the absence of specific reference to social justice in the Millennium Development Goals. When not explicitly applied to women, social justice can only be tentatively applied to MDG eight with respect to good governance and the indicators simply do not attempt to measure or quantify access to justice, a critical rights issue that significantly impacts on a number of the MDG goals. There is no doubt that while the sample is relatively small, the rights issues that were considered in the LLP do in some part reflect the critical rights based issues that are and have emerged in the region. While it is not possible to fully explore this issue in this paper, it is worth highlighting the relationship between MDGs, human rights and the role of UN Agencies. 5 Two projects from the 2005 case studies were monitored or extended in the 2007 round of the LLP. 21 Undertaking a Human Rights Based Approach: Lessons for Policy and Planning What emerges are further key questions that need to be resolved as the UN moves forward on both the MDGs and the human rights agenda. g Are the mandates of a number of UN and multilateral agencies that have direct correspondence to the MDGs not viewed in rights-based terms? Do organizations with more macro based mandates have a greater political sensitivity to rights-based language? g Is social justice too politically difficult to universally apply within the Millennium Development Goals? Or is it simply that the MDGs need to be achievable within relatively short time frames and that reformation of justice systems is simply too politically difficult and a far longer term goal? g Should there be a formal mechanism to embed emerging rights based issues within the Millennium Development Goals, or more realistically, in the introduction of further indicators that cover these issues? g To what degree are locally based MDG programmes reflecting a human rights-based approach. It was clear from the applications for the LLP in the Philippines that this is certainly occurring, however, whether this is commonly occurring across the region is uncertain. These localized programmes provide a unique opportunity to embed HRBA in the MDG agenda, and should be rigorously pursued. The relationship between human rights and the MDGs should and is currently being explored by UN agencies. What needs to be noted is that while linkages between HRBA programmes and human rights instruments and mechanisms remain less than perfect, the programming itself needs to be explored as a potential source of information regarding critical human rights issues on the ground. Further, HRBA projects can be instructive in terms of reflecting on the human rights agenda of agencies responsible for the various MDGs, and whether they view their programming as part of the Stamford Common Understanding. While recognizing the political sensitivity of these human rights issues, there may still be opportunities for supporting HRBA in the field for these agencies. These options need to be explored. Finally, what this mapping shows is that it is possible to embed a HRBA in localized MDG projects as was the case for four LLP applications from the Philippines. These applications were to implement HRBA in localized MDG projects. Adopting a HRBA to localized MDG projects is one important measure that can be taken to better align the MDGs with HRBA and human rights and should be further explored, advocated for and developed in the region. Lessons Learned to Move Forward a UN Agenda for HRBA A number of issues have been raised with respect to the implementation and strategic planning of HRBA projects, with a particular emphasis on the linkages to the international human rights framework. It is however critical that evidence of the sustainability of programme outcomes leading to both long and short term realization of human rights be highlighted and recognition of the value of the Human Rights-Based Approach be explicitly identified. Evidence of Sustainability and Incremental Realization of Human Rights Sustainability The LLP documented a number of projects that have evidenced ongoing sustainability of programming leading to the long term realization of human rights. The Thailand project is one of the best examples of the creation of a sustainable process for the realization of human rights in the region through: 22 Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a86595c-acdf-4d07-a0ca-559143adc6ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a86595c-acdf-4d07-a0ca-559143adc6ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bbdf0369a8749ec75a269a2a09d186ff039df358090d76bee3484877ee360529"}}, "hash": "bbdf0369a8749ec75a269a2a09d186ff039df358090d76bee3484877ee360529", "text": "Policy, Planning and Programming Policy g Agreement has been secured for human rights and HRBA to be considered and embedded in non- formal education policies and in the work of the National Human Rights Commission.

Support for the uptake of HRBA in other CLCs g Ban Buphai has continued to host dialogues between villages on rights based projects discussing these projects and ways to work together to secure more contentious rights. g Ban Buphai has also continued to advocate for other CLC members to undertake a HRBA by visiting communities and discussing the success of their projects. Funding g A community fund has been established to continue to undertake HRBA projects. g Funding has been secured from a number of sources for their rights based projects. Like Thailand, a number of the other projects have evidenced sustainability of programming, despite being at various stages in the realization of rights. In Fiji, the handbook created will inform not only future workshops on HRBA for women\u2019s rights to adequate housing and land in the region but also provide a resource for NGO planning in this area. Initial work has commenced in engaging policy makers, and there are clear strategic plans in place for furthering and monitoring women\u2019s rights in the region that will be informed by, and will inform, the projects undertaken in the area. The Lao PDR project, being rolled out across the country, has shown that these projects can be locally funded and monitored over time with the support of government agencies. In Afghanistan, the project will continue to be rolled out in other provinces, with learning reflected in ongoing planning for the project. Furthermore, it is part of a broader programme undertaken in conjunction with government to support the justice system. Between the district level programme that was supported by the LLP, AJDL, and the national programme to strengthen national institutions and policies, there is significant promise and commitment to ensuring justiciable rights for the people of Afghanistan in the longer term. Incremental Realization of Human Rights In addition to evidence of sustainability, a number of projects reviewed by the LLP highlighted that incremental realization of human rights can be achieved through HRBA programming. Lao PDR and Thailand stand out as clear examples of the inter-relatedness of rights and the potential for multiple rights to be realized through the human rights-based approach. In the instance of Lao PDR, the creation of community based water and sanitation systems has resulted in better environmental health conditions for the communities involved. Furthermore, this project has freed up time, particularly for women and girls. As a direct result the project has now become involved in supporting women to undertake income generating activities and encouraging girls to attend school. In Thailand, the success of the initial projects across a broad range of issues has encouraged the community to continue to explore human rights issues and to plan projects that will see other human rights realized for both marginalized groups and the broader community. Finally, the Fiji project on housing and land is, in and of itself, providing a vehicle for advocating for women\u2019s rights more broadly. 23 Undertaking a Human Rights Based Approach: Lessons for Policy and Planning Factors Impacting on Sustainability and Successful Realization of Human Rights What should be evident from the above sections is that sustainability and realization of human rights are achievable though they can be impacted both positively and negatively by a number of both programming and non programming based issues. From the pilot projects the following were the factors impacting on the long term sustainability and realization of human rights within these projects. Programming Factors: g Timeframe for implementation; g The adequacy and/or flexibility of funding sources over time particularly in light of the often long term nature of structural and behavioural change; g Government involvement and support of programme; g Contractual arrangements, sufficiency of funding and time frames and the need for ongoing engagement with the programme over time; g Community engagement and empowerment; g A recognition of local context in framing rights language for training purposes and in delivering programmes; g Degree of expectation of stakeholders and the capacity of programmes to deliver these expectations in the shorter and longer term. Non Programming Factors: g Community cohesion, tolerance and innovation; g Government position with respect to human rights articulated; g Security issues; g Stability of the political environment.

The necessity to ensure the link with international human rights norms, standards and principles g An essential component of HRBA, reaffirmed by the Stanford Common Understanding, is that programming is guided by international human rights norms, standards and principles and is informed by the recommendations of international human rights mechanisms. g It should be acknowledged that in the actual implementation of the projects examined by the LLP this requirement has not been consistently respected. This is probably due to the criteria for the selection of the projects, which did not explicitly demand it. g Firmly linking programming to the international human rights instruments provides a legally binding framework for states that serves as an entry point for dialogue with duty bearers at all levels. Additionally, human rights standards help focusing development objectives by providing the criteria to define the minimum content of the entitlements and obligations against which duty bearers 24 Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming can be held accountable. Finally, recommendations of international human rights mechanisms, by highlighting the main concerns of the international community on the human rights situation in a specific country, allow prioritisation of actions and can be a powerful tool for advocacy (as evidenced by the Fiji project). The necessity of both bottom-up and top-down approaches g The engagement of all stakeholders in the initial situational assessment is valuable not only for understanding the underlying basic causes of the rights issue but can also help enlist the active engagement of government stakeholders. Furthermore, a rigorous situational assessment that takes into account social, economic and cultural factors at the macro, micro and meso level can ensure a more holistic approach to programming at the outset. g Ongoing engagement and consultation with stakeholders and more particularly creating opportunities and channels for dialogue between duty bearers and rights holders can significantly increase the probability of realizing sustainable outcomes. g The essential criteria for good programming under the Stamford Common Understanding require that both top-down and bottom-up approaches are used in synergy, particularly with respect to capacity development around human rights. In the instance where human rights issues are contentious, serious capacity building strategies need to be in place to ensure that, though not necessarily required initially, a programme for capacity development of all parties is planned in one form or another. g Certain human rights can be easily secured where community will and resources exist and this in itself can provide sufficient evidence to advocate for later government involvement. g Despite the differences across projects, it can be said that those that had active government involvement (partly because they were less contentious) were more successful at realizing human rights on a larger scale at least in the short term. g The implication of local empowerment without appropriate monitoring is that the structures that exist at the local level within communities may be reinforced or unquestioned through the programme design. The necessity of addressing context: local customary law and negative local perceptions of rights g Where human rights may be perceived as contrary to customary law there may be opportunities to \u201cblend\u201d the informational and training materials based on the international and statutory human rights notions with the corresponding customs and principles of the relevant faiths and traditions. Finding commonalities in principles and ideas may greatly facilitate the engagement of beneficiaries with human rights without dismissing their local relevance. g When international human rights norms can be potentially confronting and abstracted from the lives of local communities, reference to the national constitutions and laws (where available) may be one way in which to show the direct connection between international human rights instruments and legislation that has direct reference to these communities\u2019 lives. g Understanding relevant legislation can be incredibly challenging for the communities. Simplified summaries of all the relevant legislation and case studies distributed to communities during the human rights training may support understanding in this area and provide a valuable resource tool for future use. g Where the marriage of customary law and international human rights law is not possible, the UN agency needs to be clear on its position with respect to the human rights agenda, with a clear strategy for addressing this issue as part of a longer term strategy for the gradual realization of this right. g Creating formal institutions that are also blended/directly engaged with or that explicitly recognize customary practices", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10a4902a-0705-4e59-b152-e4fca8c5adc9": {"__data__": {"id_": "10a4902a-0705-4e59-b152-e4fca8c5adc9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a568a579932291e217c4a98241ce441feeb68e58e10a68e0b904db99eccfc7a5"}}, "hash": "a568a579932291e217c4a98241ce441feeb68e58e10a68e0b904db99eccfc7a5", "text": "and/or administered by traditional justice providers may actually reinforce the integrity and allow change in traditional customary law, while also introducing potential flexibility and capacity into the legal system. 25 Undertaking a Human Rights Based Approach: Lessons for Policy and Planning The necessity for UN HRBA projects to be embedded in long term strategic planning, particularly when addressing sensitive human rights issues g A Human Rights-Based Approach often requires long term planning that in turn implies that projects need to be conceived from the outset within the HRBA framework so that consideration of issues such as appropriate roll out of capacity development of both duty bearers and rights holders is planned in accordance with a broader strategic framework for the realization of human rights within that country, directly linked to international rights instruments and their reports. g In the absence of processes to ensure that recommendations from international HR mechanisms inform UN country planning and subsequent programme design, there may be no logical link that can be made to the realization of human rights and programme implementation, particularly for long term, advocacy based HRBA programming in sensitive areas. g Mainstreaming of human rights into country strategies would better ensure that programming reflects the indivisibility of rights, and that the impact of programming on the rights landscape is equitable beyond the scope and the focus of the project itself. g The need to establish long term monitoring mechanisms particularly for advocacy based programmes is critical during the programme planning stage. Whether tied in with UN CCA\u2019s or as part of ongoing activities for the key partner organizations, it is difficult to argue that HRBA programming has been undertaken in the absence of long term planning for the realization and monitoring of human rights. g It can be argued that long term strategic planning for the realization of human rights may be better placed in national institutional practice or in mutually reinforcing UN and national human rights institutional strategies to enhance the probability of long term sustainability and monitoring. g The integration of Human Rights Advisors in UN country teams may encourage a greater alignment between programming and human rights instruments, if there is sufficient capacity within their roles to provide support in the delivery of HRBA projects and to actively engage in the strategic planning for the country. g The relationship between human rights and MDGs should and is currently being explored by UN agencies. What needs to be noted is that while linkages between HRBA programmes and international human rights instruments and mechanisms remain less than perfect, the programming itself needs to be explored as a potential source of information regarding critical human rights issues on the ground. g HRBA projects can be instructive in terms of reflecting on the human rights agenda of agencies responsible for the various MDGs, and whether they recognize and address the Stamford Common Understanding in their programming. While recognizing the political sensitivity of human rights, there may be opportunities for supporting the realization of human rights in the field and these options need to be explored. g Finally, the mapping of the projects reviewed by the LLP and the applications received has shown that it is possible to embed a HRBA in localized MDG projects and that this should be a critical starting point in aligning the MDGs with HRBA and human rights. The need for monitoring, evaluation and evidence g The sustainability of the programme and programme outcomes are dependent on appropriate, continuous monitoring, evaluation and feedback at all levels of programming. This reflects the critical importance of accounting for contextual factors that need to be monitored over time as well as the need to adjust programme implementation strategies to reflect relevant lessons learned over the previous period or in alternate locations. In order to do this good indicators and baseline data should to be identified from the outset of programming. g The creation and provision of appropriate materials capturing the best practices in the implementation of projects can help support the replication of the projects in other locations as well as provide valuable tools for evidence based advocacy. This would include simplified explanations of relevant legislation and international law, case studies, action guides to HRBA etc. 26 Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming Questions to be Addressed to move forward a HRBA Agenda in the UN: Lessons Learned from the LLP Five years after the adoption of the Stamford Common Understanding, the diversity in adoption by the projects reviewed by the LLP of the HRBA principles and programming components indicates that the requisite processes and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23de509f-0650-40f5-a3c0-9d8f2133076d": {"__data__": {"id_": "23de509f-0650-40f5-a3c0-9d8f2133076d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "051f922b3018a297b14357c5fafbf00e0d16046d552ee59416e80a75c398dc88"}}, "hash": "051f922b3018a297b14357c5fafbf00e0d16046d552ee59416e80a75c398dc88", "text": "outcomes that define the Human Rights-Based Approach are still uncertain and questions remain. Both directly and indirectly, the LLP has also highlighted that issues regarding more contentious rights and the policy and planning environment in UN agencies also need to be explored and addressed if the HRBA is to be effectively and systematically implemented across the UN system in Asia Pacific region. In order to encourage greater and more effective buy in of UN agencies a recognition of obstacles and greater clarity of meaning is required. Pertinent questions identified by the LLP that need to be resolved are: Defining HRBA: A number of the pilot projects clearly did not comply with the necessary and essential elements of a HRBA defined under the Stamford Common Understanding. The imposition of a HRBA post commencement of programming undoubtedly contributed to this. However, irrespective, the value of the programmes, and the value of the HRBA lens undoubtedly added to the projects, a post hoc imposition is arguably to be preferred over none at all. This issue goes to the heart of the HRBA debate within the UN regarding the expectations of the Stamford Common Understanding, and how it can be reconciled with the practical realities on the ground that may or may not allow for all the necessary and essential elements to be embedded within programming. Questions therefore arise as to; g What are the absolute minimum criteria for a programme to be considered to be consistent with the HRBA , and are these criteria essential from the outset of programme planning? g Can these minimum criteria be applied across the breadth of UN agencies or will these differ according to the mandate of the agencies involved? Should they differ across agencies? HRBA and the Environment: While no specific environmental projects were selected by the LLP, there were proposals that specifically focused on human development, bio-dioversity and environmental sustainability (see Table 1, MDG Goal 7). These raised critical questions regarding the link between human rights, development and the environment, namely: g Are \u201csoft\u201d international instruments that enumerate so called \u201cthird generation rights\u201d contained in non-binding agreements such as the 1972 Stockholm Declaration of the UN conference on the Human Environment and the 1992 Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development to be considered within HRBA projects? g Does and should the HRBA take into account the environment? UN Policy and Planning and HRBA: Finally, it should be clear from the projects reviewed by the LLP that the connection between strategic planning, policy, programming and international human rights instruments and mechanisms differs across agencies and programmes. For any UN wide HRBA agenda to move forward further questions and research is required. This needs to be the initial starting point. In order to fully understand the position of UN agencies and to appropriately design any UN wide strategy or approach and, if necessary refine and further develop the Stamford Common Understanding for the region the following questions need to be asked; g What are the current positions of UN agencies with respect to the HRBA approach in the Asia-Pacific Region? To what extent are the mandates of the various agencies viewed as being compatible or incompatible with a human-rights based approach? g In the various UN agencies, to what extent is the Stamford Common Understanding viewed as a priority for programming and planning? If not, why not? Are there competing generic UN requirements/ priorities or regional issues that are prioritized or compete with a HRBA? g To what extent do linkages between international human rights instruments and mechanisms and strategic policy and planning exist or are being established in the various UN agencies and in country offices? In answering and addressing these issues the UN may be able to more effectively move forward towards a greater \u201ccommon understanding\u201d of a human rights-based approach and, importantly, towards greater support and consensus amongst agencies in creating an environment conducive to the realization of human rights in the region. 27 Undertaking a Human Rights Based Approach: Lessons for Policy and Planning Recommendations for Policy, Planning and Programming Many useful insights and lessons have been derived from the LLP and a number of further questions have been raised. From these findings a few key recommendations can be drawn that have strong consensus amongst stakeholders and particularly pilot project partners despite the variation in the human rights they have pursued and the level of programme implementation.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes human rights as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace. The unanimously adopted Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action states that democracy, development, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. In the UN Programme for Reform that was launched in 1997, the Secretary-General called on all entities of the UN system to mainstream human rights into their various activities and programmes within the framework of their respective mandates. Since then a number of UN agencies have adopted a human rights-based approach to their development cooperation and have gained experiences in its operationalization. But each agency has tended to have its own interpretation of approach and how it should be operationalized. However, UN interagency collaboration at global and regional levels, and especially at the country level in relation to the CCA and UNDAF processes, requires a common understanding of this approach and its implications for development programming. What follows is an attempt to arrive at such an understanding on the basis of those aspects of the human rights-based approach that are common to the policy and practice of the UN bodies that participated in the Interagency Workshop on a Human Rights-based Approach in the context of UN reform 3-5 May, 2003. This Statement of Common Understanding specifically refers to a human rights based approach to the development cooperation and development programming by UN agencies. Common Understanding 1. All programmes of development co-operation, policies and technical assistance should further the realisation of human rights as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. 2. Human rights standards contained in, and principles derived from, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments guide all development cooperation and programming in all sectors and in all phases of the programming process. 3. Development cooperation contributes to the development of the capacities of duty-bearers\u201d to meet their obligations and/or of \u201cnon binding agreements rights-holders\u201d to claim their rights. 29 The Human Rights-Based Approach to Development Cooperation 1. All programmes of development co-operation, policies and technical assistance should further the realisation of human rights as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. A set of programme activities that only incidentally contributes to the realization of human rights does not necessarily constitute a human rights-based approach to programming.

Among these human rights principles are: universality and inalienability; indivisibility; interdependence and inter relatedness; non-discrimination and equality; participation and inclusion; accountability and the rule of law. These principles are explained below. g Universality and inalienability: Human rights are universal and inalienable. All people everywhere in the world are entitled to them. The human person in whom they inhere cannot voluntarily give them up. Nor can others take them away from him or her. As stated in Article 1 of the UDHR, \u201cAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights\u201d. g Indivisibility: Human rights are indivisible. Whether of a civil, cultural, economic, political or social nature, they are all inherent to the dignity of every human person. Consequently, they all have equal status as rights, and cannot be ranked, a priori, in a hierarchical order. g Inter-dependence and Inter-relatedness: The realization of one right often depends, wholly or in part, upon the realization of others. For instance, realization of the right to health may depend, in certain circumstances, on realization of the right to education or of the right to information. g Equality and Non-discrimination: All individuals are equal as human beings and by virtue of the inherent dignity of each human person. All human beings are entitled to their human rights without discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, ethnicity, age, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, disability, property, birth or other status as explained by the human rights treaty bodies. g Participation and Inclusion: Every person and all peoples are entitled to active, free and meaningful participation in, contribution to, and enjoyment of civil, economic, social, cultural and political development in which human rights and fundamental freedoms can be realized. g Accountability and Rule of Law: States and other duty-bearers are answerable for the observance of human rights. In this regard, they have to comply with the legal norms and standards enshrined in human rights instruments. Where they fail to do so, aggrieved rights-holders are entitled to institute proceedings for appropriate redress before a competent court or other adjudicator in accordance with the rules and procedures provided by law. 30 Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming 3. Programmes of development cooperation contribute to the development of the capacities of duty-bearers to meet their obligations and of \u201crights-holders\u201d to claim their rights. In a HRBA human rights determine the relationship between individuals and groups with valid claims (rights-holders) and State and non-state actors with correlative obligations (duty- bearers). It identifies rights-holders (and their entitlements) and corresponding duty-bearers (and their obligations) and works towards strengthening the capacities of rights-holders to make their claims, and of duty-bearers to meet their obligations. Implications of a Human Rights-Based Approach to Development Programming of UN Agencies Experience has shown that the use of a human rights-based approach requires the use of good programming practices. However, the application of \u201cgood programming practices\u201d does not by itself constitute a human rights-based approach, and requires additional elements. The following elements are necessary, specific, and unique to a human rights-based approach: a) Assessment and analysis in order to identify the human rights claims of rights-holders and the corresponding human rights obligations of duty-bearers as well as the immediate, underlying, and structural causes of the non-realization of rights.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cdfb9e21-ab86-4138-90e0-2af477edc1e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "cdfb9e21-ab86-4138-90e0-2af477edc1e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97c722dd4ac5eb14fd52b01f84f02494ecf493611001d81fdc2636f5c1315817"}, "2": {"node_id": "b4536960-6f24-45a9-9947-83eb4048d6d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undertaking-human-rights-based-approach-lessons-policy-planning-and-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e908e69bfe7d565877a6328a94177116299003cd1fcca3fed3723e3f103e2f04"}}, "hash": "47bf497f5f7c8e2562f41aab614d0810d311c3441b0a752efe22123f97a94057", "text": "b) Programmes assess the capacity of rights-holders to claim their rights, and of duty bearers to fulfil their obligations.

It is interesting to note that Land and Justice Issues were the most common rights issues addressed. In part this reflects a particular focus of the UNDP in the region, though there were NGO initiated projects included in these figures (2 land, 1 social justice). Rights Explored LLP 2005: Village Forest Management, Community Journalism and Rights, Social Justice, Water and Sanitation, Justice and Rule of Law, Sustainable Livelihoods and Pro small farmers rights, AIDS and gender sensitivity, Right to Food, Primary Education, Conflict Prevention and Resolution, Land Rights. Rights Proposed Applications LLP 2007: Table 1 below shows the numbers of LLP project applications in 2007 that can be linked to the eight Millennium Development Goals and their indicators. These can only be presumed to be proxy figures as some of the projects that weren\u2019t funded included those that were adopting a HRBA to examine the relevant rights issues for the communities involved and hence the rights were not articulated at the point of the submission. It should also be noted that certain projects proposed were to address more than one rights issue from the outset and therefore have been considered under more than one MDG. Furthermore, despite the fact that the rights to be addressed in some of these projects would have likely have resulted in incremental rights being realized, for the purpose of this analysis only the primary rights issues were listed next to the relevant development goal. A final caveat that should be noted is that some of the projects may have included elements of a MDG for example capacity development in the use of information and communications technology however, unless stated explicitly in the application and considered a core right this could not be included. Finally it should be noted that four of the projects that have not be included below directly examined various phases of planning and implementation of localized MDG plans in the Philippines6. 6 There was not enough information on these projects to ascertain the specific MDGs to which these projects related. 32 Undertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming Table 1: Applications For LLP Funding 2007 MDG Indicators LLP 2005 Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger u u u Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than one dollar a day.

Printed and bound in India PRICE: US$ 10.00 iii Preface At the Millennium Summit held in September 2000, the Member States of the United Nations adopted the Millennium Declaration and committed themselves to a series of goals and targets to be reached by 2015. Progress toward attainment of these Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), however, has varied greatly among countries of Asia and the Pacific, especially by the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) of the region. Today there are 14 LDCs in Asia and the Pacific \u2013 Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste,Tuvalu and Vanuatu. These countries collectively account for 37 percent of the global population in LDCs. Clustered in South Asia,South-East Asia and the Pacific,the 14 Asia-Pacific LDCs vary widely, with four landlocked countries and seven island developing countries among them. Bangladesh is the largest, with a population of more than 130 million, while Tuvalu is the smallest, with less than 11,000 people.As a result of these differences,the experiences of these countries also vary widely. While some countries have made significant progress, both in social and economic terms, and stand at the threshold of graduation from the list, others have continued to stagnate for more than two decades.In most of these countries,overall progress toward the achievement of the MDGs has been imbalanced, with success in some areas marred by failure in others. In the United Nations Millennium Declaration, member states resolved to create an environment, both at national and global levels, conducive to development and the elimination of poverty, and committed themselves to addressing the special needs of the LDCs.Among its fundamental values, the Millennium Declaration noted that efforts at achieving worldwide economic and social devel- opment must be shared among the nations of the world. The eighth MDG, accordingly, calls for a global partnership for development, whereby countries \u25cf Provide tariff- and quota-free access for exports from the LDCs; \u25cf Implement the enhanced programme of debt relief for the heavily indebted poor countries and cancel all official bilateral debts; and \u25cf Grant more generous development assistance to LDCs committed to poverty reduction Such international measures would enable LDCs to make more sustainable progress toward the achievement of the MDGs. This Report is unique in its scope and timeliness. It is a platform for Asia-Pacific LDCs to voice their views. It draws the attention of the international community to the challenges faced by these countries, seeking the support required to ensure that all countries in the region attain their MDGs.The concept for this Report emerged at a workshop conducted by our organisations on the progress toward the attainment of the MDGs in Siem Reap, Cambodia, 1-3 October 2004.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30cf58e3-5c65-4700-90d8-0c423c2fc1c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "30cf58e3-5c65-4700-90d8-0c423c2fc1c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Voices of the Least Developed Countries of Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d898013ef2885dadd5e70c711e019c40c1b0ac3aa277493a321ea9e59deffe5"}, "2": {"node_id": "f687a798-faf4-4960-9fc1-b95d164e82ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b0da1b03e14df6c7ce8c6616636a6fdefb6da5d53bc976b854e784a3c228d52"}}, "hash": "df378967130e1f7e76908c1db2f88c44b4d0bcdecb4bb93dafd5986ccf103e0a", "text": "The recommendations contained in the Report were endorsed at the inter-governmental level at the Seventh Session of the Special Body on Least Developed and Landlocked Developing Countries, Bangkok, 10-11 May 2005. iv As we move toward the Millennium +5 Summit in September 2005 and the Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005, this Report aims to be a timely reminder that LDCs in our region are no less in need of support from the international community.

Road Map Toward the Implementation of United Nations Millennium Declaration. Report of the Secretary General, New York. Note: The Millennium Development Goals originate from the Millennium Declaration signed by 189 countries,including 147 heads of state, in September 2000.The Goals and targets are related and should be seen as a whole.They represent a partner- ship of countries determined, as the Declaration states,\u201cto create an environment \u2014 at the national and global levels alike \u2014 which is conducive to development and the elimination of poverty\u201d. x Location of the Least Developed Countries in Asia and the Pacific The voices of the Least Developed Countries in Asia and the Pacific need to be heard C h a p t e r I 1.1 Background Asia-Pacific is a region of contrasts. It has some of the fastest-growing economies of the world while, at the same time, the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) continue to face persistent challenges.As a whole,the region has made sig- nificant inroads into poverty reduction with progress toward the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). China and India, together accounting for nearly 40 percent of the world\u2019s population and rank- ing among the fastest-growing countries, account for most of this progress,along with the \u201ctiger\u201d economies of East and South-East Asia. Due to the tyranny of averages, the relatively poor performance of the Asia-Pacific LDCs gets overshadowed. Only a more disaggregated appraisal reveals the far more limited gains in the LDCs1. Thus, the dynamism of Asia repre- sents both a challenge and an opportunity. It could increase inequalities that contribute to growing tensions. It also could generate resources and opportunities. Attainment of the MDGs in Asia and the Pacific as a whole will be marked by the far more limited progress made by the 14 LDCs of the region (Table 1). None of the Asia-Pacific LDCs has been able to graduate from the LDC status.In fact,the num- ber of countries in the region in the LDC catego- ry has increased,with the addition of Timor-Leste in 2003.Samoa was identified as eligible for grad- uation in 2006, but a decision is yet to be taken. While Maldives qualified for graduation in 2003, the tsunami devastation of December 2004 has revealed the fragility of the progress made.Given the challenges that need to be overcome to attain their MDGs, these countries require focused international support. Asia-Pacific LDCs find their voices obscured, both by the compara- tive success of the other developing countries of the region as well as the current priority given by the international community to the poorest countries in other regions. Given the increasing marginalisation of the LDCs of Asia and the Pacific in the global development debate, the world\u2019s attention needs to be refocused on them. This document advocates on behalf of Asia- Pacific LDCs, with particular focus on MDG 8: Develop a global partnership for development. All partners of the LDCs could consider extend- ing tariff- and quota-free access for exports from these countries; enhancing their programmes of debt relief,including cancellation of official bilat- eral debt; and increasing official development aid (ODA) for those most in need. In a spirit of equal partnership, Asia-Pacific LDCs also recog- nise the need to fulfil their part of this shared responsibility by allocating any public savings arising from reduced debt servicing toward the social sectors. They also must ensure that increased aid flows lead directly to a substantial reduction in poverty, strengthening local pro- ductive capacities and institutions.Such a global 1 Afghanistan Lao PDR Solomon Islands Bangladesh Maldives Timor-Leste Bhutan Myanmar Tuvalu Cambodia Nepal Vanuatu Kiribati Samoa Table 1.

Chapter 2 assesses progress toward attainment of the MDGs in these countries. Impediments to growth in Asia-Pacific LDCs are discussed in Chapter 3. Trade, aid and debt relief, the three instruments identified under MDG 8,are elaborated in Chapters 4 and 5, with corresponding recom- mendations. Chapter 6 concludes by underlining the importance of a global partnership to achieve the MDGs in Asia-Pacific LDCs and presents the specific recommendations that arose from the Special Body on Least Developed and Landlocked Developing Countries,at its Seventh Session, held in Bangkok, 10 and 11 May 2005.. 1.2 The Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals In the UN Millennium Declaration (A/RES/55/2) of 8 September 2000,the General Assembly expressed the commitment of countries to eliminate extreme poverty and ensure the right to development for everyone. To achieve these objectives, the Millennium Declaration noted that the responsibil- ity for managing worldwide economic and social development must be shared among the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally. In line with this Declaration, eight goals on devel- opment and poverty eradication,otherwise known as the MDGs,were established. Through their commitment to the MDGs, coun- tries agreed to work together to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; achieve universal primary education;promote gender equality and empow- er women;reduce child mortality;improve mater- nal health; combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases;ensure environmental sustainability;and develop a global partnership for development. While the first seven MDGs are set for each coun- try to achieve, the eighth Goal, on developing a global partnership, was set as a measure of the commitment by the international community to assist these efforts.The eighth Goal committed the international community to address the special needs of the LDCs through tariff- and quota-free access for LDCs\u2019 exports; enhanced programmes of debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries and cancellation of official bilateral debt;and more generous ODA for countries committed to pover- ty reduction (Box 1).In addition,this Goal commit- ted the international community to develop an open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system;to address the special needs of landlocked developing countries and small island developing states; and to deal com- prehensively with the debt problems of develop- ing countries in order to make debt sustainable in the long term. The Brussels Declaration and Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010, from the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, Brussels, 14-20 May 2001, further reiterated these goals for the LDCs. Since Asia-Pacific LDCs are located in a dynamic region, a strengthened partnership between these countries and other developed and devel- oping countries would not only significantly accelerate their progress toward the achievement of their MDGs but would also provide significant returns at the regional level. Managing challenges such as cross-border migration, trafficking of peo- ple and drugs, spread of trans-boundary diseases, preparedness for disasters, usage of natural resources including water,and control of environ- mental hazards would greatly benefit from sus- tained support for the LDCs. The rationale for global and regional partnerships also must be perceived in terms of a common ethical response to the needs of these countries, since shared humanity binds all people to a common destiny. Neglect of these countries also could result in widening inequalities and growing dis- affection, which could lead to conflicts within and outside the region.

Of the world\u2019s 50 LDCs, Bangladesh is the largest in terms of population, accounting for more than half the Asia-Pacific LDC population, while Tuvalu is the smallest (Table 2).

These LDCs have implemented numerous meas- ures to overcome their challenges.

Much of the overall progress results from rapid developments in China and India, the two most populous countries in the world, as well as in countries in South-East Asia, which recovered ground lost during the 1997- 1998 financial crises. Performance indicators for the Asia-Pacific region as a whole do not reflect the far more limited achievements of many LDCs. While many of these countries have been able to move toward attaining some MDGs, critical deficits exist in others (Box 2). A review of the MDG progress reports indicates that many countries are on track to achieve the targets on the net school enrol- ment ratio, under-5 mortality rate and selected health-related targets, such as the proportion of the population with sustainable access to improved water sources and improved sanita- tion6 (Annexure 3). However, in crucial areas such as poverty reduction, minimum dietary needs, literacy rate and infant mortality rate, most of these countries are not on track.

Greater reduction in poverty could have been achieved if the eco- nomic growth had been more beneficial to the poor. In Bangladesh, the Gini coefficient, which measures inequality, rose from 0.259 in 1992 to 0.45 in 2000,indicating widening dispar- ity in income. In Cambodia, consumption inequality increased during the 1990s as the richest fifth of the population increased con- sumption expenditures by nearly 18 percent, while the poorest fifth increased consumption by just 1 percent. Similarly, in Timor-Leste, the share of the poorest quintile in national con- sumption was found to be only 7.1 percent.

In contrast, the resource gap in selected Asian developing countries is negative only for three countries. Comparing the resource gap on a per-capita basis, it is significantly higher in Asia-Pacific LDCs than in Asian developing countries (Annexure 4 presents an alternate estimation examining the savings rate necessary to achieve a 5 percent growth rate in real per-capita income; this rate was found to be higher than 30 percent).Sufficient resources are necessary to bridge the savings and investment gap and to foster growth. Financial inflows through aid, reduced debt servicing and increased current account inflows,as outlined in MDG 8,are critical. The amount of current per-capita ODA to Asia- Pacific LDCs compares unfavourably with that received by other LDCs (Figure 4). Similarly, while the ratio of debt servicing to exports has been falling in recent years in LDCs, it remains a significant burden for these countries (Figure 5). For example, the debt servicing-to-exports ratio for Lao PDR was as high as 10.32 percent in 2003. While LDCs of the region have increased the ratio of exports to GDP (Figure 6), they have yet to catch up with Asia-Pacific developing countries as well as their counterparts in other parts of the world.The ending of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) has been a major concern to many LDCs that have focused on garment exports in recent years. Also of particular relevance here are the prob- lems faced by the landlocked and island LDCs in Asia and the Pacific. Landlocked countries with- out direct access to the sea require transport infrastructure, market integration, trade facilita- tion and harmonisation measures at the region- al level to be able to participate substantially in international trade. Freight costs and distance to port of landlocked Asia-Pacific LDCs are greater than those of their transit neighbouring 12 Economic growth does not guarantee poverty reduction, but the presence of growth does make the task easier 8 Asian Development Bank (ADB), 2004: Key Indicators 2004 - Poverty in Asia,Measurement,Estimates and Prospects. 13 Impediments to Growth in Asia-Pacific Least Developed Countries countries as well as similarly placed countries in other regions of the world9. Island LDCs face challenges posed by their small size and geo- graphic remoteness, both of which limit the possibilities for the diversification of their economies, including export diversification. In addition,these countries are particularly vulner- able to environmental risks and natural disas- ters. Geographic factors also add to risk in eco- nomic sectors such as agriculture and transport. Even with good governance, growth in coun- tries with agriculture or transport risk was lower by almost 4 percentage points annually, com- pared with countries with lower risk. Growth in countries prone to ecological disasters was lower by 2 percentage points than those that were not.Moreover,geography has implications on the choice of economic policies, thereby indirectly affecting economic growth as well. For example, countries that are close to their markets tend to choose more open trade poli- cies than countries that are distant from mar- kets.

Gross fixed capital formation is defined as the total value of acquisitions, less disposals, of fixed assets plus certain additions to the values of non-produced assets. Fixed assets are tangible or intangible assets; where tangible assets include dwellings, buildings and structures, machinery and equipment,and trees and livestock; and intangible assets include mineral exploration,computer software,entertainment, literary or artistic originals. Non-produced assets refer mainly to land. Included in gross fixed capital formation are major improvements to non-produced assets and costs associated with the transfer of ownership of non-produced assets. b Resource gap is derived as gross domestic saving rate less investment rate (or gross capital formation). c Data not available.

Since countries in disadvantaged geo- graphic locations are more likely to remain in poverty, their attainment of the MDGs becomes particularly difficult. Special attention to the particular challenges faced by landlocked and small island LDCs in the Asia-Pacific region is therefore essential. Several LDCs in the region have been affected by wars and, in some cases, civil conflict. As a result, defence (including security) spending in some countries may well exceed expenditures on social sectors, thus inhibiting the countries\u2019 investment in their futures10.The needs of coun- tries requiring reconstruction of physical and social infrastructure are of a different order of magnitude from other developing countries. For instruments of financing for development and trade to have any impact in these countries, political stability needs to be ensured. Both public and private institutions also need to be strengthened to enable effective planning and implementation of long-term policies. This is especially true since the international commu- nity sees effective application of disbursed aid as a prerequisite for additional commitment of external resources. Private sector investment necessary for strengthening of supply capabili- ties in export-oriented sectors also requires political stability,functional markets and institu- tions, and rule of law. Finally, since transport capabilities determine the extent of trade, sta- bility throughout the country is necessary for export-led growth to materialise. Due to the diversity of needs and circum- stances among Asia-Pacific LDCs, it will be important to customise the support to address their challenges. It is furthermore important for these LDCs, as well as their development part- ners, to begin by implementing policies that form the prerequisites for their development strategies. Proper sequencing of policies rele- vant to each specific LDC is also important. Finally, each country and its partners need to ensure that the country is able to use all avail- able resources, including human resources, to attain their common MDGs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a5bbf2e-1233-409a-b602-7096a1102ac1": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a5bbf2e-1233-409a-b602-7096a1102ac1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Voices of the Least Developed Countries of Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "576b1fe48f13e232a8d22657a117e53113633617a4a4e26718e4b723de7dc90c"}, "2": {"node_id": "da86c1e5-5289-49bc-9cc5-fac3c19d7bc3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ac3dda1bbdea57b33272f9e8a3501c6ec1758613528d1d735cc8a73e604886f"}}, "hash": "f86b563fe7c1da56ea42ff4e0244f93f26634a92c116b0fd58b926c6dcd1d7c9", "text": "Diversity among Asia- Pacific LDCs underlines the importance of customising support to local challenges 10 While data is available for only five Asia-Pasific LDCs, average military expenditures in these countries, as a per- centage of GDP in 2001, amounted to 1.87 percent, as compared to 1.49 percent on education and 0.87 percent on health (calculated as GDP-weighted averages of individual country values).

In the long run trade, when made part of an overall development strategy at the national level,pro- vides a possible means by which countries can grow more sustainably, reducing their depend- ence on aid and debt relief. Thus, an enhanced global partnership for development, as por- trayed in MDG 8, is of key interest to these countries since it will afford them more com- mercially meaningful access to international markets. The relationships between interna- tional trade and poverty reduction in Asia- Pacific LDCs could be direct and powerful, when backed by supporting domestic policies and strong backward linkages. In other words, trade liberalisation policies must be supported by a gamut of other complementary policies and aid that will build up supply-side capacity and create productive potential so that market access can be more effectively utilised. While economic growth is not a sufficient condition for poverty reduction, poverty can be better addressed in the presence of growth. Asia-Pacific LDCs are characterised by impor- tant differences with respect to the composi- tion and destinations of exports. Some are mainly exporters of manufactures, others of services, while for some the focus is primary commodities. Most Asia-Pacific LDCs undertook trade reforms in the 1990s, rationalising tariff rates, eliminating quantitative restrictions and reducing non-tariff barriers. As a result, these countries already have relatively open economies (Figure 7);for more open economies, international trade can be a powerful driver of economic growth. Countries where exports of manufactures and services feature prominently have experienced higher economic growth,and made more significant inroads in poverty reduction through beneficial spread effects, as compared to those that have relied on primary commodity exports. This happens due to greater wage and employment opportunities and wider linkages with consequent income generation that have made direct contributions to poverty reduction. The export structure in Asia-Pacific LDCs shows a high contribution of labour-intensive exports, remittances and agriculture for some (Table 5). For example, agriculture continues to be a major source of exports for several Asia-Pacific LDCs, particularly for some small island states such as Kiribati, where this accounts for nearly 89 percent of total exports, Maldives with 67 percent and Vanuatu with 54 percent. Remittances are as high as 75 percent of export earnings in Samoa, 31 percent in Bangladesh and nearly 30 percent in Vanuatu. The textiles and clothing export industry employs around 2 million workers in these countries, of which 70 percent are women. In 2003, the share of those items in total export earnings from Bangladesh was 76 percent, in Cambodia 95 percent and in Nepal 40 percent. The high level of dependency on one sector has 11 ESCAP, 2005.

Table 5. Structure of Earnings from Goods Exports and Remittance Flows (Percentage of Foreign Exchange Earnings from Total Merchandise Exports and Remittances) 18 prevented poor countries from taking advan- tage of the fall in trade barriers to get their other exports into the developed world. Not surpris- ingly, the ending of the MFA is of vital concern to these countries. However, a great deal of international media attention has focused on highlighting US and European voices. Various studies have suggested that the removal of quotas would have a detrimental effect on eco- nomic growth and, consequently, on poverty reduction in the affected countries, leading to calls for reimposition. Special textile quotas for severely affected Asia-Pacific LDCs could be proposed in the context of ongoing negotia- tions under the Doha Development Round. Bangladesh, for example, has seen its textile exports fall by 6 percent in the five months fol- lowing the ending of the MFA.Many exporters in LDCs have experienced a significant reduction in market shares following earlier de-restriction, and profit margins have come under pressure. Some relief, however, has been found in niche markets. For example, strict adherence to high labour standards by suppliers in Cambodia has ensured continued demand for their products on the part of buyers who support fair trade. 4.2 Special Trade Challenges Market Access Target 13 under MDG 8 addresses the special needs of LDCs and calls for greater market access to be given to products of interest to poor countries, particularly products that are labour-intensive and thus result in new income-generating opportunities. However, problems of tariff peaks and tariff escalation are suffered disproportionately by these very products, with footwear, fisheries and gar- ments featuring prominently.In this regard,it is important to note that, in the garments and agricultural sectors,the average tariffs faced by Asia-Pacific LDCs are higher than those faced by their counterparts in other regions of the world (Table 6). The main reason for this appears to be export composition and direc- tion. Clothing products dominate the export basket.The United States is the key destination market for clothing exports, and tariffs imposed by the US are higher than those of other trading partners. Preferential schemes such as the Cotonou Agreement of the European Union for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and the African Growth and Opportunity Act of the United States of America The ending of the MFA is of vital concern to Asia-Pacific LDCs, particularly for female workers; however, they have found their voices subdued by Western concerns Voices of the Least Developed Countries of Asia and the Pacific: Achieving the Millennium Development Goals Through a Global Partnership for African developing countries, could be extended to all Asia-Pacific LDCs. A number of schemes have been implemented over the years to enable greater exports from LDCs. GSP schemes and the European Union\u2019s \u201cEverything But Arms\u201dinitiative have had bene- ficial effects, but they have only partially solved the market access problems of the LDCs.This is because utilisation rates, defined as the ratio of imports actually receiving preferences to imports covered by a given preferential scheme, have on the whole remained low (Figure 8).

Cambodia and Nepal are also signifi- cantly affected by this exclusion.The granting of \u201cquota-free\u201d and \u201cduty-free\u201d schemes for all dutiable products originating from LDCs would contribute enormously to raising export earn- ings and make trade work for development in Asia-Pacific LDCs. An additional area in which labour-abundant Asia-Pacific LDCs are seeking enhanced market access is for their overseas workers.This is even more important for low-skilled workers. After earnings accruing from merchandise exports, remittances are proving to be the second- largest source of private financial flows that could provide an additional means of tackling poverty reduction.Remittance income also con- tributes to the MDGs of health and education when beneficiary households have more money to access improved health services, bet- ter schooling, protected water and better hous- ing. The importance of remittances as a source of external financial flows is most visible in small islands such as Samoa, where remittances account for close to 75 percent of total earnings, and Vanuatu,where remittances represent nearly 30 percent of total earnings (Table 5). Ongoing negotiations under the Doha Development Round Work Plan and the forth- coming WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong could provide Asia-Pacific LDCs with a window of opportunity toward obtaining greater market access.There is a need to ensure that the Doha Development Round does in fact have development at the core of its agenda and that clauses relating to special and differential treatment in the various WTO Agreements in favour of developing countries are actually implemented. Global zero-tariff and quota-free access for exports from the LDCs could be an important initiative. Other issues of critical importance to Asia-Pacific LDCs include market access for agricultural products; non-agricultur- al market access and erosion of preferences; lib- eralisation of the movement of natural persons; and process and conditions of WTO accession. Global zero-tariff market access is a critically important issue for Asia-Pacific LDCs. As an illustration, import duties on apparel exported Figure 8.

Any setback in exports of textiles and apparel could have serious repercussions on achievement of the MDGs in such areas as poverty alleviation, health and education for countries like Cambodia, Bangladesh and Nepal, where earnings from manufactured items account for as much as 88, 55 and 52 percent of total earnings from exports respectively. In view of ongoing WTO negotiations in the area of non-agricultural market access, which are expected to reduce industrial tariffs, the preferential margins enjoyed by LDCs under various GSP schemes are likely to be substan- tially reduced. For example, even as Australia and New Zealand brought duties down on the basis of WTO commitments, there has been substantial erosion of preferences for Pacific small island economies, despite the zero-tariff access to those markets extended under pref- erential schemes.The erosion of preferences is expected to increase competitive pressure on exports of all LDCs, including those from Asia- Pacific. Accession to WTO Accession to WTO is of special interest to Asia- Pacific LDCs, five of whom (Afghanistan, Bhutan, Lao PDR, Samoa and Vanuatu) are cur- rently engaged in the process. Without excep- tion and notwithstanding the 2001 WTO guidelines on simplifying and streamlining accession, the process has proven complex and resource-intensive. An enhanced global partnership, as foreseen in MDG 8, would entail focusing the accession process on pro- development policy reforms from which acceding countries can benefit economically. WTO members should therefore take the lead by concentrating on sectors of developmental interest to LDCs and by not insisting on com- pliance with provisions that have little mean- ing for the situation of acceding countries. For example, a measured opening up (in terms of timing and sequencing) of some backbone infrastructure services, such as the financial, telecommunications and transport service sectors, could significantly improve supply capacities, productivity and export competi- tiveness in LDCs provided it is embedded in an overall development plan with a poverty reduction strategy. In short, an enhanced global partnership would mean that the terms, conditions and speed of accession to WTO are set within national-level policy reforms promoting economic and social development. Furthermore, implementation of far-reaching commitments could divert public resources away from important expenditures on educa- tion, health or infrastructure services, where needs are acute and long-term returns may be greater. For example, implementation of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement requires extensive legal, legislative and institutional develop- ment, as well as financial resources, before compliance is achieved.The implementation of TRIPS may not be a priority for acceding LDCs, given their other numerous pressing econom- ic and social needs. There are TRIPS-related concerns about increased drug costs limiting access to medicines necessary for public health, including the increasing concerns over HIV/AIDS in Asia-Pacific.WTO members should therefore allow these countries to avail them- selves of generous transition periods commen- surate with their development needs. A more rigorous and systematic assessment of the costs of implementation should be undertak- en and additional ODA provided, so that its provision is not a zero-sum calculation.In other words, ODA allocated for accession should not come at the expense of lower allocations in other sectors. 12 Duty paid is calculated based on data from USITC Dataweb for 2003, while Disbursed Aid data for 2002 are from the IDS online database. 13 Exports of apparel to Canada from LDCs increased from US$ 110 million in 2002 to US$ 298 million in 2003 following the change in rules of origin. 21 Facilitating International Trade and Market Access to Achieve the MDGs 4.3 The Potential of Intra-regional Trade An enhanced global partnership would be incomplete without a discussion of the poten- tial for intra-regional trade and economic cooperation. The Asia-Pacific region has gained recognition as a global producer, trader and consumer in its own right. As such, the region is its own best source of future trade and invest- ment growth and future dynamism for the global economy. In 2003, developing countries in the region contributed more than two-thirds of global South-South trade, with an annual growth rate of 11 percent per year, nearly twice the growth rate of total world exports. At the global level, only 32 percent of the total trade of all LDCs was conducted with other developing countries in 1989, but this had increased to 56 percent by 2001.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4bf0c1e-a78a-43b4-9e7c-877e41727c36": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4bf0c1e-a78a-43b4-9e7c-877e41727c36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Voices of the Least Developed Countries of Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b47d0068bb1d3d70be43a9fb058838304f08529ffda69ac960b786bc8d1c7f4c"}, "2": {"node_id": "d648dcdd-d6b1-4d3a-85bf-557fa0f51f04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0777f1cc2f116ee2b3d7a6bc666d428949880cec43fd60c3908c9c81b1a89215"}}, "hash": "c8fc2188359fb113dc8363246e296ed7491f31a86207620668ba0c4a44b94a12", "text": "Similarly, the proportion of total exports of all LDCs directed to other developing countries more than dou- bled, from 15 to 34 percent, in the same period.

With Bangladesh accounting for a large share of total LDC trade, these global trends are found not to differ much from intra-regional trade dynamics recorded at the Asia-Pacific level. However, for increased regional trade to occur, developing countries will need to revisit their own structure of pro- tection, which has often weighed more heavily on exporters from the LDCs than on those from developed countries. Increased labour mobility from least developed to developing countries would offer immediate benefits in the form of increased intra-regional trade in services. A large number of regional trading arrange- ments have also emerged in which Asia-Pacific LDCs are members, including the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA), Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation-Free Trade Area (BIMSTEC-FTA) and Association of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Area (AFTA). Several bilateral free trade arrangements also exist. For example, India and Nepal have open borders and complete labour mobility.India and Bangladesh have also signed a free trade agreement, and Pakistan has pro- posed a preferential trade pact with Afghanistan. These regional trading arrange- ments are indicative of an increasing interest in fostering closer intra-regional cooperation in trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. This is based on a shared understanding that such cooperation will encourage horizontal and vertical rationalisation of particular industries and facilitate the integration of all countries in the region into the global trading system. In this context,the issue of duty-free access to the mar- kets of relatively more advanced developing countries, mooted in the WTO, needs serious consideration, since it would foster greater intra-regional trade and economic cooperation, potentially leading to economies of scale. Another important area where interdepend- ence between developing and Asia-Pacific LDCs is likely to deepen relates to commodities, both fuel and non-fuel, which constitute 46 percent of intra-regional trade. The region\u2019s rising ener- gy needs, particularly in its fastest-growing economies, could provide market opportunities where LDCs could be major suppliers. There is, however, a need to reinforce assistance to the LDCs to enable them to participate meaningfully in these arrangements. These countries will require trade-related technical assistance and other types of support in areas such as harmonisation of customs procedures; development of competition policies and laws; harmonisation of certification and standardisa- tion requirements;identification of markets;and the development of trade-supportive infra- structure and institutions to strengthen supply- side capacities. Some apprehension is evident on the part of Asia-Pacific Least Developed Countries that they could suffer further margin- alisation were this not to occur. 4.4 Policy Coherence and Sequencing Through Trade Mainstreaming Although there is some potential to reduce poverty meaningfully through trade liberalisa- tion, a number of other conditions and policies that go beyond the WTO\u2019s traditional purview must be in place. Designing such policies is a challenging task, given marked differences in individual country contexts. If Asia-Pacific LDCs are to trade their way out of poverty, trade policy needs to be integrated into country development plans and poverty reduc- tion strategies. In other words, by incorporating trade policy into a country\u2019s overall development framework and ensuring that it complements the country\u2019s own economic and social priorities, For increased South-South trade to occur in Asia and the Pacific, developing countries will need to re-examine their own structure of protection 22 the goal of policy coherence is promoted. It is important,therefore,that trade mainstreaming not only identifies opportunities for trade lib- eralisation and export promotion but also opportunities to reduce poverty through trade policy. In this context, the principles of key Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), including country specificity and ownership, comprehensiveness and broad stakeholder par- ticipation,should be respected and a thorough poverty impact analysis mainstreamed into the development of any new trade policy.

This could reduce their ability to put in place and fund social safety nets.Thus, the aim of the social impact assessment would be to explore the consequences of a country accepting a package of trade concessions and rules imposed on it, as is often the case with LDCs, and to determine how losers should be com- pensated so that reforms are politically palat- able for society as a whole. At the regional level,a case in point is the SAFTA revenue-compensating mechanism. While the need for such a mechanism has been recog- nised, particularly for the LDCs, it remains an open question whether consensus can be reached on the shape and form that such a mechanism should take.Agreeing on such com- pensation schemes will not be easy,yet they are worthy of further analytical scrutiny. In an enhanced global partnership for development, there is accordingly much more that donors and trading partners \u2013 acting through both multilat- eral and regional institutions \u2013 can do to pro- vide LDCs with a level and form of financial assistance likely to raise their short- to medium- term comfort levels in undertaking market- opening policies. 4.5 Aid for Trade ODA represents an important corollary to the balance of concessions and obligations that will form part of the Doha Round results and an enhanced global partnership for develop- ment. In at least two areas, there continues to be a compelling case for further attention to LDCs. One is capacity development for country negotiators and promoting institutional capacity. A second is in addressing the supply- side constraints that inhibit export responsive- ness in LDCs and limit potential gains from trade liberalisation. Capacity Development in Trade Negotiations and Trade Policy Formulation While there has clearly been remarkable improvement in technical negotiating skills in recent years, LDCs still lack depth of expertise. Post-liberalisation issues or improvements in the regulation of markets typically remain high- ly complex, requiring significant expertise and resources dedicated to institution building. Regulatory reform in particular requires a con- certed effort by more developed countries, as providers of financial as well as human resources; competent international and national agencies as executing entities;and the recipient countries.Long-term partnership arrangements among counterpart ministries, supervisory and regulatory agencies,labour unions,chambers of commerce, industry associations and NGOs could be provided in key areas such as auditing; accounting; technical and sanitary and phy- tosanitary regulations and standards; utility and other services regulation; administration of jus- tice; consumer protection; and social and envi- ronmental policies. In this regard, the agree- ment reached on technical assistance and capacity building for the launch of negotiations on trade facilitation is significant and novel; it is Voices of the Least Developed Countries of Asia and the Pacific: Achieving the Millennium Development Goals Through a Global Partnership Policies need to account for social impacts of trade Trade-related policies need to be consistent with poverty reduction 23 Facilitating International Trade and Market Access to Achieve the MDGs the first time that implementation of commit- ments is explicitly linked to the provision of technical assistance.If this link is shown to deliv- er results,it could set an important precedent in enhancing development partnerships that would pave the way in other areas under nego- tiation as well. Supply-side Capacity Building Asia-Pacific LDCs that are also landlocked or small island states face specific problems in translating their comparative advantages into competitive advantages. Significant work has been carried out under the Work Programme on Small Economies in the WTO in relation to special measures on the grounds of smallness and vul- nerability. The Almaty Programme of Action is informed by the recognition that a major reason for the marginalisation of landlocked LDCs in Asia arises out of the difficulty in accessing mar- kets because of their geographic constraints.The Programme was endorsed by the International Ministerial Conference on Transit Transport Cooperation,held in Almaty,Kazakhstan,in 2003, and provides a comprehensive framework for closer partnerships to enhance the efficiency of transit transport.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "443ba66e-93e5-451c-bcea-f66ce07227e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "443ba66e-93e5-451c-bcea-f66ce07227e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Voices of the Least Developed Countries of Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61afd8adf82fee9d31128279c947a6fe2c64b062396d87e127b655b9cefd6c58"}, "2": {"node_id": "145eaa6a-e629-4486-8503-7ae18032a727", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54b2c6e8fc18d89288a2ed7cc4581612c5adf25ef1ba71463c6d7cb9a399ca30"}}, "hash": "492a0fb29e796461f9c09e575296103b3b90c4b9ad28eccc2ce2cd538f49f6c5", "text": "An International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, held at Port Louis, Mauritius, in January 2005, formulated the Mauritius Strategy.This recognises, among other things, that most small island states face specific difficulties in integrating into the global econo- my.

To assist global integration of landlocked Asia- Pacific LDCs, there is also a need to identify and support those tradables that are less dependent on transit transport, are low volume and weight with high value.Business process outsourcing is becoming a new tradable service, where com- munications technology has made transport costs irrelevant. For countries exporting high- bulk, low value-added goods \u2014 for example, mining, agricultural, textile and clothing prod- ucts \u2014 an improvement in transport infrastruc- ture and access to cost-effective information and communication technology are key supply- side aspects that need to be addressed. These challenges have to be tackled before any mar- ket-opening process to bear the desired results in a sustainable manner. Hence, additional development assistance in these areas needs to be prioritised to enable LDCs to realise the pos- itive effects that trade promises for poverty reduction and the attainment of the MDGs. In this regard,an aid-for-trade fund of US$ 5 billion has been proposed, and it is heartening to note that a strong consensus is emerging on the need to provide additional supply-side devel- opment assistance in areas such as improved agricultural productivity, infrastructure and the provision of basic social services. Aid to build up domestic capacities is necessary for Asia-Pacific LDCs to benefit from trade concessions 24 Aid and Debt Relief: Some Key Issues to Achieve the MDGs The international community will need to fulfil the aid and debt relief targets embodied in Goal 8 and reiterated in the Monterrey Consensus if LDCs are to achieve the MDGs C h a p t e r 5 5.1 Making Aid Work The savings and investment gap in Asia-Pacific LDCs continues to be ominously high. The capacity of these countries to incur financial obligations and mobilise adequate domestic resources, both public and private, remains seri- ously handicapped by various structural con- straints.These include the low diversification of the economic base mentioned earlier and the ensuing high economic vulnerability, persistent poverty levels and resulting low levels of sav- ings; inadequacy of their basic infrastructure; and geographic disadvantages, including proneness to natural disasters. Accordingly, the international community is urged to address the special needs of the LDCs by fulfilling the aid and debt relief targets embodied in MDG 8 as well as the targets in the Brussels Programme of Action for LDCs for the Decade 2001-2010, the Almaty Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries and the Programme of Action for Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. Aid to Asia-Pacific LDCs should be front-loaded and primarily be in the form of grants. Concessional loans and debt relief can also play a vital role in financing national investments to attain the MDGs in these countries. As mentioned earlier, aid flows to other LDCs, both in absolute terms and on a per-capita basis, remained appreciably higher than aid flows to Asia-Pacific LDCs between 1990 and 2002. In recent years, this imbalance has only widened. Between 2000 and 2003, a 60 percent increase in total ODA flows to Asia-Pacific LDCs was recorded, while ODA flows to other LDCs increased by as much as 87 percent.No tangible increase in per-capita ODA flows to Asia-Pacific LDCs has been recorded since 1990. Moreover, donors\u2019priorities and motivations for aid do not always match recipient countries\u2019needs. The composition of aid to Asia-Pacific LDCs is also a cause of concern, with a 10 percent decline in the proportion of grants in total ODA from 2002 to 2003. Strikingly, while the fastest and steadiest increase in ODA grants as a pro- portion of total ODA is recorded in the region \u2014 with Afghanistan, China and Pakistan as the main receivers \u2014 at the same time Asia-Pacific LDCs have recently faced a sharp decline in that proportion. This situation needs to be assessed against the financial resources needed by these countries to attain the MDGs. The Monterrey Consensus recognises the need for substantial increases in ODA,as well as other resources,if developing countries are to achieve internationally agreed development goals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8392dc0b-f086-4780-8d2b-153b8c738dbd": {"__data__": {"id_": "8392dc0b-f086-4780-8d2b-153b8c738dbd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Voices of the Least Developed Countries of Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e63d55e9a30c42fd62f1240f8dbf47b4a83c91129edea76b3ea384a817c6c1e"}, "2": {"node_id": "7fdafbb4-cb9b-4246-8340-d4a506c964d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3378b0bdf8b7e129c9abaf75cce8e212b98b675cc12c348bba0f9fab10221b5"}}, "hash": "e9deccfac6122e7aa4de4a590778e6a1c8734ddb35832bf84f70f9288e59c20d", "text": "A number of attempts have been made to esti- mate the financing required if the MDGs are to be reached by 2015.The Zedillo Panel estimated that an additional US$ 50 billion would be required annually to achieve the MDGs in all developing countries, while the UN Millennium Project has estimated these costs to be US$ 121 billion in 2006, rising to US$ 189 billion in 2015.

A rough estimate of the resources needed to meet the MDGs in Asia-Pacific LDCs shows that these countries will require US$ 20.7 billion in 2006, US$ 30.9 billion in 2010 and US$ 47.3 bil- lion in 2015 (Table 7). Of this amount, house- holds and governments in the countries concerned are expected to generate 42 percent 25 Aid and Debt Relief: Some Key Issues to Achieve the MDGs in 2006, rising to 43 percent in 2010 and 45 per- cent in 2015.Such a task is enormous in itself for these countries. Even if governments and households in those countries are focused on undertaking this huge task, attainment of the MDGs would still require an additional support of US$ 12 billion in 2006,US$ 17.7 billion in 2010 and US$ 26.2 billion in 2015.This,however,is not an unreachable sum. As estimated by the Millennium Project, the cost of meeting the MDGs in all LDCs will cor- respond to about 0.12 percent of the GNP of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Commi- ttee (OECD-DAC) countries in 2006 and 0.22 percent in 2015. The 2006 target of 0.12 per- cent is roughly double the current share of ODA in donor GNP to these countries14 but well below the internationally agreed goal of 0.15 to 0.20 percent, as called for in the Brussels Programme of Action. A small amount of additional support from developed coun- tries would make an enormous difference to the LDCs.An encouraging indication is that the flow of ODA to all LDCs from OECD countries increased by 31 percent between 2002 and 2003;in February 2005,donor countries agreed on a substantial replenishment of funds for the International Development Association, a World Bank affiliate that provides assistance to the world\u2019s poorest countries. Nonetheless, much more will need to be done if the MDGs are to be achieved by 2015. The financing needed for Asia-Pacific LDCs to meet the MDGs will require an enormous effort on their part, plus complementary support from the donor community 14 According to 2002 data based on OECD-DAC 2004,ODA to LDCs as a percentage of OECD-DAC countries\u2019GNI was 0.06 percent, in 2002.

These include the Millennium Challenge Account of the United States, the International Finance Facility of the United Kingdom, French proposals for a tax on cross-border financial transactions and levies on aviation and shipping fuels as well as pas- senger tickets,and a proposal that the IMF issue new special drawing rights to finance aid flows. The Millennium Summit in September 2005 must come up with new, concrete proposals if the considerable resources required for devel- opment assistance are to be mobilised. The focus of the global community is needed on Asia-Pacific LDCs,just as much as on other LDCs, for them to benefit from these new instruments. It also needs to be re-emphasised that any new commitment toward meeting the MDGs must be time-bound and capable of being realised \u2014 and must not remain merely a commitment. 5.2 Debt Relief for Additional Resources As briefly illustrated in Chapter 3, debt servic- ing ratios in Asia-Pacific LDCs and LDCs from other regions have been consistently converg- ing since the mid-1990s. In view of persistent poverty levels and growing resource gaps in Asia-Pacific LDCs, however, there is an urgent need to re-examine the issue of debt relief from the perspective of generating additional resources to attain the MDGs.The international community ought not to obligate any country to spend money on debt servicing when that country does not have enough money to edu- cate all its children at the primary level or reduce the number of children dying of treat- able and preventable diseases. The gap is con- siderable for the relative debt burden on the one hand and per-capita debt relief on the other between the Asia-Pacific and other LDCs. The figures for 2002 presented in Table 8 are worthy of note: while the average outstanding debt burden of other LDCs was 1.7 times that of Asia-Pacific LDCs, in contrast, the average debt relief granted to the former was more than 10 times that of the latter. At the country level, debt-to-GDP ratios and per- capita outstanding debt stood at alarmingly high levels in 2002 in some Asia-Pacific LDCs, includ- ing Lao PDR (146 percent and US$ 471 per-capi- ta respectively); Vanuatu (71 percent; US$ 785); and Maldives (41 percent;US$ 830).Although the debt burden and debt-servicing liability of other Voices of the Least Developed Countries of Asia and the Pacific: Achieving the Millennium Development Goals Through a Global Partnership LDCs have received increasing attention, under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative,for example eligibility thresholds remain excessively high and, as a result, no LDC in the Asia-Pacific region has benefited from this initia- tive so far. Nevertheless, Asia-Pacific LDCs have in general succeeded in keeping debt servicing ratios relatively low, both as a percentage of GDP and as a percentage of exports,reflecting their rel- atively prudent economic management. In view of the pressing need to make additional resources available to meet the MDGs in resource-starved Asia-Pacific LDCs, it is impera- tive that this better performance not be penalised by exclusion from the HIPC Initiative because their debt servicing ratios are slightly above the threshold. Criteria for the selection of HIPC-eligible countries need to be reviewed, with particular attention to the unique chal- lenges faced by the LDCs. All severely indebted countries, including Bhutan, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Samoa, and moderately indebted countries, including Cambodia and Solomon Islands, should be eligible for debt relief.These countries, however, have not benefited from some of the recent global initiatives on debt relief (Box 3).

As proposed by the UN Millennium Project, debt sustainability should be redefined as \u201cthe level of debt consistent with achieving the MDGs\u201d, reaching 2015 without a new debt overhang. For Asia-Pacific LDCs left off the HIPC list, meeting the MDGs will at least require significant debt cancellation. Most important, any debt relief extended should be an add-on to ODA, not be at cost of ODA. 5.3 Development Cooperation Among Developing Countries in Asia and the Pacific In addition to the ODA provided by developed countries of Asia-Pacific, many developing countries in the region provide aid, mainly in the form of technical assistance.These develop- ing countries, which have benefited from aid in the past and may still be doing so, are in a posi- tion to share their experiences with poorer countries and so express their solidarity with them.Technical assistance provided by developing countries in the region to the least developed is sometimes more advantageous in terms of suit- ability, even if less so in terms of size. For exam- ple,manpower skills and technology transferred can be more appropriate to the geographic and ecological conditions and stage of develop- ment of the recipients. Intra-regional technical and economic cooperation is extremely impor- tant for augmenting external assistance resources for LDCs of the region. Many of the developing countries have experienced rapid growth recently and are in a position to help countries still struggling to catch up.Developed and developing countries of the region thus can collaborate in providing help to the countries most in need of aid.This triangular cooperation provides a cost-effective way to use the finan- cial resources and technical expertise available from multilateral assistance programmes and activities15. A large number of developing countries in Asia and the Pacific are involved in regional develop- ment cooperation. For instance, the Republic of Korea\u2019s aid programme, which focuses on shar- ing the country\u2019s own experience, particularly in human resources development,has grown rapid- ly from US$ 12 million in 1990 to US$ 207 million in 2002. India has been providing technical assistance under its Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme since 1964 and has pro- vided US$ 2 billion worth of technical assistance to developing countries, including neighbour- ing LDCs, since then. Its technical assistance has four components:training;projects and project- related activities such as feasibility studies and consultancy services;deputation of experts;and Debt sustainability should be redefined as the level of debt consistent with achieving the MDGs by 2015, without a new debt overhang On 11 June 2005, the finance ministers of the G8 countries (Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States of America) announced a 100 percent cancellation of debt owed to multilateral agencies by 18 poor countries. The decision is expected to ease the debt burden of Benin,Bolivia,Burkina Faso,Ethiopia,Ghana,Guyana,Honduras,Madagascar,Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. Of these countries, 14 are in Africa and four in Latin America.None of the beneficiary countries is in the Asia-Pacific region. While the implications of this package remain unclear,this is a bold initiative that will enable poor coun- tries to use the money they save on debt servicing for health,education and the relief of poverty. The HIPC initiative currently identifies 38 countries, 32 of them in sub-Saharan Africa, as potential- ly eligible to receive debt relief.Only two LDCs from Asia-Pacific,Lao PDR and Myanmar,are includ- ed in the list. However, based on standard World Bank definitions of indebtedness, four countries among Asia-Pacific LDCs (Bhutan, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Samoa) classify as \u201cseverely indebted\u201d and two as \u201cmoderately indebted\u201d(Cambodia and Solomon Islands).Hence,debt relief initiatives for these LDCs would be instrumental in releasing additional resources to achieve the MDGs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a011966a-51d6-457f-ba4f-e9ca8a9e9b45": {"__data__": {"id_": "a011966a-51d6-457f-ba4f-e9ca8a9e9b45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Voices of the Least Developed Countries of Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "700f59ec05a23e1f6350b8e981d86910951b1ed2f0f40e0782f96d7580ed8217"}, "2": {"node_id": "7244c7bb-5f23-4c5c-b577-c1dc11bf8a61", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e440242b2c0fd45cdf137b9fd2a049ccf9424f7fa741e5b91750191c971057c"}}, "hash": "7d8e9fcd3ca7bdf6670e0018a712d54ef4bfee8513094e2550f9e9aab06efe98", "text": "Source: G8 Finance Ministers\u2019Conclusions on Development, London, 10-11 June 2005, www.g8.gov.uk Box 3.

Since its inception in the 1960s, Singapore\u2019s technical assistance has been focused on increasing the human resources of recipient countries, particularly members of ASEAN, through training and acquisition of skills. Under the Singapore Cooperation Programme, technical assistance includes bilat- eral programmes, initiatives for ASEAN integra- tion centres, study visits and scholarships for nationals of ASEAN member countries.Singapore also has joint training programmes with other developed or developing countries or interna- tional organisations, in the form of triangular or third-country programmes, so that the expe- rience, expertise and resources of both partners are brought to bear on training for a large num- ber of developing and Least Developed Countries of the region. Malaysia promotes South-South cooperation by sharing its success- ful development experiences through training, study tours and advisory services, mostly aimed at capacity building and human resources devel- opment16. Finally, Thailand provides technical assistance to developing countries under its Thai International Cooperation Programme. It also participates in triangular or third-country train- ing programmes17 whereby areas of coopera- tion are identified in consultation with recipient countries. This includes development projects, the provision of fellowships and other forms of training,the dispatch of experts and equipment, and construction of physical infrastructure. 5.4 Governance Issues It is necessary to recognise that the demand for a rapid scaling up of aid flows to the LDCs is meeting with some resistance from donors, and the international arena here is becoming more difficult. This fact has been recognised by Asia- Pacific LDCs in their set of recommendations.As stated in the Monterrey Consensus,good gover- nance is essential for sustainable development. Donor fatigue and resistance often originate from frustration in seeing aid fail to deliver the expected results. Recipient countries, for their part,will need to show more sensitivity to donor perceptions about their capacity to make good use of aid owing to apprehensions about resource diversion, misallocation, corruption and wastage. When institutions in recipient countries are dysfunctional, implementation capacity is weak and lack of good governance, donors understandably become concerned about committing their taxpayers\u2019 money to support those particular countries. As a conse- quence, this reduces new commitments and puts existing commitments at risk,while leading to the imposition of stricter conditions. Such apprehensions are reflected in MDG-related programmes of support such as the Millennium Challenge Account. However,it should also be recognised that coun- tries that suffer from bad governance,weak insti- tutions and insufficient implementation capaci- ties are often those most in need of support.This is not only because of the high incidence of poverty that results from these negatives, but also because without support, these countries will not be in a position to put in place the required policies and institutions to tackle such vices. Rather than simply staying away from bad performers, the approach has to be one of con- tinuing and constructive engagement. Recipient countries need to demonstrate a willingness to improve the state of governance, including cor- ruption issues, to a level where donors feel assured to commit more support \u2014 for their part, donors have to be ready to strengthen the capacity of poor countries to address gover- nance problems. Global partners also need to recognise their own role in supporting good gov- ernance. For example, the short-term interests of private companies from more developed coun- tries and the strategic priorities of donors may interfere with the long-term interest of the LDCs, thus sometimes compromising public policies. The poor quality of governance in some Asia- Pacific LDCs is partly the result of low investment Economic and technical cooperation between developing and Least Developed Countries in Asia-Pacific is an encouraging phenomenon 16 Malaysia\u2019s Technical Cooperation Programme (MTCP) was established in 1980.Much of Malaysia\u2019s support to LDCs has been bilateral, but there has also been significant cooperation within the framework of ASEAN, the Asia-Africa Partnership, and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC). Malaysia\u2019s recent support to tsunami-affected neighbouring countries demonstrates its readiness to provide humanitarian and development assistance with long- term commitments beyond traditional MTCP lines. 17 ESCAP, Implementing the Monterrey Consensus in the Asian and Pacific Region, p.105.

If governments are willing, these issues can be dealt with through adequate pro- vision of resources. However, this may require several years of investment in improved public management and administration. Aid could help build strong institutions that will, in turn, set up the right conditions for growth and broader development.There is thus a need for a genuinely constructive engagement between donors and recipient countries toward good governance in recipient countries, keeping in view the overarching objective of achieving the MDGs in all countries by 2015. The global community needs to recognise and support positive steps to promote democratic governance in Asia-Pacific LDCs. Because of the effective use of external resouces, some countries in the region have in fact managed to attract donor funding as well as foreign direct investment. Credible national institutions and policies contribute to donor confidence in the efficient use of their resources. In one notable development, Bhutan has undertaken major reforms to develop its first Constitution. Aid figures in Bhutan have been on the rise from US$ 53 mil- lion in 2000,to $ 61 million in 2001,$ 73 million in 2002 and $ 77 million in 2003. Likewise, Afghanistan and Timor-Leste have recently held critical elections that represent a signifi- cant achievement in these post-conflict coun- tries.Though not an LDC,Viet Nam is an exam- ple of a low-income country in Asia that has benefited from a combination of external sup- port and internal policies. Indeed,Viet Nam is a sterling example of a country that has not only grown rapidly in the 1990s but also sharply reduced poverty by adopting an employment- intensive growth strategy. Donors have contin- ued to pour in money into the country prima- rily on account of their belief that the money is put to good use \u2014 which ultimately is a meas- ure of good governance. Aid Management Aid management issues that limit the effec- tiveness of aid utilisation need to be addressed by all concerned partners. On the part of donors, the gap between commitments and actual disbursements of aid in Asia-Pacific LDCs must be addressed urgently. ODA loans received as a percentage of total loans extend- ed in these countries have decreased sharply from 52 percent in 2002 to 34 percent in 2003. In the same period, ODA loans received as a percentage of total loans extended in Asian developing countries increased by more than 20 percentage points, from 48 percent in 2002 to 69 percent in 2003 and remained relatively stable in other LDCs. Improving the quality of aid is as important as improving its quantity. Untying of aid is crucial but remains abysmally low. Development requires financing not merely of initial invest- ments, but also of recurring expenditures. Therefore, the MDGs will be realised in Asia- Pacific LDCs only if donors indicate their long- term commitment to this end. Donors should consider programme budget support as the most viable long-term strategy to assist these countries. Independent monitoring and evalua- tion of aid performance at the level of the recip- ient country should also be considered. The UN Millennium Project Report has identi- fied 10 key shortcomings that hinder the attain- ment of MDGs with corresponding recommen- dations to improve aid delivery (Table 9). Development partners need to examine these recommendations carefully and take appropri- ate corrective measures. Since each country is different and has its own set of challenges and development goals, a country-based approach is required that pro- motes country ownership and channels aid to sectors where its impact is greatest.To enhance the efficiency of utilisation of such aid, Asia- Pacific LDCs need to strengthen their domestic capacities for planning and project implemen- tation, improve monitoring and evaluation, ensure better institutional coordination among government agencies involved in negotiating and utilising aid, and achieve greater decentral- Aid to foster good governance may be more constructive than simply staying away from poor performers 18 ESCAP, Implementing the Monterrey Consensus in the Asian and Pacific Region, p.100.

Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Nepal have prepared both MDG progress reports and PRSPs. In addition, Afghanistan and Timor-Leste have prepared MDG progress reports.Countries that have not so far prepared these documents should be provided with the support necessary to do so. The lack of adequate information in preparing MDG progress reports is a serious problem for most Asia-Pacific LDCs, including those that have already prepared the reports. There is a need for targeted support in assisting those countries to put in place a mechanism for generating appropriate MDG-related data and information so as to be able to attract addition- al assistance from the international community. However, it should also be acknowledged that the priority needs and concerns of the LDCs of the region change over the years.Countries that are making good progress toward the MDGs should not be penalised in future allocations of aid, at least as long as the goals are not fully achieved. Mid-course interruptions of support could derail the progress. 5.5 Priorities for Increased Aid In view of the emerging MDG deficits in Asia- Pacific LDCs,there is an urgent need for targeted support in specific areas such as the develop- ment of infrastructure, trade-related capacity building and health and education, as well as addressing the specific needs of the least devel- oped landlocked and small island countries. Several MDGs relate to health, an area where the LDCs of the region will need to make mas- sive investments if infant and maternal mortali- ty rates are to be reduced and killer diseases contained and eliminated. The PRSPs of many Asia-Pacific LDCs have iden- tified support for infrastructure as a major area of intervention requiring substantial inflows of aid. In recent years, however, this sector has wit- nessed a sharp fall in ODA by both bilateral and multilateral agencies. Inadequate infrastructure is a major reason for the small amount of FDI in Asia-Pacific LDCs, which together were able to attract less than US$ 1 billion in 2003.The lack of infrastructure also severely limits the aid absorp- Shortcomings Recommendations 1.

Global experi- ence indicates that countries that have good infrastructure and efficient institutions of gover- nance not only have higher aid absorption capacity but are also able to attract more FDI. The UN Millennium Project Report contains sev- eral recommendations on MDG priorities for regional and other country groupings. In the words of the Report, LDCs require special assis- tance because they will be unable to meet their basic needs from domestic resources, regardless of their own policies or quality of governance. Support for them should be consistent with the Brussels Programme of Action, which outlines key areas to help break the poverty trap, includ- ing human resources development,investments to remove supply-side constraints, environmen- tal protection and investments in food security. Landlocked countries have a unique need for transport infrastructure,regional market integra- tion, and harmonised trade procedures.

LDCs in South-East Asia, meanwhile, will require invest- ments in infrastructure; the environment, partic- ularly in managing forests and biodiversity; and social services, as well as a focus on public man- agement systems and increased capacity for sci- ence and technology. In South Asia, priority investments include improved health infrastruc- ture and services; increased access to high-qual- ity schools; farm infrastructure; improved water management for agriculture; slum upgrading; and improved public sector management. Investment programmes also should focus on achieving gender equality, including reproduc- tive health and rights, and integrating margin- alised populations. The UN Millennium Project Report also distin- guishes between poor countries on the basis of the quality of governance. Well-governed, poverty-trapped LDCs will need substantial co-financing through ODA to scale up much- needed investments in infrastructure, human capital and public administration. Poverty- trapped countries, where governance is poor owing to weak public administration, need investment in public sector capacity so as to raise the absorptive capacity for aid later on. Poor public administration should be viewed as an investment opportunity, not as a barrier to achieving the MDGs. Finally, in other pover- ty-trapped countries with poor governance, there is little case for large-scale aid. Aid should be directed to humanitarian efforts or through NGOs that can ensure delivery of services on the ground. Finally, conflict coun- tries represent urgent, special cases for the international community. 32 Conclusion and Recommendations C h a p t e r 6 Although progress has been mixed, with suc- cesses marred by some failures, Asia-Pacific LDCs,together with their international partners, have managed to show progress toward several key MDG targets. In order to ensure that the Asia-Pacific region as a whole achieves the MDGs by 2015,it is essential that LDCs,as well as their developed and developing country part- ners find ways to address the unique challenges faced by these countries. The Special Body on Least Developed and Landlocked Developing Countries, an inter-governmental body estab- lished to give high priority to the concerns of these groups of countries, has outlined specific recommendations to substantiate LDCs\u2019 call for an enhanced global partnership (Box 4). In a spirit of shared responsibility,the recommenda- tions are addressed to both the international community and the LDCs. As seen above, what makes Asia-Pacific LDCs unique is their location in an economically dynamic region. Regional as well as global development partnerships provide the oppor- tunity to translate this favourable location into actual benefits. On commercial grounds, pros- perity and well-being in the region could lead to increased trade with LDCs and further opening up of markets. If development partners do not rise to the challenge, the region\u2019s overall dynamism could exacerbate inequalities and contribute to growing disaffection spilling across national boundaries.Hence, this is not an argument for charity, but one for the mutual benefit of LDCs and their partners, on commer- cial and strategic grounds, apart from being morally right. The argument for development assistance rests on a win-win partnership. Strong evidence suggests that many Asia- Pacific LDCs are in a position to achieve the MDGs. What is required are bold initiatives on the part of their development partners to com- plement the pro-MDG national strategies of each country. To enable Asia-Pacific LDCs attain the MDGs,the Special Body on Least Developed and Landlocked Developing Countries endorsed the following recommendations at its Seventh Session, held in Bangkok, 10 and 11 May 2005. It is significant that these include five key recommendations where the Asia-Pacific LDCs are expected to take specific actions at the national level and seek complementary international support.There is an explicit acceptance of the importance of appro- priate domestic policies,institutions and governance in order to make this global partnership most productive.

A preferential scheme similar to the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) could be extended to the Least Developed Countries in Asia and the Pacific.

(c) More commercially meaningful commitments should be made in terms of temporary movement of natu- ral persons as well as cross-border supply of services such as outsourcing, because it leads to benefits such as skills enhancement and knowledge transfers. Such movement of natural persons, especially the low-skilled, leads to economic growth that benefits the poor in the least developed and landlocked developing countries. (d) Five Least Developed Countries and four landlocked developing countries are conducting complex and resource- intensive negotiations to accede to WTO. The WTO decision on the accession of Least Developed Countries, as contained in document WT/L/508, calls on WTO members to simplify and streamline the accession process. The terms by which these countries accede to WTO should reflect the spirit of an enhanced global partnership for trade, as foreseen in Millennium Development Goal 8. (e) With progress in the Doha-mandated negotiations, delivery of technical assistance for human resources development should be intensified, so that the negotiating capacity of trade negotiators, as well as implemen- tation capacity, is strengthened. Policy analysis should also be strengthened so that policy makers and negotia- tors base their decisions on sound economic grounds. (f) Least developed and landlocked developing countries lack productive capacity and other supply-side responses to make effective use of new market access opportunities.In this regard, a significant increase in funds allocat- ed to trade and supply-side responses is of particular importance to these countries. An improvement in sup- ply-side capacity would, in turn, attract domestic and foreign investments that would eventually reduce depend- ence on aid and create new market opportunities. (g) Regional and bilateral trade agreements should be based on outward orientation and designed in compli- ance with WTO rules and principles. Least Developed Countries should be provided with special and differen- tial concessions in an effort to reverse the increasing trend toward marginalisation and facilitate their integration into the world economy. Due consideration should be given to extending these concessions to landlocked and other small developing countries. (h) The global community is urged to strengthen global development partnerships by addressing volatilities in the financial and monetary systems.There should be greater multilateral policy coherence among trade,finan- cial flows, aid and debt relief for a more predictable trading environment.

Good governance at all lev- els is a prerequisite for effective use of aid. People and communities are both participants in and beneficiaries of such assistance. (b) Making aid effective calls for better aid harmonisation and coordination. Since each country is different,with its own set of challenges,development goals and strategies,a country-based approach,which enables each coun- try to reach its development goals,is necessary.Such an approach promotes country-based ownership and channels aid to sectors where its impact is the greatest by requiring recipient countries to prepare their own development 34 Voices of the Least Developed Countries of Asia and the Pacific: Achieving the Millennium Development Goals Through a Global Partnership programmes.Development also requires financing not merely of initial investments but also of the many forms of current expenditure.In order to ensure that aid is harmonised,recipient countries need to prepare a coherent aid policy in the spirit of the Rome Declaration and in consultation with donors.

Resources available from other developing countries of the region could also be tapped. Actions by the international community (a) The international community was urged to meet the targets in the Brussels Programme of Action, the Almaty Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy. Aid should be determined by economic and social concerns and directed to addressing fundamental causes of poverty,especially in countries with internal conflicts and countries battered by natural disasters. Given the limited capacity of these countries to incur financial obli- gations, external assistance to them should primarily be in the form of grants. Aid should also be front-loaded. (b) Steps should be taken for greater coherence among donors in areas such as policy conditionalities and ODA practices, trade regimes and technology transfer from donor countries. Efforts should also be made to ensure that policy conditionalities converge with recipient country priorities,thus promoting national ownership. Independent monitoring and evaluation of aid performance at the level of the recipient country should be con- sidered. The fostering of national ownership should be based on genuine dialogue and conducted in a spirit of partnership between donors and recipients. (c) The international community should continue its dialogue with recipient countries on issues such as grant components in aid, tied purchases and financing of recurring costs to bring about improvements in these areas. Donors should consider programme budget support as the main long-term strategy to assist these coun- tries and indicate their long-term commitment to assist these countries. (d) Regional solutions could enable smaller countries to address issues that would have been too costly to implement at the country level by introducing economies of scale. (e) The priority needs and concerns of least developed and landlocked developing countries change over the years.The international community should therefore ensure that their assistance continues to address the chang- ing needs of these countries. Note: The Special Body on Least Developed and Landlocked Developing Countries is an inter-governmental body established to review the economic and social developments in these groups of countries and to give high priority to their concerns. 35 Annexure 1. Criteria for the Identification of the Least Developed Countries In the triennial review conducted in 2003 to determine countries to be added to or graduated from the list of LDCs, the Committee for Development Policy (CDP) based its identification of these countries on the three dimensions of a coun- try\u2019s state of development, namely, (i) its income level; (ii) its stock of human assets; and (iii) economic vulnerability. GNI per-capita was used as an indicator of income,the Human Assets Index (HAI) as an indicator of the stock of human assets and the Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI) as an indicator of economic susceptibility19. In addition, no country with a population exceeding 75 million was considered for addition to the list.The results, based on LDC eligibility indicators for 14 Asia-Pacific LDCs, are summarised in the table below.

Progress Toward Attainment of the MDGs by Asia-Pacific Least Developed Countries Goal 1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Even if the MDG target of halving the proportion of population below the poverty line is achieved, more than a quarter people in the Asia-Pacific LDCs will still be subsisting on incomes below the national poverty lines in 2015.Among LDCs of the region, only Cambodia and Lao PDR are on track. The proportion of the population consuming less than the minimum level of dietary energy in the LDCs of the region remained almost static in the 1990s, falling slightly from 30.7 percent to 29.9 percent; and at this pace, it will remain at 28.6 percent in 2015, far higher than the MDG target of 15.3 percent. More encouragingly, the proportion of underweight children to total children in the Asia-Pacific region declined from 35 to 31 percent over the last decade. The challenges that lie ahead for most of the Asia-Pacific LDCs are nonetheless daunting. In this group of countries, more than 10 million children aged 0-4 years will be underweight in 2015 even if MDG targets are achieved. The number of underweight children overall may even exceed this figure by more than 1.4 million \u2014 in countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Lao PDR, the targets will not be achieved if current trends continue. Meanwhile, the implementation of targeted health and nutrition programmes that benefit the poor has proved highly effective in Bangladesh and Bhutan.In the former,the percentage of underweight children below 5 years of age fell from 65.8 in 1990 to 47.7 in 2000 and the country appears on track to surpass the MDG target if current trends hold. Nevertheless, large variations persist across income groups.The presence of malnourished children even in the highest income group suggests that health education will also need attention. In Bhutan, the MDG target for this indicator was already achieved in 2000,and the proportion of underweight children should fall to zero by 2015.Maldives was on track to achieve this target but will now require additional resources because of the impact of the tsunami. In fact, the expe- rience of Maldives reveals the high vulnerability of many LDCs,where a single disaster can wipe out progress made over years. Goal 2. Achieve universal primary education The primary enrolment ratio in Asia-Pacific LDCs improved from 71 to 79 percent in the 1990s but remained significantly lower than the average of 93 percent for the entire region.If current trends continue,only 87 percent of the children in Asia- Pacific LDCs will be enrolled for primary education in 2015 and 5 million children \u2014 mainly in Afghanistan and Myanmar \u2014 will not be. Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Maldives and Vanuatu appear to be on track to achieve the target of 100 per- cent enrolment.In Bhutan,community schools with strong grassroots links have played,and continue to play a major role in increasing enrolment.However,deteriorating trends are observed in Myanmar and in Afghanistan;around 2 million children will not be enrolled in school if the MDG target is not attained in these two countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fe51195-8520-4e3f-9b39-b27f11f34734": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fe51195-8520-4e3f-9b39-b27f11f34734", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Voices of the Least Developed Countries of Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "896c3cf68e17c77f32ca38076371dbe0f18e0fffda3eba5dcbd253e7d1c26a23"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b58c0e7-82ff-40a5-bcef-c50183cd8936", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39dad9bbdd826bc61058f9136e58b1d9a025017a5f5ab15606a7bd6b5c1a2c7c"}}, "hash": "968b68d497b6d778fe52a1d0d80f1ea38d5a12305b3313d042504180410ebbc1", "text": "An important issue that constrains attainment of universal primary education in many LDCs of the region is that, in the effort to increase enrolments, the quality of primary education suffers as measured, for example, by student-teacher ratios,the number of students per classroom,and the number of qualified and trained teachers.Additional resources are clearly required to address issues related to improving the quality of education while simultaneously increasing access. Enormous effort and resources are also required if the MDG target aiming at a 100 percent literacy rate for 15- to 24-year-olds is to be achieved in countries where adult literacy remains low,including Bangladesh (49.7 percent),Nepal (62.7 percent)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bdb8e9f0-22b6-4c45-9d2c-b1d083a5e708": {"__data__": {"id_": "bdb8e9f0-22b6-4c45-9d2c-b1d083a5e708", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Voices of the Least Developed Countries of Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0101ae522850c1569eb5ad4f95bbedf5516ecf8ed543554eabdf239b901d7b94"}, "3": {"node_id": "93c44e1e-5476-4fb5-ae89-9353411998ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c51e03fcd7deaf2d4e80b215f53a8122aee4244e906696346a92c56b2db766e"}}, "hash": "9afb9a1cf557cab461cb9822b34ed4af90389cab815c6c76d6b5126333f6f31e", "text": "and Timor-Leste (50 percent). If current trends prevail in Bangladesh, 20.3 million, or only 56 percent of youth, will be literate in 2015, leaving more than 16 million behind. Goal 3. Promote gender equality and empower women Progress toward the promotion of gender equality has been relatively slow in Asia-Pacific LDCs,where gender disparity in terms of economic participation and democratic representation is widespread.The gender gap appears to be closing at the primary school level in rural and urban areas of Bangladesh,for example,but it is much wider at higher education levels,with a 38 percent ratio of girls to boys in tertiary education.Similarly,in Lao PDR the ratio of girls to boys decreas- es as the education level increases. In Cambodia, the ratio of girls to boys in lower secondary education remained low and unchanged at 35.4 percent in 2000, while a decline in this ratio was recorded at the upper secondary level, falling to 33.7 percent that year. Goal 4. Reduce child mortality Eight of the 14 Asia-Pacific LDCs are on track to reduce under-5 mortality rates by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. These include Bangladesh, Bhutan, Lao PDR, Maldives, Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Of the remaining 38 Voices of the Least Developed Countries of Asia and the Pacific: Achieving the Millennium Development Goals Through a Global Partnership countries, Cambodia\u2019s performance in this regard has worsened, the situation in Afghanistan is unlikely to change by 2015 and others have made very slow progress. Hence, current trends indicate that around 2 million children under 5 years of age will die in 2015 in Asia-Pacific LDCs. Likewise, many Asia-Pacific LDCs are unlikely to meet the target of reducing infant mortality by two-thirds by 2015. In Cambodia,the infant mortality rate actually increased from 80 to 96 per 1,000 live births between 1990 and 2002.If cur- rent trends persist,311,000 children will die within the first year of their life in 2015.As individual country MDG progress reports suggest, even in countries that are on track to achieve the infant mortality target, significant disparities remain between urban and rural areas, and between boys and girls. Goal 5. Improve maternal health Most Asia-Pacific LDCs are on track to achieve the MDG target to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters, between 1990 and 2015, although the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated. In spite of the progress made, the maternal mortality ratio also remains relatively high in Nepal, Lao PDR and Timor-Leste, where maternal mortality rates stand at 7 per 1,000 live births.In populous countries such as Bangladesh,where 12,000 to 15,000 women die every year from maternal health complications and nearly 45 percent of all mothers are malnourished, additional resources will need to be devoted to reproductive health if the MDG is to be achieved. Goal 6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases Although most Asia-Pacific LDCs are classified as low-HIV-prevalence countries, the danger of an increase in infection rates requires continued vigilance.In Bangladesh, recent surveys indicate an alarming increase in HIV infections among intravenous drug users, from 1.7 percent in 2000 to 4 percent in 2002.The potential danger of the disease spreading in countries such as Lao PDR, Nepal and Bhutan is a real threat given that these countries are adjacent to areas in the region that have high HIV/AIDS prevalence. The high mobility of people and open cross-border movements therefore pose significant risks that need to be countered with targeted communication strategies. Malaria is a serious health threat in all Asia-Pacific LDCs. In Lao PDR, malaria has consistently been among the top three causes of reported morbidity and mortality, with about 70 percent of the Lao population living in areas where they are at risk.Yet by 2000 only 10 percent of children in rural areas, who are at the highest risk of death from malaria, were sleeping under treated bed nets. In Bhutan, more than half of the country\u2019s total population is exposed to the risk of infection, while in Nepal as much as 70 percent of the population is at risk. In both countries, the free move- ment of people along the border compounds the prevention challenge and helps spread the disease. Least devel- oped Pacific islands are also severely afflicted by the disease.

Kiribati, Myanmar, Nepal and Tuvalu are on track to halve the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe water in rural areas by 2015,while only Myanmar, Timor-Leste and Tuvalu will be able to do so in urban areas. Notwithstanding significant progress, around 60 million people in Asia-Pacific LDCs will not have access to improved sanitation by 2015. Nepal and Kiribati will face difficulties in meeting the MDG target in rural areas, while Bangladesh and Nepal will also face difficulties in urban areas. Integrating principles of sustainable development into national poli- cies remains difficult. In Afghanistan, only 2.5 percent of the land is currently under forest cover. At this rate of defor- estation, Afghanistan\u2019s forests will be gone in 25 years.

Alternate Estimate for Resource Gap Assuming an annual savings rate of 12.2 percent,a capital-output ratio of 3,a population growth rate of 1.9 percent and a capital depreciation rate of 3 percent, the real per-capita income in Asia-Pacific LDCs could fall by 0.87 percent per annum (see Table below)20. In contrast, real per-capita incomes in Asian developing countries would rise by around 6 percent annually, while those for other LDCs would fall by more than 3 percent. As a result, the average real per-capita income for Asian developing countries could more than double between 2001 and 2015. The average real per-capita income for Asia-Pacific LDCs could fall by 11 percent, from US$ 386 in 2002 to US$ 344 by 201521, while that in other LDCs could decline by 35 percent. In this scenario, a savings rate of more than 30 percent is necessary for Asian LDCs to achieve a 5 percent growth rate in real per-capita income.To achieve such a high savings rate,these countries will clear- ly require additional support.

Alternatively, for a closed economy with i equal to savings rates (s) the preceding equation can be written as, gy =(s/\ufffd) - n \u2013 d.

Local governments are in a unique position to contribute to the global struggle for gender equality by improving the status of women around the world. Local Governments are the level of governance closest to the citizens and as service providers and employers have an important role in creating the conditions that encourage women\u2019s political participation. In November 1998 a worldwide association of local governments declared the commitment of local governments across the globe in making equal the number of women and men in decision-making bodies at all levels and in all policy areas. Without an equal representation of women and men, true democratic local government will not be realised. This commitment came to fruition at Beijing +10 (the ten-year review and appraisal of the Beijing Platform for Acton carried out in 2005), where many of the statements delivered by governments and United Nations agencies highlighted achievements at the local level. Importantly for gender equality, women\u2019s role in politics was prioritized and it was recommended that women\u2019s political participation at the local level becomes an indicator in measuring achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It is indeed our pleasure to share with you this \ufb01 rst ever status report on Women\u2019s Representation in Local Government in the Asia Paci\ufb01 c which aims to deepen the understanding of progress made towards the Millenium Development Goal 3, Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women, by introducing a sub-national measure of women\u2019s political representation. This status report will form a baseline measure of women\u2019s representation in local government in Asia Paci\ufb01 c on a country by country basis, and it is planned to be updated every year until 2015 to support the national, regional and global status assessment and dialogue on the achievement of MDG 3. This status report is a product of the partnership of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM, part of UN Women), United Cities and Local Government Asia Paci\ufb01 c (UCLG ASPAC) and the Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF). The partnership of participating institutions aims to e\ufb00 ectively put the Millennium Declaration commitment on women\u2019s representation in sub-national government on the national, regional and global agenda. It is our hope that this status report will be found as informative and useful document, and would support the achivement of MDG Goal 3, Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women, within the Asia Paci\ufb01 c region.

It uses horizontal bar charts and tables to illustrate a snapshot of this data as of October 2010 and it is planned that the Status Report will be updated every year until 2015 to support the national, regional and global status assessment and dialogue on the achievement of MDG 3. The Status Report is not intended to distil the wider lessons on women\u2019s sub- national political empowerment and what societal, institutional and individual factors limit or empower women\u2019s representation in local government. It is hoped that the Status Report on Women\u2019s Representation in Local Government will be utilized by senior policy-makers, local governments and their associations, advocates, UN agencies and other government and non-government partners to promote women\u2019s political participation in achieving the MDGs and other national and international commitments on gender equality. All data was collected through the United Nations Development Programe (UNDP) Country O\ufb03 ces, the Commenwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) and the United Cities and Local Governments Asia Paci\ufb01 c (UCLG ASPAC). It represents broader e\ufb00 orts by UNDP, the United Nations Development Fund for Women, now part of UN Women (UNIFEM), CLGF and UCLG ASPAC to support policy makers and non-state partners in the Asia Paci\ufb01 c in identifying the links between representation and accountability. In particular it draws on information from the First and Second Edition\u2019s of the Local Democracy Practitioners Guide \u2018Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions (UNDP 2008 and 2010), which present thematic issues on the frameworks for representation in the Asia Paci\ufb01 c with local electoral processes and representation arrangements for councils detailed for 22 countries. v CONTENTS INTRODUCTION 1 What shapes women\u2019s political participation and representation? 3 Institutional constraints 3 Societal constraints 6 REPRESENTATION AT DIFFERENT TIERS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT 7 Women\u2019s Overall Representation 7 Women\u2019s Representation in Rural Councils 9 Women\u2019s Representation in Urban Councils 10 Women\u2019s Representation in Districts/Intermediary Councils 11 Women\u2019s Representation in Provincial and Regional Assemblies 13 Comparison of Women\u2019s Sub-national and National Political Representation 15 Conclusions and Way Forward 17 REFERENCES 19 Annex 1: Data for Women Elected Representatives in Rural Councils as of October 2010: 21 Annex 2: Data for Women Elected Representatives in Urban Councils as of October 2010: 22 Annex 3: Data for Women Elected Representatives in Intermediary/ District Councils as of October 2010 23 Annex 4: Women\u2019s Representation in Provincial and Regional Assemblies as of October 2010 24 Annex 5: Comparison of National vs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67259c29-50f6-4774-b052-dc64dc2286d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "67259c29-50f6-4774-b052-dc64dc2286d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-representation-local-government-asia-pacific-status-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women's Representation in Local Government in Asia-Pacific: Status Report 2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-representation-local-government-asia-pacific-status-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b629091a27f1e5d8077a6ab45625104c2185db728de253462cbbb90c75dbd10f"}, "2": {"node_id": "8585b91a-1066-498d-84d7-83f1f19cbb41", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-representation-local-government-asia-pacific-status-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a622d6c0c9b57cfff210b63cb943758aa421b22b1d4e407245cd119124395d40"}}, "hash": "792a234618e5fc42989aac4cce3c348271a8c389c7347a6bb8dec3cfa1f66c65", "text": "sub-national Women\u2019s Political Representation as of October 2010 25 Annex 6: Summary of Local Electoral Systems for Councils in the Asia-Paci\ufb01 c Region 26 Annex 7: Direct/Indirect Methods of Representation 27 Annex 8: Examples of Measures for Quotas in the Asia Paci\ufb01 c 35 vi ABBREVIATIONS APHDR Asia Paci\ufb01 c Human Development Report BPfA Beijing Platform for Action CEDAW Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women CLGF Commonwealth Local Government Forum FPTP First past the post ICCPR International Covenant on Civil and Poltical Rights LG Local Government MDGs Millennium Development Goals PR Proportional Representation UCLG ASPAC United Cities and Local Governments Asia Paci\ufb01 c UNDP United Nations Development Programme UNIFEM United Nations Development Fund for Women 1 INTRODUCTION M ore Asia Paci\ufb01 c countries than ever before have elected local governments and national parliaments.

MDG 3 supports the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA) which in 1995 also commited governments to advance the goals of equality, development and peace for all women around the world, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Agaisnt Women (CEDAW) which states in Article 7 that: \u201cStates Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the political and public life of the country and, in particular, shall ensure to women, on equal terms with men, the right: (a) To vote in all elections and public referenda and to be eligible for election to all publicly elected bodies; (b) To participate in the formulation of government policy and the implementation thereof and to hold public of ce and perform all public functions at all levels of government; (c) To participate in non-governmental organizations and associations concerned with the public and political life of the country\u201d1 It is CEDAW that provides the norms and standards for MDG 3\u2019s time-bound and measurable targets which are accompanied by indicators for monitoring progress and informing national development strategies. For this goal the indicator with direct relevance to ensuring equitable political participation is indictaor 3.3 which monitors progress through the proportion of seats held by women in national parliament. While the MDGs are necessarily limited in scope, the focus for this indicator at the national level ignores three major aspects of the quest to ensure that women have, on equal terms, the right to be eligible for election to all publicly elected bodies: (1) The barriers to women\u2019s participation and the patterns of actual representation at sub-national government tiers are in most countries very di\ufb00 erent from those surrounding national parliaments. In addition the barriers across di\ufb00 erent levels of sub-national government can vary depending on whether they are urban, rural, intermediary or provincial. 1 Convention on Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ cedaw.htm 2 (2) For most people in Asia and the Paci\ufb01 c, local governments are far more important arenas for matters having a direct impact on their livelihoods than national parliaments, especially when local governments are responsible for the delivery of key services; (3) Depending on the country, sub-national governments are the political arenas where the majority of women are likely to have greater numerical opportunities to compete. For example, if you combine these positions across the Paci\ufb01 c only (excluding the French Territories) there are over 7000 positions. By not measuring the percentage of women represented in sub-national governments with any MDG target, national strategies risk ignoring one of the most important arenas for women\u2019s political participation. As part of the Millennium Project, the Task Force on Education and Gender Equality has identi\ufb01 ed increasing women\u2019s share of seats in national and local government bodies, as one of the seven strategic priorities needed to achieve MDG 3 on gender equality2. To this end, the Task Force proposed the inclusion of an indicator (additional to the numbers of women in national parliament) on the percentage of seats held by women in local government bodies. 2 http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/reports/tf_gender. htm The local governments, through their national associations and global umbrella body, have expressed their commitment to the development, promotion and support of gender equality. The International Union of Local Authorities (IULA) sets out its Worldwide Declaration on Women in Local Government3. It is on this basis that the \ufb01 rst ever status report on Women\u2019s Representation in Local Government in the Asia Pacif c4 has been developed. This will contribute to the monitoring of the achievement of MDG 3 with the objective of deepening the understanding of the progress made towards goals set within the Millennium Declaration at all levels of government and all other commitments on gender equality, including international human rights obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) CEDAW and BPfA. 3 http://www.iula-int.org/iula/policies/women.asp 4 Whereas the \ufb01 rst will capture all sub-national levels (i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4db2385d-3a64-44cd-ac6f-fe2b72b6e532": {"__data__": {"id_": "4db2385d-3a64-44cd-ac6f-fe2b72b6e532", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-representation-local-government-asia-pacific-status-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women's Representation in Local Government in Asia-Pacific: Status Report 2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-representation-local-government-asia-pacific-status-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7dcc11ae10c6bf093a01bd03c96215491866b4e91a4120232e3aa8159fc3c349"}, "2": {"node_id": "2fbbb597-26f8-4420-b1c3-c928c34cb3e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-representation-local-government-asia-pacific-status-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f8378694296c0987033da983f2c39b2a5a9121ae10c10115d8571ee78e77d85"}}, "hash": "82a0d0c50a30c1ebaac98010d977a87b3437bb29b8af5ee484f4c3872c29aec9", "text": "both local and regional/provincial/state government) the reference to \u2018local government\u2019 will be used. 3 What shapes women\u2019s political participation and representation?

The role both institutional and societal factors play in infl uencing women\u2019s political representation is outlined briefl y below. Institutional constraints Institutional factors refer to the laws and various formal arrangements that guide the mechanics of governance and political participation. Institutional factors that limit representative participation include the type of electoral system and how women\u2019s representation is outlined in a country\u2019s or political party\u2019s constitution or legal framework. This includes the rules and procedures through which candidates are selected or votes are cast in an election, and in turn helps to determine the extent to which local decision-making bodies are genuinely democratic, inclusive and gender-sensitive. Several elements of the institutitonal design have a major impact on women\u2019s opportunities to stand for election and to be elected. Electoral System Comparative research on electoral systems has established that a critical factor for women\u2019s representation is often whether the electoral system has single member constituencies where only one candidate is elected from an electoral unit, or multi member constituencies where several candidates are elected per electoral unit. This distinction corresponds quite well although not perfectly with the distinction between First Past the Post (FPTP)/ simple majority systems of elections and Proportional Representation (PR) systems. Briefl y, in FPTP/simple majority systems the winner is the candidate or party with the most votes and typically there is only a single winner in each electoral unit. In proportional systems the electoral unit is generally larger and the system is designed to ensure that the overall votes for a party or coalition are translated into a corresponding proportion of seats in the legislature. If a party wins 20% of votes, it should get approx 20% of the seats in that electoral unit. All PR systems use multi member districts5. According to worldwide data women have a slightly greater advantage under PR systems rather than under FPTP/simple majority systems. A cross comparative study of 24 established democracies conducted by International IDEA shows that there has been substantial and consistent divergence 5 Matland, R.E. (2005) \u201cEnhancing Women\u2019s Political Participation: Legislative Recruitment and Electoral Systems\u201d in Women in Parliament: Beyond Numbers, 2nd edition (ed.) Azza Karam and Julie Ballington, Stockholm, Sweden: IDEA Publishing. 4 in women\u2019s representation across electoral systems since the 1970s. According to this study, by 2004, the percentage of women in national legislatures in countries using a simple majority system was 18.24%, whereas in countries using a PR system it was 27.49%. Although this status report does not speci\ufb01 cally investigate this issue at a sub- national level it is assumed that the processes associated with PR and FPTP electoral systems result in similar results at a sub-national level. Annex 6 details electoral systems in place in the Asia Paci\ufb01 c. Direct vs. Indirect Elections A direct election is a term describing a system of choosing political o\ufb03 ce holders in which the voters directly cast ballots for the person, persons or political party that they desire to see elected. An indirect election is a process in which voters in an election do not actually choose between candidates for an o\ufb03 ce but rather elect persons who will then make the choice. Members of councils above the lowest tier can be directly elected or indirectly elected from among the ranks of members at lower levels. Whether or not direct elections are held for all levels of Local Government (LG) varies from country to country. In South Asia they are held in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh (direct election of Upazila Parishads re-enacted in January 2009). In Pakistan the higher levels of local administration are indirectly elected through an Electoral College system, with lower-level council members constituting the Electoral College. Indirect systems are in many countries regarded as an extension of the traditional interface between village leaders and government at higher levels. In societies where men have traditionally dominated local council\u2019s indirect elections for higher level councils would likely perpetuate the same pattern of gender-biased political participation. In Southeast Asia upper-level LG councils are generally made up of directly elected members. Such is the case for both Indonesia and Viet Nam.

Foremost among their reasons is that politics is reputed to be dirty, where methods employed include the illegal and the unethical to win in elections and assume power, and where the corruption of public service for personal and narrow group interests has been the accepted norm. They say that they are intimidated and threatened by these dark sides of politics which they are likely to be pressured to join as their entrance fee into mainstream politics.6 In line with this, one of the main obstacles to women\u2019s representation is found in the process of candidate selection in political parties. Women \ufb01 nd it more di\ufb03 cult to be nominated as candidates in political parties 6 Miranda, R.L.T. (2005) Impact of Women\u2019s Participation in Decision-making http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/ egm/eql-men/docs/EP.7_rev.pdf 5 that are traditionally dominated by men. Without special measures to encourage women candidates the number of women enlisted as candidates by political parties is likely to be smaller than the number of men. This can be seen in Indonesia, where despite the requirement by law for political parties to nominate 30 percent of their candidates as women, lack of enforcement means many political parties do not ful\ufb01 ll their obligation. It also explains that while a PR electoral system can in many cases result in higher representation of women, it will depend on the position of women within the political parties. In addition women\u2019s caucus or secretariats are one form of organization within political parties that can work to advocate for increased representation of women in politics. Political parties that have an internal organization of women that is well coordinated, and which are able to mobilize resources, should be better equipped to respond to women\u2019s demands and promote women\u2019s political participation and representation. Quotas Quota\u2019s for women entail that women must constitute a certain number or percentage of the members of a body whether it is a candidate list, a parliamentary assembly, committee or government. Quotas aim at increasing women\u2019s representation in publicly elected or appointed institutions such as governments, parliaments and local councils. Quotas change the structure of representation by placing the onus on those who control the election/recruitment process to fast-track women\u2019s entry into politics. The two most common types of electoral gender quotas are candidate quotas and reserved seats. Candidate quotas specify the minimum percentage of candidates for election that must be women. They can be a legal requirement as outlined in the constitution or electoral laws or they can be voluntarily adopted by political parties. Reserved seats set aside a certain number of seats for women among representatives in a legislature. Reserved seats can be further demarcated by whether women are elected to the reserved seat, or whether they are appointed. Thus we delineate between three types of quota systems:7 1. Reserved seats (constitutional and/or legislative) 2. Legal candidate quotas (constitutional and/or legislative) 3. Political party quotas (voluntary) In general, research shows that the countries that have the highest number of women in governments are the ones that implemented some kind of a\ufb03 rmative action measures, such as gender quotas (e.g. in India 33% of all seats in local bodies are reserved for women). Only about a third of Asia-Paci\ufb01 c countries have some kind of gender quota system for women\u2019s political representation. In countries without quotas, women\u2019s representation in national parliaments is around 14 percent, rising to 20.4 percent in countries with quota systems in place.8 This Status Report further illustrates that the same pattern occurs in sub-national governments. Countries with sub-national quotas such as Bangladesh, Paksitan and India all have higher women\u2019s political participation than countries without 7 See also www.quotaproject.org 8 UNDP (2010) \u2018Power, Voice and Rights: A Turning Point for Gender Equality in Asia and the Paci\ufb01 c\u2019.

Even in countries with high levels of women\u2019s labor force participation women are still not expected to take part in decision making processes. In the Paci\ufb01 c, which has one of the lowest percentages of women in national politics in the world, customary notions about women\u2019s role in society may be the biggest impediment to their political participation. In some patriarchal societies, for example in Fiji, women are still considered the property of their fathers and husbands and they do not have access to customary title, chiefl y or noble systems which are entry points for political participation.9 In Sri Lankia the disappointing proportion of women elected to provincial councils in 2008 and 2009 (4.1 percent) 9 UNDP (2010) \u2018Power, Voice and Rights: A Turning Point for Gender Equality in Asia and the Paci\ufb01 c\u2019.

Gender stereotypes in the media also contribute to the deteriorating status of women. Some women\u2019s organizations are addressing this issue as part of an overall drive to increase women\u2019s involvement in decision making by providing voters education, capacity building of women\u2019s candidates and advocating the value of di\ufb00 erent leadership styles and behavior in politics. Development leads to a number of societal changes that empower women. For example, development generally leads to greater education and labour force participation for women, better health, decreased fertility rates, increased urbanization, and attitudinal changes in perceptions regarding the appropriate role for women. All these factors increase women\u2019s political resources and reduce existing barriers to political activity. But while development is an important factor especially in terms of the economic empowerment of women, it is no guarantee for women\u2019s political equality as evident in some of the most developed countries in the region where women\u2019s representation lags far behind. For example in Japan 7.56 percent of town and village mayors and councillors and 8.09 percent of prefectural assemblies and governers are women10. 10 Ibid. 7 I n the Asia Paci\ufb01 c Region the following countries all have elected sub-national government at one or more levels: Afgha nistan; Australia; Bangladesh; Cambodia; Cook Islands; China; India, Indonesia; Iran, Japan; Kiribati; Mongolia; New Zealand; Pakistan; Papua New Guinea; the Philippines; Republic of Korea; Solomon Islands; Thailand; Tonga; Tuvalu; Vanuatu; and Vietnam. As can be seen by this list not every country in the region has elected sub-national governments. In the Asia Paci\ufb01 c Region Bhutan, Laos PDR, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, Samoa and Timor-Leste either do not have formal elected subnational representatives or are in the process of establishing local governments. In addition Fiji has a mandate for locally elected representatives but elected local councils were suspended by the current government in 2009 and replaced by a government administrator. The Status Report does not include data on the Provincial Assemblies in Pakistan and the State Governments in India \u2013 the highest tier of sub-national government within the federal structure in those two countries.

In addition reliable disaggregated data was not able to be sourced for Iran and Papua New Guinea. These countries have thus been left out of the Status Report. Women\u2019s Overall Representation Representation of women in politics at the national level has made slight progress since commitments were made by most governments at the Fourth World Conference on Women at Beijing in 1995 to achieve an international target of 30 percent. Then only global representation of women in parliament was around 11 percent, while in 2009 that number had shifted to 18.4 percent.

While the overall picture of the data is that more emphasis needs to be placed on having women elected to local representative and leadership positions, the noticeable lack of data from a number of countries also illustrate that more accurate disaggregated data needs to be collected for women\u2019s local political representation. Women\u2019s Representation in Urban Councils Graph 3 below shows women\u2019s seats in countries with elected urban councils. Afghanistan, Cook Islands, New Zealand, Tuvalu and Vanuatu do not have elected urban councils.

In Viet Nam cities are identical to provinces, and so they are recorded with the Regional and Provincial Assembly data. A quick analysis of the countries with the highest levels of women\u2019s representation in urban councils (China 48.2 percent, Australia 24.65 percent, Bangladesh 28.4 percent and the Republic of Korea 21.78 percent) reveals a mix of a\ufb03 rmative action policies and level of development, with the Republic of Korea and Australia both listed as high-income countires according to the World Bank\u2019s list of economies as of September 2010. While Bangladesh has quotas, in the Republic of Korea political parties have to submit a list of candidates to the electoral commission with more than half of the candidates being female. Additionally the Australian Labor Party imposes a voluntary quota of 40 percent women and 40 percent men on candidate lists. Aside from replicating the positive a\ufb00 ect of a\ufb03 rmative action policies illustrated in the data on rural councils, the overall picture on urban councils illustrates that developed countries appear more likely to have higher women\u2019s representation in urban councils regardless of o\ufb03 cial quotas. Aside from Bangladesh the six countries with the highest levels of women\u2019s representation in urban councils are either high or middle- income countries with a mixture of quota/ non-quota systems. In relation to women heads and chairs of urban councils, apart from Australia (21.6 percent) and the Philippines (20.5 percent) women are unlikely of being elected into these leadership positions. Bangladesh has only 1.37 percent of women elected to these positions while non-quota countries such as Japan (1.24 percent) and Thailand (6.7 percent) also have low proportions of women leaders at this level of government. The main purpose for analysing data at this level of sub-national government separately is to understand if the proportion of representation di\ufb00 ered to that of rural councils where there might be more barriers to women\u2019s political political participation. In other words if women fare marked better competing for seats in an urban setting. However a lack of accurate disaggregated data where local councils exist means it is di\ufb03 cult to get an overall picture of the di\ufb00 erences in representation between urban and rural councils. Only eight countries report statistics on women\u2019s representation in urban councils, while only seven report statistics for the number of women elected as chairs or heads of the councils. Further work needs to be conducted to ensure that where locally elected urban and rural councils exist; accurate data is kept so women\u2019s low political representation at the local level can be more adequately addressed.

As the same system is used for national and subnational elections it is also di\ufb03 cult to highlight any institutional factors that might shed light on this discrepancy.

As Pakistan has quotas it is unwise to make broader implications from Cambodia\u2019s (12.65 percent) system for electing intermediary/ district councillors and its impact on women\u2019s representation even if signi\ufb01 cantly below most other countries. However women\u2019s representation as chairs or heads of councils is even worse than at rural and urban levels. Pakistan has the highest rate at 4.5 percent while the lowest recorded rate of just 0.42 percent can be attributed to Bangladesh. In Cambodia council chiefs are elected on the basis of being the top candidate for that party placing and are thus not directly elected. The chairs and heads in Pakistan and Mongolia are also indirectly elected by council members or representatives. However simply introducing a direct system of election for chairs and heads may not improve the overall level of representation as Bangladesh has directly elected positions and also the lowest level of women\u2019s representation for these positions. Women\u2019s Representation in Provincial and Regional Assemblies Graph 5 below shows women\u2019s represention at provincial, regional or state level. For this category the following countries are not included since they do not have elected assemblies at this tier: Bangladesh; China; Cook Islands; Kiribati; Pakistan; Tonga; and Tuvalu. Provincial and Regional Assemblies are the highest tier of sub-national government, and out of the countries in the Asia Paci\ufb01 c with this level of representation Afghanistan (30 percent), Australia (27.8 percent), India (37 percent), New Zealand (29.4 percent) and Vietnam (23.88 percent) have the highest level of women\u2019s representation. All \ufb01 ve have directly elected representatives but Afghanistan and India are the only two countries out of the \ufb01 ve with a legislated quota for women\u2019s representation. Other countries with directly elected provincial and regional assemblies such as Thailand, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Sri Lanka, Mongolia and Indonesia all have varying rates of women\u2019s representation. Vanuatu has the lowest level of women\u2019s representation with no women elected. Compared to the other levels of sub- national government, provincial and regional assemblies have more examples of heads and chairs of the elected bodies being women. Afghanistan has 15 percent, with the elected councillors (of which a quarter must be women) voting for the chair. However, apart from the Philippines (19.8 percent) and New Zealand (16 percent) women leadership positions in elected sub-national bodies still languishes below 10 percent with the Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka and Indonesia having zero women being elected as heads of chairs of provincial and regional assemblies. Consistent with the data from the other levels of sub-national representation, while women are able to achieve some level of representation in elected bodies their chances of being selected as a chair or head of one of these bodies is much slimmer. 14 Graph 5: Percentage of women representatives and heads/chairs of councils in Provincial and Regional Assemblies as of October 2010 * Data not available for Women Elected Representatives % + Data not available for Women Chairs/Heads of Councils % N.B.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63f882d8-9b44-44a7-bbfe-d7bccc0bde77": {"__data__": {"id_": "63f882d8-9b44-44a7-bbfe-d7bccc0bde77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-representation-local-government-asia-pacific-status-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women's Representation in Local Government in Asia-Pacific: Status Report 2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-representation-local-government-asia-pacific-status-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee03a0a34d6b19722109c55f8389b48397cd86a0e0508caeeab894ad9b61773d"}, "2": {"node_id": "122feba8-ece0-4f1d-8be3-e25be049ac91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-representation-local-government-asia-pacific-status-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d485b5f225ff1213ee9fc5bc964ab4b0a09b473645d1b189d2805ed37c3e0ff1"}}, "hash": "a1bc007cfa8a087fbfa3b7ba7431e8fdcb0dfd1621005ee6e6d684a27165e1e8", "text": "Although no data was provided for India one-third of the total number of o\ufb03 ces of chairperson in the Panchayats in some States are reserved for women India+ Afghanistan New Zealand Australia+ Vietnam Mongolia Republic of Korea Indonesia Thailand Cambodia+ Japan Sri Lanka Solomon Islands+ Philippines* Vanuatu+ 0 10 20 30 40 Women Elected Representatives (%) Women Chairs/ Heads of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f6b67fa-fbb5-4032-a9d8-6870acef15fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f6b67fa-fbb5-4032-a9d8-6870acef15fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-representation-local-government-asia-pacific-status-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women's Representation in Local Government in Asia-Pacific: Status Report 2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-representation-local-government-asia-pacific-status-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9b411164e51e492b9d2e961706ac9e4013d0ca5721bc9efb2b0c0c93f1a2e7b"}, "3": {"node_id": "76bd7ff1-9973-4a35-bb72-6c93756cb6f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-representation-local-government-asia-pacific-status-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dbf973114a6f1fbfaac797d605b59c63b21527e5a363259bb27cafb604376ac4"}}, "hash": "2455014f3ca158b292b9d68d12860d8e66a02e2dc6dd30c266d1f9f04171b7c6", "text": "Councils (%) 15 Comparison of Women\u2019s Sub-national and National Political Representation Graph 6 illustrates a comparison of the average total number of women represented in local government against the national level percentage of women represented in parliament for countries in the Asia Paci\ufb01 c. Total sub-national representation was calculated by averaging the percentage of women represented across the di\ufb00 erent levels of sub-national government. Only countries that supplied data for sub-national representation were included in this graph What we see in the graph are a number of di\ufb00 erent patterns. The \ufb01 rst is that there are a number of countries that do not have a signif cant di\ufb00 erence between their level of women\u2019s representation at the national and the average sub-national levels (eg Japan, Australia, Thailand and China). This is despite the di\ufb00 erent electoral systems and accountability networks that citizens are likely to have with representatives at the local level. Generally it seems that despite the di\ufb00 erences between national and sub-national elected bodies other factors are contributing to a stable representation of women across all levels of government. However, while the average \ufb01 gures in these countries compare, each level of local government does not necessarily. The second is that there are another set of countries where there is higher sub-national women\u2019s representation than national. In Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Mongolia there is a higher representation of women in politics at the sub-national level. In India the quota of 30 percent of seats reserved for women at the sub-national level seems to have had a strong e\ufb00 ect in increasing women\u2019s representation at the sub-national level (37 percent compared to 10.8 percent at the national). Similar a\ufb03 rmative action measures at the sub-national level in Pakistan and Bangladesh (at the Pourashava/ Municipality and City Corporation) clearly illustrate the bene\ufb01 ts to women\u2019s political representation of this approach. Interestingly Mongolia has no a\ufb03 rmative action measures in place, but clearly there appears to be more political space for women at the sub-national level (22.3 percent) compared to the national (3.9 percent). 16 Graph 6: Comparison of women\u2019s sub-national and national political representation as of October 2010 * Data not available for Sub-national Women Elected Representatives % + Data not available for National Women Elected Representatives % N.B.

For example in Tuvalu, women constituted 8.3 percent of elected members at the Kaupule or council level whereas there were no women elected at the national level in 2008. In the Paci\ufb01 c elections at the local level o\ufb00 er a greater number of opportunities for women simply because of the greater number of elected bodies and positions. If you combine these positions across the region (excluding the French Territories) there are over 7000 positions (or over 900 excluding PNG). And third, Cambodia is one of only a handful of countries (New Zealand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Sri Lanka) with higher representation at the national (21.1 percent) compared to the sub-national level (12.37 percent). While national level representatives are directly elected, the only form of the three levels of sub-national representation elected directly is the lowest level (commune). From there indirect elections elect the next two tiers of sub-national government and woman representatives are lowest at these two levels.

Further work should investigate the a\ufb00 ect of development and in particular urbanization on women\u2019s participation. While this report attempted to illustrate the di\ufb00 erence between urban and rural councils there was a noticeable lack of data from a number of countries that made the task di\ufb03 cult. Greater e\ufb00 orts need to be made by all countries, especially those identi\ufb01 ed in this status report as not having sub-national sex disaggregated data, to ensure accurate statistics are recorded to inform policy makers on where speci\ufb01 c attention needs to be paid to boost women\u2019s political participation. All of this also points at the important role of political parties as actors that can ensure progress; in some countries (e.g. Cambodia) political parties are actively exploring options for increasing both the numbers and rank of women. 18 In terms of future Status Reports there are two further sets of data that could help strengthen the understanding of what is needed to increase women\u2019s political participation at the sub-national level. This Status Report originally set out to capture the number and percentages of women candidates at the sub-national level but not enough data was collected to warrant inclusion in this report. Collection and analysis of this information would be useful in identifying how the number of women candidates plays out in actual seats. Additionally the report aimed to collect data on the breakdown of women elected through a\ufb03 rmative action measures and those elected without a\ufb03 rmative action assistance. Again a lack of data meant this could not be included in this Status Report, but building on the \ufb01 nding that quota\u2019s appear to be the number one way to increase women\u2019s political representation at the sub-national level future analysis of this would help to give a deeper understanding. Finally, this report did not cover local councils which are not formal local governments (e.g. the Suco councils in Timor Lese and local councils in Bhutan). Future studies could look further at women\u2019s representation in these bodies, and how informal systems /structures of local decision making are used, and could be used, for greater women\u2019s participation in local government. This Status Report will hopefully take important steps in enabling countries in Asia Paci\ufb01 c to monitor progress, better advocate for greater representation and decide on the action needed for women to be at the table when decisions are made in local governments. 19 REFERENCES This Guide has made extensive use of a considerable body of documentation, some of which is acknowledged in the text.

The crisis compounds the recent shock from high food and fuel prices. The region has a very short window of opportunity (due to lag time in the transmission of global impacts to the Pacific) to prepare by readjusting fiscal and monetary policy, creating an enabling environment in which alternative livelihood opportunities can be found, establishing early warning and response tracking systems, and developing immediate and longer-term social protection (safety net) policy responses. \u2022 It is essential to maintain, and where possible increase, the collection of data (disaggregated by sex and age when feasible) to closely monitor the effects of the crisis on children and women in the Pacific. An early warning system\u2014a Pacific Hardship Alert\u2014linked to the proposed Global Impact and Vulnerability Alert System could be a medium-term consideration. \u2022 Investing in children and women is not only a moral imperative; it also brings positive benefits to economies and societies. Governments in the Pacific must not stray from their commitments to children and women in this time of crisis. They must take all necessary measures to enhance the role of women as economic agents and to protect social sector budgets, especially to maintain and, if warranted, expand essential social services for children and women (health, education, HIV prevention, and protection from abuse, violence and exploitation). Donors should maintain their aid commitments to the Pacific in this time of crisis and must ensure investments benefit those most in need. \u2022 A new set of policy options including formal social protection (safety net) mechanisms such as school feeding programs, cash and in-kind transfers to the most vulnerable, and workfare programs (targeting youth and women in particular) should be considered in the response to the current crisis, to aid recovery of any lost economic and social development, and to lessen the impact of future crises. Keep human beings at the centre. Start with children. Economics must serve human ends not dominate them. Investing in people, children first and foremost, is the way to build our collective future.

Unless the crisis is responded to effectively, Pacific Island countries on track to meet their development goals could fall behind, while those that are struggling to advance could be left even worse off. The impact of the current crisis will depend on a variety of factors and will vary between different countries. Nevertheless, children and women in many Pacific Island countries are likely to be among those most severely affected, and those already most vulnerable will face the greatest impacts. Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises is very much a work-in-progress. This first edition examines some of the known and potential impacts on Pacific Island children and women of the 2008 food price rise crisis and the current economic crisis. It also highlights some of the crucial lessons learned from previous crises. Governments and development partners need a better understanding of how this current crisis is affecting the most vulnerable populations across the Pacific. This first edition describes an approach to social impact monitoring that can provide real-time vulnerability data to inform and guide policy decisions and that compliments macro-economic data currently monitored with assistance from the Asian Development Bank. If such an approach proves useful, it could be transformed into an early warning system\u2014a Pacific Hardship Alert System\u2014with links to the Global Impact and Vulnerability Alert System (GIVAS) now being developed under the direction of the United Nations Secretary-General. Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises concludes by suggesting a range of policy options to help children and women including how to achieve better returns on investment from social sector spending as well as how to strengthen existing and initiate new social protection programs. Short-term measures to mitigate the negative consequences of the current crisis are indeed urgent, but the authors also highlight that such shocks are likely to become an increasingly common feature of the global economic landscape. It makes sense then that policies to protect vulnerable families and children from such shocks should be central to national development strategies. Indeed this document argues that now is a critical time for even stronger government investment in social interventions such as micronutrient supplements for children, micronutrient fortification of food, deworming and other nutrition programs at school, increasing and improving girls\u2019 schooling, and expanding and maintaining rural water supply, to name but a few. Delivered alongside well-designed social protection programs that directly involve cash or in-kind transfers to vulnerable groups, these social investments can actually boost economic growth and improve its pro-poor quality.

The Government of Vanuatu and the United Nations together with regional partners are convening a high- level conference in Port Vila in February 2010 to focus attention on the human face of the economic crisis. The conference will consider the latest information on social and economic impacts in the Pacific, policy responses initiated and future actions needed, and call for national and international commitments to protect the most vulnerable in the short- and long-term. Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises is offered as one initial contribution by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and the United Nations Development Program towards this urgent action agenda. Knut Ostby Resident Coordinator\u2014United Nations Resident Representative\u2014UNDP Fiji Multi-Country Office Fiji Islands A Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance iv n an increasingly uncertain world, the right policy choices can be a very smart investment. Beneath this global economic crisis lies a global humanitarian crisis in which the future of Pacific Island children and women hangs in the balance. The right policies can go a long way toward protecting them now and in the future. By contrast, inaction or the wrong policies could actually worsen their situation. Failure to protect the most vulnerable in the Pacific, or choosing the wrong policies to do so, will result in not only a large increase in levels of poverty and hardship but also a protracted period of lower economic growth, even greater hardship, and increasing levels of vulnerability to future shocks. UNICEF is working with Pacific Island governments and development partners to progressively realize children\u2019s rights in accordance with national development strategies, the United Nations Development Assistance Framework, the Millennium Development Goals, the Millennium Declaration, and A World Fit for Children goals. UNICEF Pacific\u2019s strategic vision involves bringing the child dimension to Pacific regional policy debates, emphasizing children\u2019s rights within Pacific regional strategies, and assuring the realization of key results at scale for children. The global economic crisis reaffirms the importance of placing children at the centre of economic and social development. Through this first edition of Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises, UNICEF in collaboration with a range of development partners, in particular the United Nations Development Program, makes an urgent call for governments to heed the lessons learned from past crises and to draw upon the wealth of accumulated evidence that clearly demonstrates investments in children and women can make a solid contribution to equitable economic growth. As the authors point out, Pacific Island governments can use this crisis to jump-start a new development paradigm, one in which expenditure on children and women is at the heart of more inclusive and sustainable economic growth in the region. We thank the United Nations Development Program and the many other individuals and agencies who have contributed and continue to provide information to this important work-in-progress aimed at helping to protect Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises. UNDP is working with Pacific Islands countries to maintain and scale up investment to confront not only the short term threats of the global economic crisis including poverty and unemployment but also to advance longer-term development including expanding food security and social protection, developing state capacity to administer effective responses, adapting to climate change, and building essential and \u2018green\u2019 infrastructure. We have urgently organized an integrated advisory team and are reallocating resources to address increasing demand from partners for UNDP support and advice. UNDP, through its Regional Centre in Colombo, is currently involved in the conduct of a major study on the impacts of the crisis across 16 Asia-Pacific countries. For the Pacific, poverty analysis work in Kiribati, Samoa and Tuvalu being undertaken by the UNDP Pacific Centre will contribute to the outcome of this study. UNDP is also working closely with UNICEF and other UN agencies to assist Pacific Island governments to establish real-time social impact monitoring and will be a major contributor to the high-level regional conference planned for February 2010 with the Government of Vanuatu. We are delighted to have worked with UNICEF on this first edition of Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises and will continue to engage actively in subsequent updates, analysis and ongoing policy advice.

It is informed and continues to be informed by many people and information sources. This first edition offers a rapid synopsis of the food price rise and global economic crises together with their known and potential impacts on children and women including lessons learned from previous crises. It also offers guidance on real-time monitoring to better understand the situation of children and women in the Pacific and suggests policy options to help protect them including how to achieve better returns on investment from social sector spending as well as how to strengthen existing and initiate new social protection programs. Country-specific action is needed in response to the global economic crisis. This working Edition is intended to help national and regional partners better understand and actively respond to the impacts of the global economic crisis on some 1 million children and half a million women in the Pacific (excluding Timor-Leste Papua New Guinea, and the Pacific Island Territories). Our focus is the protection of children\u2019s physical and social well-being and how the crisis may be used as an opportunity to expand access to quality health, education, child protection and other key services in the Pacific to safeguard gains already made and to accelerate progress toward National and Millennium Development Goals for children. We leave room for other agencies to expand upon the situation analysis and policy guidance presented here to protect and assist Pacific Island women. The document acknowledges the impacts on and policy options for finance, trade, agriculture, food security, energy, climate change, and employment, but expanded discussion on these issues can be found in other relevant documents, many of which are referenced in footnotes. We expect to build on this work over the coming months as we learn more. Further documentation will contribute to future revisions of this document, policy decision-making and action. The Edition is divided into three Parts: Part 1: The current crises and their broad impacts across the globe and in the Pacific Part 2: The human face of financial, economic and food crises Part 3: Real-time monitoring and Policy Action for children and women in the Pacific Part 1 summarizes the broad impact of the food price rise and global economic crises to date across the globe and in the Pacific. We surmise that: Across the globe \u2022 Prospects for an early recovery are unlikely, forcing countries to prepare for a prolonged downturn in trade, investment and employment. The risks of a long and deep recession or even a depression cannot be excluded. \u2022 The crisis has hit in a series of waves. The first wave brought the global financial system to the brink of collapse. A second wave hit emerging economies causing reductions in credit, trade, foreign direct investment, remittances, and employment, and likely reductions in aid. A third wave is now hitting the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable countries already suffering from the shock of high food and fuel prices. \u2022 Further waves are likely to hit long into the future including a return to high commodity prices, deeper gender inequities, decreased food security, a prolonged labour market recession, the persistence of poverty effects, and the intergenerational transmission of poverty. \u2022 Beneath this global financial crisis lies a global humanitarian crisis or, as the World Bank describes it, a \u201cDevelopment Emergency\u201d with catastrophic implications if we fail to respond effectively. Across the Pacific \u2022 In the Pacific, only Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea and possibly Vanuatu will continue to sustain positive economic growth while other Pacific economies will slow down or contract. \u2022 It is possible that the full impact of the global economic crisis has not yet been felt in the Pacific. On the positive side, this gives countries a small window of opportunity to put together more thoughtful and effective policies. On the negative side, this means that the impacts may be even larger in 2010 than in 2009. Even if the global economy picks up in the second half of 2010, as the most recent forecasts suggest, lags mean that economic conditions will be tough in the Pacific in 2010 and it may take until 2011 for the Pacific economies to fully recover. P Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance vi \u2022 The transmission channels of the crisis to the Pacific are broadly similar to other parts of the world (reductions in exports, remittances, etc.).

The close association with the economies of Australia and New Zealand also means that downturns in these two countries will negatively affect several Pacific Island economies. \u2022 There are substantial levels of poverty and hardship in the Pacific with one in four households and almost one-in-three of the population already below the respective national poverty lines. Early indications are that levels of poverty are set to increase due to the economic crisis and other factors specific to particular countries. \u2022 Those most likely to experience the greatest degrees of hardship and poverty will be: (i) the young, (ii) the old, (iii) people living with disabilities, (iv) those who had no source of regular income, or (v) those with no access to adequate land on which to grow food for consumption and/or sale. Households headed by women and the elderly will be very vulnerable and children in female-headed households are likely to be especially disadvantaged. \u2022 The economic crisis might also create new categories of those facing hardship and poverty including: the urban poor who rely on purchasing their food; small-holder and subsistence farmers; front-line workers if their salaries are either reduced or not adjusted to keep up with higher commodity prices; low-skilled workers, internal-migrants, and immigrants; communities or groups who have been excluded from access to productive resources, decent work and social security, or displaced due to environmental degradation, disasters, or discriminatory land-use policies. Part 2 examines the impacts that previous financial and economic crises have had on children and women. It also considers the known and potential impacts of the current crisis on Pacific children and women (including last year\u2019s food and fuel price rise crises). We observe: The central lesson \u2022 In every previous economic crisis it is the poorest people in developing countries who suffer the most and not enough is done to help them. They are forced to respond with measures that keep them poor and lower future income-earning potential, resulting in persistent poverty. Likely impacts on Pacific Island children \u2022 Around 18,000 children under five years of age still die every year in the Pacific region (13,000 in Papua New Guinea, 2,500 in Timor-Leste, and 2,500 in the Pacific Island countries)\u201450 deaths a day; one death every 30 minutes. Four out of five of these children are under one year of age. Unless reversed, the economic crisis could result in an increase of between 400 to 800 Pacific Island child deaths annually\u2014two more deaths every day than is currently the case. By 2015, an additional 5,600 Pacific children under five could have died if the crisis persists; this equates to about the same number of all reported child deaths in all natural disasters occurring in the Pacific since 1950 (excluding Timor-Leste). Globally, girl children are more at risk in economic crises. \u2022 More Pacific Island children will become more malnourished, with long-lasting consequences. Malnutrition including micronutrient deficiencies is already common across the Pacific and changes in household food consumption patterns brought about by the economic crisis may increase these problems. Despite traditional subsistence agriculture, many Pacific Island countries and households already face food insecurities which will be exacerbated if the crisis decreases abilities to purchase food. There are high levels of national dependence on food imports and high proportions of household income spent on food, even in rural areas. For children in poor households, reducing consumption from already low levels, even for a short period, can have important and sometimes permanent cognitive, motor, social-emotional, educational and economic repercussions across the life-course. \u2022 Government health expenditures will likely decline in real per capita terms. Even where health is prioritized within the overall budget, real health spending per capita may still fall. The demand on public services will increase at a time when funding for such services will diminish. Where health insurance schemes exist, households may no longer be able to afford health insurance or may become ineligible. Where private health care systems exist, users may switch from the private system to the public health sector as their ability to pay for health services is impacted. The quality of health care will likely diminish. Overall, patients will likely defer care completely or only attend when the situation becomes critical, exacerbating child and maternal mortality. \u2022 The gains in education made by Pacific Island countries are now under threat. More Pacific Island children may not enroll, drop out of school or experience declines in the quality of education. If education budgets decline, teacher salaries may", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb1801e4-8738-480d-bd73-fd9978858c98": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb1801e4-8738-480d-bd73-fd9978858c98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19070d33885c3b9937135d15a9b10013897378fff2259b6c5b3da7f63e54262d"}}, "hash": "19070d33885c3b9937135d15a9b10013897378fff2259b6c5b3da7f63e54262d", "text": "be delayed and public money for new school Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance vii buildings, school repairs and school inputs such as teaching supplies may be greatly reduced compromising quality. Where students incur some direct schooling costs, however small, poorer students may be pressed to forego schooling to earn income or to substitute for adult home production. Large youth populations combined with school drop-outs already make youth employment a major concern for this sub-region with the crisis only set to increase levels of youth unemployment. If enrollments and learning levels deteriorate during the crisis, Pacific Island countries may lose a competitive head-start when the global economy recovers. There are also sinister long-term impacts of deteriorating education outcomes affecting future economic growth. \u2022 Abuse and exploitation of and violence against women and children, while difficult to measure, rise under conditions of economic stress. Evidence of severe forms of child labour are scarce and there are reportedly few street children in the Pacific, but the current crisis could propel children from school into the labour force (especially boys) or to shoulder more household tasks (especially girls). Child workers already make up an estimated 19% of the labour force in Papua New Guinea and 14% in Solomon Islands. Recent research across a range of Pacific Island countries suggest various forms of child abuse, violence and exploitation exist alongside significant levels of sexual violence against children. There is also evidence that parental neglect of children is on the rise. There is a significant danger that hidden impacts\u2014hazardous work, increases in violence and decreases in nurture, care and emotional wellbeing\u2014may not be addressed, owing to their invisibility. \u2022 The global crisis may adversely affect HIV and AIDS prevention programs in the Pacific with the most adverse effect on prevention efforts among high risk groups\u2014most at risk and especially vulnerable adolescents, sex workers, military personnel, maritime workers, and men who have sex with men (MSM). Likely impacts on Pacific Island women \u2022 More Pacific Island women will die in childbirth. Maternal mortality is already a serious concern across the Pacific. Universal access to high quality obstetric care at birth must be accelerated if maternal mortality is not to worsen. \u2022 The impact of the crisis will be felt by both men and women, but not necessarily in the same manner. Empirical data on the impacts of financial crises on women is limited but evidence to hand indicate women are more vulnerable. Across Asia, job losses in labour-intensive manufacturing industries such as textiles and apparels, leather products, and electronics are affecting women more than men. The main casualty so far is the \u201cflexible\u201d labour force\u2014low-skill, temporary, casual workers\u2014in which women constitute the majority of the workers. Gender inequality remains an issue within labour markets globally and the current economic crisis has again exposed the depth and breadth of this inequality. Mounting evidence shows that gender inequality leads to major losses in economic efficiency and human development. \u2022 Access to micro-credit schemes may diminish, further compromising women\u2019s businesses and their ability to cope during difficult times. \u2022 During difficult times, families often rely on women to take care of the sick, elderly and the extended family, even when women are already engaged in paid-work. Overwhelmingly, women will bear the brunt of the crisis. Part 3 promotes a framework for real-time monitoring of the social impacts of the economic crisis in Pacific Island countries and outlines immediate action that can be taken in the health, education, and social welfare sectors. It concludes by considering social protection to aid recovery and to mitigate the impacts of future crises on Pacific Island children and women. We stress that: \u2022 If ever there was a time for Pacific Island governments to improve their leadership, governance, and resource management, it is now. Only by putting in place measures that raise the levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of public services, will governments be able to pursue policies that adequately protect children and women. \u2022 While each country must pursue a policy framework relevant to its own context, the broad regional focus will likely need to be at least threefold: maintain macro-economic fundamentals; protect social budgeting and budget for social protection; and undertake strategic long-term investments in physical and human capital. \u2022 Although there are a number of countries that could take action alone to overcome the worst of the crisis, no one country can comprehensively address and recover from this economic downturn on its own.

Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance viii \u2022 There is a clear need for policy prioritization. Given the limited resources to formulate and then implement improved public policy as well as the diversities across the Pacific, existing crisis- response and recovery policies can be made more child- and women-focused. Identifying and monitoring the vulnerable \u2022 While it is important that all governments protect budgets for children and women, and that donors maintain their Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) commitments, ODA will be most effective if it is focused on countries which face the greatest vulnerability. Based on a combination of indicators, should the crisis response be ineffective, it is probable that a large number of children and women in Solomon Islands and Kiribati are likely to face extreme challenges. Many children and women in the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji Islands, the Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu are also likely to face substantial challenges should responses be ineffectual. Some children and women in Cook Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau and Tokelau will also be at further risk if crisis responses are unsuccessful. (Analysis on Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste is not included). \u2022 Governments and development partners in the Pacific are making crisis response decisions based on a fragmented, patchwork of information. Investment needs to be made in better early warning poverty and vulnerability data systems for rapid release of quantitative and qualitative indications of the impacts of the crisis on poor people. The first purpose of real-time social impact monitoring should be to identify the most vulnerable children and women before they are exposed to further risks that will affect their well-being. The second purpose should be that monitoring leads to just-in- time policy formulation and program action followed by timely feedback to policy-makers. A monitoring framework (see Annex 1) is proposed to help identify adverse changes happening at the community level with a focus on the most susceptible groups across health, food and nutrition, education, and other social dimensions. \u2022 In several Pacific Island countries, there are networks of volunteers, committees and community- based groups in many of the poorest communities that could be mobilized to provide community vigilance of children, women and families at risk. Routine visits by government staff could be used to monitor families at risk. Where resources and capacities allow, crisis hotlines or other novel reporting mechanisms (e.g., SMS, email) could be established if considered useful. \u2022 Monitoring social expenditures (inclusive of health, education, and welfare) will be vital. A simple measure would be to benchmark the overall annual budget\u2019s strategic intent as regards social expenditure\u2014to \u201cincrease\u201d, \u201cmaintain\u201d or \u201creduce social spending\u201d. \u2022 Just as there have been calls for an early warning system for the economy at the International Monetary Fund, an early-warning system\u2014a Pacific Hardship Alert System (linked to the proposed Global Impact and Vulnerability Alert System (GIVAS))\u2014could be considered to provide real-time data so that governments can act in time to make a real difference for children and women. The objective of a Pacific Hardship Alert System could be to provide early indications of how an external shock, like the current economic crisis, is affecting the economic, social and political welfare of the most marginalized populations and countries within the Pacific. By analyzing both exposure and resilience of Pacific Island populations to the changing environment, the Pacific Hardship Alert System might also have the capability to signal emerging vulnerabilities. To maintain such a system within the Pacific will require resources and collaboration between organizations with complementary fields of expertise but start-up resources have already been mobilized and collaboration has already commenced. Protect social budgeting for children \u2022 International organizations, donors, and national governments need to work together to ensure that recommendations for dealing with the economic crisis do not include, or result in, reduced spending on child priorities (such as basic health care, nutrition, child protection, clean water, education, social protection schemes). Governments have at least three options as regards social budgeting during the current crisis: \u201cincrease\u201d, \u201cmaintain\u201d or \u201creduce social expenditure\u201d. \u2022 Increasing investments in children is a bold, innovative move. This crisis presents an opportunity for Pacific Island countries to address long-standing barriers to progress for children.

Fourteen out of the 30 directly relate to children and women: micronutrient supplements for children (vitamin A and zinc); micronutrient fortification (iron and salt iodization); expanded immunization coverage for children; deworming and other nutrition programs at school; lowering the price of schooling; increasing and improving girls\u2019 schooling; community\u2010based nutrition promotion; providing support for women\u2019s reproductive role; malaria prevention and treatment; rural water supply; conditional cash transfers; HIV combination prevention; total sanitation campaign; and microfinance. It is essential also to focus on other major irreversabilities: if children are subject to neglect or violence and/or pushed into work, they live with the consequences for their whole life, sometimes passing the consequences onto their own children. Promoting a protective environment for children through improved legislation, strengthened social welfare services and justice systems, and societal behaviour change is fundamental. Many Pacific Island countries have policies and mechanisms that are delivering some if not most of these programs and interventions. The question is whether these efforts can be expanded or reinforced to cope with the effects of recession in varying contexts and with scarce resources. If they can, these responses are good for children and for development\u2014they yield high returns in terms of containing current and future poverty\u2014and should be enacted quickly. o Second, the resources needed for scaling up interventions for children are moderate. For example, UNICEF, the World Bank and UNESCO estimate that for no more than $2,200 per child, we could not only save a young child from death, but we could also help him or her complete basic education by the age of 13, with better earnings accruing to families in the long-term and large benefits to society as a whole. o Third, investing in children to help them realize their full human potential in times of economic growth and in times of crisis is a moral imperative. Access to health care, education, water, sanitation, nutrition, protection from violence and abuse, is an entitlement in its own right. \u2022 Maintaining social sector budgets is a steady, pro-child move. Programs that support and protect children through basic health care and nutrition, clean water, basic education and child protection services should be maintained to avoid planting the seeds of poverty for future generations. Efforts to maintain government social expenditure as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or as a proportion of total government expenditure, do not guarantee that pro-poor services will be protected. The focus should be to help finance a specific set of services for the poorest and vulnerable people, protect expenditures on a per capita basis and in real terms, and where possible, fund existing, well-targeted and sustainable social protection programs. \u2022 Reducing social expenditure is a conservative but potentially reformative move. The crisis may create opportunities to initiate and lock in reforms that will improve the performance of the public sector over the long term. Most Pacific economies can locate expenditures or revenue leakages in their budget that can be cut back and allocated to better uses or where better returns on investments can be made. Rationing decisions may be unavoidable but inadequately analyzed reductions in public spending on social infrastructure and services are likely to hurt poor households and children most. Ministries need to identify and agree on core areas, services and activities to be fully protected. Greater efficiency should be seen as a stimulus for smarter, more effective ways of working, not as another word for \u201ccuts\u201d. Focus on girls and women \u2022 Restricting women\u2019s access to work, education and health services, especially in times of crisis, comes at significant economic costs. Among the greatest gender challenges in the Pacific are the low percentage of women in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector and the low representation of women in decision-making, especially at political level. The crisis calls for creative solutions to address gender gaps. Sound gender-based policies are more important than ever when resources are scarcer. \u2022 Macro-economic policy calibration and analysis assumes that policies are gender-neutral but they are usually gender-blind. Policy responses which build on women\u2019s roles as economic agents and their preference for investing resources in child well-being can go a long way towards mitigating the negative effects of the current and future economic crises.

Providing free lunch at school for children and special nutritional packages for pregnant women will go a long way in improving their health. Mobile clinics in remote areas and community-based emergency transport could drastically reduce maternal and infant deaths. Educating girls yields some of the highest returns of all development investments. Micro- credit schemes are a lifeline for women and need special protection. \u2022 There remains a huge untapped labour potential of women and efforts must be made to provide every woman with the opportunity of decent employment. Fiscal stimulus packages as well as labour and trade policies need to be engendered. Large public infrastructure and public work projects are common features in all stimulus packages and should incorporate gender dimensions. It is important to look at the effect of trade liberalization through the prism of gender, focusing on its effects on overall growth, labour markets, and access to credit. Appropriate gender-sensitive financial incentives and regulatory frameworks are also needed to support both agricultural development and renewable energy goals. \u2022 This is also an appropriate time to increase the ratification and improve the application of international instruments regarding gender discrimination such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the four key ILO gender equality Conventions. Budget for social protection \u2022 Pacific Island countries are well known for their informal, community or family-based systems of social support and reciprocity. Pacific communities have developed resilience to adversity through such systems. Traditional safety nets, however, can break down when confronted by a large external shock. Some researchers suggest these support mechanisms in the Pacific are indeed weakening in the face of the crisis, especially amongst the urban poor. Remittances from family members living overseas\u2014a major part of informal social protection\u2014are also declining. Even if informal safety nets were not being damaged, their important existence should not stall earnest consideration of establishing state-run social protection systems and urgent efforts to improve those formal programs that already exist. \u2022 It is now generally agreed that formal social protection\u2014broadly defined as a set of policy initiatives that transfer income or assets to the poor, protecting vulnerable people against livelihood shocks, and seeking to enhance the social status and rights of the marginalized\u2014is an essential element of pro-poor growth. Several robust evaluations have demonstrated that if well designed, social protection plays a crucial role in alleviating social hardship. \u2022 Faced by the economic crisis, climate change impacts including decreasing food security, and the threat that high food and commodity prices may return, perhaps the question is not whether the Pacific can afford to support social protection initiatives; rather whether the region can afford not to? Social protection must be a priority consideration in this current crisis; the more severe the downturn, the greater the consideration. It is crucial to note that social protection policies have emerged as core elements of long-term poverty reduction strategies, rather than ad hoc crisis-driven initiatives. \u2022 There is a wide range of available social protection instruments from which governments can choose depending on their administrative capacity, resource availabilities, and target populations including: conditional or unconditional cash transfers, direct distribution of food or nutritional supplements, school- based feeding programs, childcare support, maternal/paternal benefit payments, disability allowance, education bursaries, fee waivers, pensions, unemployment benefits, price subsidies, agricultural inputs, public works programs, health insurance, asset insurance, life insurance, and microfinance. \u2022 Ideally, social protection should be in place before a crisis occurs since it can address the needs of the poor in good economic times and be adaptable to combat the effects of crisis, but there are examples where countries have used a crisis as an entry point to initiate social protection. \u2022 Existing social protection programs that target the structurally poor (i.e., those poor before the economic crisis) do not always have a clear mechanism to deal with the \u201cnew poor\u201d (i.e., those near poor pushed into poverty by the economic crisis). It is important that social protection programs remain responsive to changes in the need for assistance. \u2022 Establishing social protection programs can depend on the relative priority given to social sector", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe44b17f-7fb4-4b53-af73-de62eb6e7b23": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe44b17f-7fb4-4b53-af73-de62eb6e7b23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "24095bb6f04879ed5933f56289ee39ee60df8a5820c318da290a399deea11aea"}, "3": {"node_id": "d6c3b541-3a72-47df-98e4-2dfa177bc6b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d43fdf2c1a09ab47cb16e4092dbdb131797b7e7183616ae24a1bfcf2f7f416f2"}}, "hash": "63535173e6fd915530d2452682b65b360a112d0a0becb4e352d003d74ef07412", "text": "programming in general and the extent to which poverty is recognized and identified as a priority concern. Starting and sustaining social protection programs is a highly contextual process where ideas, ideology and politics may matter more than data. \u2022 The Pacific region does have some experience with formal social protection programs. The Asian Development Bank has developed a Social Protection Index (SPI) and recently assessed eight Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance xi Pacific Island countries to determine their SPI.1 The Pacific Island country with the highest SPI in the ADB study is Cook Islands; the lowest is Papua New Guinea. The ADB has classified Cook Islands in an \u201cabove average category\u201d (alongside Asian countries such as Azerbaijan, Kazahkstan, and Mongolia). Nauru, Marshall Islands and Tuvalu are placed in an \u201caverage\u201d category (together with Asian countries such as Bangladesh, China and Malaysia). Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu and PNG are considered in a \u201cbelow average\u201d category (which also features Asian countries such as Cambodia, Nepal, and Philippines). \u2022 Pacific Island countries may want to consider initiating or reforming existing social protection programs Ways to improve aspects of existing social protection in Pacific Island countries, especially in response to the crisis, include: (i) increase the quality of existing formal social protection programs and especially improve social protection access to and specific expenditures on the poor; (ii) reduce fragmentation of social protection programs; (iii) better understand and, where possible, strengthen traditional social safety nets; (iv) strengthen policy coordination and coherence across several sectors to avoid piecemeal and reactive responses; (v) improve coordination between governments, the private sector, civil society and other development partners to ensure linkage between policies that, for example, stabilize commodity prices, provide for basic health services, help people find decent work, and keep children in education; (vi) increase public knowledge of entitlements to increase uptake through information campaigns and partnerships between government, NGOs and community-based or religious structures. \u2022 Where adequate social protection programs exist then their coverage should be expanded and their targeting improved in the short term through the adoption of simple targeting methods focusing, for example, on: (i) geographic characteristics; (ii) family size and housing conditions; and (iii) categories of the most vulnerable populations such as those living with disabilities and elderly living alone. \u2022 The departure point for many Pacific Island countries, however, will likely be from a weak or non- existent social protection system. Where political leadership is strong, the current economic crisis provides an opportunity to create formal social protection from scratch. \u2022 If starting from scratch and depending on national and sub-national administrative capacities and resources, some social protection schemes to consider are: In-kind Transfers (e.g., therapeutic foods, long-lasting insecticidal bed-nets, etc.), School Feeding Programs, Poll Transfers (targeted or untargeted), Conditional Cash Transfers (targeted or untargeted), and Workfare Programs (for young people in particular). Single schemes such as these, even if well designed and managed, are most effective when part of a comprehensive and transformative social protection system. Basic social services must also be improved where they are weak, legislation that promotes children\u2019s and women\u2019s rights must be strengthened where these rights are denied or compromised, and societal attitudes and practices must be changed where they are harmful to children and women. Just getting started may require Pacific Islands with weak or no formal social protection programs to adopt a phased approach, perhaps starting with a Workfare or social transfer program (cash or in-kind), and bringing further schemes on stream when real-time monitoring indicates and the situation allows. \u2022 Too much haste may lead to poorly designed social protection programs that may become a drain on fiscal positions and can give rise to \u201cpoverty traps\u201d when people are encouraged to \u201cstay poor\u201d by the availability of assistance. Nevertheless, the success of Indonesia\u2019s National Safety Net Program demonstrates that it is possible for governments to rapidly launch a massive social protection response in a crisis and improve it as the program proceeds. \u2022 There is a strong case to be made for children to be put at the centre of formal social protection systems. Reaching the most vulnerable children will be critical in the effectiveness of policies to break the cycle of poverty.

A number of principles can be applied to make formal social protection more child-centred, including: (i) avoid adverse impacts on children, and reduce or mitigate social risks that directly affect children\u2019s lives; (ii) intervene as early as possible where children are at risk, in order to prevent irreversible impairment or harm to children; (iii) consider the age and gender specific risks 1 The SPI is a combination of expenditure on social protection (% of GDP spent on social protection activities); the combined percentage coverage of seven target populations (the unemployed/under-employed, the elderly, the sick, the poor, people living with disabilities, and children with special needs) who receive some social protection; a poverty targeting rate (the % of the poor in a country who receive some social protection transfers or other social protection benefits); and the amount of social protection expenditure going to the poor (derived by applying the poverty targeting rates to the total expenditure on each social protection program). Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance xii and vulnerabilities of children throughout the life-cycle; (iv) mitigate the effects of shocks, exclusion and poverty on families, recognizing that families raising children need support to ensure equal opportunity; (v) make special provision to reach children who are particularly vulnerable and excluded, including children without parental care, and who are marginalized within their families or communities due to their gender, disability, ethnicity, HIV and AIDS or other factors; (vi) consider the mechanisms and intra-household dynamics that may affect how children are reached, with particular attention paid to the special circumstances of women; (vii) since the most at-risk children usually live outside family care, make social protection systems responsive to this vulnerable group as well as to children facing abuse or discrimination at home; and (viii) include the voices and opinions of children and young people themselves in the understanding, design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of social protection programs. \u2022 Integrating child protection mechanisms into social protection packages at a time of crisis is vital. Possible synergies include: (i) integrating child protection issues (e.g. no tolerance of child labour) into cash transfer conditionalities; (ii) using interactions with program beneficiaries to raise awareness about child protection vulnerabilities; (iii) supporting the development of a single registry system so that the well-being outcomes of children receiving transfers can be better monitored and supported by cross-agency services; and (iv) linking child abuse referral systems to the implementing office of cash transfers or workfare programs. \u2022 Governments must focus on macro-economic fundamentals to create fiscal space to fund social protection. Establishing new or expanding existing social protection programs may also be an area where donors can provide valuable support. Tax-based social protection may become a viable option for Pacific Island countries to pursue in the longer-term. The World Bank\u2019s decision to launch a new Vulnerability Finance Facility to help mobilize more funding to protect the poorest is welcome. The budgetary cost of establishing permanent social protection programs need not be very high and could well bring longer-term efficiency gains to the economy. A recent ADB study showed that eight Pacific Island countries currently spend around 4.5% of their GDP on social protection but have scope to become far more cost-effective. Cost-benefit analyses also reveal that social protection programs could actually pay for themselves. \u2022 Although short-term measures to mitigate negative consequences of the crisis are urgent, a longer- term perspective is also important in order to make Pacific Island nations more resilient in the future. The current global economic crisis is not the only risk facing the region\u2014notably there is the ever present risk of natural disasters. Periods of stability are the exception rather than the rule and we can expect aggregate shocks to be an increasingly common feature of the global economic landscape. Recent experience in some Asian countries has shown that a social protection system can mitigate the impacts of crises by means of automatic stabilizers\u2014measures of support that automatically increase during times of crises or increased household vulnerability. \u2022 Policies to protect vulnerable families and children from shocks should be central rather than merely palliative, ad hoc, and peripheral to development strategies. Increases in national expenditure on the social sector and social protection in particular do not impede economic growth. On the contrary, if strong government investment is made in high return interventions alongside well-designed social protection programs, this investment can boost economic growth and improve its pro-poor quality.

For such countries, aid-led response packages will play a critical role in avoiding severe hardship. However, effective assistance requires more than just cash; stronger national capacities for aid management are also essential as are donor commitments to the principles of the Paris, Pacific, and Accra aid coordination agenda. Within such an aid environment, there is a real danger that children\u2019s rights to survival, development and protection will become less visible. In entering into new aid packages (loans, grants, etc.), Pacific Island countries must ensure that they continue to prioritize the basic services that their children and women need. The international development community must come forward and offer technical and financial assistance to ensure that the best interests of the child and women are protected. The European Union\u2019s linking of human rights, including child rights protection to preferential trade status agreements, is a possible model of good practice to ensure that children\u2019s rights are sufficiently prioritized in aid packages. Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance xiii \u2022 The role of community-based and civil society organizations and the private sector, as service providers and advocates, comes to the fore particularly at times of crisis. Governments should recognize this role and use the assets they provide to the full. Final remarks \u2022 The negative impact of the global economic crisis on Pacific Island children and women is not inevitable. A strong policy response may not avoid all the negative consequences, but it can mitigate the impact. The future of Pacific Island countries depends critically on whether and to what extent children, young people and women are protected from adverse shocks and human capital is strengthened. Social budgeting and social protection need serious rethinking not just in light of the present crisis but also to prepare for future aggregate shocks which are sure to come. \u2022 This year marks the 20th anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The survival, protection and development of all Pacific Island children and their potential to lead quality lives ultimately depend on us prioritising their needs and ensuring that the environment can sustain their basic human rights as they grow to adulthood. We respond energetically and passionately to natural disasters that take young Pacific lives. We are now confronted by an economic tsunami that could claim just as many if not more children\u2019s lives as well as cause irreparable damage to the social fabric of Pacific Islands for years to come. The future of Pacific Island children and women hangs in the balance. We must place them at the centre of our concerns. Pacific Island governments can use this crisis to jump-start a new development paradigm, one in which social expenditure on children and women is at the heart of a more inclusive and sustainable pattern of economic growth in the region. Unquestionable evidence exists that investing in children and women is very, very smart economics.

A once in a century economic tsunami. This downturn is unlike any seen for generations in its speed, scale, scope, global transmission mechanisms, and the uncertainty it has created. The world economy as a whole is forecast to contract for the first time since the Second World War.2 The Governor of the Bank of England has described this as the greatest financial crisis since the First World War.3 According to the International Monetary Fund, global growth rates could gradually recover in 2010 (up to 3%) but not to the same level observed in 2007. There are large uncertainties attached to any forecasts. Prospects for an early recovery are unlikely, forcing countries to prepare for a prolonged downturn in trade, investment and employment. The risks of a long and deep recession or even a depression cannot be excluded. 1.2. The first wave brought the global financial system to the brink of collapse.

Huge savings of the emerging economies in Asia, Russia and the Middle East had been invested in the West. \u2018Sub-prime\u2019 borrowers in the US started falling behind on their mortgage payments triggering a US housing-sector crisis. Holders of these mortgage-backed securities started to worry about the increased risk of default of hundreds of billions of dollars in \u2018sub-prime\u2019 loans. There was a lack of transparency as to just how exposed individual banks were. Banks announced over a half a trillion dollars of sub-prime and related losses yet it was unclear who would bear the cost of these losses. The failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 led to a collapse in confidence and almost every company or institution pulled out deposits from banks perceived as even marginally at risk. That in turn brought the global financial system to the brink of collapse, sparking the worst global financial crisis for generations. The scale of the assurances made to bank depositors and creditors by the major industrial country governments has no historic parallel. 1.3. A second wave hit emerging economies. Earlier economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s started in developing countries. In the current case, the crisis began in the industrialized world and it is therefore possible that the full effects have yet to be manifest in developing countries. The increasing openness of the global economy that gave rise to recent astonishing growth in East Asia\u2014growth that has helped some 500 million people to lift themselves out of poverty since 1990\u2014now binds these same countries to the downturn.

Indeed, comparatively high growth coupled with the large aggregate size of the region\u2019s economy could make Asia and the Pacific the locus of global growth in 2009. The region is forecast to account for about 115% of global GDP growth in 2009.4 For the first time in modern history, hopes have become largely pinned on developing countries, particularly in Asia, to uphold stability and growth in the world economy. 1.4. On 15 September 2008, the American investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed, triggering an international breakdown in economic confidence, leading to sharp falls in trade, production and investment around the world.5 It was also the day when the crisis truly hit Asia-Pacific shores, spreading beyond its equity markets and posing the greatest threat to the region\u2019s development since the Asian financial crisis of 1997.6 The Asia-Pacific region was better prepared than it was a decade ago, having improved current account balances and built up a protective shield of foreign-exchange reserves. But these improvements were not enough to prevent severe domestic impacts. The global liquidity of the past six years had created rapid credit, asset and investment bubbles which became fragile or burst. Equity markets across emerging economies of Asia experienced sharp declines immediately, and property markets soon followed. Exports orders started to get cancelled, export financing was cut back, and layoff after layoff was announced. In the Republic of Korea, exports fell a year-on-year 32.8 per cent in January 2009. In Japan, the drop in December 2008 was 35 per cent and in Taiwan, Province of China, it was a 2 Global Economic Policies and Prospects\u2014Note by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund.

It has become a near \u201cperfect\u201d symmetric crisis.7 1.6. On the one hand, many developing countries are in a far better fiscal position than they were in earlier crises, and most will continue on a path of economic growth, albeit at a slower rate. 8 Their banks have little, if any, exposure to complex financial instruments. On the other hand, lower income countries are more exposed to the current global downturn than in previous episodes. They are more integrated than before with the world economy through trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), and remittances. 1.7. Reductions in credit, trade, remittances, foreign direct investment, and aid. Those low income countries that had begun to access international financial markets have seen this access come virtually to an end. Foreign lenders may become more reluctant or unable to roll over sovereign and private debt falling due. Domestic banks may be hit by further effects, as the economic downturn increases the number of borrowers unable to repay their loans. The crisis is already impacting and will significantly impact these countries through reduced demand for their exports. Since many are commodity exporters, they will be hard hit by the sharp decline in demand for commodities and in their prices. Remittances often provide a safety net in recipient countries. Income from migrant workers helps stabilise consumption levels when recipient economies contract. But remittances have been falling since 2008.9 There are likely to be fewer economic migrants coming to developed countries in recession, so fewer remittances and probably lower volumes of remittances per migrant. World Bank projections suggest that remittance flows to developing countries will fall in 2009 by approximately 6 percent.10 A sharp slowdown in foreign direct investment is expected in about half of all lower income countries. Prospects for higher aid to offset these effects are particularly uncertain, given budgetary pressures faced by many donor countries. While the promises of increased aid at the Gleneagles summit in 2005 were already off track just three years later, it is predicted that overseas development assistance will further decrease as a result of tightening government budgets.11 Italy has halved its 2009 assistance and Ireland has cut 17 percent from its overseas aid in three reductions since July 2008.12 The Australian, Japanese, and New Zealand Governments, however, recently announced increased aid commitments to the Pacific region. 1.8. Rising unemployment. At the global level, after four years of consecutive declines, the number of unemployed increased in 2008 by 11 million. As the crisis continues to spread and job losses mount, worldwide unemployment could increase by an additional 50 million by the end of this year compared to 2007\u2014the majority of them in developing countries.13 In the absence of income support alternatives, job losers either move back to rural areas or take up informal jobs in the urban economy. On top of job losses, there could be substantial downward pressure on informal-economy wages, which were already on the decline prior to the crisis. This is also likely to lead to a reduction in the number of days worked. Coupled with lowered wages, affected households will have reduced purchasing power, leading to an increase in the proportion of working poor in most developing economies. The bleak labour market picture affects certain groups disproportionately\u2014notably women, migrant workers and youth (we will discuss the impacts on women in Part 2). Youth in particular are facing considerable difficulties entering the labour market. This comes on top of an already fragile situation for youth in both developed and developing countries. Despite the economic expansion in recent years, most economies fell short of creating enough decent and productive jobs for young people.

The lack of decent work opportunities at an early age can permanently compromise young people\u2019s future employment prospects. The dire situation for young workers is even more pronounced in developing countries.14 1.9. A third wave is now hitting the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable countries. Almost 40 percent of developing countries are highly exposed to the poverty effects of the crisis (with both declining growth rates and high poverty levels) and an additional 56 percent of countries are moderately exposed (they face either decelerating growth or higher poverty levels), while less than 10 percent face little risk.15 In high- or low-income countries, however, it is the poor\u2014and those made poor through loss of income or housing\u2014that will be hardest hit. Identifying vulnerable populations is as important as identifying vulnerable countries. After first striking the advanced economies and then emerging markets, a third wave of the global financial crisis has begun to hit the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable countries. This wave threatens to undermine recent economic gains and to undo years of poverty alleviation and hard-won social gains in health and education towards the achievement of the MDGs.16 1.10. For the poor, this is a crisis upon a crisis. The crisis comes on the heels of a major global shock from high food and fuel prices that last year pushed a greater number of people in developing countries to the brink. The hike in oil prices last year pushed around 25 million people into poverty. The food price increases of the last year were estimated to have trapped\u2014at their peak\u2014perhaps as many as 130 million people in poverty, causing as many as 40 million children to suffer malnutrition. It has been estimated that the food price rise between 2005 and early 2008 increased the share of the population of East Asia, the Middle East and South Asia living in extreme poverty by at least 1 percentage point, a setback equivalent to seven years of progress toward meeting the poverty MDG. The impact on the urban poor was particularly acute, increasing by more than 1.5 percentage points in East Asia, the Middle East, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The increase in the number of poor due to the food crisis was only part of the story. Estimates of poverty depth (the gap in comparison between the average poor household and the poverty line) show that poverty is deepening, with the extreme poor hit hardest. Eighty-eight percent of the increase in urban poverty depth from rising food prices is from poor households becoming poorer and only 12 percent from households falling into poverty.17 To try and assess the impact of this crisis on poor households now, researchers in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya and Zambia undertook a rapid appraisal of the impacts in one rural and one urban community in each country. Often, households are still suffering from the large increases in food and fuel prices during 2007/2008. Many have exhausted their assets and are already in a weaker position. Crime, violence and other forms of insecurity and social division also appear to be increasing. Food riots and violent protest occurred in all of the countries. In 2007 and 2008 there were a total of 61 food protests\u201423 of them violent and some of them causing governments to fall.18 When conflict occurs, the costs of violence add a huge economic burden to the affected and neighboring countries. 1.11. The combined effect of the above is that by the end of 2009 some 90 million people will be trapped on less than $2 a day.19 This is on top of the 130-155 million people pushed into poverty in 2008 because of soaring food and fuel prices. World Bank's Year in Review 2008 stressed that the current global recession will undo a 20-year trend of fewer and fewer people living in abject poverty.20 1.12.

Gender inequities may deepen. During the high-growth period following the 1997 crisis, relatively robust employment growth was achieved, but a number of important distributional inequities emerged.21 Employment growth varied considerably within each global sub-region, and within individual countries themselves, large numbers of women remained excluded from the world of work and women' share of income declined in three quarters of 83 countries surveyed by the International Labour Organization.22 1.14. Threats to food security resembling those of recent years are likely to intensify in the medium to long term. A decline in economic growth of between 2 to 3% and a concurrent decline in agricultural investments and productivity could result in much higher food prices in the longer-term and an increase in the number of malnourished children in the world by about 16 million by 2020.23 When agricultural prices drop, farmers may be less inclined to invest for the long-term. Further compounding the risks to future agricultural production are the changes in temperatures and rain patterns that climate change will bring. 1.15. There is also the risk of a prolonged labour market recession. Lessons from past financial crises show that the labour market tends to recover only four to five years after the economic recovery. This is because massive rises in long-term unemployment and greater labour market \u201cinformalization\u201d\u2014 exacerbated by return migrants and large-scale reverse migration from urban to rural areas\u2014are very difficult to reverse. If these trends take root, the negative effects of the current crisis will be long-lasting, thus yielding significant social hardship and depriving the economy of valuable resources. 1.16. Poverty effects may persist. The poor take much longer to recover, as recovery in real wages and employment, especially in the traditional low-wage sectors, take much longer than recovery in GDP. Many districts of Indonesia suffered from persistent poverty effects five years after the 1997 Asian crisis and three years after the country\u2019s rapid recovery in GDP.24 A review of financial crises in 80 countries found that real wages take an average of three years to pick up again. Employment growth does not regain pre-crisis levels for several years after that.25 1.17. Finally, intergenerational transmission of poverty is likely to occur when poor children, lacking nourishment and education due to the impacts of the crisis, grow up to head their own households and face fewer opportunities and the high risk of being in poverty just as their parents did.

Positive economic growth in Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea and possibly Vanuatu will continue but in others growth will slow down or contract. The Pacific saw an historically high rate of economic growth in 2008. Overall growth of 5.1% was led by the commodity-intensive economies of Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste. Overall growth is projected to slow to 3.1% in 2009.29 While country-specific factors are certainly contributing to lower growth forecasts in the Pacific, the global economic crisis is central to a pessimistic outlook now held for 2009 and 2010. In December 2008, the Pacific Department of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) noted that the most vulnerable Pacific economies are those that have weaker macroeconomic fundamentals, high inflation rates, recent rapid credit growth, fragile fiscal and current account positions, a weak export outlook and high public debt levels. It was noted that tourism, remittances and commodity exports are normally an economic strength to the region, but in the face of the rapidly weakening world economy, they are an indicator of economic vulnerability. Individual Pacific economies were assessed based on key indicators of macroeconomic soundness and the dependence on: income from offshore investments; commodity exports; tourism; and remittances; and supplemented by an update of economic conditions in the Pacific economies. This preliminary assessment concluded that: \u2022 Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu were most vulnerable; \u2022 Fiji Islands, Republic of Marshall Islands, Palau, and Tonga were highly vulnerable; \u2022 Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Samoa, and Vanuatu were vulnerable; and \u2022 Papua New Guinea, Nauru, and Timor-Leste were cushioned.30 1.20.

The devaluation of the Fiji dollar will, however, add to inflationary pressures in the Fiji Islands. The overall concern is that slow economic growth or an economic contraction will lead to a reversal of hard-won gains in living standards. 1.21. Downturn could be protracted. It is possible that the full impact of the global economic crisis has not yet been felt in the Pacific. On the positive side, this gives countries a small window of opportunity to put together more thoughtful and effective policies.

Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance 6 decline in economic growth in the world\u2019s major economies is widely expected to be temporary with recovery beginning during the second half of 2010. This would begin to reverse the decline in external demand now impinging on the Pacific. This turnaround does, however, hinge on the success of the large fiscal stimulus packages being implemented in the world\u2019s major economies. It also depends on how quickly they stabilize and restore confidence in their financial systems and get credit flowing again. If the international recovery is delayed, the decline in external demand facing the Pacific will last longer. The transmission mechanism of the global economic crisis to the Pacific Island economies will mainly be through: falls in commodity prices and export earnings from commodities and manufactured items; a heavy reliance on imports of food, fuel and manufactured items subject to volatile exchange rates; declines in tourism receipts as unemployment and uncertainty in source countries discourages people from taking expensive overseas holidays; reductions in the value of remittances from families living overseas who may themselves be experiencing unemployment, and from temporary migrant and contract workers (including seafarers and farm workers) whose jobs may be lost; reductions in income from internationally invested trust and sovereign wealth funds; generally weak fiscal situations which could be exacerbated by revenue losses from slower or negative economic growth; and a reliance on development assistance flows which may be adversely affected as donor countries themselves experience tight fiscal positions. 1.22. Even if the global economy picks up in the second half of 2010, as the most recent forecasts suggest, lags mean that economic conditions will be tough in the Pacific in 2010 and it may take until 2011 for the Pacific economies to fully recover. The lagged impact of external developments and the prospect that the flow through to the Pacific may be even more severe than originally anticipated, mean that ADB\u2019s forecasts may well prove conservative. Importantly, more Pacific economies may contract than forecast. Most 2009 budgets were formulated before the full extent of the global crisis was known, and it is very likely that their revenue forecasts will prove to be overestimates.

Pacific banking systems are stable at present but could be at risk. The banking systems in Pacific Islands fund their lending more through local deposits than through foreign borrowing and thus have had less exposure to the global financial crisis. The banks remain relatively profitable. Nevertheless, there are risks such as the high share of foreign ownership in Pacific banking systems. If the capital of parent banks becomes eroded, they will withdraw capital from subsidiaries overseas (i.e. Pacific banks). Likewise, if borrowers from Pacific Island banks get into difficulty in servicing their debts as the recession takes its toll, the banks\u2019 balance sheets will deteriorate. 1.24. Connections between the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand. Australia survived the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2000 dot com bubble but has not withstood the current economic crisis with its resource-based economy hit hard by the decline in commodity prices and fall in demand. The Australian economy contracted by 0.5% in the last three months of 2008. New Zealand\u2019s economy also shrank 1.1% in the last three months of 2008, the biggest slump in 18 years. New Zealand\u2019s exports of milk and wool fell as their prices plunged 31%. According to ADB Australia, New Zealand and the United States will experience recession in 2009. Their labour markets are continuing to deteriorate. Unemployment has risen to 8.9% in the United States, 5.4% in Australia, and 5.0% in New Zealand.33 Pacific Island countries have deep and extensive relationships with Australia and New Zealand and thus falls in income in Australia and New Zealand will hurt the Pacific through declines in tourism earnings, cuts in skilled migration intakes, and declining remittances (see below). Tourism departures from Australia to the Pacific weakened in early 2009. Departures for the Pacific from New Zealand had noticeably weakened earlier. Departures from the United States and Asia for the Pacific were also down over 2008. Samoa is experiencing job cuts at the Yazaki plant as the automotive market in Australia continues to weaken. 33 ADB (2009) Pacific Economic Monitor. http://www.adb.org/Documents/Reports/PacMonitor/pem-may09.pdf Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance 7 1.25. Declining remittances. Remittances have traditionally been an important source of external funding in the Pacific Islands in view of the small size of the economies. For an increasing number of Pacific Island countries, remittances from both migrant and temporary overseas workers are being seen almost as a panacea for the failure of domestic policies to create investment and employment opportunities in the home countries. But whilst these new opportunities do provide a safety valve they are not without costs in terms of loss of skills and manpower, and other unintended social consequences of absent families and spouses. 1.26. As the economic crisis unfolded, remittances were expected to show resilience to economic changes. In 2000-2001, despite a slowing of economic growth in Australia, New Zealand and the United States, remittances to the Pacific Islands increased. In 2005 and 2006, remittances again remained strong. In addition, there was some hope that seasonal worker schemes between Pacific island countries and Australia and New Zealand would provide a new source of remittances. The United States and New Zealand labour markets, two of the three key sources for Pacific countries, weakened early in 2008 and Australia, the third, has since followed. The deterioration in these three sources suggests that the decline in the real value of remittances to the Pacific seen in 2008 will become more pronounced in 2009.

The suggestion that there might be \u201cpoverty\u201d in some form is therefore something that many have had trouble accepting. The usual images of poverty, i.e., starving children, landless peasants, and men and women toiling with ox ploughs, do not apply to the Pacific. After extensive and often emotion-charged debate, Pacific Island leaders have concluded that poverty does exist in the region but should be equated with hardship and that poverty (or hardship) in the Pacific context means: \u2026an inadequate level of sustainable human development which includes lack of access to basic services, lack of opportunities to participate in the socioeconomic life of the community, and a lack of adequate resources to meet the basic needs of the household and customary obligations to the extended family, community, and church.34 1.28. Poverty in the Pacific Island context thus does not generally mean hunger or destitution, but rather the continuous struggle to meet essential daily/weekly living expenses, particularly those that require cash payments. Increasing monetization means that now even families in the most remote rural or outer island villages have to find cash for everyday needs, be it for school fees, utilities, newly essential store goods, social obligations, or church donations. Where social obligations could once have been met with woven-mats, traditional food, or other home-produced items, now there is an ever-increasing need to make cash or purchased contributions. All these add to the financial burdens on families and consequently to their need for economic opportunities. Families constantly have to make choices between the competing demands for expenditure on food and basic-needs and their limited availability of cash income; trade-offs are made between paying one bill or another, between food or school fees. Households deemed to be experiencing basic needs poverty are therefore facing hardship on a daily basis. They struggle to pay bills, and to purchase adequate and suitably nutritious food. They borrow regularly from \"loan-sharks\" who charge very high rates of interest for small unsecured loans to meet family commitments and community obligations. Many families are thus frequently, and some families are constantly, in debt. 1.29. There are therefore, communities, families and individuals throughout the Pacific now living in hardship despite traditional social support systems.35 Pacific Island countries are not as equitable as they are sometimes portrayed and, in some ways, inequalities within countries have deepened. Traditional support systems and values are being eroded as the trend towards urban and Westernized living 34 Abbott, D. and Pollard, S. (2004) Hardship and Poverty in the Pacific.

Pacific island countries are also facing new and emerging social issues, such as transactional sex work and the rapid spread of HIV and AIDS.38 1.30. Recognizing that poverty is multi-dimensional and that data on household income or expenditures may not always be available to measure poverty, UNDP has developed a Human Poverty Index (HPI) that relies on more readily available indicators of access, opportunity, and quality of life. This index combines the following measures: (a) vulnerability to death at an early age measured by the percent of persons expected to die before the age of 40 years; (b) exclusion from the world of knowledge measured by the percent of adults who are illiterate (e.g. including % of female adults who are illiterate); (c) access to basic services (percent of people without access to safe water and primary education); and (d) food poverty (percent of children 0-5 years of age who are underweight) (Figure 1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18a1b22e-d10c-47ef-ac3a-fd765ea3be9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "18a1b22e-d10c-47ef-ac3a-fd765ea3be9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7596960f4bc4f396f420033bb04dc54ba92dff69a5f46831e5b6a33866c5945c"}, "2": {"node_id": "360767db-97ee-4685-ab8b-6a9482c175d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66dae732b4a8c5fb1e50729058e964bc5451ccc1fe7ac8def9d44fcd1cce9586"}}, "hash": "dd95324057d6252b78e031ba767c41252c7a24cd27c7a6811d073e7f5f61bee0", "text": "Figure 1: Human Poverty Index for Pacific Islands (excluding Timor-Leste) 7.6 4.1 4.4 4.8 (2008 data) 6.3 7.2 9.0 9.2 11.1 12.4 15.0 19.8 22.0 31.3 41.8 0 10 20 30 40 50 Samoa Tonga Niue Cook Is Palau Tokelau Fiji Is Tuvalu FSM Marshall Is Nauru Vanuatu Kiribati Solomon Is PNG Source: UNDP/SPC. 1.31.

While not ideal, quantitative measures such as basic needs poverty lines nevertheless permit an assessment of poverty incidence and change over time. The National Basic Needs Poverty Line is a measure of the minimum income needed to buy sufficient food and meet basic requirements such as housing, clothing, transport, school fees etc. The findings of the participatory assessments of hardship (PAH) undertaken in ten Pacific Island countries by ADB in the early/mid 2000s suggested that a growing number of Pacific islanders were indeed disadvantaged. On average, excluding PNG, it is estimated that one out of five households were unable to meet the costs of food and other basic needs and services that are essential for a minimum standard of living. In the most disadvantaged countries, the proportion is estimated to exceed one in three. 1.32. Poverty-line estimates and analyses undertaken more recently paint a picture of hardship and poverty much more widespread than previously thought. This undermines the long-held view of Pacific countries as places of subsistence affluence.39 Table 1 and Figure 2 summarise the latest data on the countries for which there are estimates of the Basic Needs Poverty Line and poverty incidence.

Poverty in the Pacific and the global economic crisis. The IMF (2009) estimates that every one per cent contraction in developing countries GDP leads to an increase in poverty of two per cent.40 Analysis by the United Nations Development Program Pacific Centre of the region\u2019s household income and expenditure surveys suggest that a 1% decline in real incomes can increase the number of people living below the poverty line by 0.5 percentage points on average. So, if, for example, 30% of the population is living below the poverty line and the global economic crisis then reduces real incomes by 5%, the share of the population below the poverty line could rise to 32.5%. In the worst case, the drop in incomes could force some into poverty traps that turn a short-term shock into a long-term problem. The adverse impacts are likely to fall more heavily on some community groups than others. In particular, UNDP has highlighted the extra vulnerability of households headed by women and the elderly. Children in female-headed households were likely to be especially disadvantaged. 1.35. Let us consider Fiji as an example. The ADB has estimated that there was no growth in aggregate value added in the agriculture sector between 2003 and 2008 and that over the period there was less than 2% aggregate increase in real per capita GDP. Over the same period, inflation increased by a total of about 25%. The recent 2007 census indicated that the labour force comprised just under 600,000 persons, of whom about 55% were economically active. Of the 327,000 who were economically active, extrapolation of the 2004/05 employment survey suggests that only between 35-40% were in formal employment, the rest being farmers or workers in the informal and sectors. There are no published data on industry wage rates since 2004 but given the general state of the economy and the overall low rate of growth, it may be reasonable to assume that the income and wage rates of the lowest income groups (farmers, informal workers and those engaged in the low-paying service personal sectors and manufacturing industries) did not keep pace with inflation. Using this as a basis and assuming that for the lowest income groups there was, say, a 10% loss in real incomes (measured as a 10% rise in the basic needs poverty line with no corresponding increase in income) the estimated change in the levels of poverty incidence between the two major ethnic groups and the urban and rural areas can be summarised in Table 2. Table 2: Estimated Impact on Level of Poverty Incidence of 10% Real Increase in the Basic Needs Poverty Line in Fiji Islands Fijian Households Indian Households Fijian Population Indian Population Urban Rural Urban Rural Urban Rural Urban Rural Estimated poverty incidence in 2002/03 25.5 31.2 29.5 36.0 29.9 37.3 33.9 39.2 Estimated poverty incidence after real 10% increase in BNPL 29.2 36.1 34.4 42.6 33.5 42.3 38.7 46.1 Estimated increase in poverty incidence since 2002/03; % points 3.7 4.9 4.8 6.5 3.6 5.0 4.9 6.9 Source: UNDP Pacific Centre 2009. 1.36. These estimates suggest that rural hardship and poverty has worsened especially for rural Indian households with rural Fijian households also being quite hard hit. On average Fijian households tend to be less affected because they have greater access to own food production. Even in the rural areas Indian households appear to be much more reliant on purchased food than Fijians. From the 2002/03 Household Income Expenditure Survey (HIES) it was estimated that low income rural Fijian households produced almost two-thirds of their own food compared to only about 17.5% for rural Indian households. In urban centres, Fijian households produce about 17% of their own food while urban Indian households produce only 5%. It is clear now that one of the coping strategies for all urban households has been to increase the amount of home gardening that is being done in and around Suva for example. The Fiji Bureau of Statistics are currently conducting a new household income and expenditure survey and this will provide new definitive poverty estimates in due course (probably by the end of the year). 40 IMF (2009) The Implications of the Global Financial Crisis for Low-Income.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "081f4331-1a7c-4663-992d-081883070a10": {"__data__": {"id_": "081f4331-1a7c-4663-992d-081883070a10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b05b9e4ddd6b0d6d90605587f6a994d0e3cda6e6b715ce6050d6bb0cb5d572b"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c71b995-4391-4daf-ad53-351c1df5afba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b47b9881cd2062ebd8646b4f64e3a0173061d48204e0cb158148253839988889"}}, "hash": "285a610e55303ba401b47cc94ad6a64d8451d8f1bf0706661236a9180d693132", "text": "40 IMF (2009) The Implications of the Global Financial Crisis for Low-Income.

Further analysis is needed to determine if the Pacific is following the global trend whereby the extreme poor are hit hardest. As was noted earlier, 88% of the increase in urban poverty depth from rising food prices is from poor households becoming poorer and only 12% from households falling into poverty.42 1.38. We have noted from ADB\u2019s forecasts that only Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu are likely to experience any significant economic growth in 2009 while in other countries, growth will be minimal (Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Republic of Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tuvalu) if not negative (Fiji Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, Samoa, and Tonga). Levels of poverty, incidence of poverty, work poverty, and vulnerability-to-poverty are likely to increase in these 13 countries. Even in the three countries predicted to have positive growth, current levels of poverty may in fact increase unless governments take active measures to ensure economic growth benefits the poor and vulnerable. Rising unemployment, poorer working and living conditions and dissatisfaction with government initiatives to mitigate the crisis could be a trigger for unrest. 1.39. But who are the poor and the vulnerable in the Pacific? During the participatory assessments of hardship undertaken by ADB in the early 2000s, there was almost universal agreement on who would be most likely to experience the greatest degrees of hardship and poverty: (i) the young, (ii) the old, (iii) people living with disabilities, (iv) those who had no source of regular income, or (v) those with no access to adequate land on which to grow food for consumption and/or sale (Box 1). Box 1: People and households likely to experience the greatest hardships in the Pacific \u2022 Unemployed. \u2022 Single mothers and teenage couples without means to raise their children. \u2022 Youth and school dropouts with few prospects for the future. \u2022 Orphans or people without relatives in the community. \u2022 Homeless people or those living with relatives. \u2022 Land-less individuals, families without access to land, or settlers. \u2022 People with large families and/or those supporting relatives. \u2022 Elderly people, especially widows, without regular support. \u2022 People living with disabilities. \u2022 Chronically sick without regular support. \u2022 Prisoners\u2019 dependents and ex-prisoners. 1.40. The current economic crisis, however, might create new categories of those facing hardship and poverty in the Pacific: \u2022 The urban poor who rely on purchasing their food; across the region those in urban areas produce less than one-fifth of their own food needs compared to up to two-thirds to three-quarters in some rural areas. \u2022 Small-holder and subsistence farmers who may still be net food buyers and consumers of essential non-food goods and services, many of whom are women, and who have difficulty getting their produce to markets, but still need cash to meet non-food essentials. \u2022 Formal sector workers (both private and public) including health professionals and teachers, whose salaries may not be adjusted to keep up with higher commodity prices or in the worst cases may actually be reduced as budgets are cut, and who often support extended families; these increases the range of households falling into the category of the working poor. \u2022 Low-skilled workers, internal-migrants and immigrants, especially the untrained, who are among the first to be laid off because they are concentrated in vulnerable sectors, such as construction or tourism, and often hold temporary jobs. \u2022 Communities or groups that have limited or no access to productive resources, decent work and social security such as non-citizens, ethnic minorities and populations displaced due to environmental degradation, disasters, or discriminatory land-use policies. 41 Mahadevan, R.

The risks of a long and deep recession or even a depression cannot be excluded. \u2022 The crisis has hit in a series of waves. The first wave brought the global financial system to the brink of collapse. A second wave hit emerging economies causing reductions in credit, trade, foreign direct investment, remittances, and employment, and likely reductions in aid. A third wave is now hitting the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable countries already suffering from the shock of high food and fuel prices. \u2022 Further waves are likely to hit long into the future including a return to high commodity prices, deeper gender inequities, decreased food security, a prolonged labour market recession, the persistence of poverty effects, and the intergenerational transmission of poverty. \u2022 Beneath this global financial crisis lies a global humanitarian crisis or, as the World Bank describes it, a \u201cDevelopment Emergency\u201d with catastrophic implications if we fail to respond effectively. \u2022 In the Pacific, only Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea and possibly Vanuatu will continue to sustain positive economic growth while other Pacific economies will slow down or contract. \u2022 It is possible that the full impact of the global economic crisis has not yet been felt in the Pacific. On the positive side, this gives countries a small window of opportunity to put together more thoughtful and effective policies. On the negative side, this means that the impacts may be even larger in 2010 than in 2009. Even if the global economy picks up in the second half of 2010, as the most recent forecasts suggest, lags mean that economic conditions will be tough in the Pacific in 2010 and it may take until 2011 for the Pacific economies to fully recover. \u2022 The transmission channels of the crisis to the Pacific are broadly similar to other parts of the world (reductions in exports, remittances, etc.). In addition, countries with trust funds invested in international financial markets have seen the value of their funds drop which will likely reduce income streams to national budgets. The close association with the economies of Australia and New Zealand also means that downturns in these two countries will negatively affect several Pacific Island economies. \u2022 There are substantial levels of poverty and hardship in the Pacific with one in four households and almost one-in-three of the population already below the respective national poverty lines. Early indications are that levels of poverty are set to increase due to the economic crisis and other factors specific to particular countries. \u2022 Those most likely to experience the greatest degrees of hardship and poverty will be: (i) the young, (ii) the old, (iii) people living with disabilities, (iv) those who had no source of regular income, or (v) those with no access to adequate land on which to grow food for consumption and/or sale. Households headed by women and the elderly will be very vulnerable and children in female-headed households are likely to be especially disadvantaged. \u2022 The economic crisis might also create new categories of those facing hardship and poverty including: the urban poor who rely on purchasing their food; small-holder and subsistence farmers; front-line workers if their salaries are either reduced or not adjusted to keep up with higher commodity prices; low-skilled workers, internal-migrants, and immigrants; communities or groups who have been excluded from access to productive resources, decent work and social security, or displaced due to environmental degradation, disasters, or discriminatory land-use policies. 1.42. Pacific Island countries are faced with the need to protect critical growth-enhancing spending, trim low-priority expenditures, ensure fiscal sustainability in the medium, and above all, protect the most vulnerable. Such decisions are made even more difficult given that every source of their development finance\u2014remittances, export and commodity demand, trust funds, aid and capital flows\u2014are now being affected. In Part 2 we examine what impacts previous financial and economic crises have had on children and women. We also consider the known and potential impacts of the current crisis and last year\u2019s food and fuel price rise crises on Pacific children and women.

They are forced to respond with measures that keep them poor: reducing the number and quality of meals, postponing health-related expenditure and withdrawing children from school. These actions lead to lower future income-earning potential for current and future generations, resulting in persistent poverty.

The impact of the current crisis will depend on a variety of factors and will vary between different countries and regions.43 It is clear, however, that children and women in many Pacific Island countries are likely to be amongst those most severely affected, and that those already most vulnerable will face the greatest impact. In order to better monitor the situation of children and women as well as to develop appropriate policy responses, it is important to understand what challenges children and women are experiencing and will likely experience. In Part 2 we examine what impacts previous financial and economic crises have had on children and women. We also examine the known and potential impacts of the current crisis on Pacific children and women (including last year\u2019s food and fuel price rise crises). This discussion is by no means exhaustive but provides an overview of the real and potential impacts children and women of the Pacific are already and will likely confront during the current economic crisis. Likely impacts on Pacific Island children 2.3. More Pacific Island children will die unnecessarily. In countries experiencing significant economic crises, income shocks can have large negative effects on infant mortality: an empirical analysis of 123 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) covering 59 developing countries conducted over the period 1986-2004 has revealed evidence that a one unit decrease in log GDP per capita is associated with an increase in infant mortality of between 17.22 and 44.61 (per 1,000 children born). In other words, a one percent decrease in per capita GDP is associated with an increase in infant mortality of between 0.31 and 0.79 percent.44 For example, as a result of the 1989-90 economic crisis in Peru, infant mortality increased by 2.5%. This implies that approximately 17,000 more children died as a result of the crisis.45 At 43 Cali, M., Massa, I., Willem te Velde, K.

By 2015, this would equate to an additional 2.8 million child deaths.51 Despite steady reductions in child mortality across the Pacific, current figures reveal an aggregate of around 18,000 children under five years of age still die every year in the Pacific region (13,000 in Papua New Guinea, 2,500 in Timor-Leste, and 2,500 in the Pacific Island countries).52,53 This is 50 children a day\u2014one child death every 30 minutes. Four out of five of these children are under one year of age (around 14,400 infant deaths/annum). Global estimations may not translate directly to the Pacific, but if we apply the same IMF predictions, unless reversed the economic crisis could result in an increase of between 400 to 800 Pacific Island child deaths each year\u2014two more deaths every day than is currently the case. By 2015, an additional 5,600 Pacific children under five would have died; excess deaths that can be avoided if we respond effectively to the crisis. To provide some perspective, this equates to about the same number of all reported child deaths in all natural disasters occurring in the Pacific since 1950 (around 11,000 total deaths excluding Timor-Leste).54,55 Each child death and each additional death represent an enormous loss and a step backwards for the Pacific. It should also be noted that globally, girl children are more at risk in economic crises with infant girls experiencing almost three times higher increased mortality than boys for a given change in per capita GDP (Figure 4). 46 Rukumnuaykit, P.

The infant mortality rate is the probability (expressed as a rate per 1,000 live births) of a child born in a specified year dying before reaching the age of one if subject to current age-specific mortality rates. 2.6. Increased child mortality during an economic crisis are brought about by a variety of factors including lower household incomes (i.e. resulting from loss of jobs, asset depletion, tighter credit conditions, etc.) and thus lower spending and investments benefiting children especially nutrition; and second, through more limited access to public services due to tightening government budgets and social spending. We will examine both factors before considering other impacts on children. 2.7. More Pacific Island children will become more malnourished, with long-lasting consequences.

There are significant differences across countries, with import dependency ranging from 36% in Kiribati to over 80% in Palau. These figures represent import dependency at the national level but significant differences exist within countries, especially between urban centres and rural areas. For example, food import dependency in South Tarawa is estimated at around 61% whereas at national level it is around 36%. Similarly, for Federated States of Micronesia food import dependency is over 50% in Pohnpei and Kosrae compared to less than 20% in Yap. 2.12. A key factor in food security is the ability of countries to pay for the food they import. Factors that influence this are export earnings (including tourism earnings), levels of debt service payments, and remittances\u2014as we noted in Part 1, all these factors are currently threatened by the global economic crisis. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has developed the Food Import Capability Index (FICI) as an indicator of the vulnerability. The FICI measures the proportion of food imports to total exports. Any country with a FICI above 0.5 is considered vulnerable in terms of food security, while a country with a FICI above 1 (the value of food imports exceeds the value of exports) is considered highly vulnerable (Table 4). Table 4: Food import capacity indicators (FICIs) for selected Pacific Island countries 1990\u20132001 Average FICI over decade FICI plus Food security vulnerability assessment Cook Islands 1.84 - Extremely high Fiji Islands 0.17 0.15 Low Kiribati 1.56 - Extremely high Niue 1.32 - Extremely high PNG 0.12 0.14 Extremely low Samoa 2.59 0.46 Moderate Solomon Islands 0.15 0.12 Low Tonga 1.10 - High Tuvalu 5.48 - Extremely high Vanuatu 0.46 0.18 Low Source: SPC/MOAF 2/WP 1, 25 August 2008. 2.13. Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Solomon Islands, with average FICIs of 0.12, 0.15 and 0.17 respectively, are among the group of least vulnerable countries in the Pacific. This standing is likely to have changed Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance 18 for Fiji with the erosion of sugar trade preferences with the European Union. Services and remittances also contribute to food security and the ability to pay for food imports. On the other hand, the servicing of foreign debt reduces a country\u2019s ability to purchase food. These factors are included to create the FICI \u2018plus\u2019 indicator for the same period as the FAO data (also shown in Table 4). Vanuatu moves from a rating of moderate to low. Samoa moves from a rating of \u2018extremely high food security vulnerability\u2019 (FICI = 2.59) to \u2018moderate food security vulnerability\u2019 (FICI plus = 0.46). This change demonstrates the critical role of remittances in Samoa\u2019s food security. In the case of Tonga, remittances are even more important. 2.14. While there are downward trends of food prices compared to highs reached mid-2008, many Pacific Island countries are still experiencing higher prices than two years ago and much higher than in 2002 when prices started to rise. The situation in many developing countries is still precarious.64 Unstable or high food prices clearly accentuate the vulnerabilities of the poor, both urban and rural, with their purchasing power seriously eroded, leading to deterioration in the quantity and quality of food consumed and to other negative coping actions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e884a8c9-6d86-419f-8059-10761d5b331c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e884a8c9-6d86-419f-8059-10761d5b331c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea4ba33800f5b131eb157e62f54e342861efd506f9504ecad2f955b01a494dbd"}, "2": {"node_id": "fab26946-b7d8-4a96-b168-ef2ce47d18b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db19ec061de44c6896532961a5b7ac49e6f28e9a2ae7e876f6de41c71ec2cf7f"}}, "hash": "990814e7eb327eb205c2b0c68ae38ac04a426b3d23b08dc9fa84d675fc007b6a", "text": "Analysis conducted by the UNDP Pacific Centre revealed that almost 50% of household expenditure among low income households goes on food, even in rural areas.65 As food prices increase or as household purchasing powers decrease, a number of scenarios may unfold including: households divert expenditure away from such items as school fees and health care towards food; and/or households consume less food, less frequently; and/or households turn to cheaper, less nutritious products (if these are available); and/or households increase subsistence food production (if this is feasible\u2014unlikely in urban areas). 2.15. Bringing experiences in other parts of the world (Box 2) together with Pacific FICIs (Table 4) and household expenditure data, we can anticipate that Pacific Island children\u2019s and women\u2019s nutrition and health will certainly be diminished. The numbers of meals may decrease alongside the quantity of food consumed.

Micronutrients will disappear as diets become more and more restricted. With the existing prevalence of micronutrient deficiency in several Pacific Island countries, noted above, we can assume that many families were consuming poorly balanced diets and perhaps facing chronic food shortages even before the food price rise and the current economic crises. 2.16. For the poor, reducing consumption from already low levels, even for a short period, can have important short-term and long-term consequences. Poor households forced to switch from more expensive to cheaper and less nutritional foodstuffs, or to cut back on total caloric intake altogether, face weight loss and serious malnutrition. Already during 2008, higher food prices may have increased the number of children suffering from permanent cognitive and physical injury due to malnutrition by 44 million. Regardless of recent declines in global food and fuel prices, this represents a tragic loss of human and economic potential.68 A mother\u2019s nutritional status is associated with her child\u2019s nutritional status at time of birth. According to a study in Guatemala, a 100 gram increase in a mother\u2019s weight is linked to a 29 gram increase in her child\u2019s birth weight, after adjusting for the effects of maternal age, gestational age and sex of the infant.69 Maternal malnutrition is linked to low birth weight which is an important risk factor for perinatal mortality and morbidity, and is also associated with poor child nutrition which in turn is strongly associated with stunting, and subsequent impairments in cognitive function, attention capacity, and school performance.70 An infant who is breast-feeding from a mother who is eating less than others in the household will also be unlikely to make up for the impacts of poor nutrition later in life. Under-nutrition\u2014notably foetal and infant under-nutrition\u2014contributes to permanent changes in body structure and metabolism, in turn leading to increased risk of chronic infections and diseases with enormous effects across the life-course.71 64 Joint Meeting of the Executive Boards of UNDP/UNFPA, UNICEF and WFP (2009) Agenda Item 2: Unstable Food Prices and the Linkage to Food and Nutrition Security. 23 and 26 January 2009.

Even where health is prioritized within the overall budget, real health spending per capita may still fall. Past crises have resulted in cuts in expenditures on health, lower utilization of health services, and deterioration of child and maternal nutrition and health outcomes. Evidence from the 1997 crisis in Thailand, Indonesia, and Russia reveals that health budgets were cut during in both real local currency units (LCUs) and at the average US Dollar exchange rate, and that it took many years for health spending to reach pre-crisis levels again. In Argentina (2001 crisis) the health budget was cut and total and public health spending per capita have yet to reach pre-crisis levels in US Dollar terms. There is widespread agreement that, if government budgets come under pressure and household income drops, the demand on public services will increase but at a time when funding for such services will diminish. Where health insurance schemes exist, households may no longer be able to afford health insurance or may become ineligible. Where private health care systems exist, users may switch from the private system to the public health sector as their ability to pay for health services is impacted. Overall, patients will likely defer care completely or only attend when the situation becomes critical, exacerbating child and maternal mortality. Unless public sector services are ensured adequate financial support in these circumstances, quality of care is also likely to deteriorate.81 2.20. In many Pacific Island countries a substantial proportion of government health expenditure goes to pay salaries. Given the difficulty in downsizing the civil service, non-salary expenditures, which are used to pay for drugs and other variable inputs, as well as investments, may decline substantially and impact the quality of health care. In several Pacific Island countries, a large portion of the health budget is also spent on overseas medical treatment schemes or domestic dialysis programs which tend to favour the very few at the expense of the many who are not able to get better primary care. Currency depreciations will also likely increase the price of health-related commodities such as food, pharmaceuticals and medical devices and diminish the ability of Pacific Island governments to pay for these imports.

Box 4: Painful lessons from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis Stringent reforms were put in place to revive the financial sector and achieve macroeconomic stability. The most painful, perhaps, was the inability to fully address the social consequences of the crisis. The lack of experience in the Asia-Pacific region in handling a crisis of this magnitude, the unexpected nature of the crisis and the weakened macroeconomic fundamentals led to hasten and reactionary rescue packages. These packages largely focused on macroeconomic and financial sector stability without giving much regard, especially at the beginning, to social consequences. The 1998 public health and education budgets in Thailand declined by 9 percent and 6 percent respectively compared to the previous year. Total public health expenditures in Indonesia fell by 7 percent during the first year of the Asian financial crisis, and another 12 percent the year after. Low-income households across the region fell swiftly and deeply into poverty in many crisis-affected countries. 83,84,85 2.21. Evidence, however, also suggests that efforts to maintain government health expenditure as a proportion of GDP, or as a proportion of total government expenditure, do not guarantee that pro-poor services will be protected. Government expenditures per capita in real terms may still decline substantially due to overall declines in GDP and/or overall declines in total government expenditure.86 We will return to this issue in Part 3, but one fact is clear\u2014it is vital that governments put into place safeguards to protect health expenditures in real terms for those services and programs utilized by poor and most vulnerable populations. The health impact of the rapid deterioration of public finances is likely to be fully felt at the end of 2009 and when national budgets are drawn up. The deterioration of public finances and a consequent shrinking of fiscal space could force governments to adopt drastic adjustment and austerity measures. Resources for health systems are likely to be under severe pressure in the years ahead; health authorities and partners will have to navigate through particularly difficult times in the foreseeable future. 2.22. More Pacific Island children may not enroll, drop out of school or experience declines in the quality of education. The impacts on education during previous economic crises are not as clear-cut as they are on health.87 In five countries in Latin America for which careful analysis has been done, the World Bank reports there is little evidence that school enrollment systematically declined during aggregate economic contractions. In fact, enrollment rose markedly during recessions in Mexico and Nicaragua, and marginally in Peru and Brazil. Only during a financial recession in Costa Rica between 1981 and 1982, did school enrollment drop (by 6%). Nor does it appear that school attainment suffered: in Peru, children who were exposed to the crisis of the late 1980s had completed more years of schooling for their age than comparable children who were not exposed, while even in Costa Rica school attainment appears to have been unaffected by the economic contraction earlier in the decade, despite the decline in enrollment at that time.88 One study suggests that children were able to make up schooling later on.89 82 Skoufias, E., (2003) \u2018Economic Crises and Natural Disasters: Coping Strategies and Policy Implications\u2019.

There were also significant declines in school enrolment among the rural poor, where the percentage of 7-12 years olds not enrolled in school doubled from 6 percent to 12 percent.91 During the market-oriented transition in Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CEE/CIS) between 1989 and 1999, upper secondary enrolment rates have fallen in 16 out of 24 CEE/CIS countries for which data were available. Changes in enrolment have shown strong correlation with economic growth.92 In Bangladesh, an FAO/WFP study in May-June 2008 found 20% of households reported that they had stopped sending children to school. There are also subtle gender differences in education impacts (Figure 5). In Pakistan, a UN interagency assessment indicated that households are coping with the recent commodity price shock by taking children out of school, sending them to work, and moving them from private to public schools, with a worse impact on girls than on boys. In Madagascar, a country with low female enrolment rates, girls were more likely to drop out of school than boys as agricultural income plummeted.93 In Ivory Coast, however, both girls and boys were pulled out of school as result of a drought, but boys\u2019 enrolments dropped 14 percentage points compared to 11 percentage points for girls.94 Figure 5: Impact of economic crises on education with gender differences in selected countries Source: THE WORLD BANK/IFC/MIGA Impact of Financial Crisis on Women and Families, 2009 2.24. Whatever the net effects on enrollments, reductions in government, household and donor budgets for education are likely to threaten educational investments and worsen education quality and learning outcomes. Across the Pacific, there have been moderate gains over the last decade in school enrollments for both boys and girls, especially at primary school level. In some countries, however, enrollment has tended to plateau and few countries have achieved 100% primary school enrolment. Currently 17% of Pacific children do not enroll in primary school (19% did not enroll in 1990).95 Only Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Niue, Tonga and Tuvalu claim 100% primary education enrolment ratios. Of those children who currently enroll in primary education across the region, 12% never reach grade 5.96 National averages, of course, conceal sub-national disparities. The 2008 MICS Survey in Vanuatu revealed that the primary school net attendance ratio (defined as the percentage of children of primary school age (6- 90 World Bank (2008) Aggregate Economic Shocks, Child Schooling and Child Health.

There are also concerns about the quality of education, the low levels of investment in early childhood education, and the inappropriateness of secondary school curricula to equip young people for the workforce, especially the underdevelopment of technical and vocational education.100 2.26.

As with the health sector, many Pacific Island countries allocate most of their education budget on teacher salaries and there is heavy reliance on foreign aid to support educational developments. If national and external funding is cut, teacher salaries may be delayed and public money for new school buildings, school repairs and school inputs such as teaching supplies may be greatly reduced. To supplement declining household incomes, teachers themselves may feel greater pressure to earn extra income, driving up the rate of moonlighting and absenteeism, thus reducing the quality of instruction. At the same time, revenues from parents, the community, and remittances from abroad are likely to fall as family incomes falter, making schools even more dependent on transfers from the government. There might also be a sizeable shift of students from private to public schools raising pupil-teacher ratios, increasing the pressure on often insufficient or inappropriate infrastructure, and further compromising learning quality. Education quality at private schools would thus be further compromised through the loss of fees from students shifting to the public system. 2.27. Where students incur some direct schooling costs, however small, poorer students may be pressed to forego schooling to earn income or to substitute for adult home production. Once students drop out for longer than 12 months, it proves extremely difficult to coax them back. Even without the current crisis, students from poor families, ethnic minority groups, and girls are likely to be most vulnerable to pressures to leave school as a result of the crisis. On other hand, the decrease in paid work opportunities may reduce the opportunity cost of attending school and thus increase the likelihood that youth will stay in school longer. At the tertiary education level, there could be a decline in the resources available to students to pay tuition and other costs, and hence a decrease in student demand, especially in fee-based institutions, forcing current students to drop out and new students to postpone or forgo entry. 2.28. Another major challenge during a crisis is youth unemployment, which is expected to increase from its already high levels in some countries\u2014in 2007, for example, 25% in Indonesia, 25% in Sri Lanka and 15% in the Philippines.101 Youth unemployment also shows gender variations. Indonesia showed a dramatic increase of 17 percentage points in the unemployment rate of young women between 1996 and 2006 (from 17% to 34%). Employment prospects for young Indonesian men, however, were only slightly better than those of young women: the male youth unemployment rate in 2006 was 27%.102,103 In the Pacific, where economic growth has not kept pace with high rates of population growth, large youth populations combined with school drop-outs make youth employment a major concern for this sub-region.104 Eighteen percent of young men and 19% of young women (aged 16-24 years) are unemployed across the region. To illustrate the challenge ahead, Fiji has one of the best education systems in the Pacific but every year half of the 15,000 school leavers join the unemployed. Yet Fiji is also experiencing a critical shortage of skilled tradesmen and recruits 6,000 97 Government of Vanuatu (2008) Multi-Indicator Cluster Survey 2008. 98 UNICEF (2004) \u201cA Situation Analysis of Children, Youth and Women: Nauru\u201d, UNICEF Pacific, Suva. 99 UNICEF (2003) \u201cA Situation Analysis of Children, Youth and Women: Republic of the Marshall Islands\u201d, UNICEF Pacific, Suva. 100 UNICEF Pacific (2007) State of Pacific Children.

If enrollments and learning levels deteriorate during the crisis, Pacific Island countries may lose a competitive head-start when the global economy recovers. The World Bank notes that those countries that are able to maintain or build up the skills of their work force during the recession will be poised to take advantage of opportunities once the recovery starts.106 There are also more sinister long-term impacts of reduced educational outcomes during economic crises. Almost universally, dropping out of school earlier is associated with lower labour earnings in adulthood.

Child abuse, violence, exploitation and neglect may increase. Across the globe, declining household employment options frequently result in increased child labour, either waged (especially boys) or unpaid domestic work (especially girls).109 The child-worker population in Ecuador increased to approximately 30,000 boys and girls between January and July 1999 during a financial crisis, representing an increase of 22% in the total number of child workers. The greater decrease in real household income and the growth in the number of unemployed workers during June and July had probably exerted greater pressure on boys and girls under the age of 15 to abandon school and to join the labour market.110 During the Indonesian economic crisis of the late 1990s, the proportion of children aged 10 to 14 years who worked increased only very slightly in 1998, and fell back to its 1997 level in 1999. Nevertheless, the crisis temporarily halted the steadily declining trend in the incidence of child labour which had been observed since the early 1970s. The Asian financial crisis also resulted in a 10- 15% increase in the number of street children in Thailand, and a far greater increase in Jakarta.111 2.31. While evidence of severe forms of child labour are scarce and there are reportedly few street children in the Pacific, the current crisis could propel children from school into the labour force (especially boys) or to shoulder more household tasks (especially girls). Lack of reliable data makes it difficult to assess the magnitude of the problem, but rough estimates by the ILO suggest that with growing poverty, child workers already make up an estimated 19% of the labour force in PNG and 14% in Solomon Islands.112 Fiji will soon complete a Child Labour Baseline Survey to assess the magnitude of its child labour situation. 2.32. Particularly abusive forms of work are hard to document, but evidence elsewhere suggests that, in South Korea, one year after the Asian crisis, one in seven women (including adolescent girls) was involved in some kind of sex work.113 Similarly, in Laos, reports indicated increasing numbers of women and girls in commercial sex work to assist their parents and pay for their siblings\u2019 education. 114 Transactional sex work is on the rise in the Pacific.115 Available evidence points to a large number of sex workers (male and female) under 18 years of age.116 Recent research supported by UNICEF in Fiji, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu suggest various forms of child abuse, violence and exploitation 105 UNICEF, UNESCAP, SPC (2005) State of Pacific Youth. http://www.unicef.org/eapro/State_of_Pacific_youth_2005_FINAL.pdf 106 World Bank (2009) Averting a Human Crisis During the Global Downturn.

Children\u2019s emotional wellbeing and related long-term development are naturally affected by violence. Indeed, one of the prime deprivations identified by children in the global 2006 UN Study on Violence was the absence of protection from vio- lence.120 Also related to family stress are the increase in child and teenage suicides in Central Asia following the collapse of the Soviet Union, while during the Asian monetary crisis of the late 1990s there was a sharp rise in suicide in South Korea, although overall mortality continued to decline.121,122,123 While up-to-date information on suicide is limited, it should be noted that the incidence of suicide and attempted suicide in the Pacific is already reported to be among the highest in the world.124,125,126 2.33. Research from around the globe suggests that already existing pressures on the time and care of parents are likely to be exacerbated in times of crisis. This is not a simple story of parental neglect but reflects a broader societal failure to respond to changing labour and family support patterns. Even prior to the crisis in Botswana, Mexico and Vietnam, parental unavailability and poor working conditions, limited support networks and inability to afford childcare result in staggering numbers of young children left alone for long hours.127 Infant home placement rates increased in 20 out of 26 countries in CEE/CIS between 1989 and 1999; a period characterized by sharp contractions in economic output and huge dislocations in employment and social stability.128 Moreover, 52% of families leaving children home alone relied on other children to help with childcare. 129 The 2008 MICS Survey in Vanuatu reported that 36% of children under five years were left in the care of other children under ten years of age at least once during the week preceding the survey while 21% children were left alone. About 39% children were left with inadequate care during the week preceding the survey.130 The 2008 Situation Analysis of Children and Women in Palau reported that: \u2018Time and money have become important commodities. Nuclear families have become the norm. While the extended family and clan provide a buffer during times of trouble, in daily life many households are on their own. Adults torn between competing demands from work, custom, family, and community increasingly turn to foreign domestic helpers to manage the household and care for the children. Women who now hold paid jobs no longer have time to go to the taro patch so they import (male) foreign farm laborers. As a result of what has been coined \u201cbusy child-busy parent\u201d syndrome, children are no longer reared with a clear Palauan identity and no longer imbue traditional values and life skills.\u2019131 In Kiribati, many women were taking up care-giving and nursing jobs overseas. While this contributes to remittances, it has also meant that women who remain are expected to carry out care-giving duties, fishing and agricultural work. An increasing number of children are left at home in the care of their grandmothers and others family members.132 2.34. The crisis could bring devastating cuts to HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment programs. The global crisis may adversely affect prevention programs in the Pacific with the most adverse effect on prevention efforts among high risk groups\u2014most at risk and especially vulnerable adolescents, sex workers, military personnel, maritime workers, and men who have sex with men (MSM). As noted above, national health budgets are likely to be cut which may seriously affect HIV prevention, testing and 117 Governments of Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu with UNICEF (forthcoming) Child Protection Research 2008. 118 UNICEF, UNESCAP, ECPAT International, RRRT (2008) Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Sexual Abuse in the Pacific.

External aid for HIV programs may be reduced, with Papua New Guinea already reporting a cut of 75% in the national HIV and AIDS budget due to a fall in external assistance.133 Sources of support such as the Global Fund and private sector sponsorship may diminish. Loss of jobs and income losses may result in desperate people exchanging sex for money and basic needs at a time when HIV prevention efforts may be reduced. Even short-term interruptions of Antiretroviral (ART) drug supplies could threaten patients\u2019 health, cutting the returns to the investments in treatment. Up to 50% of patients whose treatment is interrupted for 15 days may subsequently need a different regimen. If treatment interruptions become frequent for many individuals currently on ART, the risk of transmission of drug-resistant HIV will increase. TB incidence and prevalence would also be increased if TB and HIV programs falter.134 A recent World Bank and UNAIDS report highlighted that much is at risk: increased mortality and morbidity, unplanned interruptions or curtailed access to treatment, with increased risk of HIV transmission, higher future financial costs, increased burden on health systems and reversal of economic and social development gains.135 Likely impacts on Pacific Island women 2.35. More Pacific Island women will die in childbirth. Maternal mortality is already a serious concern across the Pacific. There are questions over the relevancy of using the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) for small populations such as those found in the Pacific.136 Nevertheless, as a crude measure of progress, the regional 1990 MMR (based on countries for which data are available) was around 215 (Table 5). The 2015 MDG target is to reduce 1990 MMRs by 75%\u2014in other words, the regional MMR (inclusive of Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste) must drop from 215 to 54 by 2015. The regional figure seems to drop to 150 by 2000 and 103 by around 2006.

The only official data available in the Pacific Islands appear to be for Vanuatu and Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI). One or more ANC visit during pregnancy is almost universal in Vanuatu. Eighty-four percent of pregnant women received ANC from a skilled provider (i.e., doctor, nurse or midwife) at least once during their last pregnancy. An additional 14% received ANC from an unskilled provider. Only 2% of pregnant women did not receive any ANC (Government of Vanuatu (2008) Multi-Indicator Cluster Survey. Port Vila: National Statistics Office). In RMI, more than 70% of women (77%) attended four or more visits for ANC (Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office (EPPSO), SPC and Macro International Inc.

The impact of the crisis will be felt by both men and women, but not necessarily in the same manner. Access to full and productive employment and decent work is crucial for all, and decent work deficits are the primary cause of poverty and social instability. The economic crisis is detrimental for both women and men, whether they are at work, looking for work or outside the labour force but men and women are likely to experience the crisis in different ways. Empirical evidence on the impacts of financial crises on women is limited. Figure 6 illustrates how the current crisis may transmit its impacts on to women. For example, a drop in exports may lead to women\u2019s job losses in export-oriented sectors such as textiles (where a large percentage of the workforce is female).

Reduced remittances may limit women\u2019s autonomy and control over family matters. Additional shocks such as rising food prices will further diminish household purchasing power. In vulnerable households, these combined effects may send recently laid off or previously unemployed women out to look for work but during the economic downturn, they may only obtain poorly paid, insecure or higher risk employment (including sex work) or girls (and boys) may be pulled out of school to help the family survive.144 2.37. Women are more vulnerable. Male-dominated industries, car and auto parts, and construction, have been hard hit. Several countries in the Asia-Pacific region have experienced layoffs in financial services, Information-Communication-Technology (ICT) based back-office services, and telemarketing. The gender composition of these sectors is fairly equal. Across Asia, exports are declining in labour- intensive manufacturing industries such as textiles and apparels, leather products, and electronics. Job losses in this sector have affected women more than men. Other female dominated sectors, tourism and related services are also affected. The main casualty so far, however, is the \u201cflexible\u201d labour force\u2014low- skill, temporary, casual workers. In the developing Asia-Pacific region, women still constitute the majority of these workers.145 They are unlikely to be covered by formal unemployment insurance or social protection schemes. Lacking education and skills, they tend to be less mobile across sectors than better educated workers. Women workers are considered as part of the \u201cflexible\u201d workforce that can be easily discarded during economic downturns. The notion that men are \u201cbreadwinners\u201d of a family may lead to unequal treatment of men and women in terms of dismissal, social security entitlements and rehiring. 144 Guina, C.S.

Overseas migrant workers are often hired as temporary workers, so they get dismissed first during economic downturns. Women migrant workers from the Pacific are mostly engaged in skilled health care and education related activities; and low-skill intensive domestic care services. Since there is a conscious effort to protect social spending, especially the health budgets, in Australia and New Zealand, job losses in these categories are expected to be low. But those engaged by private firms, private institutions and as domestic help might be at risk. 2.39. The crisis brings to the fore existing gender inequality within labour markets. Gender inequality remains an issue within labour markets globally and the current economic crisis has again exposed the depth and breadth of this inequality.148 Women suffer multiple disadvantages in terms of access to labour markets, and often do not have the same level of freedom as men to choose to work. Women are too often trapped in insecure employment situations with low productivity and low earnings. Women tend to have a higher rate of part-time employment. Women are at risk of being hired last and dismissed first.149 As noted in Part 1, female-headed households are at greatest risk, with few if any savings to weather the crisis, and limited ownership of wealth and other assets, as compared to men.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0085029c-b1fc-4f85-b7a8-c01018c155a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0085029c-b1fc-4f85-b7a8-c01018c155a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fd3406ea7cada537c4ed9c09ee355db0ca2e464d51f4d0d72715e5fdce39c2b4"}, "2": {"node_id": "23f4b9c9-73c6-48ec-bdac-d5a993be903a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "676a1ccc5f19d3adbccbad5c8b53c3e83ef91eefbb670fa08f9c6b71afa6adee"}}, "hash": "a8edf582ef2a5d8bb28d40005dfccb63437b9968f7c25e982192e6f0c5368f64", "text": "Ethnic groups that are less powerful and immigrant groups will suffer in many of the same ways because they are similarly situated in the paid economy as women.

Women also face constraints in terms of sectors of economic activity in which they would like to work and working conditions to which they aspire. Women are overrepresented in the agricultural sector, and if the more industrialized regions are excluded, almost half of female employment can be found in this sector alone. Women are also often in a disadvantaged position in terms of the share of vulnerable employment (i.e. unpaid family workers and own-account workers) in total employment. These workers are most likely to be characterized by insecure employment, low earnings and low productivity. Those women who are able to secure the relative comfort of wage and salaried employment are often not receiving the same remuneration as their 146 Pilwha, C.

Gender wage differentials may be due to a variety of factors, including crowding of women in low paying industries and differences in skills and work experience, but may also be the result of discrimination. Mounting evidence shows that gender inequality leads to major losses in economic efficiency and human development. 2.40. Impacts on micro-credit will affect women. The banking crisis and formal credit squeeze is likely to have a larger direct impact on men, who are the majority of users of financial services and formal sector borrowers, than women. The poor in general, and poor women in particular, are considered \u201csub-prime\u201d borrowers by commercial banks. Women are the majority of clients of micro-finance institutions (85% of the poorest 93 million clients of micro-finance institutions in 2006).151 Poor women largely rely on micro- credit facilities for financing their businesses and smoothing consumption during difficult times. Micro- credit institutions are largely funded by commercial banks and through aid. Commercial banks in most developing countries, faced with a global liquidity crisis, have significantly cut down on lending across the board. Aid is expected to decline, and may exacerbate the problem. There is evidence from South Asia that micro-finance programs have already been negatively affected.152,153 2.41. Women will bear the brunt of the crisis. During difficult times, families often rely on women for care for the sick, elderly and the extended family, even when women are already engaged in paid-work. It means longer-work hours and heavier workloads for women. While time use data in the Pacific are limited, there is some evidence that Pacific Island women already have major paid and unpaid workloads.154 When there are few opportunities for wage work, men may migrate out of rural areas, leaving women as household heads.

The following points can be summarized: \u2022 In every previous economic crisis it is the poorest people in developing countries who suffer the most and not enough is done to help them. They are forced to respond with measures that keep them poor and lower future income-earning potential, resulting in persistent poverty. \u2022 Around 18,000 children under five years of age still die every year in the Pacific region (13,000 in Papua New Guinea, 2,500 in Timor-Leste, and 2,500 in the Pacific Island countries)\u201450 deaths a day; one death every 30 minutes. Four out of five of these children are under one year of age. Unless reversed, the economic crisis could result in an increase of between 400 to 800 Pacific Island child deaths annually\u2014two more deaths every day than is currently the case. By 2015, an additional 5,600 Pacific children under five could have died if the crisis persists; this equates to about the same number of all reported child deaths in all natural disasters occurring in the Pacific since 1950 (excluding Timor-Leste). Globally, girl children are more at risk in economic crises. \u2022 More Pacific Island children will become more malnourished, with long-lasting consequences. Malnutrition including micronutrient deficiencies is already common across the Pacific and changes in household food consumption patterns brought about by the economic crisis may increase these problems. Despite traditional subsistence agriculture, many Pacific Island countries and households already face food insecurities which will be exacerbated if the crisis decreases abilities to purchase food. There are high levels of national dependence on food imports and high proportions of household income spent on food, even in rural areas. For children in poor households, reducing consumption 151 Microcredit Summit Campaign Report 2007. Available at: http://www.microcreditsummit.org/pubs/reports/socr/EngSOCR2007.pdf 152 Chandran, R.

Even where health is prioritized within the overall budget, real health spending per capita may still fall. The demand on public services will increase at a time when funding for such services will diminish. Where health insurance schemes exist, households may no longer be able to afford health insurance or may become ineligible. Where private health care systems exist, users may switch from the private system to the public health sector as their ability to pay for health services is impacted. The quality of health care will likely diminish. Overall, patients will likely defer care completely or only attend when the situation becomes critical, exacerbating child and maternal mortality. Health expenditures in real terms for those services and programs utilized by poor and most vulnerable populations will need to be protected. \u2022 More Pacific Island children may not enroll, drop out of school or experience declines in the quality of education. The moderate gains in education made by Pacific Island countries are now under threat. If education budgets decline, teacher salaries may be delayed and public money for new school buildings, school repairs and school inputs such as teaching supplies may be greatly reduced compromising quality. Where students incur some direct schooling costs, however small, poorer students may be pressed to forego schooling to earn income or to substitute for adult home production. Large youth populations combined with school drop-outs already make youth employment a major concern for this sub-region with the crisis only set to increase levels of youth unemployment. If enrollments and learning levels deteriorate during the crisis, Pacific Island countries may lose a competitive head-start when the global economy recovers.

Child workers already make up an estimated 19% of the labour force in Papua New Guinea and 14% in Solomon Islands.

There is also evidence that parental neglect of children is on the rise. There is a significant danger that hidden impacts\u2014hazardous work, increases in violence and decreases in nurture, care and emotional wellbeing\u2014may not be addressed, owing to their invisibility. \u2022 The global crisis may adversely affect HIV and AIDS prevention programs in the Pacific with the most adverse effect on prevention efforts among high risk groups\u2014most at risk and especially vulnerable adolescents, sex workers, military personnel, maritime workers, and men who have sex with men (MSM). \u2022 More Pacific Island women will die in childbirth. Maternal mortality is already a serious concern across the Pacific. Universal access to high quality obstetric care at birth must be accelerated if maternal mortality is not to worsen. \u2022 The impact of the crisis will be felt by both men and women, but not necessarily in the same manner. While the empirical data on the impacts of financial crises on women is limited but evidence to hand indicate women are more vulnerable. Across Asia, job losses in labour-intensive manufacturing industries such as textiles and apparels, leather products, and electronics are affecting women more than men. The main casualty so far is the \u201cflexible\u201d labour force\u2014low-skill, temporary, casual workers\u2014in which women constitute the majority of the workers. Gender inequality remains an issue within labour markets globally and the current economic crisis has again exposed the depth and breadth of this inequality. Mounting evidence shows that gender inequality leads to major losses in economic efficiency and human development. \u2022 Access to micro-credit schemes may diminish, further compromising women\u2019s businesses and their ability to cope during difficult times. \u2022 During difficult times, families often rely on women to take care of the sick, elderly and the extended family, even when women are already engaged in paid-work. Overwhelmingly, women will bear the brunt of the crisis. 2.43. At this moment, when Pacific Island children and women are most vulnerable, governments are faced with decreasing fiscal capacity. The costs of inaction or inappropriate action can be high. In Part 3, we promote a monitoring framework to better comprehend some of the real-time social impacts of the economic crisis in Pacific Island countries. We then outline immediate action within short-term crisis- response packages that can be taken in the health, education, and social welfare sectors. Finally, we consider social protection programs to aid recovery and to mitigate the impacts of future crises on Pacific Island children and women. Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance 30 Part 3: Real-time monitoring and Policy Action for children and women in the Pacific 3.1. The current global economic crisis has hit the world in a series of waves. The first wave brought the global financial system to the brink of collapse. A second wave hit emerging economies causing reductions in credit, trade, foreign direct investment, remittances, and employment, and likely reductions in aid. A third wave is now hitting the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable countries already suffering from the shock of high food and fuel prices. The central lesson learned from every previous economic crisis is that the poorest people in developing countries suffer the most and that not enough is done to help them. Beneath the current crisis lies a global \u201cDevelopment Emergency\u201d with catastrophic implications if we fail to respond effectively. 3.2. While there is still uncertainty about the scope and impact of the economic crisis in the region, it is clear that children and women in many Pacific Island countries are likely to be amongst those most severely affected, and that those already most vulnerable will face the greatest impact. In previous financial and economic crises child mortality rates rose and school enrolment dropped, and there are already indications that this crisis\u2014compounded by recent food and fuel price instability\u2014is causing increases in poverty and malnutrition.155 It is possible that the full impact of the global economic crisis has not yet been felt in the Pacific. This means that the coming weeks and months still offer a window to prepare by readjusting fiscal and monetary policy, creating an enabling environment in which alternative livelihood opportunities can be found, establishing early warning and response tracking systems, and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ad2c57e-6839-46ce-95b7-172e2bb99829": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ad2c57e-6839-46ce-95b7-172e2bb99829", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35fb2d603ad10e74b4b1743b2a8c27c3d6a8f54fc4df48679fea600fe8afd11d"}, "3": {"node_id": "327fb891-56b8-4c6f-b6b7-4dbb282d7d9a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffc579a52c988643df2f049b080d8e4f86830bfb3a984ab53ed8ffe12fa14bbe"}}, "hash": "a64eb1b54aba068d3a25580903e185a99efa0ac9a667c3a1a510508b2383eab0", "text": "developing immediate and longer-term social protection (safety net) policy responses. But this also means that the impact may be even larger in 2010 than in 2009. Lags mean that economic conditions will be tough in the Pacific in 2010, even if the global economy picks up and it may be 2011 before Pacific economies fully recover. Slowing growth, reduced demand and employment, and declining budgets severely threaten progress on health, education and child protection and could leave children with the long-term mental and physical repercussions of malnutrition. There may also be long-term social and economic impacts due to reduced educational outcomes during the economic downturn. Women will bear the brunt of the crisis at home, in communities, and at work. Failure to develop effective solutions to the crisis could trigger a destructive social backlash that will inflame political instability, revive economic nationalism, and further reverse development gains. 3.3. If ever there was a time for Pacific Island governments to improve their leadership, governance, and resource management, it is now. Policy-makers are faced with the task of identifying vulnerabilities and finding ways to protect critical growth-enhancing spending, trim low-priority expenditures, ensure fiscal sustainability in the medium, but above all, protect the most vulnerable and resist shocks in the future. Such decisions are made even more difficult given that every source of development finance in the Pacific\u2014remittances, export and commodity demand, trust funds, aid and capital flows\u2014are now being affected. Only by putting in place measures that raise the levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of public services, will governments be able to pursue policies that adequately protect children and women. 3.4. A threefold policy focus. The effects of the crisis will vary significantly from country to country, depending on their economic context as well as the policy actions taken by their government. There will certainly be no \u201cone size fits all\u201d or ready-made approach. While each country must pursue a policy framework relevant to its own context, the broad regional focus will likely need to be at least threefold: \u2022 maintain macro-economic fundamentals; \u2022 protect social budgeting and budget for social protection; and \u2022 undertake strategic long-term investments in physical and human capital. We focus here on the second policy stream\u2014social budgeting and social protection. Gender equality should be a key principle in any policy response to help offset the unequal social and economic burden on women. The coming weeks and months still offer a window to develop policy along these lines. 3.5. Maintaining macro-economic fundamentals is critical if fiscal space is to be created to finance the protection of children and women. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund are providing countries with advice and supplementary funding to maintain macro-economic fundamentals. In the Pacific region, the ADB and other development partners including Australia and New Zealand are adding their technical and financial support to those of the World Bank and IMF. We will not dwell on macro-economics as these are discussed in other documents cited in the footnotes, but we must 155 For the remainder of this document, we focus on policy action in 14 Pacific Island countries\u2014Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu\u2014but the issues and ideas might also apply to other Pacific contexts such as Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea.

Macro-economic stability is equally important for the poor. Policies to maintain price stability and employment levels are key (see also 3.36, 3.37 and Box 14). The recent food price rise crisis provides an important lesson as to the potential downside of poorly formulated actions aimed at helping the vulnerable (Box 5). Box 5: Lessons from Timor-Leste on consumer price suppression 157 Most Pacific governments responded to the high prices in 2008 by suppressing the increase in consumer prices. But this would have kept prices for locally grown food below what they would otherwise have been, suppressing a much needed supply response from agriculture. For example, in Timor-Leste the subsidization of imported rice shielded many people from rising international prices, but it also reduced prices received by domestic growers, for both rice and substitute staples. It consequently held down growth in rural areas, where most of Timor-Leste\u2019s poor live. Furthermore, the subsidies for imported rice benefited the better-off more than the poor, as the better-off consume more rice and the poor rely more on corn and cassava.
