It is still technically possible to limit the global mean temperature increase to well below 1.5\u00b0C if all countries take immediate and more ambitious action to reduce emissions of all greenhouse gases. Such ambitious actions will require capacity building and adequate financial and technological support. A sound assessment of the potential benefits and risks is fundamental for further political action. The more efficiently we use natural resources, the lower the greenhouse gases emitted across the entire economy (IRP, 2019a; 2019b). Biodiversity can only be conserved, sustainably used and restored by addressing all the underlying drivers of change, including the economic factors driving the exploitation and destruction of critical habitats. The adverse effects of chemicals and waste pollution on the environment and human health can be substantially reduced by implementing the existing international frameworks, strengthening the scientific basis of policy and decision making, and fostering sustainable, resource-efficient innovations and capacity through which harmful chemicals are contained and their use reduced and phased out. Negative impacts on human development, increasing inequality and challenges to the multilateral order risk diverting attention from the environmental dimensions of sustainable development 13. The global macroeconomic outlook has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, accelerating the growth of inequality across the world and threatening to wipe out significant progress on sustainable development. In June 2020, the International Monetary Fund projected global growth of -4.9 per cent in 2020 and predicted \u201ca particularly acute negative impact of the pandemic on low-income households worldwide that could significantly raise inequality\u201d (IMF, 2020). The United Nations Development Programme warned that global human development is set to decline in 2020 for the first time in 20 years (UNDP, 2020). Building back better requires better measurement and management of the assets that underpin human, environmental, institutional and economic progress. 14. Not only are increasing socioeconomic inequality and inequity deepening divisions between the \u201chaves\u201d and the \u201chave-nots,\u201d but there is also greater concern about losing the gains made in recent decades in relation to reducing poverty. Even before the onset of COVID-19, it was estimated that inequality had been steadily increasing for more than 70 per cent of the global population (United Nations, 2020d), exacerbating divisions between and within countries. Mega-trends and global forces such as technological innovation, Marine plastics pollution has increased tenfold since 1980 UNEP, 2019c; 2019d 10x Medium-Term Strategy 2022\u20142025 | 09 urbanization and migration, in addition to climate change, environmental degradation and resource depletion, reinforce each other to exacerbate such inequality while undermining prospects for development generally. Current modes of production and consumption and the associated levels of inequality threaten the achievement of the entire 2030 Agenda (Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary-General, 2019). 15. Poor people, women and children face increased vulnerability from environmental stresses that lead to intensified competition for scarce natural resources and potentially to migration, instability and conflict. Globally, 24 per cent of land is degrading. More than 1.5 billion people, 74 per cent of whom live in poverty, depend directly on that land (Sena, 2019). By 2050, over 143 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America \u2013 comprising 2.8 per cent of the population of these regions \u2013 will have become internal migrants. A major cause of that will be the various climatic impacts, with people leaving less viable areas with higher water scarcity and lower crop productivity, as well as areas affected by rising sea levels and storm surges (Rigaud and others, 2018). 16. Establishing more sustainable consumption and production patterns at the local, national, regional and global levels, supported by a framework anchored in the United Nations, is key to reducing inequality, creating jobs and protecting the environment. Resource extraction and processing create more than 50 per cent of global climate change impacts and more than 90 per cent of global biodiversity loss (IRP, 2019a). Yet the two indicators of resource consumption, \u201cmaterial footprint\u201d and \u201cdomestic material consumption,\u201d shared by Sustainable Development Goal targets 12.2 and 8.4, both show a negative long-term trend continuing to rise at the global level (Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary- General, 2019; UNEP, 2019d). This indicates that the rate at which materials are being extracted globally is outpacing both population and economic growth (Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary-General, 2019). Reversing this trend requires transforming how we produce, process, use and manage natural resources in our socioeconomic systems and how we design and implement our national fiscal and economic policies.

Prioritizing resource-intensive sectors for a shift to sustainable consumption and production could achieve very significant economic, social and environmental gains, often in short time frames. For example, the agriculture, food and beverage, and building and construction sectors accounted for nearly 70 per cent of the world\u2019s total material footprint in 2015, while being among the most intensive greenhouse- gas-emitting sectors (Life Cycle Initiative and others, 2018). Transforming those sectors to reduce emissions and increase circularity will be crucial in the years to come. A man tries to chase a swarm of locusts devstating ricefields in Manila, Philippines.

Gender equality and a rights-based approach are key to ending all forms of discrimination and ensuring progress towards environmental sustainability (World Economic Forum, 2019). Climate change and the population crisis are not gender neutral; a high and uneven burden is carried by women, who constitute 80 per cent of those displaced by climate change (Habtezion, 2016). Women of child-bearing age and children are especially vulnerable. Women are responsible for 60\u201480 per cent of food production in developing countries (SIDA, 2009); however, women are often excluded from land ownership and decisions, with prevailing traditional, religious and customary laws and practices in 123 countries limiting their freedom to claim and protect their land assets (OECD, 2014). Women and children are often employed in informal sectors with higher exposure to risk, such as artisanal mining and waste collection. This inequality is further compounded by a low level of political representation, with only 25 per cent of parliamentary seats in governments around the world held by women (IPU, 2020). A stocktaking exercise with regard to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in 2020, 25 years after its adoption, reveals that \u201cmajor gaps remain and that obstacles, including structural barriers, discriminatory practices and the feminization of poverty, persist\u201d (United Nations CSW, 2020). Estimates indicate that it will take, on average, another century to achieve gender parity globally. Indigenous peoples constitute another group that, while comprising less than 6 per cent of the world\u2019s population, is known for stewarding 80 per cent of the world\u2019s biodiversity through traditional ecological knowledge (United Nations, 2009; Sobrevila, 2008). Indigenous peoples can also contribute to climate solutions through traditional knowledge, legal systems and cultures (United Nations General Assembly, 2019c). 18. Seventy-five years after the signing of the Charter of the United Nations, environmental multilateralism remains as crucial as ever. Global challenges such as climate change, high pollution levels, destruction of nature and the COVID-19 pandemic are clear signs of the need to champion environmental stewardship and cooperation. This multilateral cooperation must deliver solutions for sustainable development that integrate health, education, poverty reduction, and economic and social well-being. In its economic outlook for 2020, the United Nations warned that \u201camid a weakening commitment to multilateralism \u2013 whether in the economic or political arena \u2013 the capacity of the international community to contain and resolve conflicts has decreased\u201d (United Nations, 2020c). Reinvigorating multilateralism is essential to achieve the 2030 Agenda. An important milestone will be reached in 2025 when the United Nations turns 80 and the period covered by the present Medium-Term Strategy comes to an end. This opportunity must be seized.

United Nations development system reform provides the framework for integrated policy guidance and technical support to countries to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The United Nations must be ambitious in working with partners to enhance environmental sustainability through sharp analytics and to support Member States in fostering the conditions needed to meet their requests in paragraph 88 of The Future We Want. Coordinated work across the United Nations on common country analyzes and the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework through the United Nations country teams has already demonstrated the importance of integrating the environment into Sustainable Development Goal monitoring and implementation. 20.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24e5d557-2980-42c7-ae2f-6d99709fbb4c": {"__data__": {"id_": "24e5d557-2980-42c7-ae2f-6d99709fbb4c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/people-and-planet-unep-strategy-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "For people and planet: the UNEP strategy for 2022\u20132025", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/people-and-planet-unep-strategy-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d0d8c4fe5e78d5b22776310e4c2ebc37578a2b176183494770b9770ef418f24"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3f7a0c7-9867-48dc-bc38-e7850f50295c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/people-and-planet-unep-strategy-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5341f1ccaf5c9defbfe8f53511586be0e65d1129d73d1addb29e015e1ca468d3"}}, "hash": "8aaf1ee33203e762b592e82fb3a05d4d42358f1c8b57785a66d8c0e834bf818d", "text": "20.

Institutions at every level need to keep pace with the speed and scale of technological innovation in the digital space. The digitalization of society and the economy and advances in artificial intelligence offer a massive opportunity to build greater environmental sustainability, resilience and transparency. Technology is transforming life in both developed and developing countries, and enhanced cooperation across the United Nations and beyond will be required to ensure that goals, policies and strategies remain relevant to the shifting economic, social and environmental landscape. At the same time, it will be important to be aware of the global digital divide; nearly 87 per cent of the population uses the Internet in developed countries compared to 19.1 per cent in the least developed countries. In addition, the Internet user gender gap for the least developed countries stood at 42.8 per cent in 2019, compared to 17 per cent globally (ITU, 2019). Worldwide, digital technology is moving faster than society\u2019s ability to govern it. There is a growing understanding that a societal leap must be made concurrently with the technological revolution. Transparency on the environmental performance and carbon footprints of goods and services must remain a shared goal in line with multilaterally agreed norms and standards. Moreover, access to environmental data and information on environmental changes is paramount for sound environmental governance and to encourage the participation of communities and disadvantaged groups. For decision making to increase equity, technology must be leveraged for greater inclusion of those at risk of being left behind. At the same time, environmental considerations linked to the use of more digital technologies, from extraction of rare- earth elements to energy use by devices and data centres, need to be kept under review.

UNEP strives for continuous improvement and follows an adaptive management model that is constantly refreshed through exhaustive monitoring and evaluation of its performance. 23. In 2019, UNEP launched a transformation process to become more effective in delivering its mandate, with more operational integration, clarity of focus and learning from past lessons. This process resulted in a shift in its organizational capabilities and identity to deliver more impactful results. This strategy thus builds on opportunities and recommendations for improvement arising from that transformation process, which is informed by lessons learned from previous medium-term strategies, as well as a blend of internal and external reviews and audits (UNEP, 2020c). Investing in staff for sustainable organizational change 24. Promoting and reinforcing changes in individual attitudes and behaviours and creating channels to communicate feedback across all staff play a prominent role in successful organizational change management (JIU, 2019d). UNEP will continue to build a healthy, results- and performance-driven organization by tapping into the expertise and knowledge of staff to forge new forms of behaviour, while building collaborative teams at all levels and developing a strategic, more collaborative leadership that directs resources toward agreed priorities. Building on a progressive diagnosis of the cultural and behavioural traits within the organization, UNEP will invest in providing staff training in knowledge, skills and attitudes that support more coherent internal delivery of the organization\u2019s aspirations under", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ced465b8-d2ba-4e0f-b95a-a0cb7a91ddf9": {"__data__": {"id_": "ced465b8-d2ba-4e0f-b95a-a0cb7a91ddf9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/people-and-planet-unep-strategy-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "For people and planet: the UNEP strategy for 2022\u20132025", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/people-and-planet-unep-strategy-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "595a986396779c9565d000a5faa4b88da89bbc89152878ff74cda54ae7fdbff8"}}, "hash": "595a986396779c9565d000a5faa4b88da89bbc89152878ff74cda54ae7fdbff8", "text": "this strategy and reviewing the acquired capacities. By building stronger supervisory and peer support systems, UNEP will ensure that learnings translate into long-term capacities and ultimately improve day-to-day work routines, building a foundation for a cultural transformation of the organization that enhances outcomes. Getting gender right: increased responsiveness to gender equality and human rights 25. Despite appointing gender focal points and introducing \u201cresponsiveness to human rights\u201d and \u201cgender equity\u201d as stand-alone project evaluation criteria in 2018, UNEP performance on the delivery of gender and human rights outcomes at the project level remains weak (UNEP, 2020c). UNEP already takes part in the United Nations System-Wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. As of 2019, UNEP had met or exceeded 8 of its 17 gender equality and empowerment of women indicators (UN- Women, 2019), but that is not enough. UNEP will work to fully implement Environment Assembly resolution 4/17 on promoting gender equality and the human rights and empowerment of women and girls in environmental governance. UNEP will fully support Member States in their achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 5 in the context of the environment, calling for women\u2019s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of environmental decision making. The focus will be on operationalizing gender and human rights dimensions and non-discrimination issues in programme and project design. UNEP will foster the widespread use of a gender lens to ensure that gender equality and human rights perspectives are fully embedded and integrated through associated principles. Linkages between gender indicators, gender- disaggregated data and policy recommendations will be observed and applied, as will gender-informed feedback loops and reinforced monitoring frameworks. UNEP will also collect good practices that can be shared at the wider United Nations level. 26. UNEP will invest in enhancing the abilities of staff, including within the Multilateral Environmental Agreements, to better understand, implement, monitor and analyze gender and human rights and intersectional gender and non-discrimination issues, with the goal of integrating related objectives into the organization\u2019s analytical and operational work. Moving beyond project design and monitoring, UNEP will provide programme and project implementation support to ensure that gender issues are integrated across the programme cycle, not just at the design stage, but also during implementation and project evaluation, with feedback loops for continuous improvement. 14 | Medium-Term Strategy 2022\u20142025 Securing a stronger organizational design for collective accountability 27. Accountability is critical to efficient and transparent operations, including in cooperation and coordination with the Multilateral Environmental Agreements (United Nations, 2019b). UNEP will review its organizational design, including the allocation of management roles and responsibilities among its divisions and regional offices, to ensure solid alignment with the priorities outlined in this strategy. As part of this process, UNEP will place emphasis on senior managers to improve task assignment and implementation for more cohesive, inclusive and better performance. In pursuit of the United Nations management reforms, UNEP will also improve internal quality controls and compliance for enhanced performance. To that end, UNEP will upgrade and improve its standards for internal controls and management, providing oversight, identifying opportunities for greater efficiency and ensuring compliance with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, including on enterprise risk management. Increasing focus on management for results 28. UNEP recognizes that the continuing transition to results-based management is as much a transformation of the institution\u2019s internal culture as it is a management issue. The use of data, monitoring and evaluation is a critical tool for decision making (United Nations, 2019b). UNEP will enhance its internal capacity to deliver results and will develop indicators that are aligned with organizational objectives to reflect true transformational change. It will engage in project cycle reform, invest in human resources and build capacity through customized and in-house training and the establishment of technical networks across the organization that can support programme delivery, while developing \u201cbest-in-class\u201d fiduciary and governance standards that build on enterprise risk management tools. As is indicated in its programme of work, UNEP will use Sustainable Development Goal indicators or internationally agreed environmental indicators as much as possible in its results framework to increase ambition. Furthermore, it will strive to monitor change over a longer term rather than a single biennium or the four years of this strategy. To that end, UNEP will employ impact metrics with project performance dashboards and cross-project leader boards to gauge effectiveness and assess the level of uptake of its products and services. Projects that cannot demonstrate an impact on key metrics after a prescribed period and a series of iterations will be closed.

Mobilizing resources and leveraging partnerships to enhance efficiency 29. Securing contributions to the Environment Fund, as well as funding that is only softly earmarked, is indispensable if UNEP is to be equipped to deliver on the priorities agreed by Member States while demonstrating tangible results (United Nations, 2019b). As was recognized in the online survey on UNEP funding carried out in 2020, efforts by UNEP and its partners to widen and secure the resource base for the execution of this strategy, including through an increased understanding of the factors that determine or hinder Member States\u2019 financial contributions to UNEP, need to be sustained (UNEP, 2020a). UNEP will continue to engage in dialogue with Member States on these issues, and will work to define its comparative advantage and funding needs strategically, for both core and earmarked funding, and look comprehensively at the landscape of potential funding sources. UNEP will also engage in strategic and innovative approaches to resource mobilization (United Nations, 2019b), including through stronger communication of the value of the Environment Fund and the results achieved through its support, as well as the effects of insufficient core funding on UNEP\u2019s implementation efforts. UNEP will update its 2017 resource mobilization strategy to reflect the recent decisions of the Environment Assembly, as well as the results of the 2020 online survey, and will prepare a fully developed implementation plan for the strategy, with timelines and related resources. It will also update its partnership strategy to ensure stronger pursuit of its comparative advantage to match its increased ambition for resource mobilization in order to deliver on its strategic priorities.

The UNEP situational analysis indicates that the world is facing three major environmental crises: climate change, biodiversity and nature loss, and pollution. These are all largely driven by human activity and unsustainable patterns of consumption and production. Tackling these crises is critical to improving the health of the environment, as well as social and economic health, as the COVID-19 crisis has shown. A healthy environment, healthy people and healthy economies are the foundation for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.2 31. The Secretary-General has stressed that \u201cas we enter a Decade of Action on the Sustainable Development Goals, we have to convince people that the United Nations is relevant to all and that multilateralism offers real solutions to global challenges\u201d (United Nations, 2019a). In line with its mandate, UNEP will seize the opportunity provided by the Decade of Action to demonstrate the value of multilateralism by actively shaping a more balanced, equitable and sustainable future for all, where the environment is at the centre of political and economic decision making and where all countries are on track to meet their environmental goals and aspirations. 32. The present Medium-Term Strategy charts the contribution of UNEP to the 2030 Agenda and the Decade of Action, delivered against a 2022\u20142025 time frame but with a 2050 outlook on planetary sustainability for people, prosperity and equity.3 2 More than half of the Sustainable Development Goals have an environmental focus or address the sustainability of natural resources, and more than 86 of the 169 targets concern the environment directly, including at least 1 in each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (UNEP, 2016). 3 The sixth edition of the Global Environment Outlook recognizes that maintaining a forward-looking perspective in the form of a long-term 2050 vision is critical to assessing development pathways towards achieving the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals and making progress on the Multilateral Environmental Agreements, particularly on the nexus areas of sustainable consumption and production, human well-being (including in relation to pollution) and the natural resource base (including in relation to biodiversity loss and climate change). Strategic approaches central to the vision of UNEP for the 2030 Agenda and its contribution to the Decade of Action 33. UNEP will support an integrated and balanced implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It will continue to build the capacity of Member States and partners to integrate the environment into all aspects of sustainable development, leveraging the interactions and co-benefits of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

UNEP will strengthen institutional capacity for gender-responsive programme delivery. Gender equality is a multiplier and cross-cutting factor of sustainability and an effective and efficient way to address issues of poverty, health, food security and access to energy. In the period 2022 \u20142025, UNEP will leverage the opportunities provided by the Sustainable Development Goals to strengthen the institutional capacity of policymakers, UNEP staff and key partners to develop and implement gender- responsive policies and strategies. UNEP will use information from its stakeholders and government partners to secure commitments and elicit collective gender-transformative actions. 35. UNEP, working with its many partners, will deliver transformational results. It will align its planning and action with the 2030 Agenda and other internationally agreed environmental goals and aspire to deliver long-term, transformational impacts beyond the four years covered by this strategy. UNEP will identify the key transformative actions for the environment that will drive the desired systemic changes at the heart of sustainable development. In collaboration with its partners, UNEP will target these drivers through leveraging a \u201cnetworked multilateralism\u201d that demonstrates impact and scale, bringing together the United Nations system, regional organizations, international financial institutions and other key players (United Nations Secretary-General, 2020b). Medium-Term Strategy 2022\u20142025 | 17 To achieve focus, UNEP will develop a typology of projects that meet the following criteria: a. alignment with UNEP core mandate areas and a focus on the delivery of this strategy, with a strong expectation of outcomes that lead to transformative change for sustainable development; b. delivery on multiple Sustainable Development Goals, spanning the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainable development, as well as other internationally agreed environmental goals and aspirations, including the Environment Assembly resolutions; c. demonstration of new and/or innovative concepts that provide opportunities to leapfrog past outdated paradigms while maintaining a clear vision that connects with and capitalizes on the diverse expertise of external partners, enabling joint development, staffing, financing and implementation; and d. demonstration of value for money through optimal use of resources to achieve the intended outcomes. 36. UNEP will provide a clear \u201cline of sight\u201d for its delivery of the 2030 Agenda, from the internationally agreed environmental goals to regional and national action. It will pursue the global aspirations of the Sustainable Development Goals while delivering support in response to national needs and realities, and taking account of differing regional integration processes, capacities and levels of development. Through its regional offices, UNEP will increase its strategic engagement with regional inter-agency mechanisms, including regional commissions and forums on sustainable development, regional collaborative platforms4 and issue-based coalitions. This will ensure increased consensus and better institutional coherence on sustainable development while increasing the delivery of a common United Nations approach to regional Sustainable Development Goal priorities. 37. UNEP will make full use of the United Nations development system reform to extend its reach as the global environmental authority to support all Member States in their pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals. Working with and through its sister United Nations entities, UNEP will support United Nations country teams, providing 4 In line with the guidance provided by Member States in resolution E/RES/2019/15 to reposition the United Nations regional assets, the Secretary-General created a regional collaborative platform that would absorb existing, duplicative coordination mechanisms to foster collaboration on sustainable development across United Nations development system entities operating at the regional level.

UNEP will strengthen South-South and triangular cooperation5 to enable all Member States to progress towards environmental sustainability, while fostering complementarities with North-South cooperation. UNEP will promote South-South and triangular cooperation across its policy, programming and partnership activities.6 Through continued engagement with the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation and other multilateral system entities, governments and non-governmental organizations, 5 South-South cooperation is a process whereby two or more developing countries pursue their individual and/or shared national capacity development objectives through exchanges of knowledge, skills, resources and technical know-how, and through regional and interregional collective actions, including partnerships involving governments, regional organizations, civil society, academia and the private sector, for their mutual benefit within and across regions. Triangular cooperation involves southern-driven partnerships between two or more developing countries supported by a developed country(ies) or multilateral organization(s) to implement development cooperation programmes and projects (as defined in the 2016 framework of operational guidelines on United Nations support to South-South and triangular cooperation (SSC/176/3)). 6 The UNEP Strategy for South-South and Triangular Cooperation (https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/31654/ SSTC_Strategy.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), adopted in March 2020, will serve as the guiding framework for all UNEP South-South and triangular cooperation activities during the decade 2020-2030. UNEP will strengthen regional engagement and inter- agency linkages to more closely monitor and follow up on strategic and political issues related to South- South and triangular cooperation, while promoting North-South cooperation and supporting the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and Implementing Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries.7 40. UNEP will work to leave no one behind while increasing its focus on the special needs of disaster- and conflict-affected states. It will address the special needs of least developed countries, land-locked developing countries and small island developing states, facilitating access to finance, technology and innovative solutions to help them build more resilient and inclusive economies and societies in a post- COVID-19 world. In its contribution, UNEP will channel the voices of those most vulnerable to environmental degradation, including women, indigenous peoples and their communities, and children and youth. 41. Special attention will be paid to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. By focusing on the special needs of countries that are vulnerable to, or affected by, disaster and conflicts, UNEP will assist Member States in fully implementing the Sendai Framework. UNEP will assist United Nations peacekeeping, peacebuilding and humanitarian and political missions where dedicated responses to environmental dimensions of a crisis are required. To optimize prevention and preparedness, UNEP will support capacities for early warning and early action, including through building an understanding of the interlinkages between climate change, natural resource extraction, security and migration. UNEP will also engage in emergency and short- to medium-term post-crisis support, assisting Member States with integrating environmental considerations into oversight, assessment and planning for better response and recovery. 7 Adopted in 1978 by the United Nations Conference on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries.

In parallel, as the world sees ever-increasing connectivity, digitalization will become key to systematizing, integrating and democratizing environmental data, knowledge and insight for new collaboration opportunities and enhanced impact. This will be the focus of an enabling subprogramme on digital transformation. 47. UNEP will employ a three-pronged delivery approach in all of its seven subprogrammes: a. applying cutting-edge scientific advances in data collection and display; b. working with policymakers, relevant partners from science and industry, indigenous peoples and local communities, vulnerable groups, the investor community and other non-governmental actors, as well as other United Nations entities; and c. working across regions and countries and at all subnational levels to strengthen effective environmental governance and rule of law. 48.

The climate action subprogramme will operate through the following principles. a. Supporting country and stakeholder emission cuts and adaptation to climate change to facilitate stronger interactions between science, policy, finance, technology and the economy: UNEP will support countries in building public support for market and political strategies and decisions that are compatible with the latest scientific information, including from the social sciences, and promote sustainable consumption and production to achieve the largest impacts possible in terms of mitigating climate change and increasing resilience. Engagement of the finance industry and working through private- sector partnerships will be key to shifting public and private investments towards sustainable choices and business models that are adequately incentivized to support countries in achieving their climate goals and aspirations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Paris Agreement, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals. b. Supporting countries and stakeholders in achieving rapid, just and comprehensive decarbonization in line with their climate commitments and aspirations: UNEP will take a value chain and multi-sectoral approach Climate action 50. Keeping a clear focus on the Paris Agreement is essential for guiding collective climate action in line with sustainable development. Achieving long- term climate stability will depend on countries making balanced progress towards their mitigation and adaptation commitments under the Paris Agreement, including \u201cholding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C\u201d and \u201cincreasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development\u201d (UNFCCC, 2016).

Focusing on those who can contribute to the highest impact while supporting the most vulnerable: UNEP will help all countries raise the level of their mitigation ambition, with a focus on countries with the largest emissions. In parallel, UNEP will continue to support adaptation action while integrating aspects of human health, gender responsiveness, environmental security and poverty eradication, particularly in the countries that are most vulnerable and most in need, such as disaster- and conflict-affected countries, least developed countries and small island developing states. This will support the collective aspirations included in the nationally determined contributions and long-term strategies under the Paris Agreement and other strategic instruments. d. Promoting policies and actions for sustainable consumption and production practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions: UNEP will support governments, business and individuals in making informed choices to increase production of and demand for goods and services that are more resource-efficient and less emission- intensive, building on the work of relevant International Resource Panel analyzes and supporting a growing number of countries in identifying greenhouse gas emission hotspots in national economies. e. Delivering tangible results through partnerships and integrated approaches: UNEP will channel and scale up its actions through networks and partnerships, including the financial and technology mechanisms of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Global Environment Facility, the Green Climate Fund, and the Climate Technology Centre and Network and Technology Executive Committee), for increased impact. Working across the wider United Nations system to achieve better synergy, including with United Nations country teams and other United Nations entities, UNEP climate actions will follow an integrated approach that links the environment to the pillars of the work of the United Nations: peace and security, human rights and development.

UNEP will design and highlight opportunities for action in these sectors through action-oriented partnerships, including private-sector alliances, and support the country-level uptake of sustainable solutions ranging from ecosystem-based approaches to sustainable technologies and dematerialization practices, in line with national priorities. Special focus will be placed on an evidence-based introduction and uptake of better technologies, including digital technologies, for integration into sectoral and national policies and decisions. UNEP will help countries embed these opportunities in their revolving climate aspirations, linking them to adjustments in the policy and regulatory frameworks that inform nationally determined contributions and long-term strategies, as well as climate adaptation planning (e.g., early warning systems). 54. UNEP will support countries in catalyzing public support and political will for climate action. It will also support advocacy for societal change that brings climate-positive outcomes while creating jobs and enabling a just transition. UNEP will focus on generating science-driven public support for ambitious climate advocacy and supporting sustainable consumer behaviour. UNEP will continue to function as a link between policymakers and the public, leveraging, for example, the One Planet network to communicate the benefits of using sustainable products and adopting sustainable lifestyles while sharing information that supports making the economic case for such change.13 Facilitating public access to environmental information and increasing 12 Including energy, industry, agriculture, forestry, transport, buildings and finance, among others. 13 The One Planet network is a UNEP-hosted open multi- stakeholder partnership that aims to accelerate the shift towards sustainable consumption and production in both developed and developing countries and implement Sustainable Development Goal 12 under 10YFP. https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/. public awareness through formal and non-formal education, youth-led action and grassroots campaigns will be key levers of change that will shift knowledge and attitudes across society.

Outcome 3: State and non-state actors adopt the enhanced transparency framework arrangements under the Paris Agreement 58. In collaboration with its networks and partners, including the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Global Environment Facility, UNEP will help countries meet their transparency and other reporting obligations. It will also implement the enhanced transparency framework for action and support established under the Paris Agreement.14 UNEP will capitalize on its role of data-driven authority to support national institutions in tracking and reporting on climate actions, including through the development of greenhouse gas inventories; mapping progress towards their nationally determined contributions and adaptation actions; and tracking financial support provided and mobilized. The enhancement of existing national arrangements and sharpening of related regulatory frameworks will be central to these actions. Synergies will be pursued with global and regional Multilateral Environmental Agreements, including with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, with respect to the work conducted to support the transition towards the enhanced transparency framework and with the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. This will facilitate coordination and complementarity between reporting obligations and contribute to greater coherence in tracking progress in implementing decisions under the Multilateral Environmental Agreements. 59. UNEP will assist countries in assessing and better reporting on their climate-related national capabilities and circumstances, including their capacity-building and technology needs, related finance, investment and trade trends, and areas for improvement, especially for least developed countries and small island developing states. 14 Article 13 of the Paris Agreement established an enhanced transparency framework for action and support to guide countries on reporting their greenhouse gas emissions, their progress towards their nationally determined contributions, their climate change impacts and adaptation, the support provided and mobilized and the support needed and received. The enhanced transparency framework also includes processes for technical experts to review reported information and a multilateral peer review where countries can ask each other questions. 60. Through its networks and partners, UNEP will encourage non-governmental stakeholders, including the private sector and finance community, to increase coherence and transparency in the reporting of their climate actions. This will contribute to increasing global confidence in the adoption of business models and market decisions towards decarbonization and resilience pathways. 61. UNEP will help countries measure progress towards decarbonization and resilience for stronger engagement in the global stocktake process.15 UNEP will provide the best available scientific information and best practices to guide countries towards effectively assessing progress and evaluating the need for enhanced action and financial support to ratchet up the level of their climate ambition. Through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, International Resource Panel and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and its flagship reports (e.g., the Emissions Gap Report), UNEP will deploy the most up-to-date, state-of-the-art compilation of climate change metrics and sectoral knowledge. This will support country engagement in the global stocktake, increasing compliance with the Paris Agreement in a more transparent way. To that end, and in partnership with other relevant organizations, UNEP will facilitate dialogue between government actors and non-government stakeholders, including subnational authorities, businesses and civil society, to add value and increase the accuracy, accountability and relevance of the information collected and shared by decision makers. Guided by the need to ensure greater climate ambition in line with the aspirations of the nationally determined contributions and long-term strategies and other strategic instruments, UNEP will also focus on supporting countries in increasing their capacities to use climate change information in development planning and investment decisions and monitor climate finance trends as pathways to increased ambition. 15 Article 14 of the Paris Agreement established the global stocktake as its key ambition mechanism.

Living in harmony with nature means \u201cmaintaining ecosystem services, sustaining a healthy planet and delivering benefits essential for all people\u201d, as well as ensuring that \u201cbiodiversity is valued, conserved, restored and wisely used\u201d. (SCBD, 2010). Dependency on biodiversity and ecosystems, including for food, fibre, materials, water, medicines and human health, climate regulation and protection from extreme events, has been outlined clearly in assessments by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, the Global Environment Outlook and the International Resource Panel, among others. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation undermine the resilience of our economy and many critical product value chains and ultimately will prevent progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and human well-being. To facilitate a transition towards living in harmony with nature, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals and the long-term goals of the future post-2020 global biodiversity framework as agreed by Member States (SCBD, 2018a), it is expected that, by 2025: a. the implementation of the agreed post-2020 global biodiversity framework is well under way through related national planning, implementation, monitoring and reporting processes; b. biodiversity is mainstreamed (SCBD, 2018b) for sustainable development and across key themes and sectors (e.g., food and agriculture, sustainable forest management and zero deforestation, health, infrastructure, mining, tourism, trade, energy, cities, finance, governance and justice) to realize multiple benefits and avoid negative impacts on nature; c. significant actions are being taken to reduce ecosystems degradation and build the resilience of landscapes and seascapes, with ecosystem integrity and conservation being leveraged as assets and tools for disaster risk reduction and greater social resilience; and d. methodologies and tools for integrating biodiversity and ecosystems into consumer, infrastructure and financial decision making have been developed and made available for governments and financial institutions to align their policies and investment portfolios with global biodiversity targets.

The expected 2030 outcome of this UNEP subprogramme is that \u201crecovery of nature occurs and is contributing positively to human well-being.\u201d 64. The nature action subprogramme will operate through the following principles. a. Articulating a pathway to living in harmony with nature: UNEP will focus on increasing ambitions, building broad-based support and partnerships for transformational change for sustainable development, strengthening policy and regulatory frameworks and scaling up best practices. These actions will deliver science-based solutions for nature across sectors and levels of governance to halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem integrity, which are key to many economic activities and the provision of goods and services critical for human welfare. Together, these actions will set the world on a pathway to ensuring well-functioning ecosystems and environmental safeguards, poverty eradication, social resilience, the creation of green and decent jobs, and a resilient economic and trade system based on more sustainable consumption and production patterns that are in line with internationally agreed norms and standards. b. Realizing impact and strength through partnerships: UNEP will strengthen its strategic partnerships with organizations at the global, regional, national and local levels to support Member States in building their capacities, including through facilitating access to appropriate financial and technology-related means, towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the three goals of the Convention on Biological Diversity and its protocols,16 as well as the agreed post- 2020 global biodiversity framework and the relevant decisions of the governing bodies of other Multilateral Environmental Agreements.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "118484e4-5e16-4e81-9b9c-0d5db202ba1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "118484e4-5e16-4e81-9b9c-0d5db202ba1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/people-and-planet-unep-strategy-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "For people and planet: the UNEP strategy for 2022\u20132025", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/people-and-planet-unep-strategy-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0ae2d85e381604aa2d65427d55b65d6e2e7cc08fb56f11d13900e0ea642f244"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5f39c52-f93e-4809-bbfb-16ff50d0c441", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/people-and-planet-unep-strategy-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3b888a5279a9286e85dd4993951a07316d5c455db0ad5bfd846749bdc9c6ee1"}}, "hash": "5d5ded0c9c687979a120920a78d4fadb72fb09bf5ee4ea3c88b62414d5f3d574", "text": "UNEP will contribute data, knowledge and technical expertise to the United Nations Sustainable Development Group teams at the global, regional and national levels to address environmental concerns, promote better", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f92f370d-64a1-485d-9392-80a835f0be2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f92f370d-64a1-485d-9392-80a835f0be2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/people-and-planet-unep-strategy-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "For people and planet: the UNEP strategy for 2022\u20132025", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/people-and-planet-unep-strategy-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95e5bd9bb45d6426cc9c666af02d885b3f3542d6b24c78a6432c2737c9f67530"}}, "hash": "95e5bd9bb45d6426cc9c666af02d885b3f3542d6b24c78a6432c2737c9f67530", "text": "utilization and management of natural resources and integrate biodiversity and ecosystem-based approaches into the planning and delivery of national sustainable development frameworks and Sustainable Development Goal strategies.

The nature action subprogramme will focus on the comparative advantage of UNEP to achieve three 2025 outcomes Outcome 1: An economically and socially sustainable pathway for halting and reversing the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem integrity is established 65. UNEP will assist Member States in developing integrated strategies for achieving a sustainable balance between human prosperity and the sustainability of the natural resource base underpinning socioeconomic development. This will require deep transformations in our current economic systems, which currently privatize benefits while externalizing environmental costs and contributing substantially to inequalities. UNEP, in collaboration with its partners, will support these transformations by assisting Member States in developing sustainable economic pathways that benefit both people and nature and through mobilizing public support for the nature agenda. A recognition of the true value of nature, as well as of the cost of its degradation, are essential for the transition to a more sustainable and resilient economy. UNEP will tailor tools and guidance for the valuation of natural capital and the design and implementation of policies and practices supporting the shift to sustainable consumption and production. It will also refine nationally relevant metrics for measuring inclusive wealth and promoting their use in development planning processes, with close reference to the targets and indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as those agreed under the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. UNEP will also assist countries in developing integrated national infrastructure plans that prioritize ecosystems and ecosystem-based approaches, including natural infrastructure. 66. UNEP will support countries in developing policies and incentives that address the drivers of biodiversity loss and promote sustainable and inclusive economic activities in line with multilaterally agreed norms and standards. It will assist countries in developing biodiversity-based economies as an important component of their national economic development that will ensure sustainability and equitable benefit sharing, and build social and environmental resilience. 67. UNEP will support countries in developing the necessary policies, legislation and strategies to make progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and implement their respective obligations under Multilateral Environmental Agreements while strengthening national institutions and mechanisms to monitor and report on related progress. 68. UNEP will promote social and behavioural change and support sustainable education and youth-led action with outreach campaigns and public engagement and by engaging with formal and non-formal education activities that shift knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and norms to address the indirect drivers of biodiversity loss and the degradation of nature. UNEP will also work with standard-setting and labelling schemes to promote and improve existing consumer information tools by including criteria of the effect of key products on biodiversity, in line with multilaterally agreed norms and standards. 69. UNEP will assist United Nations system entities in leading by example, meaning that they conduct their operations sustainably and disclose progress against key sustainability measures, including biodiversity performance metrics. Outcome 2: Sustainable management of nature is adopted and implemented in development frameworks 70.

UNEP will align its actions with the agreed objectives of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, without pre-empting its development, working with United Nations system entities and other partners to support countries in its implementation and mainstreaming it into national processes and development frameworks. UNEP support will capitalize on the organization\u2019s experience in boosting the financial and technical capacity of countries to fulfil their biodiversity commitments, including through the support of Global Environment Facility. This will enable countries to, for example, apply science-based approaches for the sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services and restore and protect the functional capacity and connectivity within and between freshwater, terrestrial and marine ecosystems. UNEP will also promote and reinforce ecosystem-based ocean governance based on the Regional Seas Programme and implement its organizational mandate as a custodian of several Sustainable Development Goals, assisting all Member States with protecting and restoring freshwater ecosystems and the wealth of freshwater biodiversity they contain. 72. UNEP will support policies and actions on sustainable consumption and production to conserve, restore and safely manage biodiversity and ecosystems. UNEP will support Member States, cities, business and consumers in the re-use, recycling and more efficient, less polluting use of products and materials that tend to have a strong impact on nature, including through a value chain approach and support for indigenous peoples and local communities. 73. UNEP will collaborate with United Nations agencies, funds and programmes to support Member States in strengthening biodiversity and health linkages to manage and reduce risks for both human and ecosystem health and to integrate nature into national and international public health decision making through science-based approaches. In a post-pandemic context, this requires addressing nature degradation as a root cause of zoonotic disease and other novel biological introductions. Work on establishing more sustainable food value chains will be central to this effort, given that so many zoonoses are triggered by unsustainable patterns of food consumption and production. UNEP will also work with partners to strengthen the capacity of countries to implement the One Health approach, focusing on biosecurity measures, and to support the development and subsequent implementation of the Global Plan of Action on Biodiversity and Health. UNEP will also support efforts to mainstream biodiversity for health and nutrition. 74. UNEP will develop and promote frameworks and norms for biodiversity-related financing and infrastructure. By leveraging the enabling subprogramme portfolio on finance and economic transformation, UNEP will support the integration of biodiversity and ecosystem service considerations and related risks into financial and economic decision making. UNEP will provide guidance to governments and financial institutions to achieve positive outcomes for people and nature, in line with the agreed post-2020 global biodiversity framework and relevant environmental targets of the Sustainable Development Goals, focusing on economic sectors with a high impact and dependency on nature. UNEP will also support the development of innovative conservation funding mechanisms that support livelihood opportunities for indigenous peoples and local communities while building sustainability and resilience and strengthening their rights. 75. UNEP will promote the sustainability and transparency of value chains and production methods.

UNEP will support sustainable habitat management through transformative processes and outcomes, including large-scale ecosystem restoration, complemented by social and behaviour change, to minimize damage to highly valued ecosystems, including damage from disasters, conflict and climate change. UNEP will support Member States\u2019 actions to prevent and mitigate ecosystem degradation to restore nature and build back resilience, including through ecosystem-based approaches to disaster risk reduction. For forest ecosystems, UNEP will work with partners and through networks on advancing and strengthening the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries as a platform for halting forest loss and degradation. Together with the FAO, UNEP will lead the United Nations system in implementing the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021 \u20142030 in marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems.

UNEP will continue to assist Member States in strengthening the environmental performance of sustainable and restorative agriculture models through promotion of resource-efficient practices for nature, including but not limited to agro-ecology and regenerative agriculture, in collaboration with its partners. UNEP will enhance its contribution to these objectives by building on its work on, among other things, sustainable land use, natural capital accounting, sustainable consumption and production, landscape management and ecosystem restoration. UNEP will continue to support countries in restoring, sustainably using and conserving freshwater ecosystems to secure the provision of freshwater for the sustainable development of sectors and society. It will continue to support integrated coastal zone management and marine spatial planning and cooperate with relevant organizations. It will also continue to provide guidance for increased knowledge and institutional capacity to Medium-Term Strategy 2022\u20142025 | 31 Chemicals and pollution action 79. Preventing, controlling and managing pollution is central to improving health, human well-being and prosperity for all. Good environmental quality and its positive implications for reducing inequity, ill health, poverty and vulnerability are powerful motivation for moving towards a pollution-free planet. A pollution-free planet would positively impact biodiversity and enhance the health of ecosystems by preventing further damage while increasing resilience. Addressing air pollution and waste is also linked to climate change mitigation, especially when action is taken against short-lived climate pollutants. Chemicals and waste can also be a resource for job creation through reuse as secondary materials. Accelerated action on chemicals and pollution will result in benefits for both nature and people and will be aligned with the beyond 2020 framework for sound management of chemicals and waste, as agreed on by Member States.17 Scaling up action on chemicals and waste also builds on UNEP experience in the development of large multi-focal- area projects funded under Global Environment Facility. A transition towards a pollution-free planet in line with the Sustainable Development Goals recognizes that, by 2025: a. the actions adopted in the agreed beyond 2020 framework for sound management of chemicals and waste are taken on board in national planning and development; b. 30 per cent of the world\u2019s population lives in areas where WHO Air Quality Interim Target 3 for outdoor PM2.5 (a fine particulate matter) is attained;18 c. actions towards modifying economy-wide nitrogen use are in place to halve the losses of anthropogenic 17 http://www.saicm.org/Beyond2020/IntersessionalProcess/ tabid/5500/Default.aspx. 18 The WHO Air Quality Guideline for outdoor air quality is set at a level intended to be protective of human health.

The expected 2030 outcome of this UNEP subprogramme is that significant progress is made towards a pollution-free planet, particularly through the delivery of the Towards A Pollution-Free Planet Implementation Plan. 81. The chemicals and pollution action subprogramme will operate through the following principles. a. Recognizing that sustainable consumption and production and sound chemicals and waste management are intrinsically linked and mutually interdependent: UNEP will support the design and implementation of policies and business practices that reduce harmful chemicals in products and processes. It will also enable consumers to make informed choices about products and related waste. This is in recognition of the importance of adopting resource-efficient and sustainable production practices and avoiding the reintroduction of, or exposure to, toxic materials to the value chain or the environment. Sustainable consumption and production results in lower throughputs of materials, less waste and lower health risks. b. Working through partnerships towards a pollution- free planet: UNEP will maintain a strong focus on addressing various pollution streams and leveraging collaboration with partners, including the Global Environment Facility secretariat, and the Multilateral Environmental Agreements (the Minamata Convention on Mercury, the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions and the Montreal Protocol). UNEP will work through global, regional and subregional networks, forums and coalitions focused on pollution reduction, such as the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, antimicrobial resistance through the One Health alliance, and regional ministerial forums on health and the environment. UUNEP will collaborate with other United Nations entities \u2013 including WHO, the FAO, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and UNDP \u2013 and other organizations, including the World Bank, the World Trade Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, scientific institutions, national agencies, 19 As per the Colombo Declaration on Sustainable Nitrogen Management, which followed the adoption of Environment Assembly resolution 4/14 on sustainable nitrogen management. 20 Sustainable Development Goal indicator 6.3.1: Proportion of domestic and industrial wastewater flows safely treated; indicator 12.3.1: (a) food loss index; and (b) food waste index; indicator 12.4.1: number of parties to international Multilateral Environmental Agreements on hazardous waste, and other chemicals that meet their commitments and obligations in transmitting information as required by each relevant agreement; indicator 12.4.2: (a) hazardous waste generated per capita; and (b) proportion of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment; and indicator 14.1.1: (a) index of coastal eutrophication; and (b) plastic debris density.

Recognizing that global and regional environmental agreements provide a collaborative framework for governance and time-bound actions: While Multilateral Environmental Agreements are key to sound management of chemicals and waste, important implementation challenges remain, including: availability of data, information and knowledge; policy design; adequate legislation; implementation and enforcement capacity and compliance mechanisms; availability of infrastructure and accessible clean technologies; institutional and technical capacity; business and industry leadership; intersectoral collaboration and transboundary cooperation; and true-cost pricing. UNEP will support countries in developing the necessary policies, strategies and legislation to implement their respective obligations under the Multilateral Environmental Agreements while strengthening national institutions and mechanisms to monitor and report on related progress. d. Responding to country priorities and needs to reduce and prevent pollution: UNEP will assist in identifying the types and extent of pollution and offer remedial and preventive actions, highlighting the importance of investing in local and national pollution action, including through the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework. UNEP will promote mutual learning and transfer of effective policies, good practices, experiences, initiatives and green technologies within and across countries and local contexts.

Outcome 2: Waste management is improved, including through circular processes, safe recovery of secondary raw materials and progressive reduction of open burning and dump sites 86. UNEP will mainstream the 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle) and circular processes across waste flows while ensuring safe secondary raw materials recovery. UNEP will identify innovative solutions to build circularity across resource- and chemicals-intensive industry sectors. It will work with companies, research institutions, the waste management sector, civil society groups, and other stakeholders, in accordance with the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, to offer alternatives to current linear economic models. It will also work with municipalities and development organizations to create local employment opportunities. It also involves mainstreaming pollution reduction and sound management of chemicals and waste into development and humanitarian action and helping relevant actors address environmental risk factors negatively affecting the health of the most vulnerable populations. 87. UNEP will support countries and stakeholders in reducing the use of materials, energy, water and agricultural inputs through the adoption of resource- efficient and circular approaches whenever possible. Such approaches can reduce waste streams and improve secondary flows, provided these are free of toxins, while enabling resource access, affordability, availability and sustainability for all, resulting in job creation and improving community health and climate resilience. 88. UNEP will support efforts to identify and close open dumpsites, in partnership with entities such as the International Solid Waste Association and United Nations Human Settlement Programme, and encourage national and local efforts for mandatory waste collection and segregation at source. 89. UNEP will scale up ongoing efforts on greening waste and wastewater management infrastructure. It will support governments at all levels in developing, implementing and complying with resilient and effective waste and wastewater management systems and sustainable infrastructure, including natural infrastructure.26 Partners will include multilateral development banks, wastewater and solid waste management associations, and the private sector, and supporting action will include adopting ecosystem-based approaches and upstream solutions that promote circularity and can be monitored using key environmental, health and climate indicators. 26 The term \u201cnatural infrastructure\u201d refers to a strategically planned and managed network of natural lands, such as forests and wetlands, working landscapes and other open spaces, that conserves or enhances ecosystem values and functions and provides associated benefits to human populations. 34 | Medium-Term Strategy 2022\u20142025 Outcome 3: Releases of pollutants to air, water, soil and the ocean are reduced 90. UNEP will support the shift away from the generation, production and use of harmful chemicals that pose a risk to human health and the environment while promoting sound management of chemicals and waste in general. UNEP will continue working to minimize the adverse effects of such chemicals on human health and the environment, supporting the implementation of the Multilateral Environmental Agreements and the agreed beyond-2020 framework for sound management of chemicals and waste. UNEP, with partners, will aim to ensure that regulations, standards and policies are in place to facilitate the shift to safer alternatives. It will strive for the identification, phasing-out and sound management of chemicals in products and processes to reduce the risks to human health and the environment and minimize the waste and pollution generated. UNEP will increase and disseminate knowledge on chemicals of public health concern,27 develop and implement methodologies and tools for tracking and controlling such chemicals and support sectors in designing products and processes that are safer and cleaner, including through green and sustainable chemistry. Safe production processes and safeguards will benefit from fiscal instruments that reflect the polluter pays principle and correct for market failures. 91. UNEP will influence producer, procurement and investment decisions regarding chemicals use by fostering more informed consumer choices based on awareness of the environmental footprint of products consumed and used. Sustainable and responsible consumption choices will be aided by increased awareness, accurate and relevant information, and fiscal incentives, as well as by ensuring consumer engagement by providing reliable sustainability information.

Providing authoritative science, delivered with greater coherence and integration: UNEP will continue to be an authoritative voice on the environment in the global scientific community, collecting, analyzing and synthesizing scientific data that speaks to the interconnected challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. The signature, policy-relevant scientific assessments of UNEP include its flagship Global Environment Outlook reports, the Emissions Gap and Adaptation Gap reports, the Frontiers reports, the World Water Quality assessment report and the Global Resources Outlook, Global Waste Management Outlook and Global Chemicals Outlook reports. UNEP will ensure these assessments complement and connect with the existing scientific literature to increase their impact and uptake in policymaking. To that end, UNEP will continue facilitating the Ad Hoc Global Assessments Dialogue,29 involving the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, the International Resource Panel and the processes for the development of the Global Environmental Outlook and the Global Sustainable Development Report, among others. UNEP will add value to these processes by proposing systematic and integrated solutions to the challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, based on a systemic and trans-disciplinary analysis of their interconnections in relation to socioeconomic and equity issues. Through the mutual sharing of data and information, methods and tools, key findings and expertise, this process will suggest policy options to move from business as usual towards sustainability in a cost-effective manner. The dialogue will also contribute to the preparation and delivery of coherent and mutually reinforcing messages that can inform international negotiations and decisions in the framework of Multilateral Environmental 29 The Ad Hoc Global Assessments Dialogue builds on Member States\u2019 request, in Environment Assembly resolution 4/23, on keeping the world environment under review: enhancing the United Nations Environment Programme science-policy interface and endorsement of the Global Environment Outlook, that the Executive Director of UNEP \u201ccontinue to promote greater coherence and coordination of global assessments undertaken within the United Nations system and in cooperation with relevant international bodies and the secretariats of the Multilateral Environmental Agreements.\u201d UNEP delivers scientifically credible and unbiased data, information and knowledge and provides policy-relevant analysis and recommendations to catalyze and accelerate solutions and actions for the environment based on continuous global status and trends.

The science-policy subprogramme will focus on the following actions and interventions to underpin the achievements of the UNEP thematic subprogrammes. a. Increasing the uptake of science for transformative action: UNEP will provide expertise on environmental matters, bringing the latest scientific evidence and multidisciplinary analysis on the state of the world environment and related trends to the attention of policy and decision makers at all levels and the public at large. UNEP will build the capacities of government and non-government actors at national and local levels to take up the latest scientific information to inform policy development and drive transformative and systemic actions on the challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution while pre-empting the rise of other environmental challenges. The subprogramme will reach beyond the environmental community and make the case for putting the environment at the centre of economic and social decision making. Foundational subprogrammes 36 | Medium-Term Strategy 2022\u20142025 Agreements and other internationally agreed frameworks, as well as global environmental platforms such as the United Nations Environment Assembly. c. Closing the gap regarding the availability of environmental data is essential for assessing and reviewing progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and fostering synergies among the Multilateral Environmental Agreements: UNEP will continue to measure and monitor countries\u2019 progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and other internationally agreed environmental goals, providing timely data analysis and early warnings for policy and decision makers. UNEP will contribute to easing the burden of country reporting on progress by building as much as possible on existing credible data and reliable baselines and by aligning its reporting requirements with the Sustainable Development Goals indicators. UNEP will facilitate open-access and inter-institutional data and information exchanges, including at the national, regional and subnational levels. Pursuing greater scientific collaboration with the global and regional Multilateral Environmental Agreements, as well as facilitating coordination and exchanges among the Multilateral Environmental Agreements themselves, while respecting their mandates, will allow for greater harmonization of country data and methodologies for tracking progress. It will also facilitate better analysis and comparability for decision making. d. Digitizing scientific knowledge and democratizing availability while anticipating emerging issues through foresight and horizon scanning: Digital tools and technologies can accelerate the integration of environmental analysis with social and economic data, as well as better equip decision makers at all levels to assess the effectiveness, relevance and impact of global environmental policies. To that end, the World Environment Situation Room will be an asset for UNEP intervention at the local, regional and international levels. In line with the aspirations of a new global environmental data strategy,30 UNEP will continue to leverage the Situation Room as a leading global digital environmental platform for enabling governments, the public at large, as well as the broader United Nations system and particularly United Nations country teams, 30 Through the ministerial declaration of the United Nations Environment Assembly at its fourth session, \u201cInnovative solutions for environmental challenges and sustainable consumption and production\u201d (UNEP/EA.4/HLS.1), Member States committed themselves to supporting UNEP in developing a global environmental data strategy by 2025 in cooperation with other United Nations bodies.

UNEP will pursue broad stakeholder engagement as a critical step in enhancing societal understanding, acceptance and uptake of its scientific analysis. Through platforms and networks such as the Science- Policy-Business Forum on the Environment, the International Resource Panel, the World Adaptation Science Programme and the One Planet network, among others, UNEP will serve as a knowledge broker that builds consensus around existing and emerging environmental issues. UNEP will be a facilitator that enables partnerships and joint action across stakeholders from the scientific and policy communities, with societal endorsement. Communication and advocacy will remain key tools to spur societal engagement. To that end, UNEP will communicate its scientific information in a language that is accessible to all and that can influence and stimulate inclusive decision making and environmental action at the appropriate scale and pace. UNEP will contribute to climate stability by providing scientific information that measures progress towards carbon neutrality and resilience and assesses the potential and risks associated with the measures applied. It will compile, assess and communicate the latest climate-related scientific data and propose policy options to help public- and private-sector decision makers engage in ambitious climate actions in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. UNEP will make living in harmony with nature a reality by providing the scientific information and data needed to secure policies and actions for nature. Science will be the basis for justifying the uptake of such systemic policies, actions and solutions across all sectors to halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem integrity in line with the targets and goals of the agreed post-2020 global biodiversity framework. UNEP will take us towards a pollution-free planet by facilitating access to up-to-date, credible and relevant scientific information, data and statistics on chemicals, waste, and pollution. This will encourage systemic shifts towards less polluting outcomes at all levels of governance and in all relevant segments of society, including consumers, and inform the design and implementation of the necessary regulatory frameworks and policies. UNEP will put science at the centre of sound environmental governance. Access to the latest environmental information, horizon scanning and informed analysis of the interconnections between the three mutually reinforcing crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution will drive coherent, more system-level decision making towards more effective legal and institutional environmental frameworks at the national and regional levels, including the agreed post-2020 frameworks, and stronger human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment for all. UNEP will ensure that sound science supports finance and economic transformations. It will triangulate science with the policy and business community to nudge finance and market systems towards sustainable shifts, advocate for the adoption of sustainable consumption and production patterns at all levels and accelerate societal changes towards more circular economic and business models. UNEP will leverage digital transformations to digitize scientific knowledge and democratize its availability. It will capitalize on the World Environment Situation Room as the prime global digital platform for enabling governments and the public at large to visualize the state and performance of the world environment, drawing attention to new and emerging environmental issues and offering an analysis of the effectiveness and impact of existing environmental policies, underpinned by economic and social data. Science-policy: a foundation 38 | Medium-Term Strategy 2022\u20142025 Environmental governance 96. Environmental governance is the institutional and legal architecture needed to make environmental goals and commitments a reality. Supporting countries in developing and implementing environmental policies in an integrated manner and abiding by strong legal and institutional frameworks that effectively achieve environmental goals in the context of sustainable development at the global, regional and national levels is part of UNEP\u2019s core work. This subprogramme supports coherent decision making towards more effective legal and institutional frameworks that underpin the achievement of internationally agreed goals for climate, biodiversity and pollution in the context of the 2030 Agenda. 97.

UNEP will make living in harmony with nature a reality by supporting countries in developing legislation that has impact. Countries will receive support in developing the necessary policies, legislation and strategies to implement their respective obligations under the Multilateral Environmental Agreements in a coherent manner while strengthening national institutions and mechanisms for monitoring and reporting on related progress. In this context, UNEP will provide guidelines and tools for effective implementation. UNEP will progress towards a pollution-free planet by advocating for the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. Countries will receive support in developing the necessary policies, legislation and strategies to implement their respective obligations under the Multilateral Environmental Agreements in a coherent manner. In this context, UNEP will provide guidelines and tools for effective implementation. The Montevideo Programme can accelerate policy shifts towards the sound management of waste, including marine litter, with a focus on the environment and health nexus. UNEP will continue to support human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment. UNEP will use the science-policy interface to support strong environmental governance. National governance frameworks will be strengthened through the promotion of information and data exchange, education, capacity- building and technical assistance, to strengthen national environmental governance systems and improve the environmental rule of law based on proven scientific evidence. UNEP will promote integration of the environmental dimension when supporting finance and economic transformations. Strengthening the environmental dimension of economic policy decisions will lead to enhanced coherence in approaches to sustainable development and the uptake of sustainable development in national planning and policymaking. It will also assist countries in drawing up and implementing effective policy, and enabling frameworks that cut pollution through cleaner economic activities that also reduce biodiversity loss. UNEP will use digital transformations for coherent and inclusive environmental governance. UNEP will accelerate support for the scale-up of knowledge management and data reporting at the national level. This will support countries in the coherent implementation of the Multilateral Environmental Agreements and increase the understanding of the data linkages between climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution in the context of sustainable development, including as it pertains to human health.

Medium-Term Strategy 2022\u20142025 | 41 Finance and economic transformations 98. Shifting finance and business practices towards sustainable patterns of consumption and production \u2013 and towards reducing climate impacts, biodiversity loss and pollution \u2013 is crucial to realizing the aspirations of the 2030 Agenda. Important opportunities exist to decarbonize and manage resources more responsibly while also addressing sustainability, poverty, equity, employment, economic growth, security and health objectives. Three of the six One Planet network programmes are helping to create enabling environments and shift markets and preferences: sustainable public procurement, consumer information, and sustainable lifestyles and education. With digital technologies and connectivity, new ways for natural resources to support sustainable and inclusive rural and urban transformation are being tested and piloted. UNEP will build on and integrate its decades-long normative work on sustainable finance, the inclusive green economy and sustainable trade, consumption and production and will leverage the United Nations reform and its partnerships to take such initiatives to scale in countries in support of an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable post-COVID-19 recovery and environmental sustainability. 99. The finance and economic transformations subprogramme will focus on the following actions and interventions to facilitate the achievements of the UNEP thematic subprogrammes. a. Building on and integrating UNEP initiatives in support of inclusive green economies in countries: Bringing together its many complementary initiatives, UNEP will assist countries in drawing up and implementing effective frameworks for sustainable consumption and production, including resource efficiency and circularity, and reflecting them in relevant national plans and policies.35 UNEP will support practices that reduce pollution and address drivers of biodiversity loss through cleaner, more resource-efficient economic activities that improve climate stability, reduce biodiversity loss and move economies and societies towards a pollution-free world. Activities will include support for re-purposing subsidies and fiscal and pricing reforms for sustainability and a transition to inclusive green economies, which will be implemented through United Nations country teams and partners. b. Supporting business models and policies for accelerating sustainable consumption and production, including through resource-efficient and circular approaches:36 UNEP and its networks, including the One Planet network, the Partnership for Action on Green Economy, the Green Growth Knowledge Platform and Global Opportunities for Sustainable Development Goals, will support countries, cities and businesses in accelerating a transition to value chains that are more circular, cleaner and more resource-efficient, among other pathways to accelerating sustainable consumption and production. This ranges from the extraction and use of natural resources to product design, sustainable management and circularity of material flows, creation of the right sustainability incentives and enabling of policy frameworks for circularity and sustainable materials, as well as business ideas for various industry sectors, such as construction and infrastructure. UNEP will use enabling tools, such as sustainable public procurement, education and consumer information, to influence behaviour and shift consumption, as well as underlying assessment methodologies, such as urban metabolism, circular jobs and life-cycle approaches, to identify new opportunities. These approaches can be adjusted to target and support small and vulnerable suppliers and markets, taking into consideration global, regional, national and local contexts. The digital ecosystem will be harnessed to maximize sustainability gains from the transformation and monitor its impacts, guided by data analytics using science and consumer-based approaches. Digital technologies can also ensure access to better choices, addressing sectoral hot-spots, nudges and incentives that can complement informed choices and increase information on efficient and resilient value chains. They can also help consumers identify and purchase goods and services that are more sustainable, more efficient and less polluting. 35 See Environment Assembly resolution 4/1 on innovative pathways to achieve sustainable consumption and production. 36 See Environment Assembly resolution 4/1.

Accelerating the alignment of finance with sustainability objectives and policy priorities: The UNEP Finance Initiative will work through its various normative initiatives, such as the Principles for Responsible Banking, the Principles for Sustainable Insurance, the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance and the Principles for Positive Impact Finance, to align banking, insurance and investment practices to support inclusive green economy transformations. UNEP will work with its partners to scale up its engagement with industry, business and investor communities to shift towards a greater sense of responsibility to people and the environment in high-impact sectors, such as extractives, infrastructure and agriculture. UNEP will seek to promote access to sustainable digital finance that is gender-responsive, including for micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises. d. Supporting cities, infrastructure, buildings and construction in urban and peri-urban areas to become more resource efficient, circular and clean: With the onslaught of COVID-19, cities and urban dwellers were fully exposed to their dependence on nature and their sometimes fragile value chains for bringing food and critical supplies, with the pandemic coming on top of a housing crisis and exacerbating existing inequalities. The findings from the International Resource Panel \u2013 such as the Weight of Cities report \u2013 and the work of 10YFP will inform a systems approach aimed at transforming finance, governance, business models and key sectors in urban areas to increase their resilience to pandemics and other shocks and scarcities. UNEP will focus on more sustainable and resilient value chains in the food, buildings, mobility, extractives and energy sectors, and it will spur integrated approaches to planning and design, particularly in public and private infrastructure, connecting grey, blue and sustainable infrastructure.37 In doing this, UNEP will work with the United Nations Human Settlement Programme in support of subnational governments, given their essential role in creating change and implementing policy decisions, as well as across all levels of government. e. Catalyzing green investment for an inclusive and sustainable rural transformation in support of jobs and ecological resilience and restoration: In the context of COVID-19 and other socioeconomic 37 This will build on the GEF Sustainable Cities Impact Programme, with an integrated approach and emphasis given to circularity, ecosystem-based approaches through integrated planning and design, and greening of cities to enhance quality of life.

UNEP will work with other United Nations entities and its partners in government and industry to provide sustained long-term support for a sustainable recovery. It will use advanced tools to support restoration of degraded ecosystems and investment in nature for new job opportunities, biodiversity enhancement and climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as to support the transition to sustainable agriculture and food systems, and to enhance inclusive environmental governance for natural resource management more generally. f. Providing inclusive wealth statistics to better inform the links between natural assets, poverty and inequality and thereby enhance the capacity of Member States to deliver on the 2030 Agenda (UNEP, 2018): Poverty and inequality are likely to influence other trends in the post-pandemic world, as suggested in the latest report of the Secretary- General on progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (E/2020/57). Climate change and biodiversity loss, combined with the impact of the pandemic, will hit the poorest hard, aggravating existing disparities and pushing people below the poverty line. UNEP\u2019s work on inclusive wealth will support national statistics offices in their efforts to monitor the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals and develop a statistical infrastructure for inclusive wealth statistics, which will present an opportunity to explicitly define the recovery from COVID-19 in terms of sustainable development, linking to the aspirations of the Paris Agreement and the Beyond GDP38 movement. 38 The Beyond GDP initiative is about developing indicators that are as clear and appealing as GDP, but more inclusive of environmental and social aspects of progress.

UNEP will support countries in transitioning towards a pollution-free planet by promoting the internalization of the true costs of pollution in financial and economic decisions by public and private actors, to redirect finance and investments towards cleaner and safer economic activities, more responsible behaviour, healthier people and a healthier planet. It will recognize the intrinsic links and mutual interdependence of sustainable consumption and production and sound chemicals and waste management by adopting a system-wide value-chain approach to addressing pollution. UNEP will leverage the science-policy interface by drawing on robust and relevant science and data to enhance the understanding, acceptance and uptake of sustainable choices by actors along the value chain, including economic policymakers and the financial sector, and to inform public and private investment. UNEP will leverage environmental governance frameworks, in partnership with non-state actors, to address support and strengthen the institutions that guide and shape market behaviour and promote coherent and integrated approaches to addressing unsustainable patterns of consumption and production. It will aim to mainstream aspects of sustainable finance and economics into sectoral, institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks. UNEP will enhance its use of digitalization to make sustainable finance more accessible and better adapted to public and private users of all sizes and to bring footprint and life-cycle information to consumers, businesses and policymakers. It will also engage partners to reduce the environmental footprint of the information and communications technology sector.

Digitalization is sweeping the planet \u2014 changing our economy, society, institutions and even our humanity. However, this does not always happen in an inclusive, equitable or sustainable manner. The High- level Panel on Digital Cooperation (2019) reports that the digital transformation has implications for all 17 Sustainable Development Goals and their 169 targets,39 while the World Economic Forum (2018) estimates that artificial intelligence alone has over 80 different applications for the environment, including through transforming traditional sectors and systems to address climate change, protect biodiversity and bolster human well-being. 101. UNEP has the responsibility to integrate environmental and sustainability norms and goals into the global digital economy.40 It will therefore use digital tools to accelerate and amplify impact across its three thematic subprogrammes and bring more transparency to our knowledge of the state of our planet. In line with the Secretary-General\u2019s road map for digital cooperation (A/74/821), the Secretary- General\u2019s data strategy and the System-wide Road Map for Innovating United Nations Data and Statistics (CEB/2020/1/Add.1), UNEP will use digital entry points and digital ecosystems strategically to embed relevant 39 Of the 169 Sustainable Development Goal targets, 103 are directly influenced by a combination of seven digital technologies, including: digital access, fast Internet, cloud computing, Internet of things, artificial intelligence, extended reality and blockchains (GeSI and Deloitte, 2019). 40 In Environment Assembly resolution 4/23, on keeping the world environment under review, Member States recognized the existence of gaps in knowledge about the state of the environment resulting from a lack of current data and of information generation and dissemination, and they requested UNEP to develop and prioritize a long-term data strategy in support of the identification of comparable methods for data collection and analysis and promotion of their harmonization, and the improvement of platforms that provide a repository function to allow open access to up-to-date, quality-assured, credible and relevant data. Under that mandate, along with the other mandates provided in the resolution, UNEP has an institutional responsibility to integrate environmental and sustainability values and goals into the global digital economy. environmental data and analytics into the work of the entire United Nations system. UNEP will also consider how to align the digital transformation subprogramme with the key recommendations of the Secretary- General\u2019s road map for digital cooperation. 102.

Inclusive multilateralism for stronger global environmental governance 115. UNEP will value and uphold inclusivity to promote transparent and accountable environmental governance at all levels. In today\u2019s rapidly changing environment, UNEP will strive to maintain high ambition in global environmental multilateralism, focusing not only on current challenges and opportunities but also on emerging needs, particularly those of future generations, and the need for digital cooperation on global environmental issues. 116. UNEP will build an inclusive environmental multilateralism to mobilize all those who can influence the changes needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Nearly 30 years after its adoption at the 1992 Earth Summit, Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development \u2013 one of the cornerstones of stakeholder engagement in environmental policy and decision making \u2013 remains as relevant as ever.42 Powerful young voices within a revamped worldwide environmental movement have shown the power of committed individuals to influence decisions on planetary justice. In commemorating the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Charter of the United Nations, the Secretary-General stressed 42 Principle 10 reads: \u201cEnvironmental issues are best handled with the participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level. At the national level, everyone shall have appropriate access to information concerning the environment that is held by public authorities, including information on hazardous materials and activities in their communities, and the opportunity to participate in decision making processes. States shall facilitate and encourage public awareness and participation by making information widely available. Effective access to judicial and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be provided.\u201d the need for \u201can inclusive multilateralism, drawing on the indispensable contributions of civil society, business, cities, regions and, in particular, with greater weight given to the voices of youth\u201d (United Nations Secretary-General, 2020b). UNEP will leverage these new-found societal commitments to engage in strategic partnerships with major groups and stakeholders43 and the public at large, benefiting from their effective technical and advocacy functions. As part of this engagement, UNEP will continue to promote faith-based organizations and communities as custodians of far-reaching, value-based perspectives on environmental sustainability that speak to billions of people around the world. 117. UNEP will leverage the United Nations Environment Assembly \u2013 the world\u2019s highest- level decision making body on the environment \u2013 as the primary global platform for environmental action. Environment Assembly sessions serve as an opportunity for the international community across all sectors, levels of government and walks of life to come together to discuss and address global environmental issues. Driven by sound science, the Environment Assembly will continue to inspire, identify and capture bold transformative actions for the environment while focusing on solutions that speak to all. UNEP will support the Environment Assembly in enhancing its relationship with the Multilateral Environmental Agreements and its contribution to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, by strengthening convergence and dialogue on common strategic actions and shared experiences and providing increased visibility to the decisions of the governing bodies of the Multilateral Environmental Agreements. 118. UNEP will support stronger engagement with the private sector as a key partner in driving systemic shifts to sustainable pathways. Building on its strategy for private-sector engagement (UNEP, 2020b), UNEP will engage the private sector in significant shifts that will result in the generation of sound policies and sustainable technologies, including digital technologies, informed by state- of-the-art scientific knowledge.

This document presents the programme of work for the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) for the biennium 2022-2023, along with the associated budget. The programme of work sets out the UNEP results framework for the biennium, focused on the three strategic objectives outlined in the medium- term strategy. 2. Section I of the document describes the UNEP results framework in terms of a set of integrated interventions measured by relevant indicators, in line with the medium-term strategy. It sets out a theory of change for each of the three strategic objectives of the medium-term strategy: climate stability, living in harmony with nature and towards a pollution-free planet. The results framework sets out the core UNEP areas of work, consisting of three principal areas of action (encapsulated in the climate action, nature action and chemicals and pollution action thematic subprogrammes) supported by two foundational subprogrammes (science-policy and environmental governance) and two enabling subprogrammes (finance and economic transformations and digital transformations). These thematic, foundational and enabling subprogrammes are interdependent, designed to work together to support the achievement of the global goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other internationally agreed frameworks. 3. Overall, the programme of work shows how the UNEP thematic subprogrammes (supported by the enabling and foundational subprogrammes) will drive the transformational shifts targeted by the medium- term strategy for 2022-2025; outlines the means of measuring the effectiveness of UNEP in its direct, enabling and influencing roles; and defines a time- bound trajectory that aligns the organization with the 2030 Agenda. The three thematic subprogrammes will work towards a set of 2025 outcomes, supported by relevant indicators for measuring the results achieved in an integrated and focused manner that takes into account the contributions of the foundational and enabling subprogrammes to sustainable consumption and production. 4. Section II underlines how the executive leadership of UNEP, coherent policy-setting and efficient programme management and support will drive the organization forward from the inside towards greater focus and effectiveness of results on the outside. Building on lessons learned from the UNEP transformation process launched in 2019, these elements will guide UNEP efforts to deliver more impactful results. 5. Section III presents the UNEP budget for the biennium 2022-2023. An overview of UNEP resources for the biennium is followed by more detailed data regarding allocations by subprogramme and funding source, as well as a snapshot of UNEP efforts to increase resource mobilization and optimize its human resources practices.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ced3e4da-128c-486f-9515-cf0fdb41d368": {"__data__": {"id_": "ced3e4da-128c-486f-9515-cf0fdb41d368", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/unep-programme-work-and-budget-2022-2023-pow-annex-1-people-and-planet", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNEP Programme of Work and Budget for 2022-2023 (POW) - Annex 1 of For People and Planet", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/unep-programme-work-and-budget-2022-2023-pow-annex-1-people-and-planet", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3b53e966de06a5e85f1166b1c5e4041506d1ad1ebb2cd6166768afaf45fb3a3"}, "2": {"node_id": "088d0cc4-a046-49b8-990b-a47267d84a0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/unep-programme-work-and-budget-2022-2023-pow-annex-1-people-and-planet", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9244778684359a7bba2fd520fd82afdbae5854df2a63cda872f50be8112a3ed"}}, "hash": "b7d91cb1f6fa557c0bf7708824e97d9782443665e96b8dfb8a26d7eb1f1c8208", "text": "The final section is followed by three appendices that provide the evaluation plan for 2022\u201323, audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 and an organization chart for UNEP.

UNEP Medium-Term Strategy for 2022-2025 \u2013 on the road to 2030 7. The programme of work demonstrates how the UNEP subprogrammes come together in an integrated manner to deliver interconnected and mutually beneficial results. Building on pre-existing work, with an integrated approach that leverages partnerships and cross-sectoral initiatives, such as the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns, UNEP will accelerate and scale up transformational shifts towards sustainable patterns of consumption and production while targeting the drivers of, and proposing solutions to, the challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.1 8. UNEP interventions will aim to benefit from the comparative advantage of each subprogramme to improve cost effectiveness and have a greater, more strategic impact. Enhanced coordination and greater focus on the strategic linkages among UNEP subprogrammes will secure greater efficiency and effectiveness, optimize resources and generate consistent results that benefit from the supporting actions of the foundational and enabling subprogrammes to achieve multiple outcomes for the three UNEP thematic subprogrammes. 1Including by adopting integrated approaches that target nexus issues such as sustainable food systems, urban development, oceans and blue economy, waste, water and wastewater, sustainable energy and green jobs, poverty eradication, circular economy and resource efficiency, climate, environment and security, as well as the broader poverty-environment nexus. 9. The theories of change shown in figures 2, 3 and 4 map out a path for UNEP to its strategic objectives of climate stability, living in harmony with nature and towards a pollution-free planet. Each theory of change follows an integrated approach with a causal pathway that: a. connects the 2025 outcomes of the UNEP thematic subprogrammes with the UNEP vision for the 2030 Agenda, the decade of action and beyond, as outlined in the medium-term strategy, setting out a trajectory for UNEP for the period 2026-2029 through intermediate outcomes; b. encompasses a set of direct outcomes that show how the interventions across the UNEP thematic, foundational and enabling subprogrammes come together in an integrated manner. Each theory of change highlights direct outcomes supported by one or more of the seven subprogrammes, with foundational interventions under the leadership of the science-policy and environmental governance subprogrammes and enabling interventions under the leadership of the finance and economic transformations and digital transformations subprogrammes, while thematic interventions are led by the climate action, nature action and chemicals and pollution action subprogrammes; and c. outlines the assumptions, drivers and external risks that UNEP will take into account to achieve its strategic aspirations.

Towards a pollution-free planet - theory of change 07 | Programme of Work 2022-2023 10. The integration of the UNEP thematic, foundational and enabling subprogrammes is highlighted by the attribution of the direct outcomes of the thematic subprogrammes to foundational and enabling interventions under the science-policy, environmental governance, finance and economic transformations and digital transformations subprogrammes, as shown in tables 1 to 4 and as explained below. 1. Science-policy as a foundation 11. The science-policy subprogramme will empower governments and other stakeholders to make evidence-based decisions through environmental assessments, identification of emerging issues and fostering of policy action towards the achievement of the outcomes for the climate action, nature action and chemicals and pollution action subprogrammes. As the custodian agency for 26 of the Sustainable Development Goal indicators, UNEP will be actively involved in the development and refinement of data collection methodologies, particularly for environmental indicators that remain without internationally established methodologies and standards. UNEP will create the enabling conditions for countries to institutionalize environmental indicator monitoring, data calibration and reporting. It will continue to strengthen the science-policy interface through, among other things, servicing other subprogrammes in policy- relevant assessments and analyses informed by regional priorities and strong partnerships with expert networks and scientific bodies. UNEP will also deploy innovative and targeted publications to ensure that information and data reach key target audiences and are freely accessible. Table 1. Science-policy support for climate action, nature action, and chemicals and pollution action The science-policy subprogramme will provide the foundation for the following direct outcomes of the climate action, nature action, and chemicals and pollution action subprogrammes: Climate action - Policymaking and decision making for climate action are informed by the latest science-based analysis and data generation. - Transparency and accountability of government and non-government climate action, including from the private sector and finance community, is strengthened.

Environmental governance as a foundation 12. The environmental governance subprogramme will support countries in developing and implementing the environmental rule of law and in identifying integrated legal and policy responses that promote participatory and effective environmental decision-making. UNEP will support institutional strengthening and the development and effective implementation of appropriate legal frameworks and policies. Through flagship programmes, such as the Montevideo Programme for the Development and Periodic Review of Environmental Law (Montevideo Programme), and initiatives to support and partner with the secretariats of Multilateral Environmental Agreements, UNEP will support countries in applying environmental law, including multilateral environmental agreements, and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and other internationally agreed environmental goals and commitments, including by integrating them into national policies, legal frameworks and action. UNEP will also support countries in working together in an integrated manner to address specific environmental issues that cut across national borders with effective environmental law and governance solutions. Table 2. Environmental governance support for climate action, nature action, and chemicals and pollution action The environmental governance subprogramme will provide the foundation for the following direct outcomes of the climate action, nature action, and chemicals and pollution action subprogrammes: Climate action - Public support and political engagement for climate action are catalyzed. - Carbon neutrality and resilience are integrated into climate planning and policy and regulatory frameworks at all levels. - Policymaking and decision making for climate action are informed by the latest science-based analysis and data generation.

Finance and economic transformations as an enabler 13. The finance and economic transformations subprogramme will leverage business value chains, private finance and consumer behaviours and enhance economic policies to support the achievement of climate, nature, and chemicals and pollution outcomes. UNEP will support transformed economic policies, including trade policies, to accelerate the shift to more sustainable patterns of consumption, production, investment and equity. In addition, UNEP will support principles and standards that enable private finance and business and their value chains to improve environmental sustainability. UNEP information and knowledge-sharing work will inform more sustainable consumer behaviour. Table 3.

Digital transformations as an enabler 14. The digital transformations subprogramme will support digital guidelines, architecture and governance, as well as enhanced digital literacy, to encourage transformative use of environmental digital public goods and accelerate progress towards environmental sustainability. UNEP will work to integrate datasets, analysis and digital public goods associated with climate, nature and pollution into an inclusive digital ecosystem for people and the planet. It will push to bridge the digital divide by enhancing the environmental digital literacy of citizens and diverse stakeholders through inclusive digital capacity- building, policy dialogue, education curricula, social collaboration, open innovation and new communities of practice. UNEP will leverage environmental digital public goods and assess the risk and benefits of digital technologies through partnerships, platforms and networks to amplify and accelerate progress towards the internationally agreed environmental goals and a circular economy.

UNEP performance measures: indicators that take programme integration one step further 15. The UNEP results framework explains how the performance of the subprogrammes covered by this programme of work will be measured. Indicators are the backbone of the system for monitoring progress towards the outcomes set out in the theories of change. The results framework turns the theories of change into an accountability and management tool that underpins the development of implementation strategies and measures progress towards sustainable development. The outcomes of each thematic subprogramme, as shown in the theories of change in figures 2, 3 and 4, are accompanied by a set of indicators that together reflect the integrated nature of the subprogrammes. This approach allows for accountability at the subprogramme level, as well as measurement of the contribution of the foundational and enabling subprogrammes to the achievement of the strategic objectives of climate stability, living in harmony with nature and towards a pollution-free planet. 16. UNEP will measure how its interventions contribute to achieving its strategic objectives at three levels, as described in figure 5. The highest level of control rests at the direct outcome level, where results can be directly associated with the intervention and UNEP can exercise the most direct control over results. Impact at this level is measured using quantitative indicators. The contribution from UNEP becomes less direct when results occur because of enabling and influencing activities and by partnering with other organizations, Governments and the private sector, as external factors start playing a role. Impact at these levels is primarily measured using qualitative indicators. In addition, impact stories for each subprogramme will deliver examples that capture the results of UNEP interventions to provide evidence of change that occurred after a specific intervention. Figure 5. Three levels of intervention 17. Programme integration paves the way for transformational change. The intervention pathway in the three theories of change identifies the changes for which UNEP is directly accountable (towards the 2025 outcomes of the thematic subprogrammes), as well as where UNEP will act as an enabler and influencer (towards the 2030 outcome of the thematic subprogrammes) towards achieving relevant Sustainable Development Goals indicators. The results for which UNEP is directly accountable will be captured by quantitative indicators. 18. Indicators must meaningfully capture key changes. Each indicator has one or more targets (progress expected) depending on the units of measure. The targets present the expected progress after one and two years, respectively, so as to cover the two-year period under this programme of work and the first two years under the medium-term strategy. Subsequent targets, for years three and four of the strategy, will be developed in the programme of work for 2024-2025. 19. The purpose of the UNEP results framework is twofold: to measure the results of UNEP work and to guide the design of projects and programmes. This ensures that all activities contribute to the achievement of the 2025 outcomes and direct outcomes set out in the theories of change. The results framework presented in the programme of work measures the highest level of results for implementation of the medium-term strategy for 2022-2025, and the indicators and targets presented in the framework measure results at all levels of UNEP. 20.

To create a more comprehensive picture of the different levels of results delivered by UNEP, quantitative reporting on the indicators will be accompanied by qualitative reporting and impact stories focusing on the enabling and influencing role of UNEP, including with regard to the uptake of its normative and standard-setting work, as described in table 5. UNEP plays a direct role, setting the scene for transformational change through science-driven global advocacy, capacity development and stakeholder mobilization, to upscale innovative solutions through partnerships and networks. UNEP enables others to initiate systemic change by supporting policymaking, changes in behaviours and attitudes, development of norms and standards, and institutional strengthening. UNEP influences others to achieve social, economic and political transformational change through strengthened global norms and standards.

See in particular General Assembly resolutions 71/6 and 74/251. 21. The results framework is designed to underpin the integrated approach described in the medium- term strategy. Integrated implementation of the subprogrammes is central to the medium-term strategy. Indicators for the thematic subprogrammes measure change for multiple 2025 outcomes and direct outcomes, while the indicators for the enabling and foundational subprogrammes measure performance for the direct outcomes. Intrinsically, performance and achievement for each of the 2025 outcomes and direct outcomes will be measured by assessing indicators from various subprogrammes, as outlined in the results framework. 22. Tables 6 to 13 list the UNEP indicators by subprogramme, showing the outcomes with which the indicators are associated, as well as baselines and targets, units of measure, sources of data and relevant Sustainable Development Goal indicators.

The project portfolios are building blocks that enable the achievement of results as set out in the theories of change in an integrated way. The project portfolio will outline the concepts of projects to be implemented over the four-year period of the medium-term strategy. Project data will be collected for the indicators in the programme of work to ensure that the results provided for in the framework are achieved. The sum of projects will contribute to the 2025 outcomes and direct outcomes of the three thematic subprogrammes in an integrated way. A PET bottle manufacturing plant in Argentina.

Executive direction and management 24. UNEP executive direction and management encompasses UNEP leadership, management and oversight in delivering results. The Executive Office, with support from the Evaluation Office, provides executive direction and management, including on strategic, programmatic and administrative matters. This includes accountability for the delivery of the medium-term strategy and its related programmes of work, as mandated by the United Nations Environment Assembly and set out in the compact between the Executive Director and the Secretary-General. 25. The Executive Office will focus on elevating systemic changes that have been identified through an internal transformation process aimed at further strengthening UNEP efficiency and effectiveness. The Executive Office will: a. build collaboration and partnerships with governments, the private sector, financial institutions, civil society and other stakeholders; b. invest in integrated capability development; c. create coherent strategic leadership; d. deliver operational excellence; and e. create a team with aligned entrepreneurship. These five dynamics will enable UNEP to meet the challenges ahead. 26. The Evaluation Office plays a critical role in the independent oversight and accountability functions. The Evaluation Office falls within the purview of executive direction and management in recognition of its functional independence from the rest of the programme and the importance attached to using evaluation findings to improve UNEP planning, implementation and performance. As an independent unit, the Evaluation Office reports directly to the Executive Director and is responsible for implementing the evaluation work plan by conducting and managing independent evaluations. Thus, it will continue to play a critical oversight role by evaluating the extent to which UNEP has achieved its planned results for the medium- term strategy and programme of work and will provide recommendations, lessons and advice based on evaluation findings.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1973c945-70d1-4c2f-b2c3-5e04231a1c13": {"__data__": {"id_": "1973c945-70d1-4c2f-b2c3-5e04231a1c13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/unep-programme-work-and-budget-2022-2023-pow-annex-1-people-and-planet", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNEP Programme of Work and Budget for 2022-2023 (POW) - Annex 1 of For People and Planet", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/unep-programme-work-and-budget-2022-2023-pow-annex-1-people-and-planet", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6331ca0658b52419e3bd1cd3f2f0816e61eb0159c4992dd58af4a5535c01f892"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b404628-08eb-43db-b28b-165fb831bc58", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/unep-programme-work-and-budget-2022-2023-pow-annex-1-people-and-planet", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05c8a8f14d4b292abe28ee303bbdfb1ca069fcbaee3dc2372a8df62be2069947"}}, "hash": "1a4fdd58553a9d380a0de7905ceebe7dc55d39c5731e415c608f0286d07b72e6", "text": "To maintain transparency, the evaluation findings will be communicated through the Executive Director to the Committee of Permanent Representatives and the Environment Assembly, in accordance with the UNEP Evaluation Policy. 27.

Policymaking organs 28. The United Nations Environment Assembly sets the global environmental agenda and is the governing body of UNEP. The Environment Assembly meets biennially and has a United Nations system-wide mandate to take strategic decisions and provide political guidance on the work of the United Nations system in the area of the environment, including through the United Nations Environment Management Group and its annual contributions to the high-level political forum on sustainable development. The medium-term strategy and programme of work are approved by the Environment Assembly. 29. UNEP will actively support the meaningful participation of representatives from relevant major groups and stakeholders as well as United Nations organizations at meetings of the Environment Assembly and its subsidiary bodies and of the parties to the Multilateral Environmental Agreements. UNEP facilitates the engagement of major groups and stakeholders at the programme and policy level, by the exchange of information, solicitation of input, capacity-building and regular communication through the Major Groups Facilitating Committee. To enhance the participation of major groups and stakeholders and their contribution to the intergovernmental decision making process, a multi-stakeholder dialogue is held during the high-level segment of the Environment Assembly. This dialogue complements the Global Major Groups and Stakeholders Forum, which takes place before each session of the Environment Assembly. The forum is preceded by regional consultative meetings with representatives of major groups and stakeholders, whose inputs and perspectives are provided to the Committee of Permanent Representatives and the Environment Assembly through written and oral statements and an official meeting document. 30. The Committee of Permanent Representatives, as a subsidiary body of the Environment Assembly, provides policy advice to the Environment Assembly. The Committee contributes to the preparation of the agendas for the sessions of the Environment Assembly and the draft decisions it will consider. It oversees the implementation of resolutions and the UNEP programme of work once they are adopted and prepares the forthcoming programme of work for adoption by the Environment Assembly. The Committee holds regular one- day meetings on a quarterly basis and meets in an open-ended forum every two years, prior to the session of the Environment Assembly. The UNEP governing structure also includes the subcommittee of the committee of Permanent Representatives, which meets annually for five days to review the UNEP medium- term strategy and programme of work and budget and to prepare the forthcoming programme of work for adoption by the Environment Assembly. In addition, one-day or half-day subcommittee meetings are held once or twice a month, as needed and upon request, to consider specific issues in depth. 31. The Governance Affairs Office provides secretariat support to the Environment Assembly and its subsidiary bodies. The office also serves as the main interface for external relations with representatives of the UNEP governing bodies and with representatives of the major groups and stakeholders and is responsible for promoting gender parity for meetings and other activities supported by the secretariat.

Programme management and support 32. Programme management and support comprises services provided by the Corporate Services and Policy and Programme divisions of UNEP. The objective is to ensure efficient and effective development and delivery of the medium- term strategy\u2019s programmatic priorities, underpinned by sound management and leadership practices with a reinforced accountability framework that clarifies roles and responsibilities. Programme management and support provide guidance on programme and project design, delivery and closure; governance of resources; corporate policy development and oversight; programme monitoring and reporting; building of staff knowledge and capacity; and the development of programme and resource- management tools that support decision making. 33. A stronger, better-performing and more networked, integrated and results-oriented staff. Staff remain the most important asset of UNEP. It continues to focus not only on innovative human resources processes but also on ensuring that its staff acquire the skills necessary to process, produce and leverage digital information to create business value. An ongoing skills mapping initiative begun in 2020 aims to define core skills that staff require in order to prepare for the future of work. The focus during 2022-2023 will be on building a workforce that has the capacity to work in an agile way, demonstrates a data mindset and applies user-centred design thinking principles to enhance organizational effectiveness. UNEP will implement a new Corporate Academy initiative, designed to provide scope for building the capacity of professional staff in the areas of administration and programme management. This involves working on building communities of practice focused on enhancing collaborative and strategic dialogue around specialized thematic areas of work. The aim is to strengthen collaborative partnerships across UNEP and leverage internal synergies and sharing of knowledge and expertise among subject matter experts. UNEP is laying the foundation for a learning organization by leveraging digital solutions, facilitating communities, curating content, fostering manager coaching and peer learning, and valuing failure as a pathway to innovation. It will create a robust learning analytics programme to support impact tracking, with regular communication of findings to senior leadership and staff. These initiatives will build a collaborative organizational structure and an engaged workforce that fosters a culture of teamwork, innovation and results. The new culture will stem from a transformed senior leadership that is solution-oriented and committed to a shared strategy and shared values such as courage, authenticity, transparency and professionalism. 34. Programme management and support with enhanced emphasis on compliance, efficiency and risk management. The plan for the biennium 2022- 2023 is to extend the knowledge-based platforms to programme and project managers through appropriate tailor-made training and guidelines, with the aim of holistically addressing audit and risk factors associated with financial and programme management. This will ensure that internal processes evolve to support programmatic needs and that best-in-class fiduciary governance and standards are developed. UNEP will employ enterprise risk management to these ends. 35. Enterprise risk management in UNEP is a structured and disciplined approach that aligns strategy, processes, people, technology and knowledge for the purpose of evaluating and managing the uncertainties an organization faces as it pursues its objectives. Enterprise risk management implementation facilitates effective strategic decision making, as it provides management with the tools to fully understand the root causes of risk and to design proper response strategies. Enterprise risk management approaches all sections of UNEP operations iteratively to catch all risk areas and address the components of governance and culture, strategy and objective setting, performance, review and revision, information, communication and reporting. 36. In the initial stages of implementing enterprise risk management, UNEP will follow the recommendations from the United Nations Secretariat\u2019s latest updated policy on risk management and appropriate steps arising from best practice. The biennium 2022-2023 will see the risk management framework fully integrated into UNEP operations. Internal reviews, audits and evaluation results at the strategic, operative, programmatic and project levels and internal feedback on existing partnership management approaches highlight the need to strengthen UNEP\u2019s due diligence processes. In this regard, UNEP will continue to improve its partnership policy and due diligence procedures to actively monitor and manage partnerships in order to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73d3181a-a039-41a8-b577-1049c2fcdfb0": {"__data__": {"id_": "73d3181a-a039-41a8-b577-1049c2fcdfb0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/unep-programme-work-and-budget-2022-2023-pow-annex-1-people-and-planet", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNEP Programme of Work and Budget for 2022-2023 (POW) - Annex 1 of For People and Planet", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/unep-programme-work-and-budget-2022-2023-pow-annex-1-people-and-planet", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bca701646d8d0d870254881508e131e9b3cc89d54dc48448e8485df41d9af625"}}, "hash": "bca701646d8d0d870254881508e131e9b3cc89d54dc48448e8485df41d9af625", "text": "minimize and mitigate potential risks and ensure that benefits are realized. To facilitate this transition, online 27 | Programme of Work 2022-2023 tools are being developed to support a transparent review of both private and public partnership agreements and to maintain an audit trail for compliance rates. 37. Focus on alignment, relevance and measurable results. UNEP will continue the shift towards results-based management, enabling it to further quantify and qualify its achievements and communicate them effectively while demonstrating a clear line of sight from local to regional and global interventions. In the context of programme management and support, this means strengthening project design and review mechanisms and ensuring that the quality assurance framework provides information on programme implementation status, assists in the early identification of potential risks and enhances the effectiveness of project implementation. It also means developing the platforms, business intelligence tools and dashboards needed for senior management to take informed decisions and the performance indicators needed to evaluate the effectiveness of project implementation. 38. Emphasis on lessons learned from audits and evaluations for continued improvement. UNEP will identify opportunities to inculcate lessons learned from audits, evaluations and reports of the Joint Inspection Unit and in so doing will steer the organization on a path of strengthened operational efficiency and agility. UNEP will continue investing in informed decision making through the use of real- time data, facilitated by business intelligence tools and dashboards. 39. Enhanced resource mobilization. UNEP will continue to update its resource mobilization strategy in support of the delivery of programmatic results. The update will introduce additional mechanisms for partnerships in thematic areas, within and outside the United Nations system, including with global funds (such as the Global Environment Facility and the Green Climate Fund), as well as continuing to explore strategic opportunities for engagement with other stakeholders, such as civil society and the private sector. Moreover, a key element of the management direction will be renewed administrative support for and engagement with Multilateral Environmental Agreement secretariats to allow for economies of scale while preserving the special mandates of such agreements and the governance mechanisms that oversee them. 40. Dialogue for greater efficiency of service providers. UNEP will liaise with and monitor the performance of administrative service providers such as the United Nations Office at Nairobi that provide support services to UNEP in the areas of accounting, payroll and payments, recruitment and staff services, systems administration, procurement and inventory maintenance, host country relations, buildings management, conference management medical services and security and safety. 41. Strong engagement in United Nations reform. The ongoing United Nations development system reform will continue and expand in the 2022-2023 programme of work. UNEP will fully utilize new opportunities emerging through the reform process towards ensuring a wider and stronger \u201cUNEP voice\u201d through the United Nations country teams and the resident coordinators. It will also strengthen its engagement with the resident coordinator system, both in terms of nominations of the resident coordinators and the accompanying feedback and performance mechanisms.

UNEP will prioritize and allocate resources for participation in the High- Level Committee on Management and various task forces and committees mandated to provide inputs and updates that improve operational efficiencies, such as the business operations strategy and the mutual accountability framework, as well as to existing guidelines, rules and procedures. 43. UNEP is working closely with the Umoja team at United Nations headquarters to finalize the design, testing and deployment of the Umoja next- generation extension (Umoja Extension 2), which encompasses new tools and processes covering strategic management, project management, budget formulation, implementing partners, fundraising, supply chain, and conference and events management. The new modules will ultimately enhance management efficiency and effectiveness, as well as the ability of UNEP to manage and report programme and finance information and results in an integrated manner. The new extension is expected to speed up the selection of implementing partners and management processes and provide a full audit trail, thus allowing for a high level of transparency. The new modules are anticipated to be fully deployed and functioning before the start of the 2022-2023 programme of work. Table 16.

Budget and resource mobilization a. Planning assumptions and budget envelopes 44. UNEP will widen efforts to secure the resource base for the achievement of the programme of work, both directly and by its partners. Securing core contributions to the Environment Fund, or funding that is only softly earmarked rather than tightly earmarked, is indispensable if UNEP is to maintain its ability to deliver in accordance with the priorities agreed on by Member States. A key lesson learned is that the organization must provide a better, more strategic explanation of its comparative advantage and its funding needs, both for core and earmarked funds, and must have a more comprehensive view of the landscape of potential funding sources. The 2022-2023 programme of work and budget reflect lessons learned from historical trends in expenditures, income and results, as well as the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 45. The COVID-19 pandemic is set to result in a sharp and deep contraction of the world economies. UNEP foresees this impact spilling over into 2022. Accordingly, the budget proposals are based on a conservative approach whereby the budget envelopes for earmarked funds and the global trust funds are 10 per cent lower than the rounded average expenditures for the past three bienniums, at US$322 million and US$272 million, respectively. The programme support cost envelope continues to reflect an average of 10 per cent of the earmarked funds budgets. The regular budget provision is the same as in the approved 2020-2021 budget; however, UNEP does not expect the full allotment to be released, as the United Nations Secretariat regular budget currently faces severe liquidity challenges expected to continue throughout the biennium 2022-2023. 46. The Environment Fund will continue to be the financial backbone of UNEP. Its budget envelope remains at US$200 million, the same as the 2020- 2021 budget, which was already reduced from US$271 million in the biennium 2018-2019. The envelope for the Environment Fund strikes a balance between the reality of historical contributions of US$150 million to US$160 million per biennium and the ambition of receiving another US$40 million to US$50 million (US$20 million to US$25 million per year). The additional funds are expected to materialize with the implementation of a revised resource mobilization strategy, as well as by Member States contributing their \u201cfair share\u201d in accordance with the voluntary indicative scale of contributions as they prioritize the environment in their national budgets. 47.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58daa76e-eabf-4c84-9649-d23eba2f2801": {"__data__": {"id_": "58daa76e-eabf-4c84-9649-d23eba2f2801", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/unep-programme-work-and-budget-2022-2023-pow-annex-1-people-and-planet", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNEP Programme of Work and Budget for 2022-2023 (POW) - Annex 1 of For People and Planet", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/unep-programme-work-and-budget-2022-2023-pow-annex-1-people-and-planet", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4db18ec5160e1ac77edcc5a8799e0bc1e23772be80c9a359af417a300bda954d"}, "2": {"node_id": "2b1b46a5-d7a5-472a-ac86-17d0e901c17a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/unep-programme-work-and-budget-2022-2023-pow-annex-1-people-and-planet", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1bd6c50ac36221449f4dbb5cd51ec121191a83a66ce0b5c97829823d2cc318eb"}}, "hash": "eafff32aac5df15f6ea482c01cc31b8180d1ba95743c4d0fba71cab659dff149", "text": "47.

In previous years, UNEP managed to cover the shortfall of Environment Fund contributions using earmarked resources; however, in 2022-2023, when earmarked, global trust fund and regular budget resources are all expected to decline, it will be essential to collect more contributions and meet the approved Environment Fund budget. Bosco Verticale, Milano, Italy. Photo: Shutterstock / Thai Breeze Programme of Work 2022-2023 | 30 b. Overview of resources 48. The overall budget for 2022-2023, comprising the Environment Fund, earmarked funding, the global trust funds, programme support costs and the regular budget of the United Nations, is US$872.9 million. This budget is US$44.2 million lower than the 2020\u20132021 budget, owing mainly to the potential reduction in earmarked funds due to the impact of COVID19 on donor contributions. 1. Environment Fund 49. The allocation of the Environment Fund is based on a review of core mandates and priorities while allowing for flexibility to react to emerging issues and budget shortfalls. The allocations to the subprogrammes were determined by analysing historical data to identify the standard costs of generating results under each subprogramme. The analysis was based on fundamental core staffing requirements, which account for an average of 60 per cent of the overall Environment Fund envelope. 50. The resources under the Environment Fund provide for 431 staff positions compared to 422 in the 2020-2021 programme of work, calculated based on 2021 standard costs and a 3 per cent vacancy rate. The positions are distributed across the various programmes and subprogrammes based on a staff alignment exercise that mapped each position to the subprogramme to which it primarily contributes. The non-post requirements under the Environment Fund reflect the balance remaining under each subprogramme after deducting the staff costs. 51. The 2022-2023 budget for policymaking organs and executive direction and management amount to US$12 million, compared to US$11.2 million in 2020-2021. The increase of US$400,000 per year is in line with the historical trends for expenditures, attributable mainly to incremental staff costs. 52. The programme management and support budget has increased by 1 per cent, reflecting an overall requirement of US$14 million. The budget takes into account a reduction in programme support cost owing to the expected decrease in earmarked funds, as well as the planned effort to strengthen UNEP accountability systems by embedding \u201clines of defence\u201d to enhance effective risk management and control. This effort is enshrined in the UNEP \u201cback-to-basics\u201d roadmap for strengthened foundational controls and principles for management and administration. A key ongoing priority is to ensure that foundational management practices are in place as UNEP focuses on building the capacity of its fund management and programme officers while investing heavily in internal controls, and on resensitizing and training staff regarding their role as custodians of policies. The provision under programme management and support reflects the UNEP commitment to engaging fully in the United Nations reform and, accordingly, to strengthen its voice through United Nations resident coordinators and country teams. 53. Eighty-seven per cent of the Environment Fund budget is allocated to the seven subprogrammes and the fund programme reserve. The bulk of the budget is distributed among the three thematic subprogrammes and the four foundational and enabling subprogrammes. 54. The Environment Fund allocates 12 per cent (US$24 million) of its overall budget to each of the climate action, nature action and chemicals and pollution action thematic subprogrammes. The increases in the budgets for the climate and the chemicals and pollution subprogrammes compared to 2020-2021 are attributable to the fact that UNEP intends to increase its focus on and enhance its results for these action areas, in line with the medium-term strategy for 2022-2025. The reduction in resources allocated to the nature action subprogramme is due to the historical trend of increased earmarked funding.

The newly introduced digital transformations subprogramme is allocated 7 per cent. The first three subprogrammes have traditionally relied on a combination of funds from the regular budget, extrabudgetary funding and the Environment Fund for their core activities. Environmental governance remains central to delivering on the core UNEP mandate and on a growing number of Environment Assembly resolutions. The science-policy subprogramme also 31 | Programme of Work 2022-2023 continues to represent a core service and a central UNEP mandate. While Environment Fund resources allocated to the environmental governance and finance and economic transformations subprogrammes are lower than for 2020-2021, an additional US$3 million was allocated to the science-policy subprogramme to ensure adequate funding for the Global Environment Outlook series. The Environment Fund allocations are supported by assessed funds from the regular budget, whereby the science-policy subprogramme receives 40 per cent and the environmental governance subprogramme 9 per cent of the overall non-post resources. UNEP will also continue to prioritize these programmes for extrabudgetary funding. This will be achieved through existing and future contribution agreements that offer unearmarked resources. 2. Earmarked funds, global trust funds and programme support costs 56. The overall budget for earmarked funds and global trust funds is distributed across the subprogrammes based on historical trends in expenditures, which serve as a proxy for income. The resource requirement under executive direction and management and policymaking organs reflects an increase of US$1.2 million, mainly owing to earmarked contributions received for junior professional officer posts. Global trust fund resources allocated to project management and support for 2022-2023 show a US$3.8 million increase owing to contributions from the Global Environment Facility. Given the anticipated reduction in overall earmarked contributions, programme support cost resources for project management and support reflect a reduction of US$2.9 million, which is partially offset by a US$2 million increase in funding from the Environment Fund. These funds cover recurrent and fixed costs, such as payments to service providers. 3. Regular budget 57. The budgeted resources from the regular budget reflect the 2020 appropriation approved by the General Assembly and continue to fund 113 post and non-post resources under each subprogramme. Although the budgets are prepared on an annual basis, UNEP presents a biennial rolling budget in connection with the 2022-2023 programme of work. 4. Resource requirements for all funding sources 58.

The revised UNEP resource mobilization strategy addresses the challenges and opportunities identified by Member States to increase UNEP funding from a wider base. It emphasizes the need for better communication and outreach about the value and requirements of UNEP, as well as an appreciation of funding partners. 60. A revised resource mobilization strategy will address the core funding shortfalls. In The Future We Want, the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio in 2012, Member States committed to providing UNEP with secure, stable, adequate and increased financial resources. That commitment remains the underpinning principle of the resource mobilization strategy, which relies on close collaboration between the Member States and the secretariat in the implementation of paragraph 88 of The Future We Want. The revised strategy aims to improve the balance between core and non-core income by broadening the funding base (i.e., by increasing the number of Member States that provide funding to the Environment Fund and seeking further support from non-traditional funding sources). 61. While earmarked funds are an important source of income for UNEP, it would be more beneficial for both the funding partners and delivery of results if such funds were only softly earmarked. While understanding that the priority of resource mobilization is to increase the core funding to the Environment Fund, the Secretariat is realistic about the fact that earmarked funds will continue to provide an important portion of the organization\u2019s income. In light of this, the Secretariat will increase outreach to explain the challenges of tightly earmarked funds and the benefits of soft earmarking, both for the funding partners and for UNEP, to encourage funding partners to shift from tightly earmarked to softly earmarked funding. 62. The resource mobilization strategy will increase communication about \u201cfair share\u201d as represented by the voluntary indicative scale of contributions. This entails more information about how fair share is calculated and the principles behind it, including the universal responsibility that follows from the universal membership of the United Nations Environment Assembly.

Mukisa Programme of Work 2022-2023 | 34 target outreach to current and potential funding partners and seek to increase public recognition and appreciation of its current funding partners. In addition to engagement with Member States, the resource mobilization strategy provides for engagement with other partners, such as multilateral entities, foundations, the private sector and new and innovative funding mechanisms. 1. Environment Fund 64. Reaching the Environment Fund budget target agreed with Member States has remained a challenge. In the biennium 2018-2019, the US$131.3 million gap between the budget (US$271 million) and income (US$139.7 million) represented 48 per cent of the entire budget. In the biennium 2016\u20132017, the budget was US$271 million while income amounted to US$135 million, leaving a gap of US$136 million (50 per cent of the budget). At the same time, earmarked funding increased. While such funding has enabled the organization to achieve strong results within the priority areas of the funding partners, it has left other core areas of the programme of work underfunded and only partially implemented. The organization\u2019s ability to deliver the programme of work in its totality will continue to depend on whether Member States meet their commitments to the Environment Fund. When it comes to the Environment Fund, the main objective of the resource mobilization strategy is twofold: to increase total funding and to increase the number of Member States that contribute. To achieve this, the strategy provides for improved information-sharing on the results achieved with the funding from the Environment Fund, the allocation of resources and the activities funded, and more effective communication on the consequences of insufficient core funding. 2. Regular budget 65. The regular budget is a small but critical part of the budget. As part of the Secretary General\u2019s reform process and as implemented in 2020-2021, the regular budget for 2022-2023 will continue to be prepared on an annual basis. Notwithstanding this change, UNEP will still present biennial rolling budgets for its programmes of work. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 73/260, in which the General Assembly expressed concern about the sustainability, predictability and stability of the funding of the UNEP governing body, the General Assembly approved an amount of US$8,500 to support the annual meeting of the subcommittee of the Committee of Permanent Representatives in 2020. UNEP also presented its funding requirements for the fifth session of the Environment Assembly in 2021. The total requirement, yet to be approved by the General Assembly, is US$410,100 and provides for hospitality, overtime and general operating expenses. 3. Funding partners 66. Multilateral entities are changing the way they deliver their work. UNEP is also adapting to these changes. UNEP will transform its partnerships with the multilateral financing mechanisms, sister United Nations organizations and international financial institutions. This can mean shifting from small- to medium-scale initiatives that fund individual parts of the UNEP programme of work to identifying multilateral partners that will complement the core resources and allow the organization to have more impact. This means fewer but larger, more strategic initiatives that increasingly engage the private sector and investment actors in a strategically connected portfolio. 67. UNEP will engage with foundations, which play an increasingly important role in development work, with a huge potential in investment funds. The objective of engaging with this sector is to identify high-value partnerships that can be developed to secure the highest returns with the cleanest fit between agendas, so that long- term transformative partnerships for change are set in place. This could include both direct funding for UNEP and support for other areas and organizations that replicate and support the implementation of the programme of work. 68.

UNEP will also invest in the continued exploration of innovative funding mechanisms, learning from sister United Nations agencies and other organizations that strive for continued innovation. The funds generated would be focused on specific areas of work, thus complementing the core funding. 35 | Programme of Work 2022-2023 4. Human resources 70. Delivering the medium-term strategy through a diverse, high-performing workforce. UNEP seeks to be optimally prepared to deliver its medium-term strategy through a diverse workforce of talented, high-performing people who are appropriately deployed and benefit from comprehensive care and support from the organization. UNEP is developing a human resource strategy for outlining the technical and managerial competencies needed. Initial activities already started around skills mapping will provide inputs towards an upcoming staffing review of secretariat functions. This would include reviewing functional titles, mapping positions and rightsizing functional roles and responsibilities to the appropriate subprogrammes and thematic areas for the 2022-2025 medium-term strategy. UNEP will provide its staff with opportunities to develop within the human resources career stream while ensuring that a range of sound policies, procedures and systems are in place to enable them to perform their functions. 71. Enhanced participation in the support for management and strategic corporate reforms. UNEP plays a key role in supporting the Secretary- General\u2019s management reforms and participates in several working groups and task forces around human resources. As an active participant in shaping future transformations of human resources policy, UNEP is a member of the special working group on the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination task force on addressing sexual harassment within the organizations of the United Nations. UNEP has established and built internal capacity in conduct and discipline functions, participates in the High-Level Committee on Management working groups on recruitment, outreach, future of work modalities and mobility, and sits on the Human Resource Task Force on Training and Learning and Multilingualism. UNEP continues to make a concerted effort to identify and develop future senior leaders and actively engages with and supports the resident coordinator system by facilitating and supporting nominations of UNEP candidates for both the Resident Coordinator Assessment Centre and resident coordinator positions. 72. Staff development and capacity-building. Realigning training and staff development in support of key UNEP reforms and strategic priorities continued in 2020 with the development of the first online Corporate Academy. The academy is an example of continued investment by UNEP in its staff. It aims to develop and provide scope for capacity building while establishing best practices and improving transparency, accountability and risk mitigation. The academy will be expanded and replicated to incorporate other functional skill profiles, such as programme management. 73. Addressing gender gaps and geographical diversity among UNEP staff. UNEP continues to address the gender gap, in line with the Secretary- General\u2019s System-wide Strategy on Gender Parity, by supporting overall gender interventions to achieve the gender equality that contributes to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. UNEP continues to make good progress in this area. Since the inception of the Gender Parity Implementation Plan, considerable progress has been made towards gender parity, particularly at middle and senior leadership levels. UNEP continues to actively engage and work with hiring managers and the Executive Office to monitor and improve on progress towards gender parity at these levels, and is committed to reaching parity. UNEP will also improve geographical distribution through outreach via regional forums and career development avenues. UNEP will enhance monitoring mechanisms to enable it to report on the geographic distribution of countries underrepresented among its staff. 74. The COVID\u201319 pandemic has posed challenges for human resources and the duty of care. UNEP continues to respond to these challenges in a robust and flexible manner to ensure smooth business continuity, without major disruptions in operational support. COVID-19 required the organization to issue global administrative guidelines addressing administrative and recruitment issues in the light of travel limitations, telecommuting, the need for duty-of-care support for affiliate non-staff (interns) and country-specific situations. The impact of the pandemic on the global economy has also resulted in additional financial constraints for the organization given the urgent need", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9d98f09-cf5f-4719-a933-edf86922e68a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9d98f09-cf5f-4719-a933-edf86922e68a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/unep-programme-work-and-budget-2022-2023-pow-annex-1-people-and-planet", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNEP Programme of Work and Budget for 2022-2023 (POW) - Annex 1 of For People and Planet", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/unep-programme-work-and-budget-2022-2023-pow-annex-1-people-and-planet", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d490b67d6174f39b8926f7250b9ac1a0de36968949185c71479cadb2c1ed092"}}, "hash": "9d490b67d6174f39b8926f7250b9ac1a0de36968949185c71479cadb2c1ed092", "text": "for countries to redirect funding to critical COVID-19-related activities.

Park 37 | Programme of Work 2022-2023 Appendix I Evaluation plan for the period 2022-2023 1. A clear focus on results. A prominent feature of the medium-term strategy and its constituent programmes of work is their results orientation. This is reinforced by the UNEP evaluation approach, which has for many years had a strong focus on the organization\u2019s performance in achieving results that are in line with its objectives and expected outcomes. The evaluation plan proposes a combination of complementary evaluations at different levels examining different themes. 2. Systematic evaluations for better performance. The approach to evaluating the programme of work within the medium-term strategy will involve systematic evaluations of the subprogrammes and their project portfolios (figure A.1). As a project modality is used to deliver results that are fully aligned with the expected outcomes, project performance will continue to be evaluated using earmarked resources set aside from project budgets. All evaluations will be conducted in accordance with the United Nations Evaluation Group norms and standards for evaluation to ensure consistency in the quality of the evaluations and to enable the findings to be used to evaluate performance at the subprogramme level. Figure A.1 Approach to evaluating the programmes of work and the medium-term strategy UNEP Medium-Term Strategy for the period 2022\u20132025 UNEP programme of work for the period 2024\u20132025 UNEP programme of work for the period 2022\u20132023 Biennial evaluation synthesis Biennial evaluation synthesis Project evaluations Project evaluations Project evaluations Project evaluations Subprogramme evaluations Subprogramme evaluations 3. Standardized criteria are used to evaluate performance and assist the aggregation of evaluation findings across the various UNEP interventions. These evaluation criteria are used in all project and subprogramme evaluations and are consistent with international best practices and the United Nations Evaluation Group norms and standards for evaluation. They include strategic relevance and complementarity; effectiveness (including availability of outputs, the achievement of outcomes and likelihood of impact); sustainability of benefits realized at the outcome level; efficiency; financial management; monitoring and reporting and factors affecting performance, including preparation and readiness; quality of project management and supervision; the extent of stakeholder engagement and country ownership; responsiveness to human rights12 and gender equity; environmental, social and economic safeguards; and communication and public awareness. 2 The needs of all vulnerable groups, including people living with disability, youth, children, indigenous people and people living in poverty, are considered in the assessment of responsiveness to human rights.

The scope of the work of the UNEP evaluation function encompasses the programmes and projects of the Environment Fund, related trust funds and earmarked contributions together with projects funded by the Global Environment Facility, the Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund and implemented by UNEP as part of the programmes of work. Specifically, the objectives of the evaluation plan are: a. To assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact of UNEP programmes; b. To derive and share lessons learned from the implementation of programme and project activities; c. To ensure that the evaluation recommendations issued by the Evaluation Office and accepted by UNEP programme management and division directors are implemented. 5. Evaluation sequence. The sequence of evaluations of UNEP subprogrammes will continue as set out in figure A.2. As in previous years, all subprogramme evaluation reports and the recommendations therein will be circulated to the UNEP senior management team and presented to the Committee of Permanent Representatives. A plan for the implementation of the evaluation recommendations will be developed taking into consideration the time required for changes to be evident at the subprogramme level. Environmental governance Finance and economic transformations Climate action Chemicals and pollution action Nature action 6. Project evaluations. The performance of projects that have reached operational completion will be evaluated. It is estimated that approximately 60 project evaluations will be completed over the programme of work period. Evaluations are carried out in close cooperation with the relevant project or programme managers and evaluation reports are circulated to senior managers and posted on the Evaluation Office website. The Evaluation Office will continue to draw lessons from these evaluations, issue recommendations and formally track implementation compliance. 7.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a worsening climate crisis and underlying structural weaknesses have caused the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation in the region. The crises have caused enormous disruptions to energy and food markets, and have driven food, energy and commodity prices to record highs. Their impacts have been felt globally, especially among vulnerable groups: millions of people have been pushed into poverty. At least a decade of development progress has been erased. The recent economic and social turmoil, and the consequences of the polycrisis have put immense pressure on public finances and reduced financial resources available to achieve the SDGs. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Asia-Pacific region was off track to meet the 2030 SDGs and would have needed until 2065 to achieve all 17 goals. This delayed timeline could get pushed out further unless the urgent need for sustained investment is met and policies move in the right direction. While fiscal conditions have recently improved in some countries in the Asia-Pacific region, significant risks remain. Many countries face the difficult choice of having to balance medium- to long-term development interests with short-term recovery needs. Moreover, the crises have demonstrated that we must endeavor to better understand the interconnectedness of energy, food and finance security, and the complex interactions between them, as this is a potent mix that has destabilized economies and can jeopardize longer-term development. This 2023 Asia-Pacific SDG Partnership Report\u2014Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus\u2014goes to the heart of this nexus and examines the role of energy, food and finance in amplifying shocks, while also highlighting their role in providing synergistic solutions. The report analyzes how the cascading energy\u2013food\u2013 finance crises have impacted economic, educational, employment and health outcomes of people, particularly the most vulnerable. It also explores how innovations in food, energy and financial systems are vital to the solutions we urgently seek to renew development momentum and improve resilience in the region. We are pleased to issue this joint report as we work together to turn this unprecedented polycrisis into green, inclusive transitions for a sustainable future across countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

SDG stocktaking in times of compounding crises: new shocks and stresses from energy, food and finance The polycrisis has severely disrupted energy, food and finance systems in the region and set in motion new shocks and stresses that are especially devastating for the most vulnerable groups. The crisis is plunging millions more people into poverty and setting back the progress towards the SDGs even further. This situation threatens to slow down the post-COVID-19 transition towards a greener, more inclusive economy and society. Disasters triggered by natural hazards, an acute climate crisis, and political and economic turmoil have further hampered progress towards sustainable development in the region. Asia and the Pacific is at a crossroads, with a series of overlapping crises exposing vulnerabilities in the critical interlinked systems of energy, food and finance and potentially undermining longer-term sustainable development. In the polycrisis, however, also lies hope and opportunity for change. It can be seen as an important turning point towards a cleaner and more secure future, initiating renewed momentum to transform energy and food systems. Recovering from the polycrisis will require countries to address these immediate vulnerabilities whilst not losing track of longer-term development objectives. Without substantial progress on climate change mitigation in line with international agreements, climate-related disasters will become more frequent and extreme.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fed471a4-8b1b-453a-a563-29d2e08066f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "fed471a4-8b1b-453a-a563-29d2e08066f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus: 2023 Asia-Pacific SDG Partnership Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4955aa55461bb1e2d7b6941f88d45e7f969378bc61adacd53c9750e4a92d3b50"}, "2": {"node_id": "58278c7a-2cfe-4ae8-9a32-7b2542ba3001", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1f2f6eb2f45d92259a726711fb1b34ee9bc927078d9187965a917e93e60750c"}}, "hash": "68300ec5fdf62905604f9d6077392035d56d3c29937a061e6745c867612ea3d4", "text": "Preparing the Asia-Pacific region to navigate ongoing and future crises will require coordinated and inclusive transformations of the energy, food, and finance systems at regional, subregional, national and local levels.

Emerging approaches to making energy and food systems more efficient and less wasteful, along with the promotion of sustainable consumption, can further reduce environmental degradation and benefit both farmers and consumers. Replicating and scaling up existing innovations and solutions will promote more sustainable and inclusive energy and food systems, capitalizing on opportunities to overcome the polycrisis and advance the SDGs. ii Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus Key messages Chapter 3. Reclaiming the decade of action on the SDGs The polycrisis calls for multinational and multisectoral responses to address the stalling of progress on SDGs and build back better. Strengthening regional and subregional partnerships across the energy-food-finance nexus is vital to help countries become more resilient in the face of current and future shocks. National strategies that make use of cross-sector and cross- agency collaborations can foster coherent and cohesive policy solutions. Data-driven and adaptive institutions can enable countries in Asia and the Pacific to better respond to crises and build resilience of the energy, food and finance systems over the medium to long term. New technologies, when well designed and implemented, present an extraordinary opportunity to shape more effective public policy and private sector solutions across the three systems. Applying agile governance and participatory scenario planning can enable national institutions to adapt to changing circumstances through more responsive policymaking. Financing robust, inclusive and adaptive social protection systems is critical to address multi- dimensional risks and improve the energy and food security of vulnerable groups in the face of the recent crises, promoting long-term resilience. Encouraging private enterprises to use SDG impact frameworks and develop bankable projects for SDG-aligned financing will help channel more capital towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is therefore crucial to ensure financial market regulators are well placed to manage climate change risks and smooth the low-carbon transition. Recalibrating public financial management is vital to protecting fiscal space and boosting public investment towards the SDGs amid worsening fiscal conditions. Good practices from countries in the region indicate the need to integrate SDGs in the budgeting process, explore new approaches to revenue mobilisation and reform wasteful agricultural, food and fossil fuel subsidies. Scaling up private sector investment would accelerate the transition to sustainable energy and food systems. Broad opportunities exist for stakeholders to explore innovative financial solutions towards sustainability, including by better linking products to the SDGs to address the energy-food-finance nexus. Regional and subregional initiatives must complement technical and country- or community- level interventions. Amid the polycrisis, redoubling commitments to lower trade barriers and support a just energy transition through closer and stronger cooperation will help promote food and energy security. iii The report was prepared under the Asia-Pacific SDG Partnership of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

Explanatory notes x Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus Introduction The convergence of multiple global crises has further derailed efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.

This report uses the term \u201cpolycrisis\u201d to refer to the current overarching global economic and social crisis.1 It is comprised of multiple simultaneous crises whose impacts compound each other at the societal and global level. The current \u201cpolycrisis\u201d encompasses the longstanding but increasingly severe climate change crisis, the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In some countries in the region, political and economic crises at the national and local level have exacerbated the adverse impacts of these three major crises. While the polycrisis has exposed weaknesses in the existing energy, food and finance systems, it has proved a catalyst for fresh momentum to redirect the global and regional economies and societies towards a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient future. The crisis is an opportunity for people and societies to positively shape the future by making prudent choices now, which bring major beneficial impacts in the long-term and are likely to be more cost-effective than putting off action until it becomes absolutely inescapable.

Through a complex web of macroeconomic, trade and financial channels, the crisis has negatively impacted economies, with net importers of energy and food facing particularly acute challenges. Faced with higher borrowing, deteriorating current account balances, and the need to support vulnerable people struggling to meet their basic energy and food needs, governments are grappling with shrinking fiscal space. Even though the needs are greater than ever, public resources devoted to achieving the SDGs are increasingly scarce. While fiscal deficits fell in This report3 describes the impacts of the polycrisis that could undermine years of investment in reducing hunger, providing energy access, and achieving other SDGs. The report also explores opportunities the polycrisis presents to redirect the region towards a greener, more inclusive and more resilient future by transforming the interconnected energy, food, and finance sectors to achieve the SDGs.

The extensive disruption of the energy, food, and finance systems calls for urgent action to improve the resilience of governments, businesses, and people to future shocks. The multi-dimensional impacts of the polycrisis necessitate integrated solutions to achieve the SDGs by exploiting synergies across the areas of energy, food and finance (figure 2). This report is composed of three chapters. Chapter 1 analyses the impact of the polycrisis on energy, food, and finance systems. Chapter 2 explores specific opportunities for green and inclusive transformations of the energy, food, and financing systems that can help improve resilience to the impacts of global shocks in the region.

This situation threatens to slow down the post-COVID-19 transition towards a greener, more inclusive economy and society.

However, the crises in 2022 have halted, and in some cases reversed, this momentum (figure 3). For example, while lower energy demand during the pandemic reduced greenhouse gas emissions and drove up the share of renewables, a bounce back in demand and the 2022 turmoil in global energy markets prompted an increase in the use of coal for electricity generation. While the pandemic spurred some temporary improvements in social protection as part of emergency response, largely through stimulus packages and schemes to address immediate health and socio-economic needs, the cost-of-living crisis, accentuated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have again put vulnerable groups at risk and impeded the prospects of sustainable recovery from the pandemic. Disasters triggered by natural hazards, climatic crises, and political and economic turmoil have further constrained SDG achievements.

Given the region\u2019s strong integration in global supply chains, severe economic scarring is expected. The International Monetary Fund in late 2022 cut its forecast of the regional output level for 2025 compared to its original 2021 estimate.7 The disruptions in global supply chains of key commodities such as wheat, maize and natural gas have led to a surge in inflation and a subdued growth outlook.8 Elevated food and energy price inflation is likely to further widen consumption inequalities in the region, and fiscal policies to support vulnerable households may not be sufficient to contain the negative distributional implications. With narrow fiscal space and high debt burdens, countries face a challenging path to reverse the lasting impact of the polycrisis on the region\u2019s development prospects. 1.1.1. Exposure of countries in Asia and the Pacific to energy and food price shocks The severity of the current economic shocks on countries in Asia and the Pacific is a function of their exposure and vulnerability to crisis and their capacity to cope. Several countries in the region are net importers of fossil fuels and food, and key trading partners of the Russian Federation or Ukraine, or both (figure 4).9 6 Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus A preliminary economic assessment by ESCAP shows that Cambodia, Pakistan, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu are heavily exposed to rising energy prices because their net fuel imports are equivalent to more than 3 per cent of GDP. Similarly, Georgia, Kiribati and Solomon Islands, are highly susceptible to food price shocks, as net food imports in these countries account for over 50 per cent of domestic supply.10 Underlying food insecurity conditions further deepen the impact of these price volatilities. Table 1 provides data on structural characteristics in selected countries that affect the exposure to global energy and food price shocks. The continued importance of agriculture in the region further increases the region\u2019s exposure to fertiliser supply shocks. Agricultural land accounted for 39 per cent of total land in Asia in 2020, with almost one fifth in Landlocked Figure 5: Indices of prices for food and selected commodities since January 2020 (2014- 2016 = 100) Source:\ufffd FAO,\ufffdWorld Food Situation,\ufffdAvailable\ufffdat:\ufffdwww.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/. Developing Countries11, and about 30 per cent of the regional workforce engaged in agriculture in 2021.12 High agricultural input costs not only disrupt the region\u2019s food production but also put at risk the livelihoods of millions of people. Commodity prices have eased globally, to varying degrees, yet concerns remain as they are still above historical average levels. Global crude oil and food prices peaked in 2022 amid lingering pandemic-related effects, geopolitical disruptions and strained supply chains. In early 2023, Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) eased.13 With regard to food prices, the FAO food price index showed an upward trend in the wake of the pandemic and hit a record high in March 2022 (figure 5). Despite a significant drop in the index towards the end of 2022, the food price index hit a new annual all-time high in 2022.

Exposure to disasters triggered by natural hazards and climate change shocks Countries in Asia and the Pacific are particularly vulnerable to the impact of disasters triggered by natural hazards and climate change shocks. Based on the World Risk Index 2022, which ranks 193 countries on their risk or experiencing disaster or vulnerability to extreme natural events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flood and drought, seven of the top ten countries with highest risk are in the region.15 The Philippines, India, and Indonesia occupy the top three positions. In the Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Australia, Solomon Islands, and New Zealand are at \u201cvery high\u201d risk. Climatic and disaster shocks take a heavy toll on human life and economies. In the last two decades, over 475,000 people lost their lives as a direct result of more than 11,000 extreme weather events globally and economic losses amounted to $2.56 trillion.16 Figure 6 provides estimates of the human and economic costs of disasters triggered by natural hazards in 2021 across the Asia-Pacific region. 8 Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus Figure 6: Disasters triggered by natural hazards in Asia and the Pacific, 2021 Figure 7: Number of disasters in Asia and the Pacific, 2018-2022 Source:\ufffd EM-DAT\ufffdThe\ufffdinternational\ufffddisasters\ufffddatabase,\ufffd2021.

Impact of energy and food price shocks on countries and people in the region Global energy price increases led to higher fuel prices for Asia-Pacific consumers in 2022, with severe knock-on effects on transport and electricity prices. This trend is largely due to a high dependence on imported fossil fuels in several countries in the region. Figure 9 shows the effects of this energy trade pattern on the current account balance Current account balance in selected petroleum net exporting\ufffdcountries Current account balance in selected petroleum net importing countries in selected petroleum net importing and exporting countries. In Pacific Island countries with a heavy reliance on petroleum imports, fuel prices have surged from July 2020 to August 2022, with estimates indicating a 118 per cent rise in Samoa, 83 per cent in Fiji, and 70 per cent in Tonga.18 In countries in South Asia, the energy price shocks hit several productive sectors and caused export losses. In some Asia-Pacific countries, power outages may also have led to the temporary closure of schools and businesses. -5 0 5 10 Q1- 2020 Q2- 2020 Q3- 2020 Q4- 2020 Q1- 2021 Q2- 2021 Q3- 2021 Q4- 2021 Q1- 2022 Q2- 2022 Percentage of GDP Azerbaijan Kazakhstan Malaysia Russian Federation Viet Nam -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 Q1- 2020 Q2- 2020 Q3- 2020 Q4- 2020 Q1- 2021 Q2- 2021 Q3- 2021 Q4- 2021 Q1- 2022 Q2- 2022 Percentage of GDP China India Indonesia Philippines", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0809e78-d6ea-4c9a-aa14-988f6fbf3a99": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0809e78-d6ea-4c9a-aa14-988f6fbf3a99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus: 2023 Asia-Pacific SDG Partnership Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e08e3d561d70796a7537a601dd9d3f119ce792d2a31b49f79a1d307174eced0"}, "3": {"node_id": "10ab7e0b-14bd-49ab-99c3-2daa931c50bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9267cb1d8140bf6316b2529fdc63f97a4f34147a3491f1f11d5f7c1dbc58a9e8"}}, "hash": "826328cc9b404a1d3ec516a073ad8b72538dbd81bb2e3110c4f428e0cabc60c1", "text": "Thailand 10 Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus Many countries in the region have suffered from double-digit food price inflation.

Higher food and fuel import prices have resulted in a significant negative terms-of-trade shock, with the biggest impact felt in import-reliant Pacific Island countries (i.e., all of them except Papua New Guinea, which exports petroleum).20 While the Asian Development Bank has revised upwards the subregional economic growth projection for 2023 amid a rebound in tourism, sustained high inflation in Cook Islands, Samoa, and Tonga weigh on recovery prospects.21 Despite the urgent need for the Pacific to transition to renewable energy, during 2010-2019, the share of renewable energy consumption largely stagnated (figure B). In fact, countries such as Fiji and Kiribati, which relied heavily on renewables in 2010, consumed less energy from renewable energy sources by 2019. Countries in which renewable energy accounted for less than 10 per cent of total final energy consumption saw little to no increase.

The polycrisis has affected people within countries differently, with high food and fuel prices having uneven welfare implications. Food and energy carry considerable weight in the expenditure baskets of consumers, particularly among vulnerable people and low- income households. Since poorer households spend a large proportion of their income on food, households in the bottom 40 per cent of the income distribution generally suffered a bigger decline in real income compared to the top 60 per cent group.22 In addition, average real wage growth in the region in 2022 fell below its historical average, slowing from 3.5 per cent in 2021 to 1.3 per cent in the first half of 2022.23 In Sri Lanka, struggling with a mix of global economic headwinds and a domestic political crisis, workers earning a minimum wage experienced a 23.9 per cent24 decline in real wages between 2020 and 2022. Meanwhile, in the Philippines, a higher proportion of poor households were forced to reduce food consumption, compared to their better off neighbours.25 Energy prices also had direct consequences on the daily lives of people. In the Pacific Island countries, the price shock hit urban and rural communities alike, with people in urban areas spending more on direct consumption of electricity and fuel while people in rural areas experienced higher transportation costs.26 Box 3 highlights the impact of the polycrisis on food and fuel prices in 2022 in Kyrgyzstan. 12 Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus Source:\ufffd World\ufffdFood\ufffdProgramme,\ufffdPrice Monitoring for Food Security in the Kyrgyz Republic: Country Brief,\ufffd(2020).

During the pandemic, large amounts of public funds were diverted to the health sector, forcing many governments to increase their borrowing or cut spending in other areas. Meanwhile, in response to the ongoing energy and food crisis, many governments in the region Some of the policy responses have inflicted economic and social costs amid the interacting and cascading shocks. Subsidies and transfers have put pressure on public finances, increasing fiscal deficits and public debt. Public debt in developing countries rose to 65.1 per cent of GDP in 2021, from 55.7 per cent in 2019.32 The additional debt requires have introduced various further measures, including subsidies, cash transfers, and price controls, despite narrowing fiscal space and the risk of debt crises in developing countries.31 In the first nine months of 2022, around 26 countries in Asia and the Pacific implemented or announced over one hundred policy measures in response to the energy and food crises. Table 2 shows that subsidies were the dominant measure (accounting for 36 per cent of the total number), followed by trade measures (26.2 per cent) and social transfers (16.5 per cent). Based on available data on 60 policy measures in 12 countries in the region, $96.2 billion was spent, with an average outlay of 0.9 per cent of GDP per country. In this smaller set of countries, subsidies also accounted for the biggest portion of total spending (68 per cent), followed by cash and in-kind transfers (25 per cent) among others.

Meanwhile, price subsidies, fuel tax cuts, and other support measures for energy producing and energy consuming enterprises have acted as a brake on energy subsidy reform efforts in the region. In response to record energy prices, governments maintained or expanded subsidies (Malaysia), reversed subsidy reform efforts (Pakistan), and introduced subsidies for the first time (Japan).35 To address energy poverty in the face of high global prices, fossil fuel subsidies also increased in countries, such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Pakistan, which in recent years had taken prudent steps to reduce subsidies and reallocated funds towards equitable policies. However, budgetary pressures forced many governments in the region to scrap or reduce subsidies soon after they were introduced. Many countries found targeted social welfare schemes more effective and equitable to address energy price inflation than universal subsidies. On average, a monthly universal subsidy of $1,000 was found to prevent just one person from falling into poverty, compared with 2.7 people when the same amount is spent in the form of a targeted cash transfer.36 Companies\u2019 and consumers\u2019 steps to ease financial distress have amplified negative side effects on livelihoods and welfare. Many farmers in the region have scaled back their use of fertilisers in response to the high prices, which might reduce rice yields by 10 per cent or more and exacerbate food security concerns.37 In Lao PDR, many rice farmers have taken up other employment due to high agricultural input costs38, while some Pacific Island countries have seen a decline in cropped areas. Some livestock breeders in the Pacific have reduced stock amid rising costs of feed while some fishers have reduced the use of their boats to save fuel.39 Many consumers in the region have taken actions that are likely to have negative health consequences, as well as compromise their future economic security and ability to cope with future shocks. Faced with record high food price inflation, 86 per cent of Sri Lankan households have reportedly tried to cope by eating less, eating less nutritious food, or skipping meals.40 An increase in negative coping strategies in Pacific countries in the second half of 2022 was also noted, with households reducing their expenditure on health and education, depleting their assets (Samoa), resorting to begging (Vanuatu), or switching to cheaper, often less healthy food, among others.41 Changes in energy consumption patterns have also been reported in some countries, with high LPG prices prompting some consumers in Viet Nam to switch back to cheaper, but dirtier, cooking fuels.42 1.3 Impact of the polycrisis on the SDGs The polycrisis has adversely affected and derailed development progress in Asia and the Pacific, pushing the SDGs further out of reach. Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy), Goal 2 (zero hunger) and Goal 8 (economic growth and decent work) are strongly affected by the current multiple crises. These goals are susceptible to both the direct effects (ability of people to afford energy and food) and indirect effects (availability of resources to improve energy and food security) of the polycrisis. Relatedly, the mobilisation of additional resources for the SDGs in developing countries framed under Goal 17, a critical element for a resilient and just recovery, has become more challenging. 15 Chapter 1: SDG stocktaking in times of compounding crises: new shocks and stresses from energy, food and finance 1.3.1. Impact on Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy) Setbacks in access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services. Before the pandemic access to electricity in Asia and the Pacific had been improving in urban and rural areas (figure 11). However, large gaps still existed in LDCs and SIDS, where, on average, nearly 10 per cent of the population had no access to electricity. On the other hand, primary reliance on clean fuel technologies increased significantly between 2015 and 2020, although in rural areas half of the population still had no access to clean fuels (figure 11). China, India, and Indonesia, Asia\u2019s three most populous countries, increased access to clean fuel technologies faster than Limited progress in renewable energy uptake.

In most LDCs, however, the proportion of the population with access to clean fuels stalled at less than 30 per cent in 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the current energy and food crisis have already caused 75 million people across the world, many of them in Asia and the Pacific, to lose the ability to pay for an \u201cextended bundle of electricity services\u201d. Moreover, the crises have forced 100 million people to switch from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking to traditional stoves, as consumers\u2019 spending power has come under threat and prices of LPG and clean fuels have soared.43 Figure 11: Population with access to electricity and with primary reliance on clean cooking fuels and technologies in Asia and the Pacific, 2015 and 2020 Source:\ufffd Asia-Pacific\ufffdSDG\ufffdGateway 92.2 98.3 86.6 60.4 84.1 36.5 97.3 99.4 95.1 71.6 89 53.1 0 20 40 60 80 100 Total Urban Rural Total Urban Rural Percentage 2015 2020 Proportion of population with access to electricity Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technologies sources in several countries in Asia and the Pacific. India increased its renewable electricity consumption by 45 per cent in the first six weeks of lockdown as a decline in electricity demand led to the shutdown of several coal- fired power stations, with \u2018must-run\u2019 renewable plants meeting a larger share of demand.45 Similar trends were observed in other coal- consuming countries in the region. However, they were short-lived. As demand picked up again, countries largely reverted to fossil fuels to meet energy demand. 16 Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus The Russian invasion of Ukraine played havoc with the supply of fossil fuels in most countries in the region, which are net fuel importers. The impact has been especially large for developing countries that are reluctant to engage in business with the Russian Federation but cannot meet their energy needs from elsewhere due to the high prices in the global market.46 Against this backdrop, the crisis has highlighted the need for countries in the region to push for rapid energy transitions with more investment in renewables. In addition, the polycrisis could also disrupt the supply of raw materials vital to developing renewable energy systems and technologies. The Russian Federation is the world\u2019s third largest producer of aluminium (5.5 per cent of the market), a key component of solar photovoltaic panels and electric vehicles. The Russian Federation and Ukraine also account for nearly 11 per cent of global solar power production. The Russian invasion has disrupted the supply chain, triggered a rise in the price of those materials, and made renewable production and installation more costly. Heightened investment risks amid increased global economic uncertainties due to the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine can act as a brake on the renewable energy development in the region. 1.3.2. Impact on Goal 2 (zero hunger) Rise in hunger and malnutrition. The polycrisis has exacerbated the risk of increased hunger and malnutrition in countries in Asia and the Pacific, particularly among vulnerable groups. The status of malnutrition in the region was already challenging before the pandemic. From a steady improvement since 2015, the trend reversed in 2018 and in the wake of the pandemic both the number and proportion of undernourished people surged.47 In 2021, an estimated 425 million people were undernourished in the region, accounting for more than half of the global figure.

Informal workers and those in poor quality employment, often without access to social security, are at high risk of facing impacts from climate change and the prevalence of these types of employment is high in climate vulnerable contexts.59 Labour market inequalities. The current context of overlapping economic and geopolitical crises is likely to increase labour market inequalities experienced by vulnerable groups, including women and youth. With the onset of the pandemic and the dual adverse impacts on labour markets and education and skills development institutions, the region experienced an increase in the share and number of youth not in employment, education, or training (NEET), highlighting potential lasting negative impacts in their job prospects and future earnings (figure 16).60 While youth NEET rates dropped across subregions in 2022, it remained above 2019 levels in most subregions. Even before the pandemic nearly one in four young people in Asia and the Pacific were NEET.

Impact on SDG finance (under Goal 17: Partnerships for the goals) The crises have widened the financing gaps for achieving the SDGs. UNCTAD estimates that the annual global financing gap is now $4.3 trillion. This is 70 per cent higher than the 2015 estimate, reflecting a reduction in public and private investments in sustainable development due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the impacts of climate change.62 The SDG funding gaps have widened significantly in many developing countries in the region. Indonesia, for example, saw a big increase in the projected funding gap from $1.1 trillion (in total up to 2030) before the pandemic to $4.7 trillion in 2021.63 Exacerbated by the food and energy crises and rising cost of living, closing the existing gaps has become even more challenging, especially for LDCs.

Grants account for the largest share of ODA to LDCs. However, the share of grants to LDCs declined from 90 per cent in 2015 to 75 per cent in 2019, mostly because of an increase in ODA loans.70 The OECD indicated that, despite being highly concessional in nature, ODA loans are gradually exhibiting higher interest rates and shorter maturities.71 1.4 Outlook and the case for change The Asia-Pacific region is at a crossroads, with a series of overlapping shocks exposing vulnerabilities in the critical systems of energy, food and finance and potentially undermining longer-term development objectives. Recent and ongoing events including the lingering COVID-19 pandemic, Russian invasion of Ukraine, a cost-of-living crisis, tightening financial conditions, and a worsening climate crisis are reversing years of progress and affecting economic, educational, employment, and health outcomes. This is exacerbating the divergence in development trajectories of countries, as well as of people within these countries, due to limitations on fiscal space and existing income inequalities. All levels of government need to address these impacts, as they permeate all levels of society, while adopting multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder sustainable solutions. Emerging from the polycrisis will require countries to keep longer- term development objectives in sight, while responding to immediate vulnerabilities. The polycrisis can be viewed as a historic turning point towards a cleaner and more secure future, initiating renewed momentum to transform the current energy and food systems.72 The uncertainties and volatility in commodity prices experienced by countries in the region are likely to continue in 2023 due to currency depreciations and the unfolding of the energy transition. The World Bank estimates that agricultural, gas, and coal prices will fall in 2023 and 2024.73 However, these estimates are subject to risks, including the extent to which fluctuations in energy prices spill over into global food prices and thereby heighten the challenge of food insecurity. Addressing these weaknesses provides opportunities to facilitate green and inclusive transformations of the energy and food systems to improve resilience, mitigate climate change, and deliver employment and economic benefits. The ILO estimates that green policy measures could generate an additional 5.8 million jobs for young people aged 15-29 in Asia and the Pacific by 2030 relative to a \u201cbusiness-as- usual\u201d scenario.74 Without substantial progress on climate change mitigation in line with international agreements, climate-related disasters will become more frequent and extreme. The international community has recognised the inevitable impacts of climate change, with the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) establishing a fund to compensate developing countries for loss and damage caused by climate-induced disasters.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57db7994-52ff-4b4f-8302-ad66664cfae8": {"__data__": {"id_": "57db7994-52ff-4b4f-8302-ad66664cfae8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus: 2023 Asia-Pacific SDG Partnership Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90b6d3bb4472ea0eb9f6bd3920a483a3d56f9953b714a6c4b5e6561f6f86da54"}, "2": {"node_id": "7253a758-b77f-4474-99f6-4497616c73cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06c16e8a48e4fc00290f78ab5b405deefc1f8aca7256223e192075af9245918f"}}, "hash": "d2e0767bd67dea04651cbac781414fada9e1f6eaef6a02ef1b21ee4bac7fc311", "text": "Preparing the Asia-Pacific region to navigate ongoing and future crises will require coordinated and inclusive transformations of the energy, food, and finance systems.

Many efforts that facilitate a transition to these new models, such as increasing renewable energy- based electricity generation capacity and improving agricultural efficiency, were already underway before the recent crises. However, progress has not been sufficient to meet energy and food related SDGs by 2030. To change this, governments and other stakeholders must: (i) accelerate existing efforts to implement solutions, supported by innovative financing sources and models, enabling policy and regulatory frameworks, and behavioural interventions, (ii) place greater emphasis on ensuring more equitable distribution of energy and food, (iii) strengthen interlinkages between the energy, food, and finance systems, mitigate potential conflicts, and exploit synergies across the energy-food- finance nexus. This chapter identifies key opportunities and solutions to transform the energy and food sectors, harness new sources of sustainable finance to achieve the SDGs, and capitalise on the energy-food-finance nexus to contribute to a green, inclusive transition. Where appropriate, successful solutions can be replicated across the region. Some of them can be implemented without delay (subject to appropriate finance being available), while others will require more investment and maturation before they are carried out. The scale of solutions differs, too, ranging from small interventions at the community level to national and regional initiatives. 2.1 Innovative approaches to building more inclusive and sustainable energy and food systems Innovation, in various forms, is playing a critical role in generating cost effective, sustainable ways to meet the region\u2019s demands for energy and food. There is an urgent need to scale up these innovative approaches and make energy and food systems more sustainable and inclusive in the wake of the polycrisis. Possible approaches comprise new technologies, business models, policy frameworks, and social innovations that make the systems more accessible and more suitable for marginalized and vulnerable groups, including poor and small-scale farmers. Despite growing interest in such approaches, there remain significant barriers to successful scaling-up and implementation, including financial constraints, lack of political will, regulatory hurdles, and social and cultural norms that resist change. Overcoming them is vital to shaping a more sustainable and inclusive future and will require sustained efforts and collaboration from all stakeholders. 2.1.1. Embracing smart and low- carbon farming approaches Being home to a large and growing population that depends on agriculture for livelihoods and food security, the Asia-Pacific region should ramp up adoption of smart and sustainable farming practices and shift away from intensive use of energy, chemical fertilisers and pesticides that degrade the environment and contribute to climate change. Several successful initiatives in the region show the potential of such approaches. In India, various new technologies have been embedded in agricultural production, such as solar-assisted irrigation in off-grid rural areas, and solar-powered multi-utility farming vehicles. With funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Claro Energy trialed the use of 50 solar battery- powered irrigation trolleys, 50 ultra-light hand- carried flexible systems, and two mini-grids in three communities in northern India. The solar irrigation system benefitted 1,000 small farmers (30 per cent of whom were women), supported the production of 2,300 tons of rice, maize and other crops, and cut costs by 50 per cent compared with the previous irrigation method (primarily diesel pumps).75 Some farmers have adopted precision farming techniques, for example Fasal, a private company in India, which uses data and artificial 27 Chapter 2: Energy, food and financing solutions for the SDGs intelligence to optimize the use of inputs like water and fertilisers, resulting in higher yields and reduced environmental impact. The startup estimates that its platform has helped save some 9 billion litres of irrigation water, reduced pesticide use by around 60 per cent, Agrivoltaics (the co-development of land for solar power and agriculture) and agroecology (the application of ecological principles to agricultural systems and practices) also offer sustainable farming solutions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5690fa4e-c288-4f7a-8267-0c8fe46cdc44": {"__data__": {"id_": "5690fa4e-c288-4f7a-8267-0c8fe46cdc44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus: 2023 Asia-Pacific SDG Partnership Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b8aab90118801ffdd0c68460a0371c4ab53737b80c2d4546c6bfa576fc51ebf1"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9f87d03-5fde-4f1b-8e66-f409127ec8c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d11fbe7a79c045130d340b5f947d506e2e7b828d1572fd6a6e549d9c70e0863"}}, "hash": "c4f711f98571b32c5912f04d712b6da9a433eed984464130614ad214bc15aa2c", "text": "Agrivoltaic farming, such as the deployment of PV systems combined with goji berry cultivation in Ningxia province in China, optimizes land use, improves water and energy efficiency, and helps with income generation and climate change mitigation.

SatSure, a Bengaluru-based spacetech startup, uses advances in satellite remote sensing, big data analytics, and cloud computing to create products and solutions that help companies make smart decisions. Its projects focus on sustainability, financial inclusion, and food and water security. In the agriculture sector, risk assessments traditionally rely on field labour that is costly and time-consuming and therefore can only cover a small geographic area. This leaves farm managers unable to quickly respond to variable weather conditions, can make agricultural lending perilous, and reduces the impact of public agricultural programmes. SatSure seeks to address these problems and assess risk more accurately by combining satellite imagery with field data, and other relevant information, such as commodity prices and news articles. SatSure\u2019s data analytics platform unlocks finance for smallholder farms by aggregating real-time and historical data from satellites and operations. The AI- powered modelling estimates a farm\u2019s income generation potential, hence allowing potential lenders to assess risk more accurately.

Together with partners, SGP supports community organizations to use approaches, techniques, and methodologies in line with the principles of agroecology and climate- sensitive land resources management.

Excess food can feed vulnerable consumers while food waste can be converted to energy. Every year, the region generates a glut of residues from 29 Chapter 2: Energy, food and financing solutions for the SDGs rice, wheat, sugarcane, and other crops, as well as livestock. Some of these residues are used as animal feed, for cooking, or for other productive purposes. A significant share, however, is burnt or left to decay, with adverse consequences for human health, soil, and air. Upcycling agricultural waste Crop residues can be used to generate electricity using several technologies\u2014from biogas capture and use in turbines to co- firing residues in thermal plants. However, the logistics and cost of collecting, transporting, and storing residues present significant challenges. Developing a reliable supply chain that ensures a stable supply of feedstock, creates jobs, and supports farmers\u2019 livelihoods is critical. A role for specialised companies that manage the collection, transport, storage, processing of residues and the distribution of processed bioenergy to customers is exemplified by Punjab Renewable Energy Systems Pvt. Ltd., the largest provider of biomass fuel aggregation and supply services in India.77 In Singapore, biodiesel is produced by processing various waste and residual raw materials, such as used cooking oil (box 6). In 2010, Neste, a Finnish oil company, started operating a refinery that produces 100 per cent renewable biodiesel in Singapore. The government and Neste developed the project, giving them a global first-mover advantage in a strategic location for sourcing raw materials and serves as a logistical hub for biofuel production and export. Neste\u2019s biorefinery uses the company\u2019s proprietary \u201cnext generation biomass to liquid\u201d (NExBTL) technology to produce a high-quality diesel fuel. Cars, trucks, or buses can run on this fuel with no blending limitations. The plant can process a variety of fats and oils from renewable feedstocks, such as various waste and residual raw materials, including used cooking oil and waste animal fats. Neste sources these feedstocks from the Asia-Pacific region. As the company does not rely on food energy crops as a feedstock, it avoids the food-energy trade-off common in conventional biofuel production and widely criticized for undermining food security. Neste is investing EUR1.65 billion ($1.8 billion) to expand the biorefinery to produce sustainable aviation fuel. Once it becomes operational in 2023, the refinery will be able to produce up to 1 million tonnes per year, making it the world\u2019s largest sustainable aviation fuel plant. It will also have the capacity to improve feedstock pre-treatment, enabling it to process increasingly low-grade waste and residues. Efforts are underway to test new materials, such as algae or straw, for future feedstock. The market is responding to the expanding supply of biofuel. Although sustainable aviation fuel is more expensive than conventional jet fuel, Singapore Airlines has started using sustainable aviation fuel at Singapore\u2019s Changi Airport, while leading airlines in Japan and New Zealand are taking the similar steps in keeping with the trends in Europe and North America.

The hydrogen is channelled into tanks that are sent to local livestock farmers and neighbouring facilities for use in fuel cell vehicles, forklift trucks, and fish breeding facilities, among other uses.79 Meanwhile, EGAS Energy, a Pakistan-Finland joint venture, captures gas from dormant or flared gas fields, processes it to make it pipeline quality, and then transports the pressurised gas to compressed natural gas stations and industrial customers.

Dairy plants offered above average electricity savings (19 per cent of consumption) and frozen and cooked food plants offered above average fuel savings (60 per cent of consumption). Two-thirds of potential savings were from boiler, chiller, and refrigeration systems.81 Improvements leading to lower energy costs is also intended under the UK-ASEAN Energy Efficiency Accelerator programme, which supports food and beverage companies in Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Another way to support energy efficiency improvements in businesses, as used widely in several Asian countries, is to facilitate the adoption of energy-service company (ESCO) business models.82 This approach involves private companies, often engaged by the government, indentifying and implementing energy efficiency measures in exchange for compensation based on their performance (typically a guarantee of energy savings or a share of energy savings). Curbing food waste and losses Lost or wasted food embodies wasted energy and other resources, emits methane, and represents lost income and missed opportunities to provide people with nutrition. The FAO estimates that food lost and wasted across the world could feed almost 1.3 billion hungry people each year.83 Food losses can be reduced using sustainable processing innovations (box 7). A lack of access to temperature-controlled storage and transport, especially for perishable vegetables and fruits, leads to sub-optimal food quality and lower incomes for farmers. Cold storage facilities can enable farmers to better time the sale of their crops and consequently receive better prices. In India, Tan90, a Chennai- based startup, designed small and portable cold storage boxes to keep perishable items, such as vegetables, fruits, flowers, fish, and milk products, under controlled temperatures during transport, without grid power.84 The product is cheaper and more versatile than refrigerated trucks and offers a wider temperature range than ice boxes. 31 Chapter 2: Energy, food and financing solutions for the SDGs S4S Technologies, an agritech startup, uses solar dehydrators to process food that would otherwise be lost after harvesting. The technology was designed to address a lack of available storage space, which results in post-harvest losses and lost income to farmers. The dehydrators can preserve 45 different types of vegetables, fruits, pulses, cereals, and spices. The dehydrated foods have a one-year shelf-life, without the need for preservatives, and retain up to 95 per cent of the food\u2019s original nutrient content. S4S places dehydrators with women farmers in villages and works with local banks to arrange loans. Typically, 10-30 women in each village decide to get a dehydrator. The company sources and delivers the crops from local farmers and trains the women on how to use the technology. Once the women have dehydrated the vegetables (e.g., ginger, garlic, carrot, and beetroot), women employed by S4S in each village arrange pick-up and delivery to S4S\u2019s factory. After performing quality control and secondary processing, the company sells the products to various customers. S4S then pays the women and farmers the market rate for their products and earns a margin. S4S buys crops from 6,500 smallholders, usually through local co-operatives. It works with over 500 women who dehydrate the vegetables in the Indian states of Odisha, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu, as well as more than 850 customers. The farmers process 27,500 tons of food each year that otherwise would have gone to waste. Each farmer earns the equivalent of $1,000 to $1,500 per year from selling dried food to S4S.

The pilot was carried out by SOLShare in conjunction with the NGO UBOMUS, the government- owned specialised non-financial institution IDCOL, and the Centre for Energy at the Dhaka-based United International University. The technical solution involves households being physically connected to each other via a low-voltage direct current mini-grid and each household having a SOLShare electrical meter that allows it to buy renewable electricity from or sell renewable electricity to neighbouring households or businesses. Households are, in turn, connected to a blockchain-enabled ICT system that handles mobile money payments, customer service, remote monitoring, and grid optimisation. The system, thus, allows households that do not have their own solar systems to obtain access to low-cost, renewable electricity without the need for a large, centralised grid. Meanwhile, households that have their own systems earn additional income from selling surplus electricity. SOLShare\u2019s village grids can unlock up to 30 per cent excess Box 8: SOLshare in Bangladesh 2.1.3. Prioritizing access and participation of vulnerable groups and communities in sustainable energy and food systems Vulnerable groups and communities are disproportionately affected by the polycrisis and often lack the resources to access or participate in sustainable energy and food systems. Improving their access and participation, which requires support and facilitation by subnational governments in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, is crucial to ensure that these systems are inclusive and effective. Numerous small-scale technologies are available to provide the poor and vulnerable people with energy access. Nevertheless, financial constraints and, in the case of many technologies, a lack of awareness, result in millions of people across the region still lacking access to modern, clean energy supplies that could enhance their food security and livelihoods. Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) financing models, combined with digital technologies, are playing an increasingly important role in addressing financing constraints in unserved communities. With funding from UNCDF\u2019s Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme, Sola PayGo, a private solar power company, supplied 3,100 off-grid households and businesses in Papua New Guinea with PAYG solar-powered lighting kits between August 2019 and June 2020.87 Similarly, a mobile application that is integrated with an electromagnetic induction stove (eCook) by ATEC, a social enterprise, provides clean and affordable cooking systems on a PAYG basis for households in Bangladesh88, where around two-thirds of households use biomass for cooking.

It also opens up options for productive use of energy by businesses. Households that purchase electricity through the network pay a transparent electricity tariff that is below what electricity would cost through a solar home system. The project developer can recoup the cost of the solar home systems through a monthly fee and a share of profits on electricity sales (this microfinance mechanism monitored and paid for via the SOLShare system). The company now operates 116 grids, serving almost 1,500 households, of which around 280 sell electricity through the networks.

FAO also helped the government pilot an innovative approach to fostering improved nutrition and boosting the productive capacities of poor rural households. This approach combined the national social cash transfer programme for low-income families with children with nutrition education and nutrition-sensitive, climate-smart agriculture. The pilot covered 150 poor rural households. It complemented the cash transfer with productive support tailored to the participants\u2019 livelihood characteristics and the local agro-ecological and market conditions and opportunities. Two of the types of productive support were intended to improve household nutrition and dietary diversity through home gardening, while another sought to generate additional income and better access to nutritious food by supporting farm production. The programme also provided technical training and extension and advisory services, and nutrition education and coaching to all participants. Impact assessments found that participants of the pilot programme had benefitted from: \u2022 improvements in the quality of diets and food security (e.g., women and children\u2019s consumption of protein- and vitamin-A rich foods, and other fruits and vegetables), \u2022 a substantial increase in crop production and income from own-farm sales, \u2022 greater overall agricultural production, \u2022 improved agency and integration into the community. promote the development of sustainable industries.

Financing solutions for equitable, sustainable, and resilient energy and food systems The financing gap for the SDGs in developing countries worldwide is estimated to be about $4.9 trillion per year from 2020- 2025, a $400 billion increase from 2019- 2020 estimates.93 For food systems, there remains underinvestment in climate-smart agriculture and most of the existing resources disproportionately supported mitigation measures instead of adaptation strategies, although the latter is equally crucial. Accelerating progress towards Goal 7 on affordable and clean energy requires financing of two main pillars: (i) clean power, efficiency, and electrification; and (ii) transitions in fuels and emissions-intensive sectors. According to the World Energy Outlook 2021 by the International Energy Agency (IEA), for the world to be on track to move to net-zero emissions by 2050, investments need to be increased to around $4 trillion annually by 2030. Traditional sources of finance such as domestic public finance (e.g., taxes) and international public finance (e.g., multilateral lending and ODA) remain indispensable in financing efforts to meet energy and food-related SDGs. Domestic resource mobilisation at national and subnational levels is key to governments\u2019 ability to finance their development needs. ODA will continue to be a crucial source of financing for many developing countries and reforming the delivery of international public finance for improved outcomes for energy and food systems is vital. Further, the public finance implications inflicted by the polycrisis, particularly by putting government budgets under ever-increasing pressure, necessitates mobilisation of substantial amounts of finance from new sources. To this end, making use of private finance has never been more critical, especially recognising the wide-ranging benefits from unlocking and reorienting the $463.6 trillion of global wealth in the global financial system.94 This will entail strategic allocation of such resources to prioritised areas, including shifting to renewable energy, reforming the agricultural sector, and building social protection systems to support the needs of vulnerable populations.

Effective financing of the SDGs requires several fundamental shifts in development planning, including using the domestic budget as the primary instrument of government policy to deliver on the SDG agenda. This calls for the SDGs framework to be applied throughout the budgeting phases, namely budget preparation, execution, monitoring and audit. It also involves development of taxonomies or classification systems to facilitate tracking of allocations and expenditures, thematic areas (such as climate change and gender) and detailed methodology for budget coding or tagging. Aligning SDGs to the national budget process will ensure better policy coherence by focusing resources on strategic priorities, realizing synergies between SDGs, and recognizing trade-offs in resource allocation. It can also address short-termism in policy planning through the use of Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs). Moreover, as cities are recognized as a key contributor to climate change, climate budgeting can be used to secure commitment from sub-national governments to demonstrate stronger climate leadership. The Climate Change Budget Integration Index (CCBII) exemplifies how to effectively incorporate climate perspectives into PFM practices to promote climate- responsive fiscal policies. Box 13 highlights a similar initiative in Bangladesh. Pertaining to the energy sector, India\u2019s Union Budget 2023- 2024 illustrates the increasing importance of climate and energy security, with the equivalent of about $4.3 billion allocated to support the green transition in the energy sector, including green hydrogen and grid-scale battery storage projects. In the context of SDG 2 (zero hunger), particularly malnutrition in children (target 2.2), UNICEF developed a manual on Public Finance Management for Children-Nutrition in Asia and the Pacific to help countries incorporate nutrition in the budgeting process with a view to scale up nutrition programming. Lao PDR offers a good example of how to integrate nutrition costing (under its National Plan of Action on Nutrition) with the government budget process. Recognizing its position as one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world, the Government of Bangladesh in 2014 adopted the Climate Fiscal Framework (CFF) to make its public financial management system (PFM) climate inclusive. In 2020, the CFF was updated following the implementation of IBFCR Project in partnership with UNDP. This was in response to the government\u2019s adoption of SDGs as a new framework for national development post-2015 and a PFM reform strategy introduced in 2016. The new CFF is based on the principle of citizen-centred PFM. It puts the interest of citizens at the centre of decision making by expanding its remit to cover the role of the private sector, NGOs and CSO. To emphasise the importance of the supply side of climate finance, the CFF addresses broader financial policies, such as lending and insurance, in addition to fiscal policy tools such as tax and subsidy. Box 13: Inclusive Budgeting and Financing for Climate Resilience (IBFCR) Project in Bangladesh 40 Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus Exploring new approaches to domestic resource mobilisation. Before the pandemic, it was estimated that for the Asia-Pacific region to achieve the SDGs, annual spending would need to increase by around $1.5 trillion. Considering the adverse fiscal impacts of the polycrisis, adopting fiscal innovations to improve tax collection and increase domestic revenue will be crucial in sustaining progress to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth. Targeted tax reforms can improve the efficiency of tax administrations, thus enhancing revenue collection, and boosting economic and social benefits for the population. Examples of tax reforms include capacity building initiatives for tax officials, data systems enhancement to support more efficient tax collection, and reducing tax evasion to ensure fair taxation systems for sustainable revenue collection and long-term growth. These reforms are expected to benefit developing countries in Asia by increasing tax revenue (as a percentage of GDP) by 3 to 4 percentage points, on average.95 Despite its well-understood potential benefits, carbon pricing remains largely untapped, with only seven carbon pricing initiatives implemented or announced in developing Asia as of November 2022.

Under such a scenario, China and India are expected to enjoy welfare gains exceeding the equivalent of 3 per cent of GDP and other countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, and Sri Lanka, gains exceeding the equivalent of 1 per cent of GDP.96 Implementation of appropriate carbon- pricing instruments will support the transition to renewable energy, given their benefits in channelling financial resources to support energy policy aims (including energy security) by incentivizing investments in high-value and long-term assets such as power plants, grid infrastructure, and energy-intensive industrial plants. Initiatives such as the City Climate Finance Gap Fund, a multi-donor climate action trust fund, have supported cities in India, Viet Nam, and Indonesia to improve enabling conditions to better mobilise urban climate finance by embedding climate considerations in city strategic, spatial, and investment planning.97 Reforming agricultural, food and fossil fuel subsidies to enhance policy efficiency and promote equity. As of 2021, the total amount of subsidies dedicated to support agricultural producers worldwide was estimated at about $540 billion, 87% of which were assessed as price distorting and environmentally and socially damaging.98 Global fossil fuel subsidies are estimated to increase to 7.4 per cent of GDP in 2025 from 6.8 per cent or $5.9 trillion in 2020, of which Asia-Pacific countries accounted for 48 per cent.99 In line with Target 2.b (on trade 41 Chapter 2: Energy, food and financing solutions for the SDGs restrictions and distortions) and Target 12.4 (on chemical and waste management) of the SDGs, instituting subsidy reform in these sectors, while heeding the complexity and sensitivity of the process, is crucial to help augment government fiscal space. This will enable channelling investments towards more equitable and redistributive policy responses to support ending hunger and enhancing access to clean energy, while addressing the specific needs of vulnerable populations including through expansion of social protection. Fossil fuel subsidy reform undertaken by Indonesia in 2015 resulted in the reallocation of around $15.6 billion to support the broader development agenda. This included increasing (i) the central government budget, with the Ministry of Agriculture benefitting from a 2.2.2. Leveraging private sustainable finance Transforming the food and energy systems to support the attainment of SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) requires significant financial resources. Given budget increase of over 100 per cent; and (ii) fiscal transfers to regional governments and villages, which were used to support special projects, including food security improvements. In India, the government initiated efforts to swap fossil fuel subsidies with clean energy subsidies. Between 2014 and 2017, the allocation of public resources to subsidise petroleum products was cut by around three quarters, while public investments in the renewable energy sector increased almost six times during the same period.100 The Indian state of Andhra Pradesh took an innovative approach to agricultural subsidy reform, which involves reviving traditional farming systems that promote chemical-free agriculture, hence reducing the need for fertiliser subsidies. ZBNF was introduced in the southern Indian state of Karnataka in 1990s to promote chemical-free agricultural practices based on traditional farming methods. The inputs for ZBNF are home-grown and consist of seed treatments (bijamrita) and microbial inoculum (jiwamrita) that are applied to the soil as a liquid foliar spray or as a solid fertiliser. Recognizing its benefits, the Government of Andhra Pradesh in 2018 launched a plan to transition 6 million farmers to adopt ZBNF by 2024. It is estimated that with coverage of only 25 per cent of the agricultural land in the state, ZBNF practices could save $70 million annually in fertiliser subsidies and, more importantly, help accelerate the transition to sustainable agriculture. Rythu Sahikara Samstha, a non-profit organisation, is implementing the ZNBF programme in Andhra Pradesh. The organisation uses a network of trained people to provide extension services in village clusters, especially to women\u2019s self-help groups.

Islamic finance refers to financial services designed in accordance with Sharia principles. It is a burgeoning industry in Asia and the Pacific, notably in Malaysia and Indonesia. With social justice, prosperity for all, and avoidance of harm principles at their core, Islamic finance models are considered well-suited to support efforts to advance the sustainability agenda and counter damaging impacts, including in the food and energy sectors. Among others, relevant Islamic finance products and social finance tools include: and, more recently, SDG bonds (discussed in 2.2.3.). At the subnational level, municipal green bonds can be issued to fund investment in urban energy infrastructure. The recent recovery of the green bond market following a period of cyclical slowdown can be used to revitalize investments in clean energy technologies that were affected by the pandemic and other initiatives towards realizing Goal 2 and Goal 7.101,102 \u2022 Sukuk (bonds that comply with Sharia law). Like conventional bonds, Sukuk are commonly used to finance large-scale investments (e.g., power stations). \u2022 Zakat (mandatory charitable contribution). Zakat donations by individuals have the potential to address food insecurity among vulnerable groups and support investments in the energy sector. In Malaysia and Indonesia, 43 Chapter 2: Energy, food and financing solutions for the SDGs In September 2022, Badan Wakaf Indonesia, a government agency, and UNDP published the Green Waqf Framework. It sets out how waqf can help achieve SDGs, especially Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy) and Goal 13 (climate action). The framework defines \u201cgreen\u201d waqf as \u201cthe utilization of a waqf asset to support the attainment of ecological balance and sustainability, while also providing a social and economic impact for society.\u201d \u201cGreen\u201d projects include the transmission and generation of energy from renewable sources, improving infrastructure\u2019s energy efficiency, and waste management, among others. The framework envisages using waqf property, especially land, for such projects, as well as cash waqf. A proposed pilot project involves planting a Tamanu plantation and processing the fruit to make biodiesel that meets US and EU standards and can be used without engine modification. Tamanu fruits can also be processed for pharmaceutical, chemical, and other industrial uses and waste can be used as animal feed.

The guarantees, along with a 30-year feed-in-tariff that provides long-term revenue certainty, unlocked access to long-term debt at competitive rates and raised the project\u2019s expected equity returns to those of other geothermal projects, at 14-16 per cent. The project raised $1.17 billion of 20-year door-to-door limited recourse project financing loans. This included a direct loan of $492 million from JBIC; $329 million in commercial bank loans that benefitted from JBIC\u2019s extended political risk guarantee; $250 million loan from ADB, funded from its ordinary capital resources; and two ADB tranches of senior debt funded by the Clean Technology Fund ($80 million) and the Canadian Climate Fund for Private Sector in Asia ($20 million).

Considered an attractive financing model for young entrepreneurs, crowdfunding was used to advance the food security agenda even before the polycrisis. For example, Cropital, a peer-to-peer lending platform for smallholder farmers, was founded in 2015 by a group of students in the Philippines to improve agricultural productivity and address poverty among farmers. With growing interest among investors to support businesses and projects with prosocial and sustainable orientation, crowdfunding can be broadened to finance initiatives in response to polycrisis challenges, particularly new ventures that work at the nexus of finance, food and energy.

While sustainable finance using SDGs as a framework remains a small subset compared with broader Environment, Social, Governance (ESG) frameworks, the SDGs are seeing greater uptake, especially as they have never been more important to guide a sustainable and inclusive recovery from the pandemic, and now the polycrisis. Two specific types of innovations in this area are SDG financing instruments that target SDGs directly (e.g., SDG Bonds and sustainability sukuk) and SDG- aligned sustainable finance wherein SDGs are used to inform investment decisions (e.g., SDG-aligned blended finance). While most of these innovations are found in other regions, there are several important examples in Asia and the Pacific. SDG bonds. In recent years, SDG bonds\u2014 bonds that raise capital which the issuer uses for projects that advance the SDGs\u2014 have emerged to provide innovative products to investors.

Protecting the systems\u2019 resilience to ensure uninterrupted availability of affordable energy and food sources for all hinges on stronger cooperation between countries through regional and multilateral platforms. Regional and subregional initiatives, which complement the technical and country- or community-level interventions outlined above, span countries and can on a broader scale provide solutions to addressing the challenges wrought by the polycrisis and accelerate transitions to low- carbon and sustainable systems. Regional initiatives that are deemed crucial in time of the Box 23: SDG Indonesia One \u2013 Green Finance Facility (SIO-GFF) SIO-GFF, the first green finance facility in Southeast Asia, has been designed to address the lack of a large-scale pipeline of bankable green infrastructure projects in Indonesia. It has four pillars, namely, (i) commercial financing; (ii)concessional fund for de-risking; (iii) equity fund; and (iv) project development. SIO-GFF uses public resources to catalyse private funds and channels the blended finance into infrastructure projects to achieve the SDGs in Indonesia. To be selected for financing, subprojects must meet clear \u201cgreen\u201d or SDG-related eligibility criteria and clear bankability targets (a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.05 and a positive net present value). At least 30 per cent of private, institutional, and commercial capital must be mobilised for each \u201cgreen\u201d subproject. ADB has provided a $150 million loan over 20 years to support SIO-GFF projects on green recovery to help achieve the SDGs, including low-carbon energy projects in hydropower, biomass energy and other renewables. The initiative could catalyse green projects totalling more than $1 billion (eight times the original amount). It has strong potential to be replicated in other Asia-Pacific countries. polycrisis involve removing trade barriers and advancing just energy transition frameworks. 2.3.1. Removing barriers to cross- border trade in food and energy sectors Restrictions on trade in agricultural products, whether in the form of policies, such as tariffs or bans imposed by governments, or because of inefficient customs systems and trade infrastructure, have many negative impacts on food security. In Asia and the Pacific, the polycrisis has given rise to new trade restrictions, particularly food-related, often with potential adverse impacts on local livelihoods and food security.

In 2021, the PPFS, in collaboration with the APEC Business Advisory Council, launched the Food Security Roadmap Towards 2030 that focuses on productivity, inclusivity, and sustainability of food systems. The roadmap emphasizes the need for an open, fair, transparent, predictable, and non-discriminatory trading system to enable member countries to reap the benefits of international trade that could facilitate their food security and nutrition agenda. To support green growth in Asia-Pacific, the APEC Economic Leaders Meeting in 2012 endorsed the APEC List of Environmental Goods to which reduced tariff rates of five per cent or less would be applied. In line with the Bogor Goals to promote free and open trade in the Asia-Pacific region, the policy measure supports trade and investment liberalization in environmental goods that directly and positively contribute to green growth and sustainable development objectives. The APEC list entails 54 products at the Harmonized Standard six-digit level, including goods such as solar water heaters, biomass boilers and turbines for geothermal energy production. The initiative illustrates the important role of the removal of trade restrictions in supporting the attainment of SDG 7. In 2021, Indonesia became the 19th APEC member economy to be fully compliant with the list.

Developing frameworks for \u201cjust\u201d energy transitions While coal dominates Asia and the Pacific\u2019s energy mix and coal mining remains a major economic activity in the region, phasing down coal, the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel, is imperative to meet climate change goals. This will require substantial investment in renewable energy power plants to allow countries to meet rapidly growing energy demand and find alternative sources of employment and government revenues. As many of the existing coal-fired generating capacities in the region are far from reaching the end of their lifespan, owners will be reluctant to close their plants early. ADB has designed an innovative way to overcome this hurdle (box 25). ETM launched in November 2021, is aimed at accelerating Asia-Pacific countries\u2019 transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. It is intended to be \u201ca win for the climate, a win for local communities, and a win for developing economies\u201d. It involves the facility buying and operating coal-fired power plants at a lower cost of capital than is available to commercial companies, allowing them to run at a higher margin but for less time while generating similar returns. The cash flow would then be used to repay debt and investors. The program, currently in its pilot phase, seeks to retire or repurpose 5-7 coal-fired power plants in Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines and replace them with renewable energy capacity. In November 2022, ADB signed a landmark memorandum of understanding with its Indonesian partners to jointly explore the early retirement of the first coal-fired power plant owned by an independent power producer (IPP), the 600MW Cirebon-1 plant in West Java. ADB is also working with Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), Indonesia\u2019s national public power utility, to identify candidate plants for early retirement. The ETM\u2019s other recent milestones include establishing the ETM Partnership Trust Fund under ADB\u2019s Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and developing the investment plan for Indonesia for the Climate Investment Fund-Accelerated Coal Transition (CIF- ACT), an investment program seeking to advance a just transition from coal power to clean energy in emerging economies.

The second chapter outlined specific opportunities and innovative approaches to mitigate these impacts and realize energy, food, and finance systems that are more sustainable, inclusive, 3.1 Strengthen regional and national partnerships across the energy-food-finance nexus Responding to challenges that are cross- border and cross-sector in nature requires multinational and multisectoral solutions. Most existing multilateral solutions are in the form of sector-specific strategies, are undertaken by sector-specific actors, and target outcomes in a single sector. This report has demonstrated, however, that the socio- economic and political shocks wrought by the polycrisis have impacted energy, food, and finance systems in a deeply interconnected and resilient. This closing chapter brings together the report\u2019s findings and proposes practical actions for countries and different stakeholders in the region to take, in the short and medium term, in three cross-cutting areas (figure 22). These areas have the potential to enable and reinvigorate progress towards the energy and food goals, in the face of the current crises and shocks. Figure 22: Overview of actions across three cross-cutting areas \u2022 Financing adaptive social protection systems to improve the ability of vulnerable households to adapt to energy- and food-related shocks \u2022 Encouraging financiers to use the SDGs as a sustainability framework for investment-ready projects in the energy and food sectors \u2022 Positioning financial market regulators to manage risks from climate change and smooth the low-carbon transition Target finance towards the Goals \u2022 Incentivizing data-driven solutions across the energy-food-finance nexus \u2022 Applying agile governance and participatory scenario planning to inform policy planning Build data-driven, agile institutions \u2022 Strengthening regional and subregional partnerships for crisis response \u2022 Engaging national stakeholders across the energy-food-finance nexus to align policy and planning Strengthen regional and national partnerships across the energy-food-finance nexus Food Energy Finance manner. This situation necessitates re-thinking current approaches and exploring ways to unlock cross-sectoral synergies to build greater resilience against future shocks.

Opportunities exist for regional-level partnerships to work in tandem with global initiatives in developing crisis response strategies, while adding value by localizing solutions to suit the unique challenges faced in the region. For instance, governments and international organisations in the region can capitalise on the work of the Global Crisis Response Group and establish a similar Asia-Pacific body to shape regional planning for crisis management, including strategies to deal with future shocks. Given the increasing inter-connected nature of economies, energy and food supply chains, and financial systems across countries, it is important for regional trade bodies to factor in such interconnectedness when updating their strategies. These organisations can play a role in the short-term to facilitate sharing of information on new trade restrictions on food and energy commodities, to improve countries\u2019 understanding of the impacts of such policies on their counterparts and the need to take a longer-term perspective, as the WTO suggests.114 Engaging national stakeholders across the energy-food-finance nexus to align policy and planning. The polycrisis makes clear that responses and policies related to energy, food, and finance systems cannot be developed and implemented in silos. National strategies that exploit the synergies between these sectors, while acknowledging potential conflicts and policy impacts, have a critical role to play. The success of these strategies will hinge upon the ability to make use of and strengthen cross- agency partnerships within countries, to foster more coherent and cohesive actions that consider common challenges and synergies among the three sectors. Relationships between governments and international partners (both bilateral and multilateral) working on relevant sectors need to be continuously nurtured. Intergovernmental relations must be deepened to enable subnational governments to play a bigger role in responding to the polycrisis. The institutional frameworks for policymaking need to reflect the increasing complexity and multifaceted nature of our future world. This may require building the systems and enhancing institutional capacity to enable integrated modelling and generate analytics around the dynamic interplay among the three sectors. Public sector officials working in these sectors can benefit from cross-agency exchanges and, more importantly, innovation needs to be incentivised within government itself to bring about creative policy solutions. Improving participatory policymaking surrounding the nexus\u2014through stronger national and sub-national level partnerships with energy, food, and finance-experts in academia, think tanks, business associations, civil society organisations, and community organisations\u2014will be crucial to support progress towards the SDGs. 3.2 Build data-driven, agile institutions The polycrisis highlights the importance of governance for resilience. The capacity of institutions to address unforeseen and evolving challenges determines a country\u2019s recovery and subsequent development trajectory. Amid increasing uncertainties, adopting models of \u201canticipatory governance\u201d that entail analysing different future scenarios using strategic foresight methods will enable more effective planning.115 This approach is predicated on the availability and use of accurate and timely data. Data-driven and adaptive institutions can enable subnational administrations and countries in Asia and the Pacific to better respond to crises and build systemic resilience over the medium to long term. This process requires 57 Chapter 3: Reclaiming the decade of action on the SDGs a longer-term perspective and, as is the case with regional and national partnerships, also needs regular review and adjustment. Priority areas for action Incentivizing data-driven solutions across the energy-food-finance nexus. The emergence of \u201cbig data\u201d, \u201copen-source data\u201d, and digital technologies presents an unprecedented opportunity to improve the effectiveness of public policy and private solutions related to energy, food, finance, and economic crises. However, most countries in the region are yet to take full advantage of these technological developments. Developing national data plans\u2014through public-private collaboration\u2014 that identify key data needs is a first step towards improving policy responses to crises involving the three sectors and improve planning for green and inclusive transformations. To deal with the challenges presented by the polycrisis, disaggregated and time-sensitive data on changes in energy and food consumption patterns, nutritional intake, and renewable energy prices are of particular importance. Understanding how consumers at the local level behave during shocks is also crucial. Such data will provide the basis for assessments of the impact of the polycrisis on the region\u2019s energy and food systems and for the design of more effective policy, technological, and financing solutions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3eceda61-03b9-46c5-b8ea-985d4db703da": {"__data__": {"id_": "3eceda61-03b9-46c5-b8ea-985d4db703da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus: 2023 Asia-Pacific SDG Partnership Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b246f033cde71b7db08ca2200465cc05a2eeec4bf2a3e0e46b719830e23117a"}, "2": {"node_id": "74c0b796-1c9b-488d-9db7-7362be0063f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca705d2a3dc7f2c03db7e3983f6a2a9b6868d222a7051f4acbcf7b60dca0dee4"}}, "hash": "849bfd6530006580e693b8ed1d6e530159248025ac42b4a507c88fc2036871da", "text": "Other relevant data in the context of energy and food security include weather forecasts, geospatial maps of agricultural areas and technical performance of energy utilities.

Much responsibility for data collection currently falls on national statistical bureaus. However, the role of private entities\u2014especially in designing innovative data collection and analysis systems based on digital technologies, artificial intelligence, and mobile phones\u2014is also critical. To scale up private sector data gathering and analytical systems, governments may need to review their policy and regulatory frameworks to incentivise private companies\u2019 involvement in data collection efforts and, more importantly, to encourage individuals to participate in the process. Applying agile governance and participatory scenario practices to inform policy planning. Agile governance, at its core, refers to the ability of institutions to adapt to changing circumstances through responsive and iterative policymaking. It implies multi-stakeholder collaboration, especially with businesses, and the deployment of digital technologies.116 This \u201cAgile\u2019\u2019, or \u201cAnticipatory, Agile, and Adaptive (\u201cTriple A\u201d) Governance\u201d approach, which is designed to be more people- and outcome- focused, inclusive, flexible, and innovative, offers a model of future governance.117 The advantage of this approach is that it can be tailored to address the challenges posed by current and future contexts to enable precision and speed in responding to crises and the redirection of strategies as circumstances evolve. Some governments in the Asia-Pacific region, including in Singapore and Japan, are in the process of implementing agile governance that can potentially serve as a model for other countries. Regional institutions also should heed the Agile model as they support Asia- Pacific countries in this journey, for example to embrace a culture of experimentation, innovation, and learning, along the lines of UNDP\u2019s Accelerator Labs.118 In an uncertain environment, institutions must continually assess risk and plan for multiple scenarios. Such planning needs to integrate external factors such as climatic events, political shocks and different circumstances in the global, regional, national and subnational food, energy, and finance systems, as well as risks from the interactions of these areas. The result is identification of different scenarios according to importance, and their respective implications. This impact analysis helps policymakers and other stakeholders to assess the impacts of different scenarios on indicators in energy, food, and finance systems, their interconnections, as well as relevant SDG targets. The scenario analysis can be used to design actions that should 58 Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus be taken if and when different scenarios emerge. Importantly, countries should use a multi-stakeholder, collaborative process to do this; participatory planning can be the central driver to operationalise this new approach and design a network of robust and agile public and private sector institutions in the region. The implications for institutions are wide- ranging and will involve change management processes to implement improved structures, systems, and work culture, all of which will enable institutions to operate more effectively when confronting global shocks. Introducing such operational changes may include making processes more flexible, recruiting and training staff with different or new skillsets, fostering a culture that encourages experimentation and learning, and harnessing digital systems to facilitate data-driven policymaking, open communications, and access to real-time information during crises. 3.3 Target finance towards the SDGs Mobilising new sources of international and domestic financing to transform the energy and food systems to deliver on the 2030 Agenda and aligning public and private financial flows with the SDGs are critical areas for action. Asia-Pacific governments can, as a first step, carry out rigorous analysis of the impact of the polycrisis on SDG progress in their country, producing different trajectories for SDG attainment. While estimations for SDG financing needs are readily available, these must be updated taking into consideration the reversal in SDG progress brought about by the polycrisis, particularly for energy- and food-related SDGs. Regional institutions have a role to play in supporting this important work. This will then provide a knowledge base for developing practical strategies for mobilising new, targeted finance towards the attainment of the SDGs over the next seven years.

Comprehensive beneficiary registration systems, combined with innovative financing models, digital technologies, and measures to address the digital divide, will maximize efficient and effective delivery of social protection programmes to the most remote communities and people excluded from traditional financial markets. Enhancing institutional capacities of subnational administrations is a key enabling factor for these efforts. In the context of a just energy transition, it will be essential for coal-mining countries to ensure their social protection systems incorporate adjustment mechanisms for workers affected by mine closures and facilitate retraining so these workers can benefit from employment opportunities in the green economy. Encouraging financiers to use the SDGs as a sustainability framework for investment- ready projects in the energy and food sectors. Well-prepared investment projects in areas like electricity generation, electricity transmission and distribution, and food processing are more likely to attract investors; the lack of such projects is a major impediment to channelling greater domestic and international investments. Countries need to identify priority energy and food projects by undertaking market sounding, economic, financial, social, and environmental feasibility assessments, and appropriate risk allocation. Efficient and 59 Chapter 3: Reclaiming the decade of action on the SDGs transparent procurement processes in parallel ensure projects are converted to tangible infrastructure. Aligning these investments to the SDGs has significant potential benefits for energy and food system transformations and accelerating progress on the goals. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using the SDGs as a framework to measure and manage impact, both in the public and private sectors, and at both national and local levels. This entails integrating the SDG targets and indicators into existing sustainability metrics for various financial instruments and investment vehicles to measure social and environmental impact. Enabling this trend, through public-private collaborations, the development of SDG impact frameworks and development of bankable projects for such SDG-aligned financing, is important to orient greater amounts of financing that is aligned with the SDGs. Development agencies and private investors can collaborate to define common frameworks to improve alignment of private sector incentives and practices with the SDGs. These frameworks need to be designed to be consistent with standard corporate reporting frameworks and apply to a wide range of financing institutions and financial models. Within donor agencies, using project design and assessment templates to address synergies between agriculture and food- related and energy goals is useful, alongside broader aspects, such as environmental impact and gender. Positioning financial market regulators to manage risks from climate change and smooth the low-carbon transition. Successfully mobilising finance for the energy- and food-related SDGs and the low- carbon transition, while managing risk, will require changes to how central banks and financial market regulators operate. These institutions have an important role to play in managing climate-related financial risks, such as climate-induced damage to assets or loss of value in sectors during the transition, and facilitating a low-carbon transition.121 The challenges facing financial regulators in emerging markets in Asia and the Pacific are particularly acute because their financial markets are underdeveloped, information is limited, agriculture (which is particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change) and coal (which is negatively affected by the transition) dominate many economies, and millions of people are food insecure.122 Central banks and other financial market regulators in the region should review their approaches and consider adjusting them to better manage risk in the face of climate change and the transition. Managing these emerging risks will require such institutions to expand their information bases, more effectively incorporate climate change and transition risks in their modelling and amend regulations. The latter may include enhancing information disclosure requirements or imposing higher capital and liquidity requirements on financial institutions that are particularly exposed to such risks.123 The design of new approaches must be founded on an in-depth understanding of the domestic economy and the likely impacts of climate change and the transition.124 Greater availability of information can also help market players make better decisions in the face of climate change and transition. The Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System, of which many central banks in the region are members,125 may support countries in these efforts. 60 Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus The convergence of multiple crises has created turmoil", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eceacfb9-49a9-4d34-ae4e-21c005862d88": {"__data__": {"id_": "eceacfb9-49a9-4d34-ae4e-21c005862d88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals through Solutions at the Energy, Food and Finance Nexus: 2023 Asia-Pacific SDG Partnership Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03aa2004e993a93a19ae691626241e4493c935cf7c20e20f7bb20c4494e09e25"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2bcae7e-ad78-4d27-82f1-dfa0abba88f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals-through-solutions-energy-food-and-finance-nexus-2023-asia-pacific-sdg-partnership", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e863c3fba2f22ea424819634db5d2145807a3eab7d69e07d6a5f810631412d3"}}, "hash": "4faf34bcfdf4f837d611ac9f6f08b6c52b70c2ff5514e343a7d8f97e8d1a10fc", "text": "in the Asia-Pacific region\u2019s economy.

Transforming the food and energy sectors in a green and inclusive way can turn challenges of the polycrisis into opportunities for a more resilient, sustainable future and achievement of the SDGs. All levels of governments are pivotal in achieving these ambitions. The Conclusion key pathway to such transformations is not only to accelerate efforts in these areas, but also to explore synergic opportunities across the energy-food-finance nexus, with more innovation (by embracing new technologies, business models, policy frameworks, social and financial innovations) and more inclusive approaches (by enabling greater accessibility to marginalized and vulnerable groups). Major cross-cutting opportunities to make progress in these areas are strengthening multi-stakeholder partnerships across the food-energy-finance nexus to facilitate the development of integrated strategies; building agile, dynamic institutions and processes that will render the region and its energy, food, and finance sectors better placed to manage future shocks; and mobilizing and aligning finance towards the SDGs. 61 Conclusion Introduction 1\ufffd

GRADUATION FROM LDC STATUS: TRADE PREFERENCE AND DEVELOPMENT FINANCING IMPLICATIONS FOR ASIA-PACIFIC COUNTRIES UNDP Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific POLICY BRIEF JULY 2022 POLICY PAPER SEPTEMBER 2022 Brief description of the publication Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in the Asia-Pacific region have generally demonstrated socioeconomic progress over the past decades, despite being among the most vulnerable and structurally disadvantaged countries. Among the seven LDCs scheduled to graduate by 2026, five (Bhutan in 2023, the Solomon Islands in 2024, and Bangladesh, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Nepal in 2026) are from the Asia-Pacific region (UNCDP, 2021). Although graduation is a development milestone, the transition gives rise to concerns that these countries may lose access to various international support measures (ISMs) associated with LDC status. The paper finds that because AP LDCs rely more on tariff preferences for their competitive strength and have less financial support and compliance capacity, graduation and the associated loss of LDC-specific preferential tariffs and financing could pose challenges for their firms\u2019 ability to invest in ESG-related issues. Although bilateral and multilateral donors more often do not consider LDC status a precondition for development assistance, post-graduation, AP LDCs may face challenges accessing some LDC-specific funds unless the terms of engagement are adjusted as the number of graduates grows and the LDC club shrinks. Overall, graduation may not impose major constraints on trade and financial flows for most AP LDCs. Apart from Bangladesh, the impact of graduation is likely to be limited. The paper suggest that there are ways to extend ISMs to graduating AP LDCs for graduation-related adjustments. These should include, among others, continuing any market access preferences; improved terms for preferential schemes for non-LDC and/or graduated developing countries; more concessional financing backed by an improved absorption capacity; and external support and internal actions to confront development challenges that persist beyond graduation.

Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page v Asia-Pacific least developed countries (AP LDCs) have generally demonstrated socioeconomic progress over the past decades, despite being among the most vulnerable and structurally disadvantaged countries. The resilience demonstrated by these countries is remarkable, particularly those now approaching LDC graduation. Among the seven LDCs scheduled to graduate by 2026, five (Bhutan in 2023, the Solomon Islands in 2024, and Bangladesh, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Nepal in 2026) are from the Asia-Pacific region (UNCDP, 2021). Although graduation is a development milestone, the transition gives rise to concerns that these countries may lose access to various international support measures (ISMs) associated with LDC status. Once graduated, they could lose access to LDC-specific trade preferences, including unilateral duty-free market access and less stringent rules of origin requirements in major importing countries. In some cases, LDC graduation can also affect concessional development financing provisions. However, the implications of discontinuing these and other ISMs are hugely dependent on individual country contexts and likely consequences cannot be generalized. IMPLICATIONS FOR ASIA-PACIFIC LDC TRADE PREFERENCE While the loss of LDC-specific tariff preferences is of concern, the actual impact on each graduating AP LDC will be determined by various factors, including but not limited to the country\u2019s export structure, export market composition, varying trade preference arrangements (including those not conditioned on LDC status), and the extent existing preferences can be used. If graduating AP LDCs cannot use currently available preferences and/or export items are not covered by an LDC-specific treatment, graduation will have no implication.1 A World Trade Organization (WTO) and Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) study estimates that graduation could lead to, on average, a weighted-tariff increment of 4.2 percentage points for the ten countries studied. However, because tariff hikes translate into a loss of competitiveness, the study\u2019s ex-ante analysis using a partial equilibrium model suggests that graduating AP LDCs may experience as much as a 14.3 percent increase (WTO and EIF, 2020). Graduation could potentially interact with other issues: Limited participation in global value chains and various bilateral and multilateral trade agreements could exert further competitive pressure on graduating AP LDCs, causing trade and investment diversion. The environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues of workplace safety, working conditions, and environmental compliance are also increasingly prominent. Because AP LDCs rely more on tariff preferences for their competitive strength and have less financial support and compliance capacity, graduation and the associated loss of LDC- specific preferential tariffs and financing could pose challenges for their firms\u2019 ability to invest in ESG-related issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0e82643-1648-4e95-97f9-fda62cad02d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0e82643-1648-4e95-97f9-fda62cad02d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b45b65523554b28bf6526e12926c9e64c84894745c12df4280dcb7e603af169"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f36b57c-63d5-4baa-b455-ad35a7319d28", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "984c7ade39cb935d96de1850247b48d75280e6baeaff2487d6d664b4f377c641"}}, "hash": "b4c1589a8b2edd0f669afdb7bdf25834b9557521a588f0e83b3a7f0ba9771a0c", "text": "IMPLICATIONS FOR ASIA-PACIFIC LDC DEVELOPMENT FINANCE Over the past two decades, official finance from all external partners to the 11 Asia-Pacific LDCs increased from less than $3 billion in 2002 to $17.6 billion in 2019 (OECD, n.d.a). Official development assistance (ODA) constitutes 80-90 percent of all official flows in AP LDCs. Graduation is widely perceived to pose a risk to ODA inflows; however, top ODA beneficiaries include many non-LDCs. Key criteria for aid allocations include multiple factors, beyond LDC status, such as ongoing civil wars and unrest, natural catastrophes, epidemics, and refugee crises.

Furthermore, AP LDC graduates may also be entitled to a variety of benefits under several other country-specific Generalised System of Preference (GSP) schemes, regional trading arrangements (RTAs), or free trade agreements (FTAs), including the United Kingdom\u2019s General Framework (GF); the United States\u2019 preferential treatment based on a list of GSP-eligible beneficiaries; Canada\u2019s Generalised Preferential Tariff (GPT); Japan\u2019s preferential market access for Southeast Asian Graduating LDCs under the ASEAN-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP); China\u2019s ASEAN-China FTA and RCEP; India\u2019s bilateral trade agreements with several AP LDC graduates; Austria\u2019s tariff preferences under a RCEP; GSP facilities for Forum Island Countries; preferential access under the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations Plus (PACER Plus); and the Republic of Korea\u2019s bilateral or multilateral engagements with graduating AP LDCs. Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page vi dedicate a portion of their resources to LDCs; this is rarely solely due to the LDC category itself, but rather in consideration of other criteria that coincide with or correlate to LDC criteria. The World Bank does not take LDC status into account for loans or grants; instead, all countries with per capita income below a certain threshold are eligible for concessionary financing from its International Development Association (IDA). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) considers per capita income and other criteria when determining the terms of its assistance to countries. LDC status may have some influence on the type of assistance provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and graduation may have a role in a country\u2019s reclassification to a different group, depending on the country's creditworthiness. Post-graduation, AP LDCs may face challenges accessing some LDC-specific funds unless the terms of engagement are adjusted as the number of graduates grows and the LDC club shrinks. At present, the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), which supports programs under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is available only to LDCs. Access to financial flows from the LDC Technology Bank and the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) will continue for five years after graduation. The UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) can continue to fund programmes for three years after graduation under pre-graduation terms, and, if development progresses as expected, financing for the following two years can be granted on a 50/50 cost-sharing basis with the government or a third party. WAY FORWARD FOR ASIA-PACIFIC LDCS Overall, graduation may not impose major constraints on trade and financial flows for most AP LDCs. Apart from Bangladesh, the impact of graduation is likely to be limited. Furthermore, there are ways to extend ISMs to graduating AP LDCs for graduation-related adjustments. These should include, among others, continuing any market access preferences; improved terms for preferential schemes for non-LDC and/or graduated developing countries; more concessional financing backed by an improved absorption capacity; and external support and internal actions to confront development challenges that persist beyond graduation. Most graduating AP LDCs have several more years to exploit existing trade preferences before they graduate. This is a critical transition period when countries can develop their trade and industrial competencies on the supply-side. Graduating AP LDCs could therefore prepare to do the following: l Explore post-graduation preferential trade regimes with partners to retain LDC-type benefits as much as possible, for example, by requesting that preference- granting countries, such as Australia, Canada, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, offer an extended transition period for graduating LDCs similar to that granted by the European Union, and by urging the European Union to extend Everything But Arms (EBA)- type liberal rules of origin (RoO) terms for a longer transition period. l Plan to comply with the pre-specified 32 international conventions required to access the European Union\u2019s most generous preferential trade regime, GSP+, after the expiry of LDC-specific EBA provisions. l Develop strategies to build trade policy design and negotiation capacity. Destination market governments and private sector enterprises can assist graduating AP LDCs in establishing trade and commercial linkages between traders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "628f166e-b75b-4304-b9d8-7a6c0fd8d979": {"__data__": {"id_": "628f166e-b75b-4304-b9d8-7a6c0fd8d979", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0eacb931eee2b23dadee251928d51789e1f112550d8faa7fec72164cba6a6692"}, "2": {"node_id": "4656391e-7e85-4caf-9747-cdb3df90c3df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b7b8a3378f958a2996a3808c83cb1b17daad49e0a0b31539989492b8028076e"}}, "hash": "00957ed0373c52b4cd93c32cd5662842b4ddefb6db1c83250b8a3fe77ca2f462", "text": "l Explore the options for bilateral and regional free trade agreements to secure and/or maintain duty-free market access for export items. l Make a collective effort with other LDCs to retain the WTO\u2019s LDC Services Waiver preferences for a post- graduation transition period of ten years or more. l Improve administrative and project management efficiency to speed up development fund release processes and increase the effectiveness of funds utilization. l Seek more extensive use of LDC-related development financing mechanisms that aid firm-level preparedness and overall economic competitiveness. l Prioritize debt management, including through debt swaps, to provide fiscal space for a smooth", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c85bb4bb-da1e-4da7-bdc9-d8fd5f9f7569": {"__data__": {"id_": "c85bb4bb-da1e-4da7-bdc9-d8fd5f9f7569", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a55eee4f972f43f2cf95d869fea4ad99ff37c06971f2346b36c40512918d6bf"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb3a5f5b-c74d-4be8-bdc7-381bab0d14c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e42f17585527290f205cb4f5183223d0602d62b758521354624b3a0882a73a92"}}, "hash": "5b84d2c84d1c7f6592433144b3340ea6a3d0c495d705aa649ae1f1e32078973c", "text": "graduation. l Attract foreign direct investment (FDI) to stimulate investment and ensure export success, which can benefit local businesses and facilitate enhanced participation in global value chains (GVCs) while addressing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. l Improve capacities to mobilize domestic resources, which should play a bigger role in financing development. l Continue developing productive capacity, which is crucial for structural transformation. Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 1 Despite structural disadvantages and multifaceted challenges, the 11 Asia-Pacific least developed countries (AP LDCs)2 generally made solid socioeconomic progress in the 2010s, coincidentally with the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action (IPoA), the international community\u2019s 2011-2020 strategy for sustainably developing LDCs\u2019 productive capacities (Razzaque et al., 2021). Eight AP LDCs \u2013 namely four landlocked countries (Afghanistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic [PDR]) and four water-locked small island states (Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu) \u2013 have geographical characteristics that particularly hinder economic development, as reflected in high trading costs. Another major development disadvantage shared by many AP LDCs is their susceptibility to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tropical cyclones, and the consequences of climate change. Some AP LDCs have also been impacted by military conflicts and political instability. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted significant economic and social costs on all AP LDCs and exposed their vulnerability to external shocks due to their limited fiscal space and technological and human resource constraints. Nevertheless, the resilience demonstrated by most of these countries has been quite remarkable, as reflected in their peers\u2019 and their own record of qualifying for LDC graduation.3 During the IPoA period (2011-2020), the Asia-Pacific region saw three least-developed members graduate: Maldives in 2011, Samoa in 2014, and Vanuatu in 2020.4 Globally, of the seven LDCs scheduled to graduate by 2026, five are from the Asia-Pacific region: Bhutan in 2023, the Solomon Islands in 2024, and Bangladesh, Lao PDR, and Nepal in 2026. The 2021 triennial review by the United Nations Committee for Development Policy (UNCDP) shows 16 LDCs worldwide at various stages of LDC graduation (UNCDP, 2021). Ten are from the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 all AP LDCs except for Afghanistan. The impressive progress towards graduation however comes with certain concerns, including the potential loss of access to various international support measures (ISMs) that the global community has provided for several decades. Under the ISMs, LDCs enjoy certain privileges and receive differential treatments through development partners\u2019 special attention and commitments to support them via trade preferences, development finance, and technical assistance. AP LDCs particularly benefit from trade preferences granted by World Trade Organization (WTO) members and concessional development finance offered by various bilateral and multilateral partners. These two areas are regarded as the most significant and readily accessed ISMs for LDCs. Therefore, graduation could result in (i) preference erosion in international trade, potentially affecting export competitiveness, and (ii) unfavourable impacts on a country\u2019s prospects for concessional development financing. In other words, when a country depends on certain trade preferences and can make use of the concessional finance available, losing such privileges could hamper economic development prospects. Conversely, when preferences and privileges remain unutilized due to various factors, such as supply- side constraints, LDC graduation would only imply forgone future opportunities without causing any actual consequences. This policy paper aims to assess the implications of graduation for AP LDCs in two broad areas: trade preference and development finance. It draws on secondary data and information, reports published by United Nations organizations and other institutes, and country-specific government documents to gauge the I.

This assessment will inform United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) advocacy and engagement in relation to the 5th United Nations Conference on LDCs (LDC5) in March 2023 in Doha, Qatar. It will also inform each AP LDC about the likely implications of its graduation. Understanding regional and individual country contexts is extremely important in assessing how each country can make LDC graduation sustainable. Studying a group of countries with similar LDC-related ISMs should generate important insights to formulate practical policy actions to support countries transition from the LDC group, with momentum for setting and achieving further development milestones. The next section provides an overview of economic progress made in the AP LDCs, highlighting various stages of their graduation to developed-country status. Section three assesses the extent of trade preference utilization, the best options for preferential access alternatives after graduation, and the potential impacts of preference erosion on exports. Section four analyses the implications of graduation for concessionary development finance. Finally, section five provides policy options and recommendations for AP LDCs to deal with the challenges of graduation and to continue striving toward development goal achievements. Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 3 2.1 ASIA-PACIFIC LDC ECONOMIES FROM 2010 TO 2020 Over the previous decade, the economic growth of Asia- Pacific LDCs has varied widely. During 2011-2019, the estimated weighted-average GDP growth of the group was 6.45 percent, while the simple average GDP growth was 5.2 percent. Of the 11 AP LDCs, three \u2013 Bangladesh, Cambodia and Lao PDR \u2013 saw high growth of around 7 percent during the decade, while Afghanistan and two small island states, Kiribati and the Solomon Islands, achieved only modest growth rates of less than 4 percent (Table 2.1). Overall, the period\u2019s 4 percent average growth rate in the four Asia-Pacific small island states was lower than the global LDC average of 4.5 percent. Limited productive capacity, lack of economic diversification, inherent vulnerability, and the high cost of trade, among other factors, perennially contribute to the subdued economic performance of small island states. In 2020, the last year of the Istanbul Programme of Action (IPoA), the global COVD-19 pandemic dealt a severe blow to the economic performance of most AP LDCs. Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Tuvalu recorded low yet still-positive growth rates, while Bhutan and the Solomon Islands recorded negative 10 percent and minus 4.3 percent growth, respectively. During the initial waves of 2. OVERVIEW OF ASIA-PACIFIC LDCS the pandemic and while the world economy contracted by 3.3 percent, several Asia-Pacific LDCs remained resilient. In fact, Timor-Leste experienced a staggering 10.4 percent growth rate in 2020, while Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Tuvalu grew 3.5 percent, 3.2 percent, and 4.4 percent, respectively. On the other hand, Bhutan\u2019s economy sharply contracted by 10.8 percent, while the Solomon Islands, Cambodia, Afghanistan, and Nepal suffered lesser economic contractions (Table 2.1).

Net inflows of ODA to Afghanistan, Kiribati, and Tuvalu amounted to 20.7 percent, 19 percent, and 45.5 percent of their respective gross national income (GNI) during 2017-2019 (Table 2.1).

Nevertheless, significant progress was made; 16 countries now stand at different stages of graduation. As determined by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), graduation requires that a country meet at least two of three pre-defined development threshold criteria in two consecutive ECOSOC Committee for Policy Development (UNCDP) triennial reviews. The three thresholds are determined by per capita gross national income (GNI), Human Asset Indicators (HAI), and an Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI). For example, in 2021, the thresholds were $1,222 per capita GNI, 66 HAI, and 32 EVI (Figure 2.1). Another provision, the \u2018income- only\u2019 graduation rule states that when the three-year average per capita GNI of an LDC has risen to at least double the graduation threshold, the country could be eligible for graduation regardless of its situation under the other two criteria.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3b02372-9282-4294-9694-8fadea086511": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3b02372-9282-4294-9694-8fadea086511", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05c2ec6157ea3bdcffe4023194dee9bff55b2077b372fed7350db39e6f50b776"}, "2": {"node_id": "74b6a46b-b99f-4eb8-bf57-f8ec8a910b6d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fc4c2284cc4fbeac134fde32615bc8ce68251f00e72313a7c867d9110012fc7"}}, "hash": "eecf5ef7012f6a2b9e1f0220f4dc9399562388bae99727a495698c848ba7a4dc", "text": "According to the latest triennial review (UNCDP, 2021a), Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar met all three criteria for graduation; only Nepal did not yet meet the GNI per capita threshold (Figure 2.1).

If it satisfies the criteria again in the 2024 review, it will be able to schedule a graduation date. Myanmar, Kiribati, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu have met graduation thresholds in at least two consecutive triennial reviews, but have deferred their graduations for various reasons. Although Myanmar met all criteria for the second consecutive time in the 2021 triennial review, its graduation decision was postponed until the 2024 triennial review because of political instability. Kiribati has met graduation criteria since 2012, but its graduation decision has been deferred to 2024 because of the country\u2019s severe vulnerability to climate change and other environmental shocks (UNCDP, 2021; ECOSOC, 2021). Timor-Leste\u2019s graduation decision recommendation was rescheduled over concerns about the sustainability of graduation since the country is vulnerable to economic shocks and climate change. Similarly, Tuvalu was recommended for graduation in 2021, but due to its extreme environmental vulnerability, its decision has also been deferred to the 2024 triennial review (ECOSOC, 2021).

A trade policy reversal by the United States, trade wars between the United States and China, a prolonged period of uncertainty after the United Kingdom left the European Union, and other events resulted in a dismal state of trade.

In contrast, during the IPoA period of 2010-2020, merchandise exports increased $3 trillion in 2011, to $18.5 trillion, and grew to just over $19 trillion by 2014 before severe trade shocks caused global exports to decline to $16 trillion in 2016. By 2019, global merchandise exports had recovered to 2014 levels, only to fall to $17.6 trillion in 2020 because of COVID-19. The combined exports of all LDCs during the IPoA decade grew by just $28 billion, far less than $108 billion increase seen during 2000-2010 (World Bank, n.d.a). In the 2010s, the AP LDCs, however, fared comparatively better thanks to Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Myanmar: their combined exports more than doubled from $36.9 billion in 2010 to $81 billion in 2019, before the pandemic hit. During the past decade, the global LDC share of merchandise exports remained almost stagnant, at around 1 percent (Figure 2.2 A), below the IPoA target of 2 percent. During the same period, the 11 Asia-Pacific LDCs nearly doubled their merchandise exports, from 0.24 percent to 0.43 percent (Figure 2.2). Among the AP LDCs, Bangladesh alone captured around 0.20 percent of global merchandise exports in 2020, followed by Cambodia (0.098 percent), Myanmar (0.095 percent), and Lao PDR (0.035 percent) (Figure 2.2 A), while the export shares of other AP LDCs remain negligible (Figure 2.2 B). At the individual level, AP LDCs\u2019 export performances vary wildly. Bangladesh is the largest exporter of all global LDCs, shipping around 20 percent of all LDC exports over the past five years. Its export volume rose to $39.3 billion in 2019, before COVID-19 caused volume to fall to $33.6 billion in 2020 (Table 2.3). During 2010-2019, Bangladesh\u2019s merchandise exports grew 8.6 percent per year on average, while Myanmar\u2019s grew 8.9 percent, Afghanistan\u2019s grew 9.7 percent, and Cambodia and Lao PDR saw very sharp export expansion at 13.2 percent and 14.8 percent, respectively (Figure 2.3). Merchandise exports from the four AP LDC small island states, Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu, suffered instability, although their annual average growth can appear high (Figure 2.3).

Agricultural products account for around 80 percent of exports from Afghanistan, Kiribati, and Tuvalu. Bhutan, Lao PDR, and Timor-Leste rely on extractive sector products, such as precious stones, minerals, and metals, which account for 50 percent to 80 percent of their exports. Myanmar, Nepal, and the Solomon Islands rely moderately on primary exports, which comprise a 50 percent or less share. Bangladesh Cambodia, Myanmar and Nepal, have a moderate to heavy reliance on manufactured products for export. The Solomon Islands primarily exports wood and wood products; Myanmar exports a range of manufactured products; and Nepal, Bangladesh, and Cambodia export a large share of textiles and clothing products.

In 2019, clothing items accounted for up to 19 of its top 20 export products at the Harmonized System (HS) 6-digit level.5 Its top 20 exports at the 6-digit level accounted for more than two-thirds of Bangladesh\u2019s total merchandise exports. Apparel items in the most important HS codes include T-shirts, singlets, and other vests made of knitted or crocheted cotton (HS 610910), the largest export code at around 13 percent of the total, followed by men\u2019s or boys\u2019 trousers (HS 620342), women\u2019s or girls\u2019 trousers (HS 620462), and jerseys, pullovers, cardigans, waistcoats and similar articles, of cotton, knitted (HS 611020) (Figure 2.5). Bangladesh ships nearly half of all exports to the European Union, 17 percent to the United States, around 10 percent to the United Kingdom, 3 percent each to Canada, India, and Japan, and 2 percent to China (Figure 2.6). When global exports contracted by around 7 percent during the first waves of the 2020 pandemic, Cambodia instead recorded a robust 20 percent growth in export volumes, which exceeded $17 billion (Table 2.3) (UNCTAD, n.d.a). This was largely attributed to exports of gold, including gold plated with platinum (HS 710812). Clothing accounted for more than half of all Cambodian exports, followed by precious stones (7.9 percent), leather and leather goods (7.7 percent), and agricultural products (5 percent) (Figure 2.4). Cambodia\u2019s export mix is the most diversified of the Asia-Pacific LDCs. Its top 20 codes at the HS 6-digit level comprise 45 percent of total exports, and include apparel items, such as tee-shirts, singlets and other vests of cotton, knitted (HS 610910), jerseys, pullovers, cardigans, waistcoats and similar articles (HS 611020), and women\u2019s or girls\u2019 trousers (HS 610469), followed by semi- or wholly- milled rice (HS 100630), and bicycles and other cycles (HS 871200) (Figure 2.5). The United States is the largest destination of Cambodia\u2019s exports, receiving around 30 percent of merchandise, followed by 18 percent to the European Union, 14 percent to Singapore, 6 percent each to China and Japan, and about 5 percent to the United Kingdom (Figure 2.6). Bhutan\u2019s merchandise exports (including electricity) reached $650 million in 2020 (Table 2.3). Electricity constituted one-third of all Bhutanese exports during the past decade. The country\u2019s other most important exports include metals (HS 72), including iron and steel (62 percent), followed by minerals (21 percent), inorganic chemicals (6 percent), and agricultural items, such as tea, coffee, and mat\u00e9 (5 percent) (Figure 2.4). Bhutan\u2019s high export concentration is evident from its products\u2019 composition. At the HS 6-digit level, the top ten 6-digit-level codes account for 88 percent of total exports. Ferrosilicon (HS 720221) is the largest export item, accounting for nearly half of Bhutan\u2019s non- electricity exports (Figure 2.5). India is Bhutan\u2019s largest export destination, receiving more than 90 percent of Bhutanese merchandise exports (Figure 2.6). In 2020, Nepal\u2019s exports stood at $855 million, having declined from $960 million the previous year (Table 2.3). Agricultural items (43.4 percent) compose its largest exports, followed by textiles (28 percent), clothing (7.6 percent), and metals (6.6 percent). Unlike other LDCs that export both textiles and clothing, Nepal concentrates on textiles, which make up almost 80 percent of its textile and apparel exports (Figure 2.4). At the disaggregated product level, items in the next most important HS codes include palm oil and its fractions (HS 151190), which comprise 20 percent of total exports, followed by carpets and other textile floor coverings (HS 570110), soya-bean oil and its fractions (HS 150790), and yarn containing predominantly synthetic staple fibres (HS 550951).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90e0b9d0-f1bd-4585-b44b-ff1b7d83ee48": {"__data__": {"id_": "90e0b9d0-f1bd-4585-b44b-ff1b7d83ee48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae885ac45768b7c7fff104ec71c66c5dd3d1651a1a8e683811bfd5f9f9c2d5e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "565c68fd-b0b5-4746-8414-6ace9cb1f8d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a08ce72c166069d88642c6c59401059d55e5273be2bb17d6d6a5ae07f188259b"}}, "hash": "697190f6f94c02a5ef005c962b8107aebd64ae7c52fd522e64f69a31c0b02c31", "text": "The top 20 HS 6-digit codes together comprise more than 65 percent of exports (Figure 2.5).

Vegetable saps, extracts, and pectic substances (HS 130212) compose the largest HS 6-digit code items, followed by dried grapes (HS 080620), and figs (HS 080420) (Figure 2.5). Like Nepal and Bhutan, India is the largest importer of Afghanistan\u2019s products, accounting for 47 percent of exports, followed by Pakistan at 33 percent (Figure 2.6). Myanmar recorded merchandise export receipts of $16.7 billion in 2020, a 6.5 percent decline from the previous year (Table 2.3). Textiles and clothing (about 31 percent of export earnings), agricultural goods (about 27 percent), and mineral products (22.6 percent) constitute the country\u2019s major export products (Figure 2.4). It recorded a staggering yearly average clothing export growth of 40 percent during the past decade, until the early 2021 military coup triggered political instability. Liquefied natural gas (HS 271111), natural gas in gaseous state (HS 271121), and copper (HS 740311) constitute major individual items at the HS 6-digit level (Figure 2.5).

Island LDCs are prone to excessive export volatility, which can be a major problem for macroeconomic management. Their small export bases mean changes in export volumes can be quite drastic (Figure 2.3). The combined export volume of the four Pacific Island AP LDCs was close to $650 million in 2020. Of this, Kiribati contributed only $9.3 million (Table 2.3). Its export trends show high volatility. It is dependent on agricultural items for more than 90 percent of its exports (Figure 2.4).

The other AP LDCs would likely rank even lower if they were included in the ECI. The AP LDCs\u2019 lack of productive capacity and minimal product diversification are also revealed through \u2018product space analysis\u2019 (Hidalgo, et. al., 2007), which depicts the locations of individual AP LDC\u2019s export items relative to all possible export products. 6 The ECI measures and ranks an economy's capacity as inferred from data that connects locations to activities present in them. The ECI is based on several macroeconomic outcomes, including countries\u2019 levels of income, economic growth, income inequality, and greenhouse gas emissions, and draws on trade, employment, stock market, and patent data, amongst others (OEC, n.d.b).

Many primary exports are located on the periphery. Figure 2.9 shows that AP LDCs produce only limited export items, which concentrate far from the centre. A close look at Figure 2.8 reveals that Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar have a noticeable presence in the textiles cluster of the product space. Afghanistan, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Nepal also have various product clusters, albeit somewhat far away from the centre of the space. In all other AP LDCs, individual export products and diversification opportunities appear limited.7 2.4 SERVICES EXPORTS The global LDC share of services exports nearly doubled between 2005 and 2019, increasing from 0.45 percent to 0.8 percent. During the same period, the share of AP LDC services exports nearly tripled, rising from 0.13 percent to 0.37 percent when their overall services export volumes registered a more than five-fold increase, rising from $3.6 billion to $22.9 billion (Table 2.4). Myanmar is the largest services exporter among the AP LDCs, exporting $6.7 billion worth in 2019, followed by Bangladesh ($6.2 billion), Cambodia ($6.1 billion), and Nepal ($1.6 billion). Myanmar expanded its services exports at an annual average rate of 30 percent during 2005-2019, which makes up 13.6 percent of all services exports from LDCs. Travel services comprise more than one-third of its services exports. During the same period, services exports from Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Nepal, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu saw more than 10 percent average annual growth. However, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the services exports hard. All AP LDCs, except Afghanistan and Bangladesh, experienced an absolute decline in services exports in 2020 due to border closures and lockdown measures. Overall services exports from AP LDCs slumped by 35 percent, exceeding the global average decline of 20 percent (UNCTAD, n.d.a). 7 The location of products on the periphery is usually associated with a lack of nearby products that require similar capabilities, which implies a limited scope of and inherent difficulties for export diversification. Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 15 3.1 STATE OF TRADE PREFERENCES FOR GOODS EXPORTS Almost all developed and some developing countries unilaterally offer preferential market access for LDC merchandise exports under the importer\u2019s Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) regime. LDCs enjoy duty- free market access and less stringent rules of origin (RoO) requirements for their export products. Prominent export markets with LDC-specific trade preference schemes include Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, India, the Republic of Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States, among others. These LDC trade preference schemes supersede the World Trade Organization (WTO) most-favoured-nation (MFN) principle, which gives equal access to all WTO members' markets and guarantees equal \u2013 not lower or higher \u2013 tariffs for all other member-countries (WTO, 2022). LDCs also benefit from tariff liberalization when they are signatories to bilateral or regional trade agreements. USE OF LDC-SPECIFIC TRADE PREFERENCES However, LDCs do not uniformly or automatically benefit from trade preferences that are exclusively extended to LDCs. Low use of preferences stems from weak supply- side capacity, limited product diversification, and high trading costs, among other important determinants. Some countries cannot utilize preferences because of their inability to meet minimum RoO requirements, which results from inadequate backward and forward linkages. Graduation to developing country status will therefore have no effect on a country\u2019s current exports if it did not use LDC-specific preferences prior to graduation.8 A LDC export product enters an importing market under one of the following conditions: (i) The product obtains an LDC-specific trade preference for duty-free market access to a preference-granting country. (ii) The product enjoys preferential treatment under a free trade agreement (FTA) or a preferential trade agreement (PTA), irrespective of the exporting country\u2019s LDC status.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25bcea58-b4fc-42de-a069-82e07a946654": {"__data__": {"id_": "25bcea58-b4fc-42de-a069-82e07a946654", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "357442c699bf3eb50c37421f1dc784d69a12f82cf522c5421be8e204c88a1a40"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a04b3cf-a522-4059-aa06-6d2a4ed68b75", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fefb2cac914df4eff80d38e8e813b7ff3380ab4fb8dcab9ed6e5eeeff949ec27"}}, "hash": "eb278dd6ee1bad831fc47c772d33d3a83b5492aa618599156cc932a5e5533214", "text": "(iii) The product is not eligible for trade preference because the LDC exporter fails to comply with RoO requirements and therefore must pay the MFN tariff rate.

About 70 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s export products use LDC-specific preferences. Another 20 percent attract positive MFN tariffs, mostly attributed to exports bound for the United States. The second largest LDC-specific preference-dependent country is Myanmar: one-quarter of its exports make use of LDC preferences. For Bhutan, Nepal and the Solomon Islands, such dependence is 10-20 percent; for Lao PDR 5-10 percent; and slightly less than 5 percent for Kiribati, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu. More than 85 percent of Kiribati and Timor-Leste exports enter importing countries under an MFN zero-duty rate, and thus have no scope for tariff preference. The corresponding figures for Lao PDR and Myanmar are in the range of 40-50 percent, and 20-30 percent for Nepal and Tuvalu. Bhutan and Nepal have bilateral trade agreements with India, their main trading partner.9 As much as 85 percent of Bhutan\u2019s and 58 percent of Nepal\u2019s merchandise exports go to India and receive trade preference (\u2018other preference\u2019) through the bilateral agreements without reference to their LDC status. The Solomon Islands does not have a preferential LDC scheme with China, its most important export market, and all their exports with China are subject to MFN tariffs. PREFERENCE UTILIZATION Some importing countries report the so-called \u2018preference utilization rate\u2019 for LDCs and other 3. LDC GRADUATION AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR TRADE PREFERENCE 8 However, graduation implies forgoing future export trade preferences. Graduation impact assessments usually analyse how a LDC\u2019s current exports would be affected by changes to trade preferences. 9 Bilateral agreements with India are not included in the WTO database. The author has approximated preference utilization rates for the Indian market. Graduation from LDC Status: Trade Preference and Development Financing Implications for Asia-Pacific Countries Page 16 developing countries. The preference utilization rate is defined as the percentage of GSP-eligible exports that actually realize trade preferences. For example, while nearly 100 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s exports to the European Union are GSP-eligible, only 97 percent of goods can make use of duty-free market access; the remaining 3 percent are subject to MFN tariffs because the goods do not fulfil RoO conditions. Therefore, Bangladesh\u2019s preference utilization rate in the European Union is 97 percent. In another example, Tuvalu exported \u20ac430 million worth of goods to the European Union in 2019. Of this, \u20ac290 million had zero MFN duty and the rest (\u20ac140 million) was GSP eligible. Within these GSP- eligible exports, Tuvalu had a preference utilization rate of 98 percent. The preference utilization rate calculation does not consider supply-side capacity; for this reason, it should be interpreted with caution. A high utilization rate may not be meaningful when the overall size of GSP- eligible exports is small. It is important to note that, given their export-product composition, individual countries\u2019 GSP-eligible exports will vary. For instance, in the European Union (including the United Kingdom),10 90-99 percent of exports from Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Myanmar are GSP-eligible for tariff preference (Table 3.1). This is because these three countries have concentrated exports in clothing and footwear items that attract European Union MFN tariffs. On the other hand, proportionately much higher shares of export products from Afghanistan, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu have zero MFN duty in the European Union market, and thus no scope for tariff preference. However, preference utilization rates are high for their remaining GSP-eligible exports (Table 3.1). Table 3.2 shows the preference utilization rates for major export products to the European Union at the HS 6-digit level. As noted above, apparel products constitute the top ten items exported from Bangladesh to the European Union, with a GSP utilization rate more than 97 percent.

Another 6 percent of this item has zero MFN duty. Nearly 30 percent of export earnings from bicycles (871200) cannot use preferences. Kiribati\u2019s European Union GSP-eligible exports and preference utilization rate greatly fluctuates. For example, it vacillated from a high of 88.6 percent to a low of 17.8 percent over the course of one year (Table 3.1). However, the European Union accounts for less than 1 percent of Kiribati\u2019s exports. Besides, the high proportion of duty-free exports implies that graduation will not impose major challenge to Kiribati in the European Union market. For Lao PDR, a significant share of exports to the European Union is duty free. For its GSP-eligible exports, around 90 percent can access duty-free under the Everything but Arms (EBA) scheme, which removes tariffs and quotas for all imports of goods (except arms and ammunition) coming into the European Union from LDCs. Among major Lao export items at the 6-digit level, more than 10 percent of preference for footwear with rubber (640391) and men\u2019s or boys\u2019 cotton shirts (620520) remains unutilized. About 5-8 percent of Myanmar\u2019s exports to the European Union have zero MFN duty, and the rest are eligible for LDC preference under the EBA. In 2020, the overall preference utilization rate for Myanmar in this market was 95.5 percent. Major export items at the 6-digit level, mostly clothing and broken and semi-milled rice, exhibited high utilization rates. In 2020, Nepal and the Solomon Islands had European Union GSP utilization rates of 91.6 percent and 99.8 percent, respectively (Table 3.1). Nepal mainly exports carpets and clothing to this market. The Solomon Islands exports preserved tuna and crude palm oil; its disaggregated export data by duty type also show high LDC preference utilization rates (Table 3.2). Timor-Leste and Tuvalu have low export volumes with high instability. Less than one-third of their exports to the European Union market are GSP-eligible (Table 3.1), with the rest having zero MFN duty. Among eligible exports, both countries have high preference utilization rates of more than 90 percent. Canada applies the MFN zero-duty rate to more than 70 percent of imports from Afghanistan, Kiribati, Lao PDR, and the Solomon Islands, which implies that LDC graduation will have a negligible implication on these countries\u2019 exports. Around two-thirds of exports from Afghanistan are shipped to Canada under the MFN zero- duty rate. On the other hand, Bangladesh and Cambodia export less than 10 percent of goods to Canada at the MFN zero-duty rate. Instead, they have preference utilization rates of around 90 percent, mostly due to their concentration in clothing and footwear exports. Overall, their major exports to Canada have preference utilization rates in the range of 70-99 percent (Table 3.3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff1c1502-0dd1-43d5-9257-e5aa85771e73": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff1c1502-0dd1-43d5-9257-e5aa85771e73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Graduation from LDC status: trade preference and development financing implications for Asia-Pacific countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51fbe595ac6e016731ac11f55c61ecdd991931bea82b5deb2cf9b0f5561c8ff5"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ffef786-d185-4c78-8e10-4a73056b0625", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/graduation-ldc-status-trade-preference-and-development-financing-implications-asia-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e965de25f4e0f39ce0f55e919ef7c3274415a8ca0f2c89bc9a1487a0c3608958"}}, "hash": "f8d9a0e2e0a25b4d303ebce846a772d037dedd152dd56dfe77a14cb876446688", "text": "More than 70 percent of GSP-eligible exports from Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Nepal to Canada enjoy LDC tariff preferences, but it is not a major market for those countries, accounting for less than one percent of total Table 3.1: Asia-Pacific LDC GSP utilization rates in the European Union market, 2017-2019 (%) GSP-eligible exports (% of total exports) GSP utilization rate (%) 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 Afghanistan 32.9 46.0 39.7 53.0 57.2 75.9 Bangladesh 98.0 98.0 99.7 97.0 96.8 97.2 Bhutan 99.3 97.1 97.8 98.7 98.0 95.7 Cambodia 98.9 98.7 97.2 95.8 95.6 94.6 Kiribati 70.3 59.7 98.5 66.4 88.6 17.8 Lao PDR 69.1 78.2 85.2 94.5 92.8 89.0 Myanmar 92.0 91.4 94.8 94.0 95.4 95.5 Nepal 88.2 87.1 89.9 91.3 90.6 91.6 Solomon Islands 99.4 99.1 99.8 \u2026 99.7 99.8 Timor-Leste 26.5 30.0 8.8 91.7 94.3 92.6 Tuvalu 28.0 28.4 33.0 98.4 98.1 97.9 Source: European Commission, 2020a.
