Cambodian Masculinity Norms Existing studies document traditional male gender roles in Cambodia. However, numerous studies noted the relative lack of research on masculinity and also called for further research. One researcher noted that most studies focused on problems or sexual behaviour such as domestic violence or rape, and noted a lack of research on men who do not engage in violent activities.1 Nonetheless, several studies cite norms for masculinity as defined in Chbab Proh (Rules for Men), proverbs and other cultural influences. These rules are disseminated less widely than the Chbap Srei (Rules for Women), which were written between the 14th and 19th century.2 The rules for men are more individualistic, compared to those for women (which focus on responding to men).3 It is worth noting that in Buddhism, Cambodia\u2019s predominant religion, it is suggested that women earned less merit in their previous life.4 These rules are not the only codes for men. Cambodia has a hierarchical society where sex is one factor among many, including age, wealth, urban-rural residence, position, education, family reputation and religious piety.5 Cambodian culture expects men to be strong individuals who are the heads of their families and primary breadwinners. There are conflicting cultural messages about their behaviour and recreation, however, and recognition that male ideals may not always be fulfilled. 1.1. Head of the Household Many studies confirm the male role as head of the household.6 Women are viewed as financial managers7 and most decisions are made jointly. But men make the final decisions, in particular in the \u201cuse or sale of valuable assets such as land, vehicles and cattle.\u201d8 Other family members are expected to defer to the head of the household and show respect and obedience. \u201cA Cambodian proverb says that a man should not be \u2018under the wife\u2019s apron,\u2019 and therefore under her control.\u201d This is \u201cone of the most extreme insults to a 1 Hilton, Alistair (2008) I Thought It Could Never Happen to Boys (Phnom Penh: HAGAR), p. 54. 2 Brickell, Katherine (in press) \u201c\u2018We Don\u2018t Forget the Old Rice Pot When We Get the New One\u2018: Gendered Discourses on Ideals and Practices of Women in Contemporary Cambodia\u201d Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, p. 2.

This gives them a \u201csource of personal pride and feelings of self worth.\u201d15 Almost half, (48%,) of the respondents in men\u2019s discussion groups organised by the Project Against Domestic Violence (PADV) said they would consider a man without a job to be lazy, and a man who depends on his wife. This label of being \u201clazy\u201d is particularly harsh in Khmer culture. Five of the respondents said that a man with no job is \u201cunder the wife\u2019s apron,\u201d which is considered to be \u201cone of the most extreme expressions of contempt that can be directed at a man,\u201d even though more women are now earning income outside the home.16 On the other hand, male respondents in one study acknowledged that fulfilling this role can be difficult, and a source of pressure.17 Some people believe that women should not work outside the home. About 42% of women feel that married women should not be allowed to work outside the home.18 One study notes \u201cmost men did not perceive women to be contributors to family revenue, despite the fact that women in Cambodia contribute more than 50% of household income.\u201d19 Although the same study noted that \u201cabout half of the men said 9 Ministry of Women\u2018s Affairs (2005), p. 6. 10 National Institute of Public Health and National Institute of Statistics (2006), p. 271. 11 Ministry of Women\u2018s Affairs (2008), p. 157. 12 Ibid., p.12 and 20. 13 Ibid., p. 21. 14 IWDA, p. 13. 15 Fordham, Graham (2005) \u201cWise\u201d Before Their Time: Young People, Gender-Based Violence and Pornography in Kandal Stung District (Phnom Penh: World Vision), p. 64. 16 Giles, p. 26.

A full 45% of women agreed that it is better to educate a son than a daughter.21 These attitudes are reflected in lower school enrollment rates among girls, with females accounting for only 35% of university students and 39% of upper secondary student populations.22 1.2. Personal Characteristics Many studies show that men are expected to be mentally and physically strong, someone who will \u201cnot walk away from a battle.\u201d23 Men must have a \u201cfive hudt chest,\u201d with one hudt being the distance from the tip of the fingers to the elbow.24 Boys and men cannot cry and they are expected to solve their own problems, and to \u201cact like a man from an early age.\u201d25 These traditions are very strong in Cambodian culture. \u201cThere was little variation in responses to the question about how a man should be or behave \u2026 He is \u2018strong\u2019, \u2018courageous\u2019, and is a \u2018leader\u2019. He knows what is right and wrong and is always law abiding. He takes \u2018responsibility for his actions and is \u2018persistent.\u2019\u201d26 In another set of research, boys who were sexually abused are reported as saying that ideals about male strength and bravery were particularly problematic when it came to responding to such abuse.

Cambodians believe that \u201cboys are like the rice before it is threshed \u2013 if it falls into the water it can still grow. Girls are considered like the white rice \u2013 if you drop it \u2013 it will die.\u201d32 Respondents explained that rape of a boy is not seen as serious as the rape of a girl, and that \u201cthey cannot become pregnant so people don\u2019t care about their reputations.\u201d33 One respondent stated, \u201cif this happens to girls, they lose their future and virginity. It\u2019s painful for the body and mind, and no one will love them anymore.

These attitudes may even make it harder for social service agencies to recognise such abuse. The staff at one agency that would be expected to be aware of sexual abuse cases involving children all said they were not working with any boys who had been sexually abused.35 \u201cUnravelling and making sense of the victimisation of males challenges perceptions that are almost set in stone ... powerful myths, beliefs and stereotypes related to males, power, invulnerability, masculinity, victimisation, honour and sexuality obscure the male victim\u2019s experiences. They combine to shroud the issue in silence, isolate victims and ultimately protect perpetrators.\u201d36 This leaves the victims struggling with their emotions, while \u201cthe need to be independent and self-reliant and live up to expectations of the man with a five-hudt chest contributes to their difficulties.\u201d37 1.3. Male Behaviour Studies outline differing standards for behaviour.

Now the saying is used in the context of all types of conduct.40 Nonetheless, expectations about behaviour are constantly changing, as a result of many factors. PADV found contradictions in descriptions of normal men compared to the ideals mentioned above. When respondents listed common characteristics of men, only three percent of these characteristics matched the respondents\u2019 own descriptions of the ideal.41 For example, a total of seven men said that a man who does not drink, gamble or use sex workers or drugs is a \u201cgood man,\u201d but 15 said that a man who did do these things was normal.42 Citing caution about the three forms of madness, one researcher notes \u201csociety does not enforce these rules in practice.\u201d43 Other studies note that gambling, sex outside marriage and use of alcohol and other drugs appear to be increasing.44 Some studies reflect that standards have eroded over time.

Masculinity and Violence 2.1. Underlying Causes of Violence Several studies document Cambodia\u2019s experience recovering from three decades of war and a society with weak rule of law. \u201cDomestic violence must be viewed in the larger context of Cambodian society, where notions of power and status determine social relations and a culture of impunity prevails. The prevalence of domestic violence is directly related to the prevalence of violence in society at large, and modern Cambodia\u2019s history of violence. Currently, violence is accepted as a normal end to a conflict in Cambodia, as people see no other possible solution.\u201d52 One result of Cambodia\u2019s violent history is that Cambodia has a serious problem with youth gangs, who engage in theft, violence, bauk (gang rape with three to ten males and one female, who may be a sex worker) and other activities. Young people said that both young men and women were members of gangs: 48% said gangs were for strong boys, 39% said they were for strong girls, and 35% said they were for boys in general.53 When asked why people join gangs, young people said that gang members wanted to be powerful, and drew parallels to patronage system among adults.54 Young people in Cambodia experience significant amounts of violence. A survey of 580 young people found that 62% had witnessed and assault or robbery by a youth gang.55 In another study, 56% of boys and 19% of girls were subject to physical violence by teachers.56 Young people also reported being beaten by their parents: 67% of boys and 38% of girls were beaten by their fathers, and 76% of boys and 60% of girls were beaten by their mothers.57 As the researchers note, despite other studies where \u201cwomen have been cast in the role of victims with little or no agency, while men have almost always been demonised as violent aggressors,\u201d mothers used violence more frequently than fathers against their own children.58 50 Ibid., p. 21. 51 Ministry of Women\u2018s Affairs (2008), p. 12. 52 Ministry of Women\u2018s Affairs (2005), p. 85. 53 Bearup, Luc (2003) Paupers & Princelings: Youth Attitudes Toward Gangs, Violence, Rap, Drugs and Theft (Phnom Penh: Gen- der and Development for Cambodia), p. 44. 54 Ibid., pp. 44 and 70. 55 Bearup, p. 27. 56 Fordham (2005), p. 46. 57 Ibid., pp. 48-49. 58 Ibid., pp. 49-50.

All the men in the perpetrator group organised by PADV agreed that children learn this behaviour from their fathers.62 Participants in Hilton\u2019s study also said they believed in a cycle of abuse, although the author cites a need for more research.63 Khmer culture does not proscribe domestic violence outright but it does encourage qualities that prevent violence, such as non-aggression, tolerance and forgiveness (although other traditions indicate tolerance of violence).64 But these ideas may not have much power to influence behaviour. Of the 88 responses to survey on the characteristics of a good man, only five said that a good man does not commit domestic violence.65 Furthermore, one researcher suggests that part of masculinity is kum, or revenge or payback of a slight with interest.66 Acceptance of marital control by husbands, and in turn, acceptance of violence when a wife does not 59 Bearup, p. 27. 60 Fordham (2005), p. 47. 61 Ibid., p. 59. 62 Giles, p. 26. 63 Hilton, p. 120. 64 Giles, p. 101. 65 Ibid., p. 24. 66 Fordham (2005), p. 73.

More than half, 55%, of the women surveyed in the CDHS agreed with at least one reason to justify a husband beating his wife. \u201cWomen are least likely to consider that a husband is justified in beating his wife if she refuses to have sexual relations with him. Women are most likely to consider that a husband is justified in beating his wife if she neglects the children (45%).\u201d69 In the governmental baseline survey on domestic violence, a significant number of respondents said that even extreme violence by husbands toward wives is sometimes acceptable. A full 30% of men, and 26% of women, said that throwing acid, stabbing or shooting \u2013 acts that can cause death \u2013 are sometimes acceptable. 21% of men and 26% of women said that burning or choking is sometimes acceptable. The study notes that \u201cfor all levels of violence except the most extreme category (throwing acid, stabbing or shooting) women showed greater acceptance of violence\u201d than men.70 Higher numbers of respondents said this violence was acceptable when a wife challenged her husband\u2019s dominance (by arguing, not obeying, questioning a husband about money or girlfriends, etc) than when the wife simply failed to fulfill her gender role.71 Notable among the variations among groups in this data is that young men aged 15 to 24 were more likely to see more extreme forms of violence as acceptable. \u201cThis indicates that despite rising education levels and a greater commitment to ending domestic violence by policymakers, attitudes about domestic violence have not improved. In contrast, they are generally static, and worsening in some groups.\u201d72 Research with men\u2019s groups by IWDA and PADV yielded similar results. IWDA cited a challenge to male power as the main cause of violence, and noted that more half the participants believed that women provoke men\u2019s violence behaviour.73 \u201cMen feel pressured to fulfill a masculine role and a failure to fulfill this role has a negative effect of a man\u2019s self esteem and sense of identity.

The baseline study reports that the most frequently cited influence on male behaviour toward women was lack of law enforcement, followed by male friends and peer pressure.85 Furthermore, domestic violence is not always seen as crime, but rather as a private matter.86 Once again, the research demonstrates contradictions in social norms for men. One study outlines two difference values systems.87 It describes \u201cpleasure indulgent masculinity\u201d where men show commitment to their friends by socialising, drinking alcohol and seeking sex as a group. This is in opposition to the ideal of \u201cself restraining masculinity\u201d based on \u201ctraditions of filial piety, social harmony and self control.\u201d As in other areas, there is a \u201cnoteworthy contrast between the private value systems men articulate and the standards that groups of men impose on one another.\u201d88 As a result, married men report \u201cnear-constant friction between demonstrating loyalty to the peer group and to their wives.\u201d89 Other studies focus more on pleasure seeking behaviour.90 The top answers on male characteristics related to sexuality from the men in the PADV groups were as follows: \u2022 strong sexual desire, have sex until death, love at first glance \u2022 having many sexual partners \u2022 being the one who initiates sex \u2022 forcing a woman to have sex \u2022 having sex without thinking about the feelings of the partner.91 Men reported that it is \u201cgenerally accepted, if not condoned, by men and women, that men will have 84 Ibid., p. 101. 85 Ministry of Women\u2018s Affairs (2005), p. 23. 86 Ministry of Women\u2018s Affairs (2008), p. 135. 87 PSI and FHI (2007) Let\u2019s Go For a Walk: Sexual Decision-making Among Clients of Female Entertainment Workers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia (Phnom Penh). 88 Ibid., p. iv. 89 Ibid., p. 7.

Some men say they are \u201cpowerless to resist\u201d their friends, and must continue to brothel.94 The men are admired by peers for having sex many times in a night and convincing women to have sex with them and for enthusiasm in seeking sex.95 One reason it is difficult to opt out is cultural pressure to avoid conflict, makes it hard to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55575399-f277-450e-afa7-76065a36842c": {"__data__": {"id_": "55575399-f277-450e-afa7-76065a36842c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9691a37ad66810fdb87ba43817331c7042838cbe57234fef9fe382f7072b4a9"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a3ed8cd-1d6b-485d-831d-03dc971e8e62", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "efab47fd02f608b53e5981ee97c824818dbe2ca2cd2dbd9f698699d0aa7475a8"}}, "hash": "13578fead91aa7d0050a9fb0e16c414bd13c87d6a946b7d9c35d713063ec6746", "text": "refuse.96 Although some men opt out when the group goes to a brothel, others say they admire them for this, although these men are subject to teasing and being called \u201cwomanly\u201d or \u201clike a girl.\u201d97 This behaviour starts early. \u201cThe transition from boyhood to manhood is often marked by an initiation into sexual experience, and in Cambodia this often occurs with a sex worker while accompanied by friends. 98 Similarly, as males come of age, a rite of passage occurs when they have more autonomy and freedom, shown by dar leng with friends.99 Sexual coercion and violence are not uncommon in Cambodia. As noted above, two of the most common male characteristics identified by the PADV men\u2019s groups were forcing women to have sex, and having sex without thinking of the feelings of the partner.100 The same study shows acceptance of marital rape. \u201cMarital rape is not a part of the Khmer lexicon, except within human rights organisations, and is generally considered to be an aspect of a husband\u2019s rights within the marriage.\u201d101 This confirms findings in the baseline study on domestic violence, which note \u201cAlthough most respondents thought that men did not have the right to force their wives to have sex, only 55% thought that rape in marriage is a crime.

Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 82 Several studies document the incidence and acceptance of bauk, which is gang rape, often of a sex worker. This is usually is committed by younger men.103 Studies speculate on several causes of bauk, including stress, the difficulty for youth to find jobs, decades of war and the \u201cunresolved history of the Khmer Rouge,\u201d peer pressure and pornography.104 Bearup notes that short of willing partners and money, young people turn to gang members and bauk to affirm masculinity, and this creates a sense of ritual.105 Respondents in these studies showed an \u201cextreme lack of empathy\u201d with the woman, who was often deceived, coerced or even abducted by pulling her hair or slapping her until she complied.106 This makes sense in a society where rape of a sex worker is not generally condemned because of her profession.107 In addition, participants in one study did not make ethical distinctions between situations involving several men and one woman where the woman had been tricked (into being with several men) or where she gave consent.108 Respondents said they liked bauk because it affirmed their masculinity, and as a way to have fun with friends.109 Bauk was also widely accepted by young people in general. Only 134% of male and 13% of female respondents said that bauk was wrong because of the lack of consent. The most common answer was that bauk was dangerous due to the risk of contracting STDs, reported by 33% of males and 40.7% of females.110 2.2. Contributing Factors to Violence Studies identify several contributing factors, including alcohol abuse and pornography. With regard to alcohol abuse, researchers characterise it as an overlooked issue.111 Brickell and other sources called for more research on links between masculinity, violence and drinking alcohol.112 However, researchers report that drinking alcohol is \u201ca manly activity\u201d and men face peer pressure to drink.113 In 103 PSI and FHI, p. 24. 104 Sophrach (2008), p.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a3ed8cd-1d6b-485d-831d-03dc971e8e62": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a3ed8cd-1d6b-485d-831d-03dc971e8e62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9691a37ad66810fdb87ba43817331c7042838cbe57234fef9fe382f7072b4a9"}, "2": {"node_id": "55575399-f277-450e-afa7-76065a36842c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "13578fead91aa7d0050a9fb0e16c414bd13c87d6a946b7d9c35d713063ec6746"}}, "hash": "efab47fd02f608b53e5981ee97c824818dbe2ca2cd2dbd9f698699d0aa7475a8", "text": "24. 104 Sophrach (2008), p. 35 and 40. 105 Bearup, p. 94. 106 Ibid., p. 92. 107 Giles, p. 100. 108 PSI and FHI, p. 23. 109 Bearup, p. 89.

Due to frustration, it is seen as \u201cnatural\u201d to drink.115 Fordham states that the context of drinking is a root cause of violence, as opposed to drinking phoek Si, as it is often associated with gambling, which can cause a man to lose his money, leading him to go him and demand more money from his wife. This can cause conflict.116 In another study, \u201cJust over half of the men believe the main cause of violence is alcohol consumption yet slightly less than half of the participants believed that this is an excuse rather than a reason for violence ... Many men spoke about their inability to \u2018control their mind\u2019 when they drink and that a cause of violence is stress in the mind.\u201d117 International studies shed more light on the link between alcohol and violence. \u201cWhen stressed people drink, they tend to become violent\u201d and to increase defensive activity and perception of being challenged.118 In addition, researchers have noted an increased use of alcohol in Southeast Asia.119 However, the role of alcohol in intimate partner violence is complex. It is important to acknowledge that alcohol is not a root cause of violence against women such as patriarchy and gender inequality in society. However, it is clearly a risk factor that we need to explore in more detail. Lee has suggested that alcohol may be used as an excuse for violence occurring in intimate relationships, which allows the victim to forgive the abuser. Others suggest that conflict when inebriated may be more likely to result in violence because of the effect of alcohol.120 However, social anthropologists have argued that the connections between violence and drunkenness are socially learnt.121 Although there are few studies on the impact of pornography in this region,122 some studies posit that pornography does have an influence on behaviour, especially among young people. These studies note an increasing amount of pornography coming into Cambodia and that these materials are violent.123 In a 114 PSI and FHI, p. 20. 115 Fordham (2005), pp. 65-66.

Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia 84 study of Cambodian youth, Fordham found that pornography is \u201chighly significant\u201d in the lives of young people.124 Only 16.5% of youth in the study had not seen it, and the mean age of exposure was 13.2 years of age, some much earlier.125 A later study showed that \u201ca significant proportion of Cambodia\u2019s young people (both boys and girls) are exposed to extremely hard-core pornography, and that this has real impacts on their lives, whether they are directly exposed to pornography or whether their exposure is indirect.\u201d126 Fordham states that this exposure has an influence on masculine and feminine behaviour.127 He links pornography to increasing sexualisation of youth128 and states that \u201cpornography teaches young people sexual scripts, and if it is violent pornography they are violent scripts.129 Female respondents in his studies reported that boys acted differently after viewing pornography. \u201cAs several girls put it, boys are not \u201cgentle\u201d any more and they speak \u201crudely\u201d following exposure to pornography.\u201d130 More significantly, Fordham describes a link between pornography and rape. \u201cIt is highly likely that there is a direct link between the consumption of pornography by young people and sexual violence and rape\u2014rape within marriage, gang rape (bauk) and, particularly, the rape of girl children by boys who themselves are minors or even in early adolescence.\u201d131 Fordham cites a 15-year-old boy who said he was unaware that he had committed rape by having sex with a five-year-old girl, because he was copying what he had seen on a VCD.132 He notes \u201cthose who work with victims of bauk or child victims of rape see a direct link to increased access to pornography in the context of little sex education.\u201d133 2.3 Responses to Violence Several Cambodian studies document the experience of seeking help in a situation of domestic

By contrast, one third of women who experienced violence by their husband and others (38%) or women who experienced violence by a previous husband (53%) sought help.\u201d135 In the earlier governmental baseline study, \u201cthe respondents said that women would be most likely to seek help from communal authorities or village elders, followed by police or the courts. Respondents said that a woman was less likely to seek help from a lawyer or legal aid or an NGO offering counselling or support, and least likely to ask for help from an agency that offers shelter, especially in cases of emotional abuse or rape in marriage. Respondents in urban areas and those with higher incomes said that a woman was more likely to seek help from an NGO. This may reflect the higher availability of NGOs in urban areas.\u201d136 The baseline study pointed out that women\u2019s \u201cability to get help when they are being abused is limited to options that are available or perceived to be available to them,\u201d citing communal or village authorities, or the police, as the only avenues that are actually available.137 \u201cFar fewer cited the courts, which are often located far away. In fact, 38% of the sample said they would need to travel two hours to reach a court, and 27% of the respondents said they would need to travel up to six hours. Transportation costs to the courts averaged US$4. Agencies that provide counselling, legal aid, or shelter were even less accessible.\u201d138 The study notes that women are often unsuccessful in obtaining help. \u201cLocal authorities and police not only fail to enforce existing laws against violence, they also reported similar levels of acceptance of domestic violence as the general sample ... Other key resources (counselling, health centres, legal aid) are simply not available in most geographic areas.139 Among the 330 respondents who reported that they sought help in the baseline study, more than half had sought a divorce, most often through communal authorities.140 They study notes that \u201cwomen and those with lower incomes were more likely to seek a divorce for physical abuse or injury or emotional abuse.\u201d However, \u201cthe vast majority of the respondents who sought a divorce themselves were urged to reconcile by the authorities. 82% of the men and 96% of the women were urged to reconcile. The final result was that roughly three quarters of the respondents were reconciled.\u201d 141 135 Ibid. 136 Ministry of Women\u2018s Affairs (2005), p. 63. 137 Ibid., p. 60. 138 Ibid. 139 Ibid., p. 86. 140 Ibid., p. 67. 141 Ibid.

Global and Regional Literature 3.1. Regional Literature The descriptions of domestic violence outlined in Cambodian studies show similarities with regional studies.

Most countries reported that \u201cphysical partner violence was almost always accompanied by sexual violence,\u201d170 with the exception of Thailand, Bangladesh and Ethiopia. Women who were separated or divorced or living with a partner without marriage reported a higher level of violence, as did younger women aged 15 to 24 years old and women with less education. As the authors note, these findings \u201creflect the fact that violence often starts early in partnerships, as well as the likelihood that separated women may have left violent relationships.\u201d171 The study also collected data on controlling behaviour by intimate partners, which ranged from 21% in urban areas of Japan to 90% in urban areas in the United Republic of Tanzania.172 The study also found a correlation between physical or sexual violence and these controlling behaviours. \u201cFor example, nearly 40% of women in Peru province who had ever suffered physical or sexual, violence, or both, by an intimate partner had experienced at least four of the controlling behaviours mentioned, compared with seven percent of women who had never experienced violence. This pattern holds true for all of the sites.\u201d173 The study noted that these findings were consistent with previous research in several different countries. Other studies have documented the social isolation of women as a risk factor for partner violence.174 Brown suggests, The isolation of a wife is also determined by the degree of privacy a society traditionally assigns to the domestic sphere. In general when domestic activities take place almost entirely out of doors and in full view of the rest of the community, or when domestic activity is audible through thin house walls, it is less likely that women will be battered because others will step in. There is greater danger that wives will be abused when the domestic sphere is veiled in privacy.175 Similarly, Michalski argues that having a low degree of social isolation or strong network support contributes 168 Ibid. 169 Ibid., p. 29. 170 Ibid., p. 84. 171 Ibid. 172 Ibid., p. 36. 173 Ibid. 174 See Warrington (2001); Hanmer (2000) and Neilsen et al.

There is strong evidence in other countries in the region and globally, those children who have either experienced violence themselves or witnessed violence when growing up are more likely to end up in a violence relationship, either as the perpetrator or victim.177 Recent studies in the Pacific have also revealed this.178 It is likely that children in violent homes learn to use violence rather than other more constructive methods to resolve conflicts.179 It may also lead to permissive attitudes towards violence.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d981351-13a5-4921-83c3-d390e893a519": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d981351-13a5-4921-83c3-d390e893a519", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deoum Troung Pram Hath in Modern Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8cad2a6672be0986ac8ff24af0f6669ffa7ab8436f1dfe83112bb3c065acaa70"}, "2": {"node_id": "610cdcc1-f2ad-4127-a418-d2cd9e2ad954", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/deoum-troung-pram-hath-modern-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac4d43c40727b4c051f8263bcdfe3004be51e9c711e78485d6982130f495ebb7"}}, "hash": "43337bff08bd066fc96d4fa7e184b64b4101012bb33f6c938d58019f5817a759", "text": "There is further evidence from the region about the intergenerational transmission of violence noted in the section below.

Historically, feminists have been hesitant to accept this association because it fails to deal with what they consider the root cause of violence, namely patriarchy and gender inequality in society. As in Cambodian research, responses in the WHO study varied regarding the justification of violence against women. \u201cWomen appear to make distinctions regarding the circumstances under which wife beating may or may not be \u2018acceptable.\u2019 In all sites, substantially more women accept wife beating in the case of actual or suspected female infidelity than for any other reason.

Appendix E: Literature Review 91 In addition, the study asked women if wives had the right to refuse sex with their husband. The study offered both a question that listed possible reasons why a wife might refuse, and also asked if a wife can refuse under any circumstance. Respondents answered differently, based on different reasons why a wife might want to refuse (such as being sick, if she does not want to, if the husband is drunk or if the husband mistreats her.) \u201cIn all sites, fewer women felt that a wife has the right to refuse to have sex because she does not want to than when her husband is drunk or abusive.\u201d184 The proportion of women who said that a wife has a right to refuse sex to her husband under any circumstances varied widely among countries (from 15% in the provinces of the United Republic of Tanzania province to over 90% in urban areas in Brazil and Serbia and Montenegro and among different sites within countries (in Peru, from 40% in a provincial setting to 86% in the city).185 These findings on justification for violence a woman\u2019s limited rights to refuse sex to her husband are deeply intertwined with gender norms. The In-Depth Study on All Forms of Violence Against Women: Report of the (UN) Secretary-General186 links violence to gender norms establishing male dominance. \u201cViolence against women serves as a mechanism for maintaining male authority. When a woman is subjected to violence for transgressing social norms governing female sexuality and family roles, for example, the violence is not only individual but, through its punitive and controlling functions, also reinforces prevailing gender norms.\u201d187 The study further notes that customs, traditions and religious values are often used to justify violence against women.\u201d188 The UN Secretary General\u2019s report lists several causes for domestic violence. The study notes that several countries have legal doctrines providing impunity for violence committed against family members or in the home, and also states that many countries do not prosecute domestic violence cases.

Drawing on consultations with all stakeholders, including volunteers, survivors and representatives of organizations, this study aims to inform and strengthen future volunteer interventions to respond to and prevent gender-based violence. In order to achieve its objective, the study included interviews and group discussions with volunteers and staff from seven different organizations engaged in GBV response and/or prevention through volunteer interventions and a group discussion with GBV survivors. The organizations that participated in this study were chosen from a compiled list of 15 national and international non- governmental organizations (NGOs), volunteer-involving organizations (VIOs) and community- based organizations (CBOs). This study developed a typology of volunteers working on GBV. Three volunteer profiles were identified across all the participating organizations: community volunteers, office volunteers and international volunteers. While this study is not meant to be exhaustive on the topic, we are confident that it provides an accurate reflection of the main issues affecting volunteerism and GBV work in Cambodia. Key findings: \u2022\ufffd Community volunteers are essential for NGO programmes on GBV because the volunteers are the primary means of implementing these organizations\u2019 projects, thus all GBV prevention and response activities in local communities depend on volunteers.

Based on these findings, this study offers a set of recommendations to strengthen volunteerism for GBV prevention and response aimed at NGOs, the United Nations (UN) system and policy- makers. These recommendations include: recognize the value of volunteerism, invest in the work of volunteers, use volunteerism as a tool to strengthen the community as a whole, provide adequate training to volunteers, participate in training to strengthen NGO skills on volunteer management, create a network of volunteers working on GBV, address volunteers\u2019 limited understanding of gender issues, and strengthen relationships among local authorities and volunteers working on GBV. 1. Executive summary Executive summary 5 6 2. Background 2.1. Rationale At the time this study was initiated, several UN agencies, including UNV Cambodia, were in the process of developing a joint initiative to support the strategic directions of the Cambodian National Action Plan to Prevent Violence against Women (VAW). UNV Cambodia was assessing the possible entry points for this joint initiative and analyzing how volunteerism contributed to existing GBV efforts. The initiative was to be in line with: \u2022\ufffd The intent of the Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Protection of Victims; \u2022\ufffd The UNDP, UNFPA, UNV, and UNIFEM Regional Joint Programme \u201cPartners for Prevention\u201d (P4P); and \u2022\ufffd The Country Programme outcome of the UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 2011-2015, \u201cImproved societal attitudes and preventive and holistic responses to GBV.\u201d As this study looks at the benefits and challenges of using volunteerism as a means to prevent and respond to GBV, it could be the basis of future projects and activities to support organizations and individuals addressing these issues. Globally there is a lack of literature on GBV and volunteerism and our study has found that there has been limited research on this topic. This report offers an indication of the current status of volunteerism in GBV response and prevention in Cambodia, and provides recommendations for future interventions. This project is also meant as a pilot to inform similar projects in other Southeast Asian countries that are working with Partners for Prevention. 2.2. Objective and expected outputs The primary objective of this study is to analyze interventions where volunteerism played or is playing a significant role in the prevention of and response to GBV in Cambodia. Drawing on consultations with all stakeholders, including volunteers, survivors and representatives of organizations, this study aims to inform and strengthen future volunteer interventions to respond to and prevent gender- based violence. Therefore, the study produces the following four outputs: 1. A typology of volunteer profiles working on GBV prevention and response, to better understand volunteerism on GBV in Cambodian society. 2. A detailed analysis of volunteer interventions in addressing GBV. While the analysis cannot be considered comprehensive or representative of the general situation throughout Cambodia, it provides an indication of the main issues at stake and could be used to inform future research and programme directions. 3. Documentation of the success, support and challenges of volunteerism on GBV. 4. An assessment of where development partners, such as UNV Cambodia and Partners for Prevention, could direct their efforts for mainstreaming volunteerism in GBV interventions. 2.3. Context: Volunteerism, gender and GBV in Cambodia A desk review of relevant documents and materials was conducted as part of the study. The documents and materials included official UN reports, government documents and survey reports, and organizations\u2019 brochures, organizational profiles, reports, publications and websites.

This study found that \u201ctraditional\u201d volunteerism has been essential to the formation of communities and to their access to resources and services, such as education. In addition, two main trends have led to increased opportunities for volunteers (including youth) to contribute to national development. First, there appears to have been a shift in the ways that NGOs work. International NGOs are working more in partnership with local NGOs, which are in turn initiating local grass-roots associations. These associations often rely entirely on village volunteers. Second, due to the disruption of education during past conflicts, youth are often more highly educated than older generations and thus may make significant contributions to the development of their country. The Youth Star Cambodia/UNV Cambodia study has found that volunteers have positive effects in the following priority areas of the government\u2019s National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2006\u2013 10: promoting access to education (including survival rates and access to further education) and improving its quality; reducing poverty through increasing agricultural skills, decreasing interest rates and providing long-term flexible credit; reducing household vulnerability to unexpected incidences, especially related to health care; increasing lawfulness and peace in communities, including enhancing legal protection for women; promoting agricultural diversification; engaging young people so that they avoid harmful activities (such as violence and use of drugs); and promoting civic engagement and good local governance. Indeed, volunteer work has a far-reaching effect in implementing development initiatives in Cambodia. Given the importance of volunteers in Cambodia, our study seeks to build on the work done by Youth Star Cambodia/UNV Cambodia by studying the significance of volunteerism in GBV interventions. In particular, our study seeks to analyze the contributions of volunteers in GBV prevention and response in their communities. Our study also investigates the needs of these volunteers in order to identify how their NGOs and communities can further support them to carry out their work. 2.3.2. Gender in Cambodia Gender equality is guaranteed in the Cambodian Constitution, which prohibits all forms of discrimination against women (Article 45). Both men and women should have equal opportunity to exercise their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Cambodia became a State Party to the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1992. More than half of Cambodia\u2019s population is female (51.35 percent), yet they do not share half of the wealth, resources and voice. Cambodia ranks 93 out of 136 countries on the Gender Inequality Index (GII) in the 2010 Human Development Report (HDR). GII is a new measurement that reveals the gender disparities in reproductive health, empowerment and labour market participation, replacing the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) and Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM). Ranking 93 on the GII shows how Cambodia\u2019s gender-related development lags behind that of neighbouring countries, such as Thailand (GII 62) or Vietnam (GII 45). 1 Youth Star Cambodia and United Nations Volunteers Cambodia (2008), \u201cVolunteerism: Harnessing the potential in Cambodia\u201d Background 8 As various research1 shows, there is evidence of change in gender attitudes, including greater awareness of women\u2019s rights among younger women and women living in urban areas. Nevertheless, significant gender inequalities continue to persist in Cambodian society, and include: \u2022\ufffd Limited participation in decision-making and development processes. Over the past decade, there have been improvements on the status of women in Cambodia. Yet women remain less visible in public sphere. Women comprise 34 percent of civil servants and hold 22 percent of seats in the National Assembly. \u2022\ufffd Lower education levels of girls and women. Almost the same number of boys and girls attend school until the age of 14. However, fewer girls continue in higher education. Adult literacy rates are also unequal: only 70.9 percent of adult females are literate, compared to 85.1 percent of their male peers. \u2022\ufffd Poorer health outcomes. The HDR 2010 reports a maternal mortality ratio of 540 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is not only one of the highest in the region, but also is an increase from the 2005 Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS), which reported a maternal mortality ratio of 472 deaths per 100,000 live births. \u2022\ufffd The number of men and women in the total workforce is almost the same (49.4 percent women). However, more women are self-employed or unpaid family workers (83 percent of female employment vs. 76 percent of male employment).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c57cf1a-806e-4c68-9999-7db55ce8aa18": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c57cf1a-806e-4c68-9999-7db55ce8aa18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making a Difference - GBV in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6cfa2f4675b4de8ee7932b847dd1e06111fa396cbcdcd463feccfcd9b1a4c800"}, "2": {"node_id": "80e56b28-7560-4093-932a-b2cea32ab3c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37660d4531099b8a8b80b243e630d0d091243d1c4acc9b59348a27fb3ee54423"}}, "hash": "fff4969662e3b6895acde63f2e9f7ebf10a5972b187f66924057d1fc48356f54", "text": "76 percent of male employment).

Idealized gender roles and behaviours are embodied in the Chbap Srey and Chbap Pros (the traditional codes of conduct for women and men). These codes give men higher status and authority as the head of the household, and exhort women to be faithful, modest and obedient and to accept their husband\u2019s behaviour no matter what he does. Although these traditional roles continue to be very influential for women, changing social and economic conditions have made it more difficult for women to adhere to traditional gender norms and new images of femininity have emerged, particularly in urban areas, reflecting these changes. Traditional norms of conduct for men appear to be less influential on men\u2019s behaviour than for women. 2.3.3. GBV in Cambodia Violence against women is widely prevalent in Cambodia. The incidence of domestic violence (DV) has remained static over the past decade, while reporting of rape has increased. Reliable data on the incidence of sexual exploitation is unavailable; however, it appears to be entrenched in Cambodia. Data on sexual harassment is not widely available; however, recent studies indicate that it is more likely to occur in informal vulnerable occupations.2 Research from Cambodia indicates that GBV is a problem that cuts across age, class, race and ethnicity. The Royal Government of Cambodia\u2019s (RGC) baseline report on VAW found high levels of DV in both urban and rural areas, affecting women in all sectors of society3 . According to the baseline survey, 19% of ever-married women age 15-49 reported experiencing emotional violence from their 1 Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs (2008) \u201cA Fair Share for Women: Cambodia Gender Assessment\u201d, Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs (2009) \u201cViolence Against Women: Follow-up Survey\u201d and UNDP (2010) Human Development Report 2 Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs (2008), \u201cA Fair Share for Women: Cambodia Gender Assessment\u201d 3 Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs (2005) \u201cViolence Against Women: A Baseline Survey\u201d Background 9 husbands, 13% reported physical violence, and 3% reported sexual violence .1 The study also showed overlap between different types of violence with 22% of women reporting physical, sexual, and/ or emotional violence. Research has also documented a higher likelihood of violence in marriages where husbands exercise control over their wives. An estimated 42% of women in marriages with a high level of marital control reported physical and/or sexual violence. The 2009 Follow-up Survey found significant community acceptance for DV and a strong belief that men are entitled to more rights than women.2 Approximately 64% of the sample knew a husband who acted violent towards his wife and 23% of female respondents had suffered violence at the hands of their husbands. The survey also showed that violence had significant economic, physical and mental health impacts on those who experienced it. The RGC took a major step forward in addressing VAW by approving the Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Protection of Victims in 2005.3 The stated objective of this law is to \u201cprevent domestic violence, protect victims and strengthen the culture of non-violence and harmony within households in society.\u201d 4 The law defines domestic violence as violence directed toward a husband, wife, child or other dependant, including acts affecting life, physical integrity, torture or cruel acts and sexual aggression, as well as threats. Another key response to improve the prevention of VAW in Cambodia was the development of a National Action Plan to Prevent (NAP) Violence against Women in February 2009. The three strategic areas in the NAP identified by the RGC are: (1) Raising public awareness and distribution of laws to the public; (2) Creating and improving social, health and legal services; and (3) Development and improving related policies and laws.5 However, despite the new law and NAP, the Follow-Up Survey on VAW (2009) found that while the policy framework has been strengthened, implementation is uneven and poorly monitored, largely due to ineffective institutional arrangements at all levels and structural barriers to the effective application of VAW principles and norms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d666fe2f-a685-45fc-b46e-6891e0627803": {"__data__": {"id_": "d666fe2f-a685-45fc-b46e-6891e0627803", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making a Difference - GBV in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "089a74fb96876c7e1399c0849cb9e9bbc7efc9bfbc49b436e0bfcb15c42c8ddd"}, "2": {"node_id": "8de578f2-5d29-48f2-9e44-36d7088585a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5a7a12dcd65bdcdadae3d4d76eee9f041ba6d7346837f870f507222bd11a3d0"}}, "hash": "7ffb69a865381c1f1da8f666452bda47bfa8d0bb961a12de1e5669113490a073", "text": "The Five Year Strategic Plan 2009-2013 Neary Rattanak III also states that: \u201cAddressing the attitudes and behaviour which underlie GBV and the stigmatization of survivors and victims of violence remain a considerable challenge.\u201d 6 1 National Institute of Public Health and National Institute of Statistics (2006) \u201cCambodia Demographic and Health Survey\u201d, page 290 2 Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs (2009) \u201cViolence Against Women: Follow-Up Survey\u201d 3 Kingdom of Cambodia Government Document 1005/3 4 Kingdom of Cambodia Government Document 1005/31 5 Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs (2009), National Action Plan to Prevent Violence Against Women 6 Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs (2009), Five Year Strategic Plan 2009-2013 Neary Rattanak", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0832211-7df2-477f-82d9-7a1051d235f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0832211-7df2-477f-82d9-7a1051d235f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making a Difference - GBV in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4bbc7e528dad077af8146c135b3c41d9df5a5bb979c2219d9c2c22e9fa1ad80a"}}, "hash": "4bbc7e528dad077af8146c135b3c41d9df5a5bb979c2219d9c2c22e9fa1ad80a", "text": "III Background 10 3.1. Study design In order to achieve its objective, the study covered seven different organizations engaged in GBV response and/or prevention, chosen out of an initial selection of 15 national and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), volunteer involving organizations (VIOs) and community- based organizations (CBOs). For each organization, data was collected through two or more of the following methods: \u2022\ufffd A semi-structured interview with organization staff; \u2022\ufffd Semi-structured interviews with volunteers (two from each selected organization, when possible one male and one female); \u2022\ufffd Focus group discussions (FGDs) with volunteers; and \u2022\ufffd FGDs with GBV survivors who had been recipients of volunteer interventions. Following data collection and preliminary data analysis, a participatory forum was organized with study participants and other staff and volunteers from the seven organizations, to present and validate the findings. A total of 24 representatives from all seven organizations participated in the forum and provided feedback on the findings and recommendations, which was then incorporated in this final report. The remainder of this section provides more details on the sampling, data collection and data analysis processes. It also outlines the ethical considerations, the definitions used and the limitations of the study. 3.2. Definitions 3.2.1. Concept of GBV For this study we used the following definitions of GBV and VAW: \u2022\ufffd From the UNFPA Gender Theme Group, 1998: Gender-based violence is violence involving men and women, in which the female is usually the victim; and which is derived from unequal power relationships between men and women. Violence is directed specifically against a woman because she is a woman, or affects women disproportionately. It includes, but is not limited to, physical, sexual and psychological harm (including intimidation, suffering, coercion, and/or deprivation of liberty within the family, or within the general community). It includes that violence which is perpetrated or condoned by the state. \u2022\ufffd From the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women: Any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. Accordingly, violence against women encompasses but is not limited to the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, dowry-related violence, marital rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation; (b) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution; 3. Methodology Methodology 11 (c) Physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated or condoned by the State, wherever it occurs. To operationalize the terms used, examples were given during discussions with research participants. With a few notable exceptions, most staff and volunteers confused GBV with DV, which may be a reflection of what the understanding of gender is among Cambodian NGOs, staff, volunteers, and GBV survivors. As a result, the researchers were careful to defined GBV explicitly as more than DV and including, but not limited to, rape, sexual violence, and human trafficking. Without more research it is not possible to confirm whether it is the term \u201cgender\u201d that caused misunderstanding, or the local understanding which tends to equate gender with women instead of with the social construction of male and female identities. The research team suspects the latter. Gender is essentially a construct of the global North exported to other parts of the world through a variety of means, including humanitarian and development assistance and programming. The understanding of gender in the global North developed over time due to a particular set of circumstances. The question of how this concept can be transferred in a short timeframe and used within a cultural and social context with different circumstances is beyond the scope of this study, but nevertheless must be kept at the forefront throughout any research that deals with gender. 3.2.2. Concept of volunteering For this study we used the definition of volunteering from the United Nations Volunteers Report prepared for the UN General Assembly Special Session on Social Development (Geneva, February 2001): There are three key defining characteristics of volunteering. First the activity should not be undertaken primarily for financial reward, although the reimbursement of expenses and some token payment may be allowed. Second, the activity should be undertaken voluntarily, according to an individual\u2019s own free-will, although there are grey areas here too, such as school community service schemes which encourage,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32b2c1a7-2a63-4fa6-862c-5c71b4eeaf03": {"__data__": {"id_": "32b2c1a7-2a63-4fa6-862c-5c71b4eeaf03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making a Difference - GBV in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1045351cdaef6e37317be424d66dbf61f97cc63436e5462b9434e608f69776cf"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e78a92e-931f-485c-b1da-aa4ead028457", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eae009e65725e0698475a0143a21040f08ad9e130b7bcbe633eb3c3f31fc09c3"}}, "hash": "46f4ce873c21175a1350cc1346e33436d95898aaf7e9184480186dc2276bb0bb", "text": "and sometimes require, students to get involved in voluntary work and Food for Work programmes, where there is an explicit exchange between community involvement and food assistance. Third, the activity should be of benefit to someone other than the volunteer, or to society at large, although it is recognised that volunteering brings significant benefit to the volunteer as well. Within this broad conceptual framework it is possible to identify at least four different types of volunteer activity: mutual aid or self-help; philanthropy or service to others; participation or civic engagement; and advocacy or campaigning. Each of these types occurs in all parts of the world. The three volunteer profiles are quite clearly delineated in the categories explained in Section 4.11; however, that should not be taken to mean that a common understanding of volunteering exists in Cambodia. On the contrary, numerous organizations contacted during the selection process did not consider community volunteers to be volunteers. Most thought that by \u201cvolunteer\u201d we meant only international volunteers or volunteers working in the office. The term \u201cvolunteer\u201d was thus explained to the organizations and interviewees in a manner that included community volunteers. 1 See Section 4.1. Typology of volunteers for more information about the different types of volunteers. Methodology 12 3.3. Sampling and selection 3.3.1. Sampling and selection of organizations and staff This study was designed to investigate the work of volunteers of the most relevant local NGOs working on GBV prevention and response in Cambodia. Relevant organizations were identified from the following sources: \u2022\ufffd \u201cMapping and needs assessment of GBV interventions in Cambodia\u201d1 , which documents all the national NGOs working on GBV in Cambodia;2 \u2022\ufffd The Regional Consultation \u201cWorking with Boys and Men for GBV Prevention\u201d3 , which brought together the main NGOs working in Cambodia with boys and men in GBV prevention; and \u2022\ufffd The Network of International and Local Volunteer Agencies and Volunteer Involving Organizations in Cambodia4 (VolCam), which includes the main VIOs in Cambodia. When compiled together, these sources produced a list of 50 NGOs, VIOs, and CBOs working on GBV and/or using volunteers. From the 50 organizations, 15 organizations were identified as potential participants in this study, based on the following eligibility criteria: (1) the organization works on GBV prevention and/or response, and (2) the organization uses volunteers for its GBV programmes (see Annex 7.1: Pre-Selection of NGOs, VIOs, CBOs). Among the 15 organizations, we purposefully selected seven organizations that were local NGOs using between 50 and 200 volunteers, to ensure that the organizations studied were well established in the local community, had an extensive network of volunteers and had a comprehensive volunteer programme. In alphabetical order, the following seven Cambodian NGOs participated in this study: \u2022\ufffd Banteay Srei \u2022\ufffd Buddhist for Development (BFD) \u2022\ufffd Cambodian Defenders Project (CDP) \u2022\ufffd Gender and Development for Cambodia (GAD/C) \u2022\ufffd Legal Support for Children and Women (LSCW) \u2022\ufffd People Health Development (PHD) \u2022\ufffd Project Against Domestic Violence (PADV) The seven organizations identified ten mid to high-level staff members to be interviewed individually or in pairs based on the scope of the study. Staff interviewees served as key informants based on their involvement in the organization\u2019s volunteer programmes, including their experience with community, office and international volunteers5 . The positions of the interviewees varied across the organizations, from the Executive Director to the Trainer of the volunteers.

The impact of the services provided by volunteers. Almost all of the interviews and FGDs were recorded using an electronic recorder, and both the main researcher and the Khmer interpreter/facilitator(s) took notes during and after each interview, FGD and field visit. These notes were compiled in English and then compared by the Khmer interpreter/ facilitator(s) with the audio files in order to fill in any gaps. Data was collected through several methods as outlined in the sample design: \u2022\ufffd Semi-structured interviews with the NGO staff. See Annex 7.2: Guidelines for the interviews with the NGOs, VIOs, CBOs for more details. \u2022\ufffd Semi-structured interviews with volunteers. See Annex 7.3: Guidelines for the interviews with the volunteers for more details. \u2022\ufffd FGD with male volunteers. See Annex 7.4: Guidelines for the Focus Group Discussions with the volunteers for more details. \u2022\ufffd FGD with survivors. See Annex 7.5: Guidelines for the Focus Group Discussions with the survivors and Section 5.2.4: Further Research for more details. Interviews with the NGO staff were mainly conducted in English. Most of the interviews with the volunteers were conducted in Khmer by the main English-speaking researcher with the assistance of an interpreter. Both focus group discussions were conducted in Khmer with the assistance of a translator. 3.5. Ethical considerations All participants were informed that participation in this study was completely voluntary. Any organization, survivor or volunteer who decided to take part in the study could change their mind and withdraw at any time. There were no consequences for deciding not to participate or to withdraw. Participants also had the right to decide to have their data withdrawn from the study at a later date, as long as their data could be identified, without any consequences to themselves. These ethical considerations, as well as those below, were shared with all potential study participants and their consent was sought prior to initiating any data collection. (See Annexes 7.2 Guidelines for Methodology 17 interviews with NGOs, VIOs, CBOs, 7.3 Guidelines for interviews with volunteers, 7.4 Guidelines for focus group discussions with volunteers and 7.5 Guidelines for focus group discussions with survivors for more details on the consent process). Two organizations exercised their right to not participate. One organization cited a heavy work load as the reason for declining to participate and the other organization stated that its programme had just started and, thus, it did not have sufficient information to contribute to the study. All of the organizations and persons who decided to participate completed the study. 3.5.1. Informed consent The aim of the project, the procedures used to collect the information and all the ethical issues were explained to all the study participants, and their verbal informed consent before starting any data collection was provided (See Annexes 7.2 Guidelines for interviews with NGOs, VIOs, CBOs, 7.3 Guidelines for interviews with volunteers, 7.4 Guidelines for focus group discussions with volunteers and 7.5 Guidelines for focus gGroup discussions with survivors for more details). 3.5.2. Confidentiality and anonymity Anonymity was ensured in that all resulting documents and products do not contain names or any other identifying information. Confidentiality was ensured for answers provided during the interviews. Only the research team had access to the answers, and all data has been kept on a password protected computer in a secure office. The interviews with the NGO staff were conducted in private rooms at the interviewees\u2019 workplaces. The interviews with the volunteers were held in private locations chosen by the interviewees. Three volunteers from one organization requested to be interviewed as a group due to discomfort of answering questions on their own. The research team complied with this request and the interview was conducted in this manner. There were also certain limitations on anonymity for interviewees (both volunteers and GBV survivors), given that they were identified as potential study participants internally by each organization. These conditions and any constraints were clearly explained to study participants as part of the informed consent process. Confidentiality and anonymity could not be ensured for the FGDs and the participatory forum, given the concomitant presence of other study participants. However, given that all GBV survivors participating in this study were still subject to violence, additional measures were taken to ensure their safety and privacy. In particular, the FGD with GBV survivors was conducted in a secure location at least 10 kilometres away from the rural communities of the survivors. The FGD was also conducted during business hours to ensure that the perpetrators would be less likely to discover that the survivors were participating in such a study.

Most of the study participants were not familiar with the concepts of anonymity and confidentiality and with the informed consent process. Therefore, these concepts were introduced when soliciting participants and at the beginning of interviews. Due to cultural differences and language barriers, some interviewees became uncomfortable and sometimes defensive when the concepts were being explained. It seems that the process of going through these ethical considerations and asking for consent was unfamiliar to the participants, who perceived it as being overly formal. This situation affected the level of comfort and confidence of the study participants at the beginning of the interview. Once the consent process was completed, the informants relaxed and actively participated in the interviews or discussions. Methodology 18 3.5.3. Risks and benefits Due to the nature of GBV, discussions may bring up sensitive issues that could be upsetting to participants or subject them to re-traumatization. Participants were, thus, informed that they could ask for the interview to be rescheduled or restarted after a break, or to withdraw completely from the study. No participants opted out of the interview or discussion and most participants found comfort in talking about their experiences and appreciated being given a voice. Indeed, volunteers expressed strong appreciation for the opportunity to talk about the challenges and needs they face in their work; most of them were very talkative and provided many details about their work. GBV survivors were also eager to talk about their difficulties at home and needed only minimal encouragement to begin sharing details of the abuse they suffered at the hands of their husbands. They talked openly and offered many details of their situations, not only to the research team but also to the group in general, or to the person sitting next to them. Having the opportunity to talk openly about one\u2019s experience of abuse with other women going through similar situations was beneficial. All potential participants and organizations were also informed that there were no direct or immediate benefits to them from their participation in the study, but that they could benefit indirectly from their participation, as the information given could be used by organizations, agencies and the government to design and implement better programmes and services. After the interviews and FGDs, participants were given a cap to thank them for their involvement in the study. An added benefit that emerged during data collection was the participants\u2019 appreciation of the opportunity to share their experiences. Finally, study participants also appreciated the participatory forum, being informed about study findings, and being given the opportunity to provide input and shape the final report and recommendations. When transport was required to any study activities, the research team provided compensation. 3.6. Data analysis To analyze the data, the research team compiled all the notes from the data collection process and identified common themes, unexpected results and unique issues. The use of several data sources and different data collection methods ensured more reliability in the interpretation of the data. Study participants from each organization were invited to a participatory forum where the research team presented their preliminary findings for validation. The forum participants provided feedback on the findings and made suggestions for new directions and recommendations. This feedback was incorporated in the analysis in this final report. 3.7. Limitations While every effort was made to overcome difficulties, the present study came across several limitations: \u2022\ufffd Language: Language was the one major barrier in the implementation of this study, and one that could not be thoroughly addressed due to limited resources. Simultaneous translation during the interviews and FGDs was not sufficient to capture all that was said and may have missed secondary meanings, messages and innuendos. The multiple consequences of this limitation must be kept in mind at all times when assessing the implementation, findings, and analysis in this study. \u2022\ufffd Key informants: While key informants provide general insight into volunteer interventions on GBV by certain local NGOs, the methodology of this study does not allow for the findings to reflect the whole situation of volunteer interventions on GBV in Cambodia. Methodology 19 4. Findings 4.1. Typology of volunteers working on GBV The study revealed three distinct groups of volunteers who had different profiles. We have categorised them as community volunteers, office volunteers and international volunteers. The profile of each group is outlined below. 4.1.1. Community volunteers According to the research, \u2018community volunteers\u2019 had the following profile: \u2022\ufffd Literate, but without higher education; \u2022\ufffd Living in the same communities where they", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "072b8440-399d-4b09-a742-e6f62f9d365c": {"__data__": {"id_": "072b8440-399d-4b09-a742-e6f62f9d365c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making a Difference - GBV in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4601b6e641640e3ec93955acd7197aeaa33146a36f39abc53a3b9823d34892c"}}, "hash": "f4601b6e641640e3ec93955acd7197aeaa33146a36f39abc53a3b9823d34892c", "text": "did the volunteer work (usually small communities in rural areas); and \u2022\ufffd Aspiring to become life-long or long-term activists for GBV prevention and response in their communities. Host organizations did not necessarily refer to these volunteers as \u201ccommunity volunteers\u201d but rather identified them with other terms, such as: volunteers in the communities, core group volunteers, Village Volunteers\u2019 Network, Gender Peace Network, Village Health Volunteer, sentinels, activists, or peer educators. However, in essence, all these terms referred to volunteers with the same profile. Profile/requirements of a community volunteer, according to one of the participating NGOs: \u2022\ufffd Be physically fit \u2022\ufffd Can read and write \u2022\ufffd Be dedicated, brave, & friendly \u2022\ufffd Be known & respected by people in the community \u2022\ufffd Be able to communicate with the authorities and other NGOs \u2022\ufffd Be able to solve problems in families \u2022\ufffd Have approval and support from his or her own family \u2022\ufffd Live in a non-DV family \u2022\ufffd Be a resident of the target village An important finding of this study is that community volunteers formed the core of GBV projects in rural areas. Since they volunteered in their own communities where they could be present at all times, community volunteers were known by and knew most of the community members. As a result of the added value of community volunteers (e.g., trust from the community, no living/travel costs for the organization, extensive local knowledge), they formed the foundation for many GBV projects that would otherwise not have been able to cover these rural areas. It is therefore understandable that this type of volunteer was the most common one for GBV assignments. The community volunteers had very similar roles and responsibilities across all seven organizations, usually working on both GBV prevention and response within their communities, and in some cases also on volunteer coordination. For most volunteers, their role was not limited to GBV work, and they were also involved in such activities as HIV/AIDS prevention or health and environmental issues, depending on the NGO\u2019s programme in that location. In effect, community volunteers functioned as representatives of their NGO in those communities. Findings 20 The tasks performed by the community volunteers fit into one or more of the following three areas: \u2022\ufffd GBV Prevention: o Provide information, training and legal information to the communities, mainly in groups but sometimes also from house to house. The most common topics addressed were: gender, DV (DV law, effects of DV, and cycle of violence), marriage certification, rape and sexual abuse, human trafficking, illegal/safe migration, alcohol and drug abuse, health, HIV/AIDS and children\u2019s rights. o Other topics covered by some of the volunteers were: safe abortion, adoption, divorce, family property, economy of the family, employment, human rights, promoting higher education for women, stress, depression, \u201cmorality\u201d (such as the roles of husbands and wives and role of women) and Buddhism. o Build relations with the authorities, to better inform them of GBV prevention and response and strengthen their support for the issue. o Advocate for GBV prevention in public forums and meetings, in cases where volunteers themselves were part of the local authorities (e.g., insert discussions of GBV in formal speeches). o Establish men\u2019s and women\u2019s support groups within the communities. o Participate in/organize campaigns within the communities, such as the White Ribbon Campaign or International Women\u2019s Day. \u2022\ufffd GBV Response: o Act/intervene when a case of GBV occurred by: trying to stop the violence, taking survivors to the hospital or a safe shelter when needed, contacting the local authorities, bringing the perpetrator to the police station in serious cases or making him sign an agreement to stop the violence in other cases. o Provide counselling for women survivors of violence, both in groups and individually, and visit the families to follow up. o Provide counselling for men, both in groups and individually, and visit the families to follow up. The goal of the counselling was to show the perpetrators the negative consequences of their behaviour and try to change it. o Offer referral arrangements to other support systems when needed (such as legal aid, shelter, authorities, or police). o Help survivors access the judicial system, e.g., help them to write complaints or sue the perpetrator. \u2022\ufffd Volunteer Coordination: lead, organize, support and monitor the work of other volunteers. There was one exception to the profile and roles of community volunteers. In one organization, the volunteer work was done in an urban setting mostly by and with university students. These volunteers only worked in GBV prevention, with the same functions mentioned above, and not in GBV response.

Reasons to become a community volunteer: When asked why they decided to become volunteers Findings 21 in a GBV assignment, most community volunteers stated that they wanted to contribute to their communities and to develop their own capacity and gain experience. A few volunteers were also aware of gender inequalities and GBV problems in their communities and wanted to contribute to social change. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see domestic violence cases in my commune. There are a lot of problems of gender inequality and nobody was working for it here\u201d- male community volunteer \u201cTraditionally men were family leaders and I wanted to change this thinking\u201d- female community volunteer Some women survivors of GBV decided to become volunteers because they wanted to learn more about the topic and prevent similar incidents of violence happening to other women. \u201cBefore, my husband abused me so I wanted to learn about domestic violence to stop the violence within my own family\u201d \u2013 female community volunteer The conditions of service varied from one organization to another, but they mostly covered: training on gender and other topics, travel allowance when needed, sometimes a small monthly allowance, phone allowance and, in a few cases, health insurance. Most of the volunteers did not have an established schedule, instead they worked on an ad hoc basis when the incidents of violence occurred (response) and when they carried out planned trainings/visits per month (prevention). Most of the organizations had a monitoring system in place to coordinate and evaluate the work of community volunteers, which usually consisted of regular meetings between volunteers and staff and submission of reports. The volunteer recruitment process was also similar among the organizations. The NGO staff would usually conduct informal surveys in different communities and select the most active, sensitized and motivated people. Usually they try to involve the local authorities in this process. Sometimes, volunteers are even selected by the community. \u201cThe project staff conducts a needs assessment in the communities and study who are the people interested in GBV. They see it through participation in awareness raising activities, or because sometimes these people are survivors and sometimes local authorities\u201d \u2013 NGO staff GBV survivors came in contact with community volunteers more often than with NGO workers or any other type of volunteers, because of their permanent presence in the community. Therefore the understanding of survivors about who volunteers were tended to reflect the profile of community volunteers. When asked about who they considered to be volunteers, GBV survivors answered the following: \u201cPeople working for an organization who help with problems about DV or when people are going to divorce\u201d \u2013 GBV survivor \u201cVolunteers want to help me to have a happy family\u201d \u2013 GBV survivor \u201cPeople who help with happiness in the family and improve living standards\u201d \u2013 GBV survivor \u201cPeople who help to avoid fights\u201d \u2013 GBV survivor 4.1.2. Office volunteers Depending on the host organization, office volunteers were also referred to as national interns or student volunteers. They have a common profile in that they are usually university students who work for the NGO for several months. Their roles and responsibilities consist of providing support to project staff, with a focus on administrative and financial functions. Reasons for volunteering: Office volunteers stated that they volunteered because they wanted to Findings 22 contribute to their communities and also to build their own capacity and gain experience so it would be easier for them to find a job. One of them was also aware of gender inequalities and GBV problems and wanted to contribute to social change. \u201cI wanted to get experience so I could get a job afterwards\u201d \u2013 female office volunteer \u201cWhen I observe what\u2019s happening in the society through newspapers, TV, etc., I realize that there are a lot of problems related to domestic violence (\u2026) so I wanted to do something about it\u201d \u2013 male office volunteer The conditions of service varied from one organization to another, but they mostly tended to cover training on gender and other issues; travel allowance when needed; and a small monthly allowance. Office volunteers had an established schedule and usually worked from 20 to 40 hours per week. Regarding the recruitment process, the organization usually post an advertisement and people interested have to apply to a specific department or position and pass an interview and a written test.

International volunteers1 Most of the organizations used international volunteers in a random and ad hoc way, based on the skills and interests of the person who contacted them expressing interest in volunteering with the organization. Therefore, the profiles of international volunteers were quite diverse, from young people on holidays or fresh graduates who wanted to have a first professional experience, to expatriate senior professionals who wanted to contribute their expertise. The roles and responsibilities differed from one volunteer to another, depending on the skills and experience of the respective person: communications, fundraising, writing reports, graphic design and English teaching. The wide range of roles reflects the ad hoc nature of international volunteer recruitment; taken as a whole, it also illustrates a certain set of skills that, while needed, may not be as well developed among Cambodian NGOs. Several NGOs were specific in identifying their need or desire for more international volunteers/staff with particular skills to provide support with programme management, reporting, and fundraising. Interestingly, these were the same NGOs that already worked with international volunteers, suggesting that the ad hoc nature of international volunteer recruitment might help meet the needs of the volunteers more than those of the NGOs, and possibly even put undue burden on the Cambodian NGOs. For instance, short-term volunteers require resources and support from the NGOs for their orientation and training. This investment in time and resources by the NGOs is often not worthwhile or returned in benefits from the volunteers\u2019 contributions. It is possible that the NGOs do not feel that they can be too selective about the international volunteers, or that they do not have the knowledge, skills, and resources to dedicate to more strict international volunteer recruitment. The conditions of service varied from one organization to another. Two organizations used to have arrangements with an international Volunteer Involving Organization (VIO), which was the one that provided support to the volunteers (living allowance, transportation, and visa). The rest of the organizations tended to just cover travel allowance when needed. Their work was usually monitored by the head of the section where they were assigned. 1 As no international volunteers were available to participate in this study, this information is based on interviews with NGO staff. For this reason, this profile does not include the motivation of international volunteers for becoming involved with GBV interventions. Findings 23 Overall, this study has identified three types of volunteer profiles. It must be noted that these profiles are constructed by the research team and were not necessarily perceived as such by the volunteers or NGOs themselves. Also, the community and office volunteer profiles may overlap at times as volunteers take on different roles and responsibilities. The following section discusses the findings of the interviews with the NGO staff, volunteers and GBV survivors. 4.2. Findings 4.2.1. Prevalence of volunteer interventions on GBV The interviews and FGDs suggest that community volunteers are essential for NGO programmes and allow the NGOs to reach remote areas, university campuses and every setting in between. As the primary staff for implementing the organizations\u2019 projects, all GBV prevention and response activities in local communities depend on volunteers. Indeed, volunteers serve as focal points of the NGOs at the community, village, and, sometimes, district level. \u201c[Volunteers] live in the communities and can provide immediate assistance to the community. A lot of the cases wouldn\u2019t be attended if it weren\u2019t for these volunteers\u201d \u2013 NGO staff \u201cWe can\u2019t work without them [volunteers]\u201d \u2013 NGO staff Typically, NGOs depend on volunteers to access local communities. When NGOs begin an intervention programme in a certain area, the NGO staff select volunteer(s) to implement the project, as explained in the typology section (Section 4.1). The NGOs provide training to the volunteers, who then start their work in the local communities, usually beginning with GBV prevention activities and providing information to raise awareness about GBV. As the work of the volunteers becomes more established in the community, the volunteers grow to be the contact point for GBV response. 4.2.2. Satisfaction with volunteerism Overall, the qualitative research conducted for this study has found that volunteers, organizations and survivors of violence were generally satisfied with the GBV work of the volunteers. The main satisfactions mentioned by the volunteers were: \u2022\ufffd Impact on the communities One of the main gratifications for all volunteers interviewed was to see the change that their work had produced. Volunteers received gratification from and were motivated by seeing the impact of their work in the community, whether on individuals or the community at large. \u201cI\u2019m happy when I see men stop drinking", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6bc3a853-8e9c-486c-8e9c-af88590a234d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6bc3a853-8e9c-486c-8e9c-af88590a234d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making a Difference - GBV in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5ad0585f40f380528347d8da8df42c44b0dc981a0e742d5e7e2fdab26810b83"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c5827da-2096-4e1a-bd64-79c383728d80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "caaac133330c18d2146f3b397bbcf4a93b70d5843f9eefaf41786abeeced37e2"}}, "hash": "135f55e105ddf3fe70f70c924588b049230da3ff8c5e2b2fcd39388a7c2b466e", "text": "and stop violence\u201d \u2013 female community volunteer \u201cI\u2019m happy when I can get people to understand about bad people who try to take their daughters away.

In particular, the knowledge gained about laws and procedures seemed to be well-appreciated among the volunteers. \u201cI could only finish primary school, but with this job I have learnt a lot\u201d \u2013 female community volunteer \u201cI\u2019ve learnt about women\u2019s rights, that I have rights and can advocate for them\u201d \u2013 female community volunteer \u2022\ufffd Self-development Experiencing what they perceived as self-growth through their work provided strong satisfaction to the volunteers. This particular reason for work satisfaction went beyond the increased experience and knowledge mentioned above, and reflected a positive change in how the volunteers saw and felt about themselves and their place in their families and communities. \u201cIt has been an opportunity for me to advocate and prevent violence; before I needed to follow the village chief, now I\u2019m more independent\u201d \u2013 female community volunteer \u201cUsually a nuns\u00b4 work is to study Buddhism and to serve monks in the pagoda. With this work, I can do much more\u201d \u2013 female community volunteer When speaking of self-growth, the interrelated themes of independence, self-confidence and empowerment emerged as particularly important indicators of work satisfaction for the female volunteers. \u201cI am brave now\u201d - female community volunteer In the participatory forum conducted to validate the preliminary findings, participants gave concrete examples of how the experience of volunteering empowered them and improved their self-esteem: \u2022\ufffd By gaining more knowledge and changing some incorrect concepts they had about gender, migration, DV as a family issue and so on. \u2022\ufffd By becoming more confident and brave, being able to share their ideas in public with the community. \u2022\ufffd By receiving value and respect from their families, their communities and the authorities and by becoming a person that the community can count on when there are problems. Some volunteers have been promoted to be members of the village or commune council. In the FGD, the main satisfactions that the survivors mentioned were that they were comforted by the volunteers, and that volunteers were people from their own communities who could be trusted. Also, because the volunteers were living in the community, survivors could request their help at any time. The FGD with the survivors implied that volunteers brought added value to GBV interventions as they lived in the community, understood their situation better, and worked for non-profit purposes. \u201c[I can request help] even during the weekends and at night time\u201d \u2013 GBV survivor \u201cThe volunteers feel more pity for me than the regular staff of the NGO\u201d \u2013 GBV survivor \u201cIt\u2019s good [to use volunteers] because the volunteers are people from the village who live in the village and Findings 25 know the real situation\u201d \u2013 GBV survivor \u201cI feel their warmth, I trust them\u201d \u2013 GBV survivor \u201cI know I can go and talk to them and they will support me\u201d \u2013 GBV survivor In the interviews, staff from the organizations suggested that they were satisfied with the work of volunteers because it substantially improved the coverage, impact and sustainability of their community programmes.

Discussions with NGO informants about international volunteers focused more on the skills that they could contribute to the organization. For instance, NGO staff suggested that international volunteers could easily provide technical support for certain issues, such as English language training, grant proposal writing and fundraising, computer training, website construction, and graphic design. 4.2.3. Challenges to volunteerism The volunteers faced very similar difficulties and challenges across all the organizations. We categorized the difficulties identified by the volunteers into the following: \u2022\ufffd Lack of support from the community Most of the volunteers suffered at the beginning of their assignments due to a lack of understanding from within their own communities of the work they were doing, which varied from disrespect to more serious cases of curses and threats. The belief that domestic violence is a private family issue is still deeply rooted in Cambodian society and this affects volunteers\u2019 work. However, most of the volunteers also said that they overcame this difficulty after proving to the community that they were able to do a good job. In fact, not only did they overcome Findings 26 this difficulty, but they turned it into one of their main gratifications: gaining respect and recognition from the community. \u201cWhen I first started people looked down on me because people believe DV is a family issue, they cursed me. But later on, it changed when they saw that I was helping the victims\u201d - male community volunteer \u201cI received curses and threats from perpetrators when I started, but later on, when I started to work with the authorities, people treated me better and respected me\u201d \u2013 female community volunteer \u2022\ufffd Working with the authorities Many of the community volunteers found it difficult to work with local authorities, such as judges, police or village chiefs, because of corruption and lack of cooperation. \u201cBased on Cambodian Law, people can work only when they are 18, but some people go to the authority and change their birth certificates\u201d - female community volunteer, referring to cases of human trafficking Even in cases where corruption was not mentioned as a problem, cooperation with authorities still remained a concern due to lack of respect for the volunteers\u2019 voices and knowledge. This was particularly difficult for female volunteers. \u201cThe authorities always listen to men first\u201d \u2013 female community volunteer This experience suggests ongoing challenges for female volunteers who have to deal with gender stereotypes in addition to advocating with local authorities to prioritize the issue of GBV. \u2022\ufffd Limited impact In contrast to one of the other main findings of this study, many of the volunteers felt frustrated when faced with lack of results from their interventions, sometimes despite repeated efforts. \u201cThere are no changes in the perpetrators after I talked to them many times\u201d \u2013 male community volunteer Community volunteers found it particularly difficult to deal with drunken men, as it was much more difficult to have positive results from interventions in these cases (see the Safety category below for further discussion on this). Volunteers were also frustrated when they could not intervene because the families hid their real situation due to embarrassment, e.g., women suffering from violence from their husbands or families sending their under-age children to work overseas. These frustrations would then result in reduced motivation and likely affected the volunteers\u2019 involvement in their work, as well. Indeed, in the FGD, the survivors emphasized how, despite volunteer interventions, the violence had not stopped, though in many cases it had been reduced. \u2022\ufffd Lack of experience and capacity Another main concern of the volunteers was their self-perceived lack of knowledge, skills and experience. In some situations they felt insecure about how to solve some difficult situations, answer questions (particularly about the law), or offer counselling and advice to survivors. Findings 27 \u201cSometimes the community asks for help but I don\u2019t know how to do it\u201d \u2013 female community volunteer A particular difficulty identified by volunteers was dealing with people from different ethnic, religious, class or age groups. Volunteers found it difficult to make themselves understood or found communication difficult because of barriers like language and traditions. \u201cI cannot talk to the rich perpetrators because of my", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06be294e-2281-4add-9ff6-d444385c55a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "06be294e-2281-4add-9ff6-d444385c55a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making a Difference - GBV in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fc575d89812eb0d50de7f0d6f81c05a51754dba00db9935436df171593f0f16"}}, "hash": "0fc575d89812eb0d50de7f0d6f81c05a51754dba00db9935436df171593f0f16", "text": "economic status\u201d \u2013 female community volunteer \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me as a young person to talk to older people\u201d \u2013 male University-community volunteer \u2022\ufffd Safety In the interviews and the FGD, community volunteers, particularly the women, stated that they feared for their own safety especially when acts of GBV occurred at night, when the perpetrators had weapons, and when the perpetrators threatened the volunteers. Dealing with perpetrators who were drunk was particularly difficult, because the men became very aggressive and the volunteers feared for their safety and did not know how to intervene. Some volunteers and survivors said that sometimes even the police, whom they might have otherwise turned to, were afraid in such cases: \u201cSometimes, the husband uses a knife or wants to set fire to the house, so the police are also afraid\u201d \u2013 female community volunteer \u201cWhen my husband is drunk there is nothing the volunteer can do\u201d \u2013 GBV survivor \u2022\ufffd Lack of resources Most of the volunteers talked about transport during their work as one of their main preoccupations: the bad conditions of the roads in general and especially in the rainy season, the lack of means of transport, or the long distances they had to cover. The most immediate and frustrating impact of these barriers occurred when an urgent action was required, such as taking the survivor of violence to a clinic or to a shelter. The organizations mentioned as well the lack of resources as a difficulty for the volunteers to accomplish their work. Some of the diverse resources mentioned were: hard copy of the DV law, documents and training materials, electronic equipment such as a photo camera or a recorder, raincoats and an office. \u2022\ufffd Work load and income Some volunteers found it difficult to combine their personal obligations such as income generating work or religious obligations with their volunteer work. They would have liked to receive a living allowance to be able to dedicate more time to their volunteer work. The organizations also mentioned a few challenges of working with volunteers, of which the one mentioned by most referred to the lack of power of persuasion that NGOs had with the volunteers. \u201cYou cannot push the volunteers the way you push staff\u201d \u2013 NGO staff Another challenge: \u201cSome [volunteers] quit the job because they don\u2019t see benefits. [The organization] has already wasted time and money to provide them training\u201d \u2013 NGO staff Findings 28 The other challenge mentioned referred to the lack of language skills of international volunteers, who could only communicate in English and thus put a burden on NGO staff that then had to provide translation or interpretation assistance. Interviews with the organizations also found that, while the organizations recognized the work of the volunteers to some extent, they did not necessarily appreciate the full value added of the volunteers\u2019 work. For instance, none of the participant organizations have studied the impact of the volunteers\u2019 work. The most that the organizations had done was include a small paragraph in some of their reports. The survivors did not have any comments on the challenges of working with volunteers, or at least no comments reflecting on the work of the volunteers themselves. When asked about difficulties in working with volunteers, the survivors did not provide any substantial responses, and the only relevant comment that some survivors made came from a different question. In particular, survivors suggested that when their husband was drunk, there was nothing a volunteer (or an NGO staff) could do. 4.2.4. Gaps in support to volunteers When asked directly, all the volunteers said that they were content with the level of support provided by their organization. Nevertheless, when asked if they would need anything else from the organization, they all had requests. Interestingly, the needs identified by the volunteers, the organizations and the survivors were all very similar, with capacity building and financial support emerging as the two major themes. The organizations also identified the difficulty of finding qualified people for staff and volunteer positions, the low capacity of existing staff and volunteers, and the need for technical support, including training on volunteer management. Volunteers\u2019 needs were very similar across the organizations: \u2022\ufffd Training All the volunteers who participated in this study identified the need for more training. Some of them were very specific about what they needed, and others thought they needed more knowledge in general. The topics identified by most volunteers were counselling, gender, DV law and procedures, other relevant laws, GBV, leadership and children rights.

Therefore, since the structural factors that facilitate GBV (poverty, illiteracy, HIV/AIDS, social trauma, patriarchy, sexism, traditional gender roles, etc.) remain largely unchanged no matter how many individual cases reflect change, it is unavoidable that volunteers would at times get discouraged, particularly when there is no visible community/society-wide accompanying action addressing the root causes of GBV. Findings 29 This may have undermined the volunteers\u2019 self-confidence and belief in their work, as exemplified by the fact that most of them identified the need for more training. As most of the training the volunteers received seemed to be limited in length, frequency, content and scope, it is probably true that most of them would benefit from additional training. However, their self-identified need may also indicate that volunteers blame themselves or their lack of skills when they cannot \u2018solve\u2019 certain situations. This not only points to the need for structural reforms, development, and society-wide anti-GBV campaigns to accompany community-based interventions, but also to the need to provide continuous support to the volunteers to maintain their well being and their motivation. This need is also reflected in the fact that some volunteers mentioned the desire for a network of volunteers (more below) \u2013 such a network would go a long way to support the volunteers in their work even if only by offering a space for them to share similar experiences, frustrations, and achievements. It should also be noted that it seems that the relationship of community volunteers with the survivors and perpetrators goes a long way to compensate for lack of specialized skills. Perceived as legitimate GBV focal points, the community volunteers already have the trust of the community members and do not need to prove themselves as much. This foundation could be further strengthened with adequate training and experience. \u2022\ufffd Financial support All volunteers agreed that the financial support they received from their organizations was not sufficient. Office volunteers found it difficult to dedicate their time to unpaid work because all of them were also full time students and that left very little time in their schedules for income generating work to support themselves. Community volunteers faced the same dilemma of balancing their volunteer work with the need to support themselves and their families. Aside from the need for a living allowance, they also had more specific needs directly related to their GBV work, such as support for transportation (e.g., monthly transport allowance, a bicycle or a motorbike) and for various materials (e.g., printed materials, raincoats). The survivors also mentioned that volunteers needed more support, particularly for transportation. This was mirrored by acknowledgment from the organizations that they should provide more financial support to the volunteers. \u201cIncrease monthly allowance\u201d \u2013 female community volunteer \u201cA bicycle\u201d \u2013 male community volunteer \u201c[Volunteers] need financial support for them and their activities\u201d - NGO staff \u201cOrganizations should give more money to the volunteers so they are more active and more motivated\u201d \u2013 GBV survivor \u2022\ufffd Safety More volunteers than organizations identified safety as one of the main needs of support. Volunteers would like more support from the local authorities and the organizations in this area (for instance, when they have to travel to remote areas). \u201cSometimes I have to travel to remote areas and I feel insecure. I would like more support from the authorities\u201d \u2013 female community volunteer Female community volunteers were concerned about travelling at night, especially when they did not have their own means of transport, and in places where road quality was not very good. When discussing their safety concerns about dealing with violent cases or with men who were drunk and aggressive, volunteers talked about the need for training on how Findings 30 to deal with such cases. \u2022\ufffd Psychosocial support None of the volunteers", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "480c8d0a-8855-4951-b7a7-9ccc9c9b0ebc": {"__data__": {"id_": "480c8d0a-8855-4951-b7a7-9ccc9c9b0ebc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making a Difference - GBV in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "08caf73625e54163004833055bf8c75f7afd064539e0e6a4f31a6d65a27f1dcb"}}, "hash": "08caf73625e54163004833055bf8c75f7afd064539e0e6a4f31a6d65a27f1dcb", "text": "interviewed received psychosocial support from their NGOs. Most community volunteers were involved in cases of DV, which means that they must, in some form or another and to varying degrees, have been affected by vicarious trauma1 , compassion fatigue or burn out. This is not mentioned directly by either the volunteers or the NGOs themselves, though it might be mentioned indirectly when volunteers identify their need for more training, or frustration with lack of impact. This is possibly a reflection of the normalization of VAW and GBV in Cambodia, which in turn may normalize and minimize vicarious trauma and therefore render it less visible. Making it less visible would not lessen its impact, however, but rather it would make it harder to identify and address. The question arises, then, of how this would affect volunteers\u2019 ability to engage in their work. In the participatory forum, the volunteers called for more \u201ctraining on psychology\u201d (with such topics as self-esteem, knowing oneself, and emotion management), but emphasized the need for capacity training and other benefits, such as leadership training, communication skills, counselling, GBV, support and motivation, monthly allowance, transportation, materials, and health insurance. \u2022\ufffd Networking Some volunteers expressed their interest in meeting with other volunteers and NGOs working on GBV. \u201c[I would like to] participate and meet with other NGOs working on GBV\u201d \u2013 male community volunteer When asked directly if a network of volunteers would be useful, all the organizations and volunteers said yes. The reasons they gave were: in order to share information, knowledge, experience, ideas, difficulties, successes and so on. Apart from that, during the interviews volunteers expressed appreciation for the opportunity to talk about the challenges and needs they faced in their work. Although this may not be enough to draw any conclusions, it does suggest that volunteers may have limited opportunities inside and outside of their organizations to provide this kind of input. This exclusion may make the volunteers feel isolated, not appreciated or ignored, which may explain the suggestion for a volunteer network. 4.2.5. Volunteers\u2019 understanding of gender and/or GBV The knowledge of the volunteers on gender issues was highlighted as a difficulty and a need by the volunteers, the survivors, the organizations and the research team. All volunteers received some form of training from their NGOs, with most training sessions averaging 3 days in length, none longer than 5 days, and a few shorter. Most training sessions were given only once, with only one volunteer mentioning repeat training sessions. In terms of topics, the majority of trainings focused 1 Vicarious Trauma is defined by the Vicarious Trauma Institute (http://www.vicarioustrauma.com/index.html) as a transformation in the helper\u2019s inner sense of identity and existence that results from utilizing controlled empathy when listening to clients\u2019 trauma-content narratives. In other words, Vicarious Trauma is what happens to your neurological (or cognitive), physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual health when you listen to traumatic stories day after day or respond to traumatic situations while having to control your reaction Findings 31 on gender and/or DV and the DV law. Other topics mentioned included human trafficking, marriage certification, monogamy law, rights-based approach, CEDAW, counselling skills, conflict resolution, and VAW. The interviews and FGDs allow for better insight into the range of understanding on gender issues that exists among volunteers. One salient point repeated by the study participants was the need to give or receive help \u201cto have a happy family\u201d and support the family unit. Study participants generally perceived divorce to be a worse option for abused women than \u201crehabilitating\u201d the abuser and maintaining the family unit. \u201cThe volunteer gave counselling for my husband and me when I wanted to divorce. The NGO talked to us about the difficulties and effects of the divorce for the family and children\u201d \u2013 GBV survivor \u201cI wanted to see a positive change: families suffering from DV becoming happy families\u201d \u2013 female community volunteer Using the example of divorce, we found that some volunteers would discourage survivors from this option, and instead focus their efforts on keeping the family together. Volunteers perceived that life for divorced women is extremely harsh, with numerous insurmountable barriers such as lack of property, lack of employment, social stigma, etc. These beliefs and actions by the volunteers may be a direct reflection of their lack of understanding of gender issues and DV. For instance, it suggests that volunteers hold and promote traditional roles of men as heads of families and of women as having responsibility for the home. The volunteers\u2019 training \u2013 or lack of training \u2013 on gender issues could be an important factor affecting these beliefs.

That being said, it is also important to note that such beliefs are not entirely without basis. In reality, life for divorced women in Cambodia would be quite difficult in terms of social stigma, housing, community support, employment, and so forth. The rigid and traditional gender roles reinforced to different degrees by all research participants are also reflected in societal structures that are not supportive of women moving away from the family unit, challenging the authority of a man/husband, or exposing \u2018private\u2019 matters to the community. Providing more training on gender concepts would be only one small step of the many needed to change those structures. 4.2.6. Relevance of volunteers\u2019 sex on GBV interventions \u201cYes, women don\u2019t trust men, they prefer to talk to women and men prefer to help men. It\u2019s difficult for me as a man to talk to women because their husbands might feel jealous and I can cause trouble to women\u201d - male community volunteer \u201cWomen talk better to women. Female victims won\u2019t feel comfortable talking to male volunteers. Women are better at talking to other people. Some male are not willing to listen to women\u201d - female community volunteer \u201cThe important thing is what they can actually do, their abilities, not their sex\u201d \u2013 young office female volunteer The volunteers and organizations were asked if they thought that the sex (male/female) of volunteers was relevant to the work they did on GBV issues. With very few exceptions, volunteers and organizations agreed that work was easier and more effective when the volunteer was of the same sex as the person they were engaging with, i.e., men volunteers working with men (usually perpetrators, but also authorities), and female volunteers working with female survivors. The reasons Findings 32 given for this were mostly focused on male volunteers working with female survivors, which was seen as \u201cdifficult\u201d because of perceived mistrust of men by survivors, because of men\u2019s \u201cunwillingness to listen\u201d, and because it was not considered appropriate. Thus even from this very small group one can start to see a clear division along gender lines of the kind of work volunteers do. While not always the case, male and female volunteers continue to perceive, act, and reinforce male and female stereotypical roles. The female volunteers are better at talking to women, because \u201cthey talk better\u201d and \u201care better at talking to other people,\u201d because the survivors do not trust men, and because if the volunteer were male the woman\u2019s husband \u201cmight get jealous\u201d. The male volunteers are better at talking to men, because they can discuss issues with other men and are not concerned about safety in the same way as women. Interestingly, this also included dealing with the authorities, who \u201clisten to men first\u201d, and therefore it is better and more effective if male volunteers approach the authorities. Thus, it seems that stereotypical gender roles tend to be reinforced to varying degrees by all stakeholders, including female survivors, male perpetrators, local authorities, the volunteers, community members, and organization staff. A number of questions/issues arise from this conclusion: \u2022\ufffd Since the people the volunteers work with, both men and women, themselves tend to hold rather traditional gender roles, what kind of volunteer work would be most helpful and effective? From all the responses it seems clear that a male volunteer would be severely limited in his ability to help a female survivor. However, the question must also be asked, if the male volunteer had a different understanding of gender that transcended traditional boundaries, would that not be beneficial in their work, including for female survivors he might be working with? \u2022\ufffd Again, what kind of understanding of gender and GBV do the volunteers have, and how is it being changed, challenged, reinforced, or altered by the trainings they receive? This also raises the question of monitoring and feedback \u2013 do NGOs observe and monitor volunteers\u2019 work, provide feedback and direction, assess activities, and how thorough is the monitoring, what does it look at? Findings 33 5.1. Conclusions This study\u2019s findings represent a step forward in better understanding the work being carried out by volunteers on GBV prevention and response in Cambodia. The primary objective of this study is to analyze interventions where volunteerism played or is playing a role in the prevention of and response to GBV in Cambodia. Drawing on consultations with major stakeholders, including volunteers, NGOs and survivors, this study aims to inform and strengthen future volunteer interventions to respond to and prevent GBV. The study produced a typology of volunteer", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7f3e0d5-ddb4-4741-8353-fc18a9ba0c24": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7f3e0d5-ddb4-4741-8353-fc18a9ba0c24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making a Difference - GBV in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0eaa40273fc99fe1d33e3255b97428cd7ffe7f789b40b8072a6d9b6a471450d9"}}, "hash": "0eaa40273fc99fe1d33e3255b97428cd7ffe7f789b40b8072a6d9b6a471450d9", "text": "profiles working on GBV prevention and response and provided a detailed analysis of volunteer interventions in addressing GBV, a framework of the success and challenges of volunteerism on GBV. The recommendations section below provides an assessment of where development partners, such as UNV Cambodia and Partners for Prevention, could direct their efforts for mainstreaming volunteerism in GBV interventions. The work being carried out by volunteers on GBV prevention and response is far-reaching across Cambodian society. Without them, the civil society and development partners could not reach most of the rural areas that the volunteers are covering with their interventions. The work of the community volunteers is particularly remarkable: by using volunteers in their projects, NGOs are building their capacity in a sustainable manner. As a result, people living in local communities will have a greater understanding of GBV issues which can have a multiplier effect on the impact on GBV prevention and response work, as more and more people learn about GBV. The findings also suggest that since volunteers live in the communities where they work, they become legitimate focal points for the local community and survivors come to trust them and reach out to them. This means that volunteers provide added value to GBV interventions beyond what regular NGO staff can do. Overall, volunteers, organizations and survivors of violence were satisfied with the work of the volunteers in GBV work. In particular, volunteers found satisfaction with/from the experience and knowledge that they gained and from seeing the impact of their work in their communities. Nevertheless, they all face challenges such as fear for their own safety, lack of experience and capacity, initial lack of support from communities and communication difficulties with the authorities. Interviews and FGDs have found that there are numerous gaps in the support to volunteers, such as training, financial support, safety, psychological support and networking. These gaps in support may contribute to the volunteers\u2019 limited understanding on gender issues. With very few exceptions, volunteers and organizations agreed that work was easier and more effective when the volunteer was of the same sex as the person with whom they were engaging. It seems that traditional gender roles tend to be reinforced to varying degrees by all stakeholders, including women survivors, male perpetrators, local authorities, the volunteers themselves, community members, and organization staff. While the results illustrate the successes and challenges of volunteer interventions on GBV, the findings also highlight possible entry points for NGOs and development partners to strengthen these interventions and ultimately contribute to preventing GBV and promoting gender equality. 5.2. Recommendations The following recommendations have been grouped into 4 main areas: 5.2.1. NGOs \u2022\ufffd Recognize the value of volunteerism in GBV work This study has provided preliminary evidence that volunteers carry out the bulk of the NGOs\u2019 work in the field yet the NGOs typically do not fully acknowledge the heavy burdens that 5. Conclusion Conclusion 34 the volunteers carry and the extent of their GBV work. \u00bb NGOs should include assessments of the volunteers\u2019 work in all organizational reports and materials and publicly document and highlight the volunteers\u2019 contributions and efforts. \u00bb NGOs that do not currently engage volunteers in their GBV interventions could assess the potential use of volunteers in their organization\u2019s work. This assessment would provide a baseline that could then be used by the NGOs in the strategic planning of their programmes. \u2022\ufffd Invest in the work of the volunteers Given the far-reaching effect of volunteers working on GBV and the amount of work that they carry out on behalf of the organizations, the NGOs should prioritize the work of the volunteers and allocate more resources to facilitate their work. For instance, NGOs can improve the conditions of service by responding to the needs of their volunteers. Conducting a survey of the challenges and gaps in support of the volunteers\u2019 work could help the NGOs better understand their situation. As the volunteers implement the programmes of the NGOs, it would only be of benefit to the NGOs to invest in their volunteers. Ultimately, the NGOs are responsible for the physical and psychological well-being of the volunteers and the work that they carry out. \u00bb At the very least, every effort should be made to ensure the volunteers\u2019 safety. \u00bb NGOs should invest in the volunteers by responding to the needs of the volunteers with special attention to building their capacities and facilitating their work. \u00bb NGOs should provide sufficient psychological support to their volunteers. \u2022\ufffd Provide adequate training to volunteers Survivors, volunteers and NGO staff all identified training as one of the main needs of the volunteers. While the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "594afcf6-0611-4e92-b2eb-cafa6cf89e64": {"__data__": {"id_": "594afcf6-0611-4e92-b2eb-cafa6cf89e64", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making a Difference - GBV in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cdbc1531d7d196c819234873de8087611902044f85bfe04b21d7f2bc32e92f36"}}, "hash": "cdbc1531d7d196c819234873de8087611902044f85bfe04b21d7f2bc32e92f36", "text": "NGOs themselves may be limited in their capacity to offer comprehensive training sessions, this should nonetheless be prioritized over other needs. This study has found that volunteers are primary focal points of the NGOs at the community- village level, and, depending on their training, they might sometimes do more harm than good. For instance, while representing the NGO, the volunteers could contribute to perpetuating stereotypical gender roles and gender inequality. NGOs should thus provide adequate training to their volunteers. \u00bb NGOs should pool their resources to cooperate and develop initial and ongoing training standards and consider conducting joint training sessions to improve the volunteers\u2019 skills and knowledge of gender issues. Joint trainings would also provide opportunities for volunteers to interact across organizations. \u00bb NGOs should take advantage of existing training sessions and resources that are currently available through UN agencies and other development partners. \u00bb NGOs should investigate both the content and format of current training sessions. This will provide a better understanding of how the concepts of gender and GBV are understood by the volunteers. Conclusion 35 \u2022\ufffd Address volunteers\u2019 limited understanding of gender issues The findings suggest that the majority of volunteers perpetuate stereotypical gender roles, e.g., women talk to women, and men talk to men. Furthermore, when dealing with the authorities, volunteers found that they \u201clisten to men first\u201d. \u2022\ufffd NGOs should promote volunteers working in mixed-sex teams (i.e., one man and one woman per team) so they can break these gender stereotypes. \u2022\ufffd NGOs should address gender roles and gender equality in the training sessions. \u2022\ufffd Use volunteerism as a tool to strengthen the community as a whole The interviews and FGDs with the volunteers have found that the volunteers, especially women, felt that their volunteering on GBV issues had contributed to their self-growth and development. The volunteers learned more about human rights and became focal points for GBV issues in their community. This responsibility further empowered the volunteers within their own communities. By taking into account these positive effects of volunteering, NGOs could use it more purposefully as a tool to build women\u2019s capacities and improve their self- esteem. \u00bb NGOs should assess what the use of volunteers could contribute to other programmes and act on those assessments. \u2022\ufffd Participate in training to strengthen NGO skills on volunteer management During the interviews, several NGOs identified the need for receiving volunteer management training to improve their knowledge on the issue and better coordinate their volunteer programmes. \u00bb NGOs should initiate, plan and/or participate in training to strengthen their management of volunteers, including topics such as recruitment, training, programmes, monitoring and evaluation and performance assessment. \u2022\ufffd Create a network of volunteers working on GBV Interviews with both volunteers and NGO staff found that the creation of a volunteer network to connect volunteers working on GBV from all over the country would be useful for sharing information, knowledge, best practices, ideas, challenges, successes and so on. The network could be used as a support system as well. \u00bb NGOs should promote the creation of a network of volunteers working on GBV to provide a support system for their work. 5.2.2. The UN system \u2022\ufffd Recognize the value of volunteerism in GBV work Given the extensive work conducted by volunteers, the UN family and other development partners should recognize the amount and value of work being done by volunteers, especially community volunteers. \u00bb The UN system should allocate more resources to facilitate the work of volunteers. \u00bb The UN system should continue to conduct research about the impact of volunteerism. Conclusion 36 \u00bb The UN system should assess the potential impact of using volunteers in their GBV programming and act accordingly. \u00bb The UN agencies should award certificates or public honours to show their appreciation of volunteers working on GBV, and/or support NGOs that wish to do so. \u2022\ufffd Provide adequate training for volunteers Interviews with volunteers and NGOs have found that volunteers lack training and NGOs lack the capacity and resources to provide adequate training and support for their volunteers. \u00bb The UN system should support NGOs through funding, training resources (curricula, documentation and other knowledge resources) and technical assistance to provide adequate training on gender issues and capacity-building for volunteers. \u2022\ufffd Provide training to strengthen NGO skills on volunteer management Throughout the interviews, several NGOs identified their need for volunteer management training to strengthen their volunteer programmes and human resource policy and procedures. The UN system, particularly UNV Cambodia, and key development partners, particularly VolCam, could provide technical assistance and financial support to NGOs working on GBV to strengthen their volunteer management skills and further", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed5c6be8-f96f-47d0-9850-ebeee857bbeb": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed5c6be8-f96f-47d0-9850-ebeee857bbeb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making a Difference - GBV in Cambodia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5bc4891f95f496edff5e1172b0ac2609f42de3d6cd082ad22a3f5ab828c94a6"}, "3": {"node_id": "e57f73f2-c274-40a9-a96c-9c6d372b28c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-difference-gbv-cambodia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad2df8ff61329b63396c0c41a3e530670be8bce7f59e6acd3d707d9e54c05af9"}}, "hash": "9643f4c9efb516994a233970f3509c0755511794e6a8fa4f22f4542ce5e307ec", "text": "increase the effectiveness of their volunteer programmes.

Policy-makers \u2022\ufffd Strengthen relationships among local authorities and volunteers Despite the efforts of NGOs to work with local authorities, this study has found that there are still remaining challenges for volunteers in working with local authorities. National and sub-national authorities in Cambodia could support local authorities in promoting a relationship with the volunteers and NGOs working in the community. This will ultimately facilitate GBV prevention and response. \u00bb National and sub-national authorities in Cambodia should promote dialogue and collaboration among local authorities and the volunteers and NGOs working in their local communities. Conclusion 37 5.2.4. Further research In terms of potential future studies, some recommendations emerging from the present study are: \u2022\ufffd While this study revolved around violence against women, future research could look at male survivors of GBV, a group about which there is little discussion at the moment in Cambodia. \u2022\ufffd While this study touched the effects of volunteer training it does not specifically look at the content and quality.

Six 'blocks' in Union Council Rehmatabad, Rawalpindi city, were selected for research purposes and research findings were based on interviews and focus group discussions with young men and women from the 15-25 age group. At first glance, and when taken in conjunction with the overall aim of the study viz to 'develop a deeper contextualised understanding of perceptions of men and women around masculinities', and to 'explore links between notions of masculinity and behaviour, especially gender based violence' in the Pakistan context, the research has obvious limitations. As pointed out in the study, it is non-representational character. Limited to one relatively homogenous class group, it misses out on the cross class dimension; based only on the views and opinions of a lower middle class community in urban Punjab, it also fails to take into account both rural/urban and ethno-cultural variables. Paradoxically, these limitations including the possibility of an inherent 'sample selection bias', constitute its strength. Deprived of the multiplicity of points of view stemming from differences of class, caste, rural, ethnic contexts and related factors, its relevance lies that it highlights and brings into sharp focus the critical role of stereotypes in the constitution of male identity. In the process it also provides useful insights into masculinity as a socio-psychological construct and the ways in which gender-based stereotypes naturalise, justify and perpetuate violence against women. Interviews and focus group discussions reveal perceived links between potency, notions of masculinity and male identity. Recurrent references to male ability to perform sexually with wives and including other women, the ability to produce offspring, and sexual performance as a means of dominating/controlling women and ensuring fidelity, point to the impossible demands of masculinist fantasies and the precarious uncertainties of male identity that inform all areas of life such as the male role as breadwinner, 'good' son and husband, including boy's 'games' and as topic of conversation. For instance, the ability to have an 'erection' was seen as the sign of a 'real man' and includes challenges among unmarried young men to demonstrate this ability openly; further, a man unable to perform sexually or to prove it publicly through domination of his wife, number of offspring, sex with sex workers ran the risk of being labelled as a 'non-man' through the pejorative label of 'khassi' or castrato. That this dominant and assertive masculinity is underpinned by fear is evident in the concerns expressed by men and reinforced by women who, at least as far as these research findings so, accept this perception of a dominant and assertive masculinity at its own valuation. It is a phallocentric worldview, and the stereotypes that it has given rise to reflect and reinforce the central concerns of this world. By definition stereotypes reduce individuals to a few simple characteristics that are perceived or represented as being fixed by Nature and are therefore unchanging and unchangeable. There is no room for difference, diversity or nuance in the stereotype. In this sense, stereotypes set up a socio-symbolic border 'Us' and 'Them'; between the 'normal' and what then falls within the purview of the 'abnormal'. At one level therefore, the stereotype grants certainty to the world that is lived and experienced. At another, however, Foreword vi vii precisely because it is so narrowly constituted, immutable and unchallengeable, it creates a potentially violent space where all that which it denies and excludes is relegated to the margins and aligned with the illicit, thereby placing the stereotype constantly under threat. In so far as definitions of what constitutes the male and female, stereotypes facilitate the division men and women into simple binaries that are stripped of all nuance and diversity. Thus if a 'real' man is visibly aggressive and virile, then the one who fails to meet the requirements imposed by the stereotype, is not", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68f1765e-081d-4570-bc9a-a2620d62b797": {"__data__": {"id_": "68f1765e-081d-4570-bc9a-a2620d62b797", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-masculinities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Understanding Masculinities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-masculinities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c0228029fc2fa0724a215039ca88e490a675ec854bfa66eb0bed492ce643487"}}, "hash": "8c0228029fc2fa0724a215039ca88e490a675ec854bfa66eb0bed492ce643487", "text": "a man. This very real and debilitating fear is borne out by this study in which anxiety about sexual performance because of previous sexual experience was mentioned 22 times. By this logic, if the man is a breadwinner, then the working woman is a transgressive entity who violates the straitjacket of the stereotype falls within the purview of excess of laying claim to illicit agency that threatens the masculinity or manhood of the male; if the visible sign of manhood is control and domination of the woman, then not only does she pose a threat to it, she justifies violence that is meted out to her. The internal logic of the manhood/dominance dyad presupposes hierarchies of power where the latter is directed against and the subordinate or excluded group viz women, and those men who are in a weaker position either socially or because they have failed to meet the standards of accepted manhood. There is no question of peaceful coexistence here, but of a violent hierarchy where men have the upper hand. Seen from this perspective 'Understanding Masculinities: A Formative Research on Masculinities and Gender-based Violence in Pakistan' by Rozan is a welcome contribution to the work being done on issues of violence against women. Its value lies in fact that while much work has been done on the feminine as a social construct as well as women's status and role in society in order to understand and the phenomenon of gender-based violence, in Pakistan at least, little work has been done to understand the link between perceptions of masculinity and violence. By highlighting the role of gender stereotyping it brings the focus to bear on the insecurities that underpin male identity and concomitant notions of masculinity. In the process it marks out areas for further exploration and also of the work that needs to be done in this regard. In order to address the issue of gender based violence, not only do men need to be taken on board, spaces also need to be created where both men and women are enabled to question their fantasies alongside the ideas and norms that shape their thoughts and experiences and subject their needs and desires to the rigid and often impossible demands of stereotypes that limit their right to agency and self-realisation. Neelam Hussain This research report attempts to provide some insight into young boys and men's lives and their experiences of masculinities and gender norms within the context of Pakistan. It is Rozan's belief that initiatives aimed at gender transformation must address and understand how these roles and norms are experienced by men and how they impact their lives and relationships. A particular concern explored is how these manifestations are experienced, perpetuated and challenged by women. A qualitative piece based on a small homogenous lower middle class community in a city of Punjab, it is an attempt by Rozan to deepen its understanding of male attitudes and perceptions on gender based violence and their link to masculine identity. This it feels is vital if we are to 'talk' to men and involve them as partners in the work on gender based violence. The research also aims at developing and testing the Gender Equitable Men (GEM) Scale, initially developed and tested in Brazil and later India, to the Pakistani context for use as an evaluation tool. Conducted in Union Council, Rehmatabad, Rawalpindi city, in the province of Punjab, the research interviews 39 respondents through 11 in-depth interviews and 5 focus group discussions. Four major themes were discussed namely masculinity, violence, sexuality and relations. Respondents were young men and women between the ages of 15-25. Primarily the analysis is qualitative, however, an attempt has been made to record the frequency of recurring themes. It is also pertinent to note that distinct grouping on basis of marriage was also done as it was considered an important determinant of changing social positions and hence roles of men and women. Sexuality was a theme that appeared consistently in interviews and dominated discussions with sexual potency and performance seen by most as an important way to maintain control and domination over the wife. Maintaining potency and virility, special diet, exercise, sports and body building, protecting oneself from too much indulgence in masturbation and sex were areas which were emphasized. Most men shared personal sexual experiences with other boys as they were growing up and almost all made some reference to a homosexual experience. Sex with younger boys was often coercive/abusive. Boys often expressed sexual helplessness when confronted with girls and women on the street.

Running parallel to the theme of being a 'provider' were negative or disapproving attitudes towards women's earning. All espoused a clearly well defined role between husband and wife when it came to domestic chores and upbringing of children. Man's role in the house was seen as that of the head who must command respect and be able to balance between the demands of the parents and the wife. Most felt that men should look after the needs of the wife, if this conflicted with parental rights, parents should be prioritized. There was a need to establish clear dominance and control in relationships with the opposite sex within and outside marriage. Most men mentioned controlling women's sexual activity and a deep distrust of women. Keeping an eye on the sister's and wife's movement was considered important. Sharing sexual problems or concerns with the wife was considered to be ill advised as women were seen as untrustworthy. Most men mentioned violent fights between rival youth groups in the community. Many had been part of such groups, and some reported detailed incidents in which their lives were endangered. Use of weapons such as pistols and knives seemed common. Sexual violence against younger boys, was not viewed as violence and it seemed that the line between sexual experimentation among friends and manipulation of young boys by older boys was blurred. There was less recognition of sexual harassment as violence though they accepted that women were harassed on the road and in public. Domestic violence was seen as an act which was sometimes necessary when 'a limit' was reached to show the woman 'her place' especially when she answered back. The onus of preventing violence and conflict in the home was clearly on the woman. Men saw themselves as a group that needs to protect and uphold society's traditions and morality. This role extended to beyond the family where some boys/men reported that they insulted and teased boys whose sisters worked. There was also a reference to the need to 'clean up' society from groups like homosexuals, men who 'kept' younger boys, youth who teased girls and boys and girls who were 'dating'. Descriptions of what men wore and how they walked would be invariably be expressed as being different from women; negation of feminine traits seemed important to their identity as men.

While some echoed men's sentiments that living off a woman's earnings is wrong, others felt that women can and should support men. These women experienced men as the ones who decide, give orders, dominate and get angry when they do not get respect. Women echoed what men said about women being untrustworthy and felt that men were better at keeping secrets. Women's relationships with each other within the home were characterized by conflict and competition over resources such as use of money, food items, decision making within the home. Women felt that they were blamed for not having children or for producing a female child and felt that a woman's standing was only secure once she had a male child. Women repeatedly shared personal or observed stories of domestic violence. Nearly all married women had experienced physical violence at the hands of their husbands and some by mothers and fathers- in- law. There was an acceptance of domestic violence as justifiable under certain conditions.

Most believed that the responsibility of avoiding violence lay with the women. Beating was also acceptable if it was done in privacy and at night, and if the man apologized later. Women never mentioned a man's sexual potency as a key criterion for what defined a real man. They shared that men tended to blame women for childlessness or infertility and did not tolerate questioning about their own potency. Women saw men's sexual needs as something that men could not control and agreed that a man's sexual desire must be met immediately. Using these findings, the Gender Equitable Men (GEM) Scale was adapted in the Pakistani context, where initially 39 GEM Scale items including 3 India specific items were tested for consistency with 106 young boys and men. After factor analysis, 13 items were finalized that include 4 Pakistan specific items extracted from the research. The findings from this study highlight how perceptions and practices of masculinity influence and inter-connect with issues such as relationships, sexuality and, most importantly violence. Application x Traditional notions of masculinity put men in positions of dominance where relationships are often characterized by unequal power relations and violence is seen as a tool for maintaining control. This control as is at best fragile, in the face of rigid expectations from men regarding sexual virility and dominance as well as their role as primary providers for the family. These expectations are particularly unstable in the context of rapidly changing demographics with shifting gender dynamics, reduced livelihood opportunities, and an increased need for women to work and supplement family incomes. Understanding and acknowledging these tension points, contradictions and anxieties in men's lives in programming with men can be strategic entry points of discussion and engagement with them on issues of gender based violence and may serve to increase the stakes for men for a more gender-just world. Introduction Gender and Violence in Pakistan Numerous studies have confirmed that in Pakistan's patriarchal society, women and girls are considered less competent and less worthy than boys and men. A strong patriarchal culture has resulted in structural and socio- cultural inequity, which often manifests in violence and harmful traditional and cultural practices. According to UNDP's Human Development Report 2006, the literacy rate amongst Pakistani women is just 36% as compared to 63% for men. Pakistan's maternal mortality ratio, estimated to be 500 deaths per 100,000 births, is estimated to be one of the highest in South Asia . A common perception within communities is that women are themselves responsible for inciting violence and that such violence is a private, personal issue and outside intervention is unacceptable. Illustrative statistics given below provide testimony to the widespread practice of violence against women; 1 Both the feminist and the human rights movement have focused largely on either women or civil or state responsibility towards women. With either focus women are the ultimate beneficiary. Efforts attempt to enable women to empower themselves, to provide them with better quality services and to cope with the effects of violence in their lives. The other part of the equation, namely men, is often forgotten. Initiatives to engage men involve sensitization to 'women's issues' or appeal to them to play a part to reduce injustice against women. Valuable as both approaches are, they often view men as 'ungendered', their behavior with women as disembodied aspects of their life and often inadequate attention is paid to gender norms specifically how notions of hegemonic masculinity play a critical role in shaping men's identity and their behavior towards other men. It is important to recognize how inequitable gender norms are inherently part of the socialization process for both males and females. These norms lead to inflexible gender stereotyping which impact women in obvious ways e.g. restricted mobility, withdrawal from school, control over interactions with males (Greene 1997) and heightened threat and presence of violence (Verma et al 2005). However, it is also important to recognize that they also affect men and boys, where privileges such as autonomy, mobility, opportunity and power create a specific set of vulnerabilities and pressures for men (Greene 1997; Barker 2000b). These could be distinctive vulnerability to child sexual abuse (Aangan, Rozan 2007) risky behavior such as unprotected sex, not seeking support for sexual problems and concerns (Barker 2000) and increased exposure and engagement with violence on the streets. Public spaces are gendered spaces where boys and men often prove their masculinity through street fights and harassment of women, 1 Chapter - 1 \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd 2913 cases of honor killings were reported to the Police departments in 2003 According to reported", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92d53fbc-ed4a-4bd9-8d4e-17432b2629ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "92d53fbc-ed4a-4bd9-8d4e-17432b2629ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-masculinities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Understanding Masculinities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-masculinities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ee1da3cd126731e1c293748ff70283c9e68757f93a5d571671d13640ce79690"}}, "hash": "5ee1da3cd126731e1c293748ff70283c9e68757f93a5d571671d13640ce79690", "text": "cases, in 1997 at least eight women, more than half of them under the age of 18, were raped every twenty-four hours nationwide According to a sample survey in Punjab , 82% of women in rural Punjab reported violence, with 52% women in urban Punjab reporting violence within the home 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 UNFPA: http://www.unfpa.org/profile/pakistan.cfm National Commission on the Status of Women report on 'The Concept of Justice in Islam' 2007. The Gender Question, Human Development Centre, 2000 State of Human Rights Report 1998 Rozan developed this qualitative investigation in order to deepen its understanding of male attitudes and perceptions on gender based violence and their link to masculine identity within the Pakistani context. Rozan believes that a holistic understanding of masculinities with its various forms of expressions and manifestations is essential for designing effective preventive programs on violence agaisnt women. Of particular significance is how these manifestations are experienced, perpetuated and challenged by women. More specifically the study aims to: Study Objectives companion who walks alongside. The research and the work being done now reflects a deepening of our experience and learnings over the years and a closer focus on it. Currently, the programme is involved in formative research on masculinities and has started a community project with young men. It aims to create spaces for men to engage on gender issues with a special emphasis on involving men and boys in stopping violence against women. The power of these social norms governing men's behavior together with uncompromising standards of masculinity are a formidable challenge to reducing the incidence of gender based violence. Recognition of these socialization messages, their impact on men, and the pressures men face in meeting standards of masculinity is vital if we are to 'talk' to men. Herein lies great potential for a shift in ownership of the issue of gender-based violence. Though there has been some promising work on gender-based violence and its link to masculinities in the regional and global context, more work is required specifically in the context of Pakistan. Initiatives that explore alternative and acceptable ways of being a 'man' without resorting to domination and violence are rare. Despite the growing informal acknowledgement of the need for these initiatives, within Pakistan there is limited evidence- based work showing this as an effective and necessary strategy to address gender based violence. Research Justification children and/or men who do not conform to dominant forms of masculinity. Boys and men can be subjected to and victimized by performances of masculinity by other men; in other words acts of violence instigated by other men. Homosexual men or those perceived as feminine may be attacked by other men who prove their masculinity and heterosexuality through this violence (Flood 2005). For some young men, violent behaviour is perceived as inevitable and compulsory, an appropriately masculine and heterosexual response to conflict with substantial rewards (Reilly et al. 2004). How men respond to victimization is also gendered. Responding aggressively and unflinchingly to other men's physical aggression or sexual aggression can be a sign of manhood. Men who show pain or weakness risk being seen as feminine (Flood, 2005). Boys are often misinformed about sexuality and sex and rarely have adequate or reliable sources of information. Myths such as masturbation leading to impotence, physical illness, and weakness are common. In addition many report guilt and strong anxiety about sexual performance in marital life (Qidwai, Waris 1996). Rozan sees these trends through its work with young men and in particular through its counseling service, the youth help line (YHL, Rozan 2003) where many young men talk about the 'pressures' of keeping a certain image, engaging in violence and risky sexual experimentation. Based in Islamabad, Pakistan, Rozan is an NGO that works on gender, violence against women and children and sexual and reproductive health since 1998. Its oldest programme, Aangan has a special focus on child sexual abuse. In addition to working with communities and schools, it functions as a Rozan and Men resource center. Capacity building and training is a core strategy employed by the organziation. Recently, the organization rolled out a project on gender sensitization of the media. Currently, Rozan has contractual partnerships with the government to improve service delivery to survivors of violence through support for its women centers (Ministry of Women Development) and to institutionalize training on gender and violence in police training (National Police Academy). Besides capacity building, Rozan also offers in- person, telephone, e-mail counseling services to survivors of violence. Men and boys have been an essential feature of all Rozan activities since its inception.

A large section of the module developed for the police addresses the police men's own issues, pain, powerlessness and stress. In our gender workshops, Rozan addresses how socialization hurts both men and women.

There are 20 sub locations comprising 14 colonies and 6 blocks in UC Rehmatabad. These 6 blocks were selected for the study. The 6 blocks represent the original settlement of the area, known as 'Gharibabad'. The population of selected area (6 sub locations) is approximately 10, 200 people and can be categorized as a low- income group. Prominent castes and ethnic groups in the area are Shiekh, Abbasi, Kashmiri, Rajput, Khawja and Pathan and the population is predominantly Muslim. The area is reasonably developed with paved streets, water supply and electricity system, good sewage and sanitation system. One government Basic Health Unit and three government schools are present in the locality. Since 2003, Rozan's 'Aangan' programme has worked with women and children of Rehmatabad on child sexual abuse and child rights. Under this program, Child Protection Committees (CPCs) have been established which serve as a platform for community members to raise awareness and provide support services for survivors of child sexual abuse. The research team involved members of CPCs as \u201ckey informants\u201d. With the help of key informants, the team gained knowledge about the history and socio-economic scenario of the area and also identified another set of key informants (both men and women). The following characteristics were sought for members of this group: A mapping exercise to define sampling frame and to characterize youth in the communities was conducted with the help of young men and women. Places were identified where youth usually gather and spend time. These included movies shops, video games shops, snooker clubs, Internet clubs, playgrounds etc. Furthermore, two of the research team members were residents of the target area and acted as a bridge between the team and the local people. Small groups of young men were first approached and given an orientation about the purpose and objectives of the research. They were motivated to spread the details among their peers and encourage them to respond to the research team. Once this was underway, the snowball technique was used to help identify people for the focus group discussions, which in turn helped identify respondents for in depth interviews. For women, owing to the fact that they are often not accessible in public spaces, a different strategy was used. To identify women respondents door-to-door visits were conducted. After identification, one to one meetings and orientations (both individual and group) were carried out to seek their consent to participate in the formative study. A PRA tool Daily Routine Chart was also used with both young men and women. The community members, both male and female, were asked to develop their daily routine charts. There were three purposes of doing this activity: first to get an idea about the life style of community members and to have knowledge about how and where they spend most of their time, second to identify potential respondents i.e. who are willing to participate and were expressive; and third, to assess an ideal time to approach", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd839056-e0d0-4f47-b44d-4a8d576b2188": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd839056-e0d0-4f47-b44d-4a8d576b2188", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-masculinities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Understanding Masculinities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-masculinities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88563efd3698ff4b3dbe1d9a34536519f4baa56e29bfb9026026485a0d991887"}}, "hash": "88563efd3698ff4b3dbe1d9a34536519f4baa56e29bfb9026026485a0d991887", "text": "them for research activities and possibly for the intervention at a later stage.

In order to participate in the study, respondents had to be expressive and open to discussing topics that could be considered socially taboo. Therefore, the findings may reflect sample selection bias. Moreover, the homogenity of the sample does not take into account class, rural/urban, and ethnic and cultural variables and as such has obvious limitations in terms of representation. Limitations of the Study transcribed in Urdu. It was then translated into English taking into account that the translation be done literally without changing the sense of the respondent's views. Two data sets (1 FGD, 1 IDI) were reviewed in detail. On the basis of the review, the research team divided the data into four main domains namely, Masculinity, Violence, Sexuality and Relations. Two domains i.e., Masculinity and Violence were further subdivided as: Traits, Attributes and Influencers (source of message) Type of violence (Physical, Non- physical or sexual), list of perpetrators and context /situations. Primarily the analysis was qualitative, however, an attempt was made to record the frequency of recurring themes. The analysis also attempted to look at similarities and Masculinity: Violence: Analysis Understanding Masculinity: Findings from the Qualitative Research Themes that appeared recurrently when we spoke to men about perceptions of an ideal man revolved around pressures to prove oneself as a man. For many, this was about sexual potency and concerns around that, and about being a protector and provider, essentially a money earner. Some key themes that appeared in men's interviews and focus groups discussion were as follows and have been ordered according to the frequency with which they appeared in discussions. Sexuality was a theme that appeared consistently in interviews and dominated discussions. This focus was more marked among unmarried men than married men. Sexual potency and performance defined by some as the ability to engage in sex for long duration ('sexual stamina'), were seen by most as an important way to maintain control and domination over the wife. Mentioned over 11 times in data pieces were references to men's ability to perform sexually with their wives and produce offspring. Some shared that men who were not able to sexually satisfy their wives ran the risk of being dominated and 'ordered' around by their wives and even infidelity on the part of the wife. The need to prove oneself sexually, was not limited to the wife alone. Two unmarried boys mentioned how the ability to have an 'erection' was a sign of a real man and how boys can challenge each other openly to i) What men said A real man should ensure that he remains sexually potent 'prove' this ability.

There was much discussion on how to maintain potency and virility. While there was lot of emphasis on special diet, exercise, sports and body building, there was also a strong belief that too much indulgence in sex with women and in masturbation would weaken the body and that this damage was irreversible ( zina fana hai - sex destroys you). Many spoke about physical exercise for strengthening the body for sex but also felt that it was a good way to release energy and helped to protect from sexual indulgence as well. Anxiety about sexual performance because of previous sexual experiences was mentioned 6 7 \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Men and women Married and unmarried persons Group and individual discussion \"zina fana hai - sex destroys you\" over 22 times. There seemed to be a hierarchy of activities that were sexually weakening. Masturbation was at the top of this hierarchy, 'If you do it with hand, it takes twice as much from a man than doing it with a woman', followed by sex with women and then sex with other boys. There was also guilt expressed about masturbation with reference to religion. One person shared that his inability to 'control' his sexual needs and his involvement in a religious madrassah caused a great of deal of anxiety as he felt he was being a hypocrite. 'At that time, we considered ourselves sinners, because we were doing wrong (masturbation). Our (religious) taining was underway and we used to go for learning sipara (Holy Quran recitation) as well as preaching. We were also learning about what is wrong and what is right. So in this respect we used to think that what we have just done (masturbate) is wrong and what we are doing here (reciting Holy Quran) is also wrong. We used to feel shame but they say sexual pleasure is such that you require more and more of it. Many men reported that they did not wish to discuss these anxieties with their peers, however, some mentioned going to 'hakeems' and local sex clinics in the area that promised sexual strength. There was also a reference to special tablets that made one sexually virile. Most men shared personal sexual experiences with other boys as they were growing up and almost all made some reference to a homosexual experience. It was interesting that the respondents did not see sex with men and boys as being as sexually or physically harmful as sex with women. In most cases, where men shared experiences of having sex with men, they talked about being the penetrator as opposed to being penetrated. This may be because the latter is associated with being 'femininzed'. Sex with younger boys seemed to be somewhat coercive/abusive. At times, participants referred to the practice of finding and trapping younger and 'beautiful' boys referred to as keeping a 'suchi'. Keeping a 'suchi' was associated with pride and was a sign of a virile and powerful male. Other examples of coercion were less direct. Participants spoke about sexual experimentation with other boys wherein one or two older boys who were more knowledgeable initiated the experience. In one instance a young man spoke about an experience where a group of older friends had sexually abused him when he was in Grade 2 (approx. 8 years old). He shared that this experience had profound negative impact on him and his schooling suffered. Though he referred to this act as a 'zyadati' (unfair/wrong act), he tried to absolve his friends by saying that they had started doing this because maybe they too had been sexually abused by someone. Another young man shared a detailed account of an experience in which he and a group of 12 boys had taken a young boy up a deserted hill and raped him. He shared that they had threatened him with an axe if he tried to resist. Clearly here the element of abuse, use of power, and the need to be penetrator is evident, as it seems these boys chose to rape this boy as opposed to having sex with each other. What is also clear is that the abuser or as in these two cases, the abusers are often 'friends'. Boys often expressed sexual helplessness (bequabu) when confronted with girls and women on the street in 'tight clothes and short sleeves' and justified", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22882e42-ee0d-4cee-bbac-84757d2bd7f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "22882e42-ee0d-4cee-bbac-84757d2bd7f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-masculinities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Understanding Masculinities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-masculinities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "98a4974e728f92645fa034e76f4fef880772d4f7f43a61e67b94b6ac13164ca5"}}, "hash": "98a4974e728f92645fa034e76f4fef880772d4f7f43a61e67b94b6ac13164ca5", "text": "'teasing' of women as something stimulated by women themselves through their 'eye contact' and 'ways of walking' and other behaviors.

'Even if a prostitute is caught red handed and she is not willing (to have sex with you), you can't harm her, if she is sitting right in front of you and she is not willing, you can't even touch her. When she is willing (to have sex), she can do it even beneath seven covers. It doesn't happen without the will of a woman, it is never forceful', implying therefore that rape is impossible and women lie about being raped. Preoccupation with their ability to earn and provide for the family was second only to their concerns around sexual virility. Mentioned A man provides for the family, earns himself and does not depend upon women's income 8 9 Some experiences while collecting data \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd There were some initial hesitations and skepticism expressed about NGO's, especially women's NGO's, and a belief that their agendas were pro-women and unsympathetic towards men. This was more apparent at the early stage of identification of sample, however, as the research team visited the area more frequently this decreased. The dynamics of masculinity, especially around male honor were apparent in the heated discussions that took place when young unmarried men talked about whether sisters should be 'allowed' to work and the view that those who lived off sisters earning should not be called 'men'. There was citing of Quranic verses and hadith to support both sides of the argument, and there came a point when the researcher feared that physical violence might erupt as some boys started to attack and question each other directly. Discussion and mention of sisters and insinuations about their sexual conduct were matters of clear tension and conflict between these boys. The ease with which the discussion could have escalated into physical violence is indicative of how difficult it is to have an open dialogue and communication on these issues. Interviews and FGDs with women went on longer than expected, as women were eager to talk and on the whole were more expressive. The married women's focus group discussion was a heavy session. Personal experiences of violence dominated the session. Many women shared personal stories and many cried, with some asking for support and referral services. These women were then linked to Rozan's counseling and referral services for women. 5 5 Sayings of the Holy Prophet Muhammad ( PBUH) \"If you do it with hand, it takes twice as much from a man than doing it with a woman\" over 22 times in the data pieces, this attribute was critical. Again and again men would talk about this being a primary function of men 'men are born to earn'\u2026'without money/ salary a man is nothing'\u2026'earning of a man is his characterized by a sense of duty and respect especially after marriage. The dynamics between husband and wife were quite different. As one said 'treat your wife with kindness but do not end up being subordinate to her'. Another defined the kind of relationship between husband and wife as ' if a woman really cares for her husband and if one day her husband asks her to die, it is not for the woman to ask why, if she is an obedient wife she should die as it pleases her husband and she must always respect him' Sometimes words used for the wife seemed derogatory and reduced her status to an object or possession e.g. 'cheez'. Controlling the wife seemed to be an important attribute of masculinity where men were conflicted about maintaining a balance between being polite and not being 'extra polite'. This extended to the sexual arena as well and the pains young men take to show that they are sexually virile but at the same time not 'controlled' by their women. One man recounted the tale of a friend who upon getting married was teased by friends: if he went home too early, he cared about his wife, but if he went home late, he was afraid of sexual activity. This need to establish clear dominance and control in relationships was not limited to more freedom for honesty in private interviews. All espoused a clearly well defined role between husband and wife when it came to domestic chores and upbringing of children.

Some went on to say that working within the home was shameful for men as real men did not do work meant for women. Man's role in the house was seen as that of the head, pillar, decision maker who must command respect and be able to balance between the demands of the parents and the wife. Some cited religion as reinforcing the role of the man as the one who fulfilled expectations of people especially parents and this was conisdered an important way to please God.

Although most felt that men should look after the needs of the wife, if this conflicted with parental rights, parents should be prioritized. The husband's role was to make the wife 'understand' this priority. 'By the grace of God I always do what my parent tells me, irrespective of whether I will gain or lose by that act'. In case of conflict between parents and wife, many men said that their typical behaviour was to withdraw, leaving the two conflicting parties (often the wife and the mother in law) to fight it out and resolve it between themselves. Relationships with parents seemed to be A man needs to control his wife, look after the needs of parents more than the wife, and take major decisions within family. potency' \u2026 'men who cannot are eunuchs'. Ability to earn and provide was closely linked to respect as many believed that only men who could earn and provide for their family deserved respect. Running parallel to the theme of being a 'provider' were negative or disapproving attitudes towards women's earning which came up 14 times. Using money earned by women members of the house was seen as honourless. 'One who lives on (eats) his wife's earning is not a man'. There was also anxiety and tacit disapproval regarding the increasing trend of working women's independent mobility and their exposure to harassment and other men. Women working outside or going about doing their work alone were considered extremely deplorable. These women were often equated with sex-workers, and their family members, specifically men were seen as pimps for allowing them this freedom. Married men differed from unmarried men on this topic though. This may be because married men acknowledge the need for women to work and supplement a family's income because of practical realities. Similarly there was less emphasis on this trait in individual sessions, and some shared that, although not desirable, it may be necessary. Many of these men rejected female employment as honourless in the group setting even though individually they admitted 'allowing' it. This discrepancy may have been caused by a social pressure to convey certain traditional messages in a group setting, with 10 11 \"One who lives on (eats) his wife's earning is not a man\" marriage but also extended to other opposite sex relationships and it was highlighted that a boy must not be dominated by his girl friend. Losing control was defined as spending 'too' much time with her and giving her attention. This could lead to teasing and being ostracized from boys' groups. Religion was often cited by young men, especially in group discussions to support their argument about restricting women's mobility, dress code, earning. However, interestingly there were a few dissenting voices that felt religion was being misinterpreted and that Islam allowed women more freedom. Most men mentioned controlling women's sexual activity and a deep distrust of women. Keeping an eye on the sister's and wife's movement was considered important. Sexual activity before marriage for women was not acceptable, and it was important that women be virgins before marriage. Once a woman had engaged in sexual activity, she was not to be trusted; 'whether you steal once or you steal a thousand times it is the same, whether you steal one rupee or one lakh rupee it is the same thing'. This criterion was rigid and applied even if the sexual activity had been with the Sexual violence against younger boys, was not viewed as violence and it seemed that the line between sexual experimentation among friends and manipulation of young boys by older boys was blurred. There was little expressed empathy for the victim. Even when respondents described their own experiences with victimization, there was little suggestion of feeling angry or resentful.

There was less recognition of sexual harassment as violence though they accepted that women were harassed on the road and in public. Where some criticized the practice as wrong, many felt that men were 'compelled' to engage in it and that women invited it. Some felt that women who were harassed were sex workers and that even if they did not respond to verbal engagement, men would continue to harass them. In sharp contrast to the women's groups, where domestic violence and abuse was a recurrent theme, men did not discuss it. This denial was especially marked in the group discussion. In the individual sessions there was some mention of it, and, though many felt that it was not husband before marriage. This strict moral code seemed to have no connection to their own sexual practices before marriage, be it sexual experimentation with friends, sex workers, or younger boys. Sharing sexual problems or concerns with the wife was considered to be ill advised as women were seen as untrustworthy, and there was concern about losing control through admission of weakness and her then looking elsewhere for sexual satisfaction. There seemed to be some evidence of this extending to matters beyond sexual concerns as well, but that was not adequately probed. Male friends on the other hand were considered more trustworthy and reliable. They could be looked upon to help and also keep secrets. Most men mentioned violent fights between rival youth groups in the community. Many had been part of such groups, and some reported detailed incidents in which their lives were endangered. Use of weapons such as pistols and knives seemed common. Issues over which they fought ranged from revenge for perceived insult, being paid to inflict harm on another person, possession of younger boys for sexual purposes, engaging in fights to 'cleanse' society, and rivalry between different castes. There was a belief that a real man always responded to a threat, did not forgive or forget, and did not shy away from conflict even if it meant endangering his life. There was a sense of bravado and not being afraid of death if you were a real man. 'We have to die one day, whether we die at the hand of a human being or because a dog bites us, or the angel of death comes to take our spirit, when our death is ordained it will happen' Violent behaviour and harassment of powerless groups as part of being a real man. desirable, at times they felt it was necessary. Some felt that it had to be done when 'a limit' was reached to show the woman 'her place' especially when she answered back. Domestic violence was discussed as an important tool to ensure domination and respect. One man shared that sometimes men also beat their wives when they wanted to hide certain things (hinting at sexual infidelity) and women insisted on questioning them about it. Many felt that the threat of violence or show of temper ought to be enough to keep her under her husband's control. The onus of preventing violence and conflict in the home was clearly on the woman. As one put it 'when she sees I am angry she herself gives in. I can get out of control in anger\u2026 to keep her respect she backs off\u2026everyone likes to maintain their respect'. Another man puts it as 'avoiding violence is a woman's responsibility, if she is intelligent, she should pick up her husband's mood'. A man shared that the man who beats his wife is 'namard' (not a man) but in the same sentence went on to say that although you should not beat women, a woman of a 'good family' was able to tolerate violence. 'She is like a wall, no matter how much you beat her she takes it'. Men saw themselves as a group that needs to protect and uphold society's traditions and morality. Most expressed this foremost and primarily in terms of the women in their family especially the wife and sister, often referred to as 'cheez' or possessions. This was linked to controlling her mobility and dress. Failure to meet this criteria made a man honourless, and, as one man put it, 'in our area we live for our honor only, and we die for it as well' .

Some women felt that men were skeptical or suspicious of women and that dress, appearance (e.g cutting hair) and mobility were often areas where 'permission' was needed. Many shared that a man required that a woman seek permission before visiting her natal home. These women experienced men as the ones who decide, give orders, dominate and get angry when they do not get respect. Decision-making was seen as men's domain and women shared how they were discouraged from participation in decision- making by being told that they did not know enough. Women echoed what men said about women being untrustworthy and felt that men were better at keeping secrets. Sometimes, women mentioned traditional gendered practices that men did not perceive at Men earn, make decisions, are trustworthy and have a need to control the wife. Men should balance parents' and wife's expectations and most of all 'give peace' to the wife Men's ability to earn was an important pre requisite for respect, although some women felt that this burden was heavy and many men suffered as a result. They talked about how men sometimes smoked, used drugs and became violent to release tensions. They shared that men feel inferior and low about themselves if they could not meet their family's needs. This impact on men's health and behaviour came up only once in the data collected with men. While some echoed men's sentiments that living off a woman's earnings is wrong, others felt that women can and should support men. Some also indicated that it was considered good if the girl was educated and could bring in money. This made her an asset. This is in contrast to what most unmarried men said who labelled letting their wives and sisters work as 'honourless'. Women also saw men's work as outside the home and women's as that of looking after the family and children. Some felt that women who work should get more support from men in household chores. However, there was some skepticism about their (men's) ability to do so. As one woman put it 'wo kaam kam karte hain aur khap zyada daltein hain' (when doing domestic chores they create more fuss and work less). Another woman felt that it was a sign of shame if the man of the house had to work within the house. 'Raub' or control over the wife was considered an essential attribute of masculinity where one said 'men want that other people should Real men do not look like women ii) What women said Although being muscular and physically strong was mentioned by many as an important trait of masculinity, this was almost always mentioned in the context of sexual virility/potency except twice where it was mentioned in the context of using it to show strength and dominance over other boys. Special diets and regular exercise and sports were considered important not only as they visibly made the body stronger, but also as a protection/distraction from excessive indulgence in sex. Participants made it clear that real men do not look like women. When asked to provide descriptions of what men wore and how they walked, they would invariably frame it as being different from women, almost as if the definition of being male meant not being female; negation of feminine traits seemed important to their identity as a man. 'Men must be different from women, through clothes, colors etc'. Another man, describing what he called a feminine man in the area said ' they have a female nature\u2026there have 50%-75% woman's qualities in them, I mean their style of speaking, if they go somewhere they will think about their appearance and this will resemble that of women i.e. doing facials, putting lenses, and make up.

There was also a reference to the need to 'clean up' society from groups like homosexuals, men who 'kept' younger boys, youth who teased girls and boys and girls who were 'dating'. 'Nowadays if some boy passes through our streets (area) and he is after a girl or if he has come for a date, he can never deceive us. We make him understand once, but the second time we don't just talk to him (implying that they use violence). People in the neighbourhood also support us in this saying that the boy has done wrong as he came to tease girls (so he deserves it'). In individual sessions there was more focus on controlling female members of their household rather than society but as a group there was more collective censure of activities outside the home. \"In our area we live for our honor only, and we die for it as well\" 14 15 \"When she sees I am angry she herself gives in.

There were some dissenting voices; however, all agreed that there were certain conditions where beating was justified. One of these conditions was sexual infidelity. Beating was also acceptable if it was done in privacy and at night, and if the man apologized later. 'He beats me at night, so I say to myself, it is OK. But he has started to beat me in front of everyone, and there are signs on my body'. Two women shared that they did not feel they could ever refuse their husband sexually. As one simply put it, there was no point ' even if a wife is not willing, he will do it by force'. There was a strong religious justification given for this, and many felt that it was a sin to say no to the husband. \"He beats me at night, so I say to myself, it is OK. But he has started to beat me in front of everyone, and there are signs on my body\" all. For example, women mentioned setting aside better food for the man of the house in acknowledgment of his status as breadwinner and primary earner. It is notable that this preferential treatment in diet had no relationship to sexually potency, which is the only time men spoke about the importance of special diet. Women's relationships with each other within the home were characterized by conflict and competition over resources such as use of money, food items, decision making within the home. While some experienced actual physical abuse at the hands of the mother in law, others talked about how they felt less important and how often husbands would side with the mother in law and his sisters and leave them to fend for themselves. However, women felt that a good man should be able to balance fairly between the needs of his wife and his parents. They also felt that a good man should speak politely and calmly with his family and try not to resort to violence. As one put it, 'it is all right if he cannot give money he should at least give us peace of mind'. Women felt that they were blamed for not having children or for producing a female child and felt that a woman's standing was only secure once she had a male child. 'Since I gave birth people have stopped criticizing me' In sharp contrast to the married men's focus group discussion where domestic violence was denied and ignored, the topic dominated women's discussion. Women repeatedly shared personal or observed stories of domestic violence. Mentioned over 46 times in the discu- ssions, the types of violence shared included sexual abuse of children, sexual harassment in public spaces, acid throwing, and physical Men resort to violence in intimate relationships violence against wives, ranging from slapping, hitting, kicking, marital rape and excessive beating leading to abortion.

Many felt that the wife should only be beaten when she has done something bad outside or disobeyed her husband and 'that if he beats her for a reason it is acceptable'. However, when they spoke about incidents of violence they had experienced themselves, they nearly always spoke of it in terms of being excessive and unfair. 'When I was pregnant, my husband used to kick me with his legs excessively, and then I lost the child. When we went to the doctor, he said there was no pregnancy and then he and his mother started to say that I had aborted my child myself'. Another woman stated 'The main reason why a man beats a woman is that he can't be violent with anyone else, so in this case he is violent with his wife; if he is angry with his father\u2026 or with someone else\u2026so he will vent it in the home especially on his wife. The wife will say to him, \u201c why do you take out your anger with someone else on me\u2026\u201d. Like the men, most believed that the responsibility of avoiding violence lay with the women. 'When a man is asking for something, it is better to agree with him instead of him becoming violent' This was not so much in Men blame women for infertility and do not want to be questioned about their potency. Women never mentioned a man's sexual potency as a key criterion for what defined a real man. In two of the five data pieces with women, there was a reference to the ability of men to produce children. They shared that men tended to blame women for childlessness or infertility and did not tolerate questioning about their own potency. This was, however, more in the context of the ability to produce offspring than sexuality per se. This echoes what men had said earlier about their discomfort or wanting to hide sexual weakness from their wives. Women saw men's sexual needs as something that men could not control and agreed that a man's sexual desire must be met immediately. 16 17 \"It is all right if he cannot give money he should at least give us peace of mind\" \"When a man is asking for something, it is better to agree with him instead of him becoming violent\" Pakistani Adaptation of Gender Equitable Men (GEM) Scale The GEM Scale was originally developed by the Horizon Program and Instituto Promundo with young men aged 15 to 25 years. The original scale includes 24 attitudinal statements about gender roles in the area of domestic work and childcare, sexuality and sexual relationships, reproductive health and disease prevention, partner violence, and attitudes towards homosexuality and close relationships with other men. Based on the analysis of data collected by Rozan for the original testing, 22 statements were taken from the original GEM Scale, 3 from the Indian adaptation, and an additional 14 statements were developed for Pakistan. 1.

Conclusions and Implica- tions for Programming Drawing upon the findings, this section presents conclusions about the attributes or perspectives that define masculinity. It also attempts to understand how these attributes interact with each other and impact the lives of young men and young women. Each of the areas identified below highlight tension points that can be explored and discussed in group education sessions and campaigns in an attempt to support young men in: Sexual potency and the ability to 'prove' ones masculinity through sexually virility were important for these young men. Activities that were believed to lead to increased sexual performance were highly desirable such as special diet, engagement in sports, physical exercise and bodybuilding. There seemed to be an interesting contradiction /fascination with sexual stamina (and a need to develop it through physical exercise) in order to fulfill sexual demands and be a man but at the same time, a fear that sex will weaken the body and must be avoided. They seemed to be struggling constantly with what they felt were 'uncontrollable urges' and fearing their detrimental consequences. Men's especially a male child, was obvious in discussions. Any admission of sexual weakness or anxiety about sexual performance seemed contrary to the notion of being a man and as such there was discomfort with sharing this with women and to some extent with other men. Men did not wish to discuss this with their wives or seek possible treatment for it. This discomfort sprang from a perceived fear of sexual infidelity on part of the wife, once she discovered that the man had a real or imagined sexual deficiency. A practical implication articulated by women of this fear experienced by men, was that men would not accept blame for the couple's inability to conceive and often would blame the wife for her inability to produce children. Interesting to note here is that men's defensive behaviour in a bid to 'protect 'their manhood leaves women vulnerable to the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13dbb24b-d8e9-49ed-9eee-55da3defed58": {"__data__": {"id_": "13dbb24b-d8e9-49ed-9eee-55da3defed58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-masculinities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Understanding Masculinities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/understanding-masculinities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67d28c78174537a04a378e4f05d266a8a2576503d3618538cb163805ad428b72"}}, "hash": "67d28c78174537a04a378e4f05d266a8a2576503d3618538cb163805ad428b72", "text": "blame for being barren/childless. This is often cited as a major justification for second marriage for men. For most men early sexual experimentation involves other men, even though this behaviour is not acceptable in a traditionally conservative society like Pakistan. Moreover, with a by older 'friends', sex and sexuality become enmeshed with guilt, fear of physical consequences, and a strong anxiety around sexual performance in married life. As a result these young men, despite the very real anxiety they experience, have few avenues of support, reassurance or provision of factual information to clarify myths around sexuality or even information about sexual health. Also we know that men traditionally block themselves from anxiety around sexual virility and its association with the ability to produce offspring, blurred line between experimentation and abuse emotional expression, and as such may find it hard to deal with trauma like sexual abuse as children and may also subsequently find it harder to empathize with powerless groups as to do so may invoke memories of unresolved trauma in their lives. The data clearly reveals the belief that and that it is women's dress and behaviour which 'compels' them to be attracted to them. Linked with this was the belief that women could not be forced to have sex and that 'good' women were never harassed. An implication of this belief would be that that women who claimed they had been sexually abused were lying and are to blame for sexual assault in the first place. Correspondingly men have no agency or ability to control themselves sexually and hence are not to be blamed. To some extent young men were helpless in the face of sexual needs women also echoed this and felt that women's dress may lead men to sexually assault them. However, they did not share the opinion that women could not be raped without consent. for the family was closely linked to respect, as many believed that only men who could earn and provide for their family were deserving of respect or were honourable. Although this was reiterated by women, they prioritized it less. Women shared that what they sought most from their husbands was care, importance, and peace of mind, even if they could not provide financially. Running parallel to the theme of being a 'provider' were attitudes towards living off of which was regarded by men as honourless. This was less intensely expressed by married men and in individual interviews. The reality is that many women in Ability to earn and provide women's earning, 20 21 Comparing perceptions of men and women Much of the discussion with men revealed male expectations to prove masculinity. Being a man was not an entitlement by birth, but had to be proved repeatedly through the fulfilment of sexual, familial, and financial roles. There was relatively little emphasis on physical attributes, and men seemed to be driven more by the need to prove their sexual potency and ability to provide and earn for their family. Other proofs of masculinity were domination and control over wife, not being feminine, responding without fear to threats and insults, and taking revenge. Women's discussion revealed daily experiences with the man/men in their lives; their messageswereacontrasttothe men,whospokeabout the ' man'. There was also similarity between men's and women's views about socialization messages around gender norms. The views complement each other, but it was interesting that women's prioritization of what makes a 'real' man was different from men's. They seemed to place peace of mind (treating women with respect and not resorting to violence or threats) higher than his ability to earn and provide for his wife or his sexual virility, both of which are placed by menascriticalforgaining respectwithin the familyandsociety. Women also showed more insight than men and more flexibility when it came to changing or challenging gender norms, as they are clearly at the receiving end of this discrimination in more obvious and extreme ways. Men seemed to function from a position of privilege and power (entitlement), but there was clear anxiety and tension around the need to prove and maintain thispositionofpowerandfearofadmissionofweakness. ideal Chapter - 5 \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Reflecting upon and understanding where these expectations come from, how they influence their behaviour and also how it then impacts people and relationships around them Gaining knowledge and information on sexuality (e.g myths around sexuality) Learning skills (e.g. conflict resolution and anger management) Coping with aspects of their lives that need support especially in cases where their first experience with sexuality has been abusive this community work as domestic help in homes, in schools, in offices, or in NGO's.

This was seconded by women who shared that husbands and brothers were often skeptical and suspicious about them especially if they went out of the home. Women also felt that women should stay within limits and not abuse freedom if allowed to work outside. This included being conservative in dress and demeanour and not appearing overly 'bold' or socially adept. Men experience themselves as men only if these traits and attributes differentiated them from women. There was a strong fear of appearing feminine and pressure to prove that in If you did not meet these standards, you could be teased and ridiculed. There was mention of drugs and steroids used by young men to build the body. Overwhelmingly, both men and women shared the belief that the Although justification was given by both, the women expressed more clearly that it was often unfair and excessive. Women and men both felt that a woman could avoid violence if she was able to manage her husband's mood; but often conditions to avoid violence were arbitrary and essentially meant backing off from one's Controlling and guarding the women of the house your trait, mannerism and dress you were a 'real' man. responsibility of avoiding violence within the home was the woman's. position and being subservient to the man's demands. Even in this case, some women felt that violence could not be avoided when the man had to vent his anger about something else and the woman was a safe outlet. Men lacked this insight when they talked about violence. Some men did censure violence also but said so on grounds of how men should be kinder to women and keep a balance between being polite and overly subordinate. Recognition of sexual harassment as a form of violence against women was low. 'Real' men were not afraid of even if it endangered their lives. Many had been part of street gangs and groups and although there were dissenting voices which spoke about resolving conflict through dialogue, the majority felt that show of strength was needed to establish dominance. This did not have to be physical strength alone but could also be connections with powerful and influential groups. There was clear both for men and women, more so in the case of men. Both expressed that it was shameful for men to work around the house, especially in terms of serving himself etc. Some women seemed more open to changing this norm, saying that women who worked needed more support within the home and women could supplement family income. The need to establish (sexual and otherwise) in relationships with wives/ girl friends was expressed as an essential attribute of a man. Image was important in this case and could translate into pressure on men to show that they did not 'care' so much for their wives and girl friends. It seems that men hide their sexual anxieties from their wives and can resort to violence if necessary to demonstrate this control. engaging in violent and risky behaviour demarcation of responsibilities within the home, clear dominance and control As most families within Pakistan live in a joint family system, an issue that seemed to come up again and again was These needs were often perceived as competing. Men's reactions to this conflict were to side with parents and also to avoid responsibility for resolving the conflict, withdrawing physically from the situation. This was echoed by the women when they shared experiences of negotiating disagreements with their in-laws. Some men saw themselves as This role seemed limited to others' sexual activities outside the domain of marriage, with a special focus on groups like homosexuals, men who 'kept' younger boys, youth who teased girls and boys, and girls who were 'dating'. Here, the criterion for being attacked was sexual activity outside the contract of marriage. No distinction was made on the basis of whether the behaviour was engaged in willingly or was forced (as in the case of eve teasing and child sexual abuse). Both the victim and perpetrator were implicated as culpable.

The findings from this study highlight how perceptions and practices of masculinity influence and inter-connect with issues such as relationships, sexuality and, most important violence. Traditional notions of masculinity put men in a position of dominance where relationships are often characterized by unequal power relations. Violence is seen as a tool for maintaining control. This control is at best fragile, in the face of rigid expectations from men regarding sexual virility and dominance as well as their role as primary providers for the family. These expectations are particularly unstable in the context of rapidly changing demographics with shifting gender dynamics, reduced livelihood opportunities, and an increased need for women to work and supplement family incomes. Understanding and acknowledging these tension points, contradictions and anxieties in men's lives can be strategic entry points of discussion and engagement with men on issues of gender based violence and may serve to increase the stakes for men for a more gender just world. 22 23 1.

Overview: The Beginning \u2013 and Where We Are Now Over the past ten years, UNDP has been progressively transforming itself into a more knowledge- driven and globally networked organization. Regionalisation of certain functions and services has formed part of this approach and five years ago, the Regional Centre in Asia and the Pacific was established. The Centre integrates human and financial resources from multiple sources and provides a platform for the provision of services to countries and country offices. The vision is to address the very diverse needs of the region\u2019s more than 700 million poor people across the 37 countries covered by the Centre. While rapid progress had been made in many countries toward the Millennium Development Goals, others \u2013 notably the 14 Least Developed Countries \u2013 have fallen behind. Even now, no country in the region is on track to achieve all eight Goals by 2015. Five years ago, UNDP\u2019s work at the regional level was not sufficiently coordinated, leading to fragmentation, lack of clarity and loss of impact. Regional Programmes entailed heavy project implementation costs and were scattered across countries, sometimes managed by UNDP Headquarters or regional institutions such as the Association of South East Asian Nations. Sub- Regional Resource Facilities, or SURFS, played an active role in policy support to Country Offices \u2013 but with Regional Programmes and SURFS each managed by different parts of the organization, linkages were few. As this five-year perspective will illustrate, the Regional Centre, with offices in Bangkok, Colombo and Suva, has worked to break down the silos that characterized the earlier division of labour. In so doing, we have tried to balance what is strategic at the regional level \u2013 multi-disciplinary policy expertise, knowledge sharing, research services, and development of regional public goods \u2013 with high-quality, direct country support services. We offer a network of regional \u201ccommunities of practice\u201d that has engaged hundreds of development practitioners. We offer capacity development not only to regional and national partners, but also to UNDP\u2019s Country Office staff, so they can deliver better services to their counterparts. We offer, in short, a concentration of expertise. We have addressed all this through the creation of regional teams in UNDP\u2019s four core areas: (1) Poverty Reduction and Achievement of the MDGs, including HIV/AIDS; (2) Democratic Governance; (3) Crisis Prevention and Recovery; and (4) Environment and Sustainable Development. Recently, we have added support to United Nations coordination through the UNDG Asia-Pacific as an important element of our service. Throughout, we have forged strategic development partnerships, including with other United Nations Agencies, bilateral donors, international financial institutions, regional intergovernmental organizations, the private sector, civil society and academia. Our country-specific work aims to be as demand-driven as possible and we regularly consult with Country Offices, government authorities and other partners. Priority is generally given to Least Developed Countries, as well as to opportunities for learning from potential innovations and applying this knowledge elsewhere. Between 2007 and 2008 alone, our country programming support grew by 27 percent, totalling 687 advisory missions and 4,825 person-days.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67a0a9bd-a658-48da-b3d3-d03a4335186c": {"__data__": {"id_": "67a0a9bd-a658-48da-b3d3-d03a4335186c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Taking Care of Business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b08e41ebcd95eb5741d9ee49def717d1cb14289ec6849aa354f2a9e132ba0c9"}, "2": {"node_id": "fecc2a78-6c17-44be-a2de-5cdf0b1b3472", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c60f2f682d2b44148979a8513ca8497d371417d656c8ded1f2ea64e4bd55238"}}, "hash": "c44f1ee2d46118f97d565f99dad8ef8f44cbaa6583b4cde4e79c75bc7012311f", "text": "Regional resources are allocated on the basis of emerging issues and of a \u201cregionality\u201d test, where common solutions can be provided for several countries.

Our Crisis Prevention and Recovery team was first on the scene after the tsunami and extensively involved in assisting the transition from emergency to development. The South-South team quickly mobilized expertise from other developing countries to fill key assistance gaps, while the Management team helped enhance management capacity in affected Country Offices on gap analysis, business process documentation and strategic operational support, enabling the absorption of a record US$250 million in development assistance that was channelled through UNDP. The Governance team worked to establish a critical aid tracking system in record time, ensuring that these resources could be accounted for transparently. Crisis Prevention and Recovery also later contributed to a pioneering regional tsunami early warning system, as well as the building of end-to-end national early warning systems in the most affected countries. In other areas, we emphasize the linkages between democratic governance and poverty reduction, and between poverty and environment \u2013 and we ensure that gender equality and capacity development are integrated into all our work. Many of our initiatives have been cited as global best practices, such as our piloting of a regional network that promotes capacity development of indigenous women in public decision making. A snapshot of our key achievements includes: \ufffd Responding to climate change by contributing to the reduction of 962 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions and protecting nearly 3 million hectares of forest \ufffd Provision of immediate support in response to sudden crises, including drought, earthquakes, cyclone, floods and landslides in China, Bangladesh, Philippines, Myanmar, Viet Nam, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Bhutan, Samoa, Tonga and Thailand. \ufffd Assistance in the building of end-to-end tsunami early warning systems in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Thailand and India. \ufffd Delivery of financial literacy training to nearly 23,000 rural people in Fiji, another 20,000 rural people in Solomon Islands, Tonga and Samoa. \ufffd Shaping a development policy and intellectual agenda that both supports and goes beyond the Millennium Declaration, through delivering high-impact regional public goods such as the award-winning Asia-Pacific Human Development Report Trade on Human Term, co-production of documentaries on Discovery Channel and BBC World Service, and Public Service Announcements on CNN and national broadcasters on issues including corruption, recovery after crisis, climate change and gender equality. 3 \ufffd Bringing countries closer to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, through development or rollout in 10 countries of a unique integration of national Goal-based costing, planning and financing strategies; in addition, confronting HIV via a range of approaches, including facilitating high-level roundtable discussions on HIV vulnerabilities of migrant women \ufffd Building effective coalitions to fight corruption, such as through development of mechanisms to ensure health sector integrity in Mongolia. Yet these achievements have not come without substantial challenges. It has been difficult to serve different missions and mandates, simultaneously delivering Country Office support and regional programming. A strong need has existed to better understand and gauge the demands of the Country Offices, and more so now with the global financial shock. Although this has been increasingly addressed over the years, some services are still perceived by countries as \u201csupply- driven,\u201d and in an era of fiscal discipline our regional advisors often remain overstretched. Many resources were locked into multi-year programme and project activities. Increased attention has been necessary to develop performance indicators, to recognize the importance of advocacy and communications, and to improve the quality and impact of regional publications. Our clients have pointed to the following services as particularly strong: \ufffd Objective and internationally grounded quality policy advice and technical support that costs less than market prices and is available on short notice \ufffd Programme formulation capacity, based on both our familiarity with UNDP and our detailed knowledge of donor requirements \ufffd Emergency response to crises \ufffd Support for Country Office staff capacity development \ufffd Expert rosters and referral services \ufffd Advocacy and financial support \ufffd Sharing of good practices and lessons learnt, with particularly useful information gained from regional knowledge networks We are available and accessible. We respond rapidly and strategically to clients and partners alike. As one key partner, the New Zealand International Aid and Development Agency, has put it:1 \u201cWe have an extremely positive relationship [with the Regional Centre]. We\u2019ve learnt a lot. It\u2019s very unusual \u2013 we weren\u2019t quite sure of the engagement.

Impact: Our Core and Cross-Cutting Work a) Democratic Governance: Promoting Universal Values Progress toward democratization and good governance across Asia and the Pacific has been highly volatile. The Regional Centre has focused its interventions on overcoming multiple deficits in the democratic order, including debilitating religious, ethnic and social conflicts, corruption, weak state institutions, communal politics, and the persistently limited influence of women, indigenous peoples and minorities over public decision making. The global food, fuel and financial crisis, and consequent shortfalls in development aid flows, has increased the risk in many countries of a reversal of democratic gains. Remedies most needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals have been prioritized, primarily involving the promotion of participation of all social groups in policymaking and implementation, and of international norms against corruption, and for human rights and aid effectiveness. Our Results Governance results are in three categories: (1) Providing regional public goods that assist countries in strategically shaping and addressing politically sensitive issues such as human rights, gender equality, accountability and transparency; (2) Capacity development that strengthens national, regional and global governance discourse; and (3) Long-term policy advice on democratic governance. This has included: \ufffd Working closely with Country Offices to overcome unprecedented challenges to coordinated response and recovery posed by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The Regional Centre helped to ensure that record levels of resources targeted the most urgent needs and could be accounted for transparently, establishing a world-class aid tracking system in record time and in partnership with four Country Offices and Asian Development Bank. This system in Indonesia, the Recovery Aceh-Nias Database, went on to win the Innovative Government Technology Award at the 2008 FutureGov Summit for its groundbreaking contribution to aid accountability. \ufffd We have undertaken a number of high-profile initiatives to curb corruption and promote integrity in the public sector. In one pioneering initiative, the Centre has partnered in Mongolia with Country Office and the Ministry of Health to strengthen ethics in the health sector since 2006. Building on the development of a National Programme for Combating Corruption, specific results include replication of health sector benchmarks on accountability and transparency across the public sector. Other tangible changes in policies and management have led to a more than doubling of salaries for health sector employees \u2013 and less interest in under-the-table payments. \ufffd The Centre has led or mobilized resources for the development of major post-conflict programmes on local democratic governance across the region, including Afghanistan (US$67 million), Nepal (US$180 million \u2013 see also Capacity Development), Sri Lanka (US$6 million) and Aceh in Indonesia (US$27 million). Comparative analysis and continued technical backstopping by the Centre has delivered a key contribution to a series of policy changes, such as helping Afghanistan to clarify the mandate of the new Provincial Councils elected in 2005, or Maldives to develop a policy for newly elected local governments in 2009. 5 \ufffd A two-year partnership between the Regional Centre Governance and Capacity Development teams and the Country Office has contributed to Indonesia becoming a middle-income policy pioneer. This has included the development and signing of the Jakarta Commitments by the Government and 21 development partners, setting out a strong aid policy. To implement these commitments, the Country Office established a Government-led, multi-donor Aid for Development Effectiveness programme, which has attracted contributions of more than US$1.4 million. \ufffd The Centre established a Capacity Development for Development Effectiveness Facility with Asian Development Bank, World Bank and the Government of Japan. This has facilitated South- South collaboration, as well as between governments and donors, on challenges such as establishing effective mechanisms for reviewing joint accountability for development results in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Nepal, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam. The facility has provided opportunities for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Samoa and Sri Lanka to influence international policy processes such as those led by the UN Development Cooperation Forum and the OECD. \ufffd As an increasing number of countries recognize that strengthening all citizens\u2019 voice is critical to fostering participation of the poor, the regional initiative on Communication for Empowerment in Asia has begun to focus on indigenous peoples as one of the most marginalized groups. Working in Nepal, Lao PDR, Timor-Leste, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Cambodia, more indigenous peoples have access to government information through improved information flows and strengthened community media, such as community radio. Our Biggest Success The Regional Centre has promoted a human rights-based approach to access to justice in country programmes, balancing capacity development of justice institutions with empowerment of the poor. This has carved out a specific, innovative niche for UNDP, which has inspired a movement across Asia and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd71056b-7bc6-4804-8ee1-9ad75d2a534a": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd71056b-7bc6-4804-8ee1-9ad75d2a534a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Taking Care of Business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c0bf7fff4206a439459273ffbfa792bf69e97b17ab591de2a017f9fe1975994"}}, "hash": "2c0bf7fff4206a439459273ffbfa792bf69e97b17ab591de2a017f9fe1975994", "text": "the Pacific. More than a dozen rights-based access to justice country initiatives have been started, in Indonesia, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Lao PDR, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam. On average, for every US$100,000 invested by UNDP, we have raised at least an additional US$1,000,000 in partner funding. In Indonesia, the ratio has risen as high as US$23,000,000 per US$100,000 of UNDP investment, with our work leading to the first comprehensive access to justice assessment in the country, piloted in five provinces and targeting the poorest and most disadvantaged groups. This formed the basis for an initiative between UNDP and the Ministry of National Planning for legal empowerment and assistance for the disadvantaged, placing access to justice firmly on the agenda of Government and donors. Later, it supported development of the National Access to Justice Strategy incorporated into the Government\u2019s 2010-2014 Mid-Term Development Plan. Public complaint mechanisms and dialogues have empowered Indonesians to channel grievances related to service provision and to hold public officials accountable. 6 b) Poverty Reduction and Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals: At the Core Asia\u2019s dynamic development and spectacular economic growth rates have been marred by high levels of accompanying poverty and hunger. One reason for this disjuncture is rapidly rising inequalities. Policy shortfalls also account for relatively disappointing progress against poverty. The central objective of UNDP\u2019s regional poverty reduction work is to analyze and help to address such policy gaps. MDG objectives provide a practical framework for sustainable development that includes all social groups. The Poverty Reduction Team examines the role of both economic and social policies for achieving the Goals. Resource allocation priorities are defined by two processes: The primary determinant is Country Office demand and country priorities. The other important feature is to undertake regional work that allows sensitive national policy reform to be discussed in a neutral international framework. Our Results UNDP in Asia and the Pacific has built a strong reputation as an organization that helps address the central developmental challenge of poverty reduction, growing inequalities and advancing human development for the continent with the majority of the world\u2019s poor. Specific results include: \ufffd Assisting governments to respond strategically to the social and economic impacts of the global food, fuel and financial crisis, through providing technical expertise on monitoring and assessment. In India, Indonesia and Viet Nam, together with our partners, such as UNICEF, we have supported periodic quick-impact surveys and prepared 14 country case studies, as well as a regional synthesis study, that are allowing more strategic responses. Our regional advocacy on the crisis to senior government officials has highlighted the human and social costs. During 2010, 10 country-level dialogues have been planned to assist countries with recovery from the global economic shock. \ufffd In the area of trade, evidence-based policy recommendations in more than 20 countries have led to the design and implementation of innovative, high-impact projects in Afghanistan, Nepal, Pakistan, Mongolia, Cambodia and China. Our aid-for-trade approaches, for LDC and low-income countries in particular, provide a basis for trade capacity development projects by donors. The poverty reduction programme has contributed substantively to building the trade capacities of Bhutan, Cambodia, Nepal, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and Samoa, allowing them to maximize their gains from globalization. \ufffd The South Asia Economic Summit, which we helped conceptualize, has led to substantive engagement on regional trade integration in South Asia, with specific proposals being taken note of by the Secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. South-South trade cooperation has been strengthened through use of an expanded knowledge analytical base built in cooperation with UN and multilateral partners. \ufffd A pioneering campaign to reduce inequality and hunger was led by the Regional Centre with active involvement of partner UN agencies. Some 40 members of parliament from across the region have signed a resolution containing policy reform measures to follow up at national level; 7 regional media and academia have provided significant support by highlighting the need for urgent action in countries such as Nepal, Pakistan, India, Cambodia and Bangladesh. \ufffd Lastly, the Regional Centre brought international good practices on poverty reduction to the attention of Asian policymakers. Practical information on conditional cash transfers, for example, has been provided by Latin American experts who designed and implemented these schemes. We have advocated such practical measures for security for the poorest since 2006, and several Asian countries have adopted such programmes. Our Biggest Success The Regional Centre provided the substantive research that led to development and global adoption of a simple but robust macroeconomic framework that assists policymakers in assessing the economic impact of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b39f0aa-daf5-4f8f-adf7-76b105ab4875": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b39f0aa-daf5-4f8f-adf7-76b105ab4875", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Taking Care of Business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c14e9cf6b521ec7b99e4060f676aa5ca5321ea90ed32d81bba419f7c98b27949"}}, "hash": "c14e9cf6b521ec7b99e4060f676aa5ca5321ea90ed32d81bba419f7c98b27949", "text": "scaling up public expenditures to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. This is critical if governments are to formulate credible Goal-based national development plans, which has now occurred in Bhutan, Mongolia and Nepal. The Centre was the first regional programme in UNDP to emphasize the need to involve United Nations Country Teams as a whole as an instrumental partner in training government counterparts in Goal-related needs assessment methodologies and institutionalizing Goal-consistent macroeconomic frameworks, as well as in technical backstopping for sectoral strategies. The success of our macroeconomic modelling tool provided a new programming niche for UNDP Country Offices and has complemented a unique integration of costing, financing and policy advice that we offer to our partners. The latter has focused in countries such as Maldives and Lao PDR on supporting national policymakers\u2019 examination of how to secure and leverage additional donor funding for poverty reduction; these plans will be presented to donors during 2010. 8 c) Crisis Prevention and Recovery: Tackling Risks The region\u2019s vulnerability to natural hazards and armed conflict is on a rapid upswing, with more than 50 major disasters affecting millions of people just since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. At the same time, capacities to manage disaster risks are lagging. The Regional Centre mobilizes funds and provides cutting-edge technical expertise to crisis-prone countries, relying on regular consultations with key government authorities and detailed needs assessment and analysis. Its work focuses on (1) regional and multi-year disaster risk initiatives to address common issues; (2) demand-driven and country-specific technical support and funding; and (3) emergency support to countries at high risk of recurring natural and manmade crisis. Our Results The Regional Centre helps to make risks more visible before they occur and promotes deeper understanding of the linkages between poverty and disaster risk. We also work to ensure that disaster risk is sustainably integrated into national development policies, plans and programmes under the global Hyogo Framework for Action. Our results include: \ufffd Building risk knowledge at regional, national and local levels, particularly given that the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami came as a tragic surprise. We have helped to establish and implement nationally owned disaster loss databases in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and India\u2019s Tamil Nadu state to analyze disaster trends and impacts, based on 30 years of history. These processes have been consolidated into policy guidelines shared across the region, with the methodology extended to Nepal, Iran and Pakistan; Data are being used to influence numerous decisions, plans and budget allocations; for example, the Disaster Management Centre in Sri Lanka has used the loss database to prioritize and budget district preparedness and mitigation initiatives and associated budgeting. \ufffd The disaster loss databases we established have been groundbreaking globally in assessing the relationship between natural hazards and poverty, underpinning the fact that 85 percent of disaster mortality risk is concentrated in lower-middle-income countries. Replication of the methodology is planned in Indonesia, Viet Nam and Philippines. Analysis by the Regional Centre in countries such as Iran, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka also has shown that over a long period of time, losses from largely unnoticed \u201cextensive events\u201d \u2013 low-intensity but high- frequency occurrences, such as flooding or heavy rains \u2013 have as much impact on lives and livelihoods of the poor and vulnerable as do high-intensity but low-frequency \u201cintensive events\u201d that capture the most international attention (earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones). \ufffd We have provided critical technical support, training and policy advice to the development of new disaster risk management laws, legal frameworks and institutions in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand, with work continuing in Maldives, Cambodia and Philippines. Such laws lay the foundation to ensure the safety of risk-prone communities and implementation of pre- and post-disaster actions. In Indonesia, for example, we helped to establish a national \u201csurge\u201d capacity that has responded quickly and effectively after disasters such as the September 2009 earthquake in West Sumatra. In Philippines, joint work with the Environment team has resulted in approval of a new law to address climate change. Disaster risk reduction also is being integrated into the secondary education curriculum in Philippines, Cambodia and Lao PDR as a result of our mobilization of external resources for training modules for teachers. 9 \ufffd Since the 2004 tsunami, UNDP has perfected its rapid and coordinated response time in emergencies to between 24 and 72 hours after the disaster. This has been put to the test in response to 54 natural disasters across Asia and the Pacific since 2005, with the Regional Centre leading efforts to establish sustainable recovery systems, processes, standard operating procedures and funding mechanisms. In turn, this helps to re-establish livelihoods, community", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "243653f1-5a64-4e0b-a8c7-58116ce7fa5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "243653f1-5a64-4e0b-a8c7-58116ce7fa5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Taking Care of Business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "240da83439ab582c995ed33c4d93b41da3cf21e3f56458f2bac53a3647b170a2"}}, "hash": "240da83439ab582c995ed33c4d93b41da3cf21e3f56458f2bac53a3647b170a2", "text": "infrastructure and income-generating opportunities for disaster-affected people. In 2009 alone, China, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Philippines, Myanmar, Viet Nam, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Bhutan, Samoa, Tonga and Thailand were provided with immediate support in response to sudden crisis, including drought, earthquakes, cyclones/typhoons, floods and landslides. \ufffd In peace-building, the Regional Centre was requested to provide urgent assistance to conflict- ridden Timor-Leste during a political crisis in 2006 that saw the resignation of the Prime Minister, the formation of an interim government, and renewed international peacekeeping assistance. Crisis Prevention and Recovery and Governance teams from the Centre were deployed rapidly and provided technical assistance to cash-for-work programmes for unemployed youth, economic recovery for displaced persons, support to the Ministry of Justice to help it deal with increased crisis-linked caseloads, and initiatives to promote dialogue and reconciliation. A Women in Self-Employment programme, established in partnership with the Secretariat of State for Vocational Training and Employment, has created market-oriented job opportunities for nearly 800 women entrepreneurs. Overall, stability has been restored, and Timor-Leste has not relapsed into conflict. \ufffd In Pakistan, the Regional Centre focused on civilians caught in the crossfire during the Government\u2019s action against Taliban militants in NWFP in 2009, which resulted in the displacement of some 2 million people. US$200,000 emergency funding was provided for needs assessments and improved coordination, ensuring efficiency and avoiding duplication for return and reintegration strategies. We also mobilized seed funds of US$2 million for a comprehensive peace building and recovery programme, on the basis of which the Country Office was able to mobilize a more than a further US$12 million. Our Biggest Success Following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami tragedy, the Regional Centre has been proactive in the formulation of numerous effective short- and long-term disaster responses. One was in pioneering a common approach for assessing tsunami risk in the Indian Ocean, in collaboration with the Intergovernmental Coordination Group for the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System and UNESCO. This has now been officially adopted by all 28 member states of the warning system. Critically, we also helped build end-to-end tsunami early warning systems in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Thailand and India, designed to prevent a recurrence of the overwhelming loss of life in 2004. In so doing, we have trained senior disaster management, academic and meteorology officials from 14 countries in Asia and Africa to apply and sustain the region-wide standard operating procedures. As a result, when a major earthquake occurred off Sumatra in Indonesia in September 2009, the national tsunami warning agency was able to issue a tsunami warning within five minutes of detecting the quake. A month later, a total of 18 countries and coastal communities successfully tested the new early warning system in the first tsunami warning exercise around the Indian Ocean. This will become an annual event to assure continued readiness of vulnerable communities. 10 d) Environment and Energy: Contributing to Quality of Life The Environment and Energy work of the Regional Centre encompasses ecosystems and natural resources, biodiversity, climate change mitigation and adaptation, energy, ozone layer protection and chemicals management. It is driven by demand for our services, as articulated as country level, and also by opportunities that emerge through dialogue with Country Offices and partners. Since 2006 we have mobilized US$167 million in environmental finance for initiatives across the region, from sources such as the Global Environment Facility, Least Developed Country Fund and Special Climate Change Fund. Our Results The Regional Centre assists national and regional initiatives that transform, influence and develop markets for energy efficiency, renewable energy and low-greenhouse gas-emitting technologies. Many interventions create enabling policy or regulatory frameworks; programmes also expand electricity access to households and help address local and national environmental issues such as urban air pollution and acid rain. These benefits are vital to improving the quality of life of people across Asia and the Pacific. \ufffd Through 39 market interventions, UNDP\u2019s has helped 15 countries in Asia-Pacific to reduce 51.19 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to Sweden\u2019s CO2 emissions in 2006. China accounts for three-quarters of the total emission reductions achieved. Across the region, we have supported commercialization of 21 clean technologies, such as wind, biomass, solar and hydro; energy-efficient technologies for buildings (including lighting and appliances) and industrial processes; and sustainable transport measures. An important aspect of our work is the linkage to sustainable livelihoods and poverty alleviation: Recently completed initiatives in Iran and Bhutan have introduced alternative sources of income and mobilized communities to manage natural resources by either sequestering carbon or reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \ufffd Also with regard to climate change, we have developed an", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99de3eac-dcb1-4590-b63b-fdeeff578480": {"__data__": {"id_": "99de3eac-dcb1-4590-b63b-fdeeff578480", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Taking Care of Business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7893181e8e6eadfc4ccc894f3c19fe0871dd8cb36c7226cc9bae37e2cb9b0225"}}, "hash": "7893181e8e6eadfc4ccc894f3c19fe0871dd8cb36c7226cc9bae37e2cb9b0225", "text": "approach for \u201cclimate-proofing\u201d United Nations programmes, followed by sensitization of Country Offices in how to apply the approach. Initial screenings of key Country Programme documents have been carried out in Maldives, Viet Nam, Indonesia, China and India, among others. These have then been used as a basis for identifying entry points that can strengthen overall resilience to climate-related risks. Our thematic priorities for climate adaptation include coastal zone management, freshwater resources, health, agriculture and forestry, and disaster management. Geographic priorities are set on the basis of vulnerability to, and economic impacts of, anticipated climate change impacts, as well as country leadership and our comparative advantages in capacity development. \ufffd Creating or strengthening national parks or protected area networks to secure critical ecosystem services such as groundwater supply also represents a crucial element of our work. The Regional Centre has helped to bring more than 6 million hectares of critical ecosystem landscapes \u2013 an area larger than Thailand \u2013 under sustainable management in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia and other countries. \ufffd We are demonstrating sustainable management of croplands across more than 100,000 ha in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, addressing the unsustainable land management practices that 11 are destroying croplands, devastating livelihoods and exacerbating desertification and dust storms in arid and semi-arid areas of the region. Our demonstrations are helping farmers and agricultural extension systems to improve agricultural productivity and livelihoods while reducing the loss of crucial land, on which many poor and marginalized communities depend. \ufffd In Bhutan, Regional Centre advocacy and technical expertise linking poverty reduction and environmental issues resulted in an increased allocation of Government funds for pro-poor environmental activities such as climate adaptation by local governments. We supported the Department of Public Accounts to undertake an environmental public expenditure analysis to determine the major trends of Government spending on the environment; it found that while Bhutan has relatively high spending on environment and natural resources, this has declined in recent years. \ufffd To address the overfishing that is devastating global tuna stocks, the Regional Centre supports the Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency in bringing together 15 governments of the Central Western Pacific to coordinate management of the world\u2019s largest remaining stocks. The introduction of sustainable, science-based management of fish and their habitats in Kiribati, Tonga and Solomon Islands has resulted in improved flow and quality of fisheries data; new analyses of environmental impacts on yellowfin and bigeye tuna; and comprehensive estimates of catch levels. This has successfully strengthened the capacities of Pacific Island states to sustainably develop their oceanic resources in an area of very high significance for global food production and marine biodiversity. Our Biggest Success A Regional Centre-supported Solar Photovoltaic programme in Malaysia has been making strong progress since 2005 in mitigating climate change. The main goal of the programme, which was included in the 9th Malaysia Plan, is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector as well as the long-term cost of photovoltaic technology, which converts solar radiation into direct- current electricity. It has transformed the local photovoltaic market, contributing to energy security and offsetting a significant percentage of conventional peak energy requirements. Moreover, it has reduced by 19 percent the cost of Building Integrated Photovoltaic systems, which are built into the roof or walls of a structure. Thus far, the programme has already reduced carbon dioxide emission by 550 tonnes, about half of the targeted total, and has more than doubled its targeted capacity of installed Building Integrated Photovoltaic systems, at 1,065 kilowatt-peak. The Centre led the conceptualization and design of the programme, facilitated access to financing from the Global Environment Facility, and provided technical backstopping and monitoring services as well as administrative support. A major offshoot has been the launching of the National SURIA 1000 Programme in 2006, Malaysia\u2019s pioneering financial incentive scheme for solar energy; the programme provides attractive financial discounts for homeowners wanting to install photovoltaic technology in their homes, with the goal of allowing anyone in the country to have their own photovoltaic system to generate their own electricity. 12 e) HIV and Development: Integrating Responses The UNDP Regional HIV and Development Programme is guided by the global division of labour among UNAIDS co-sponsors as well as the strategic priorities of UNDP at the global and regional levels. Thus, the Regional Centre seeks to address the human development, governance, human rights, gender and trans-border challenges of HIV and AIDS in Asia and the Pacific. We work in close partnership with UNAIDS and its co-sponsors; other United Nations organizations such as the United Nations Development Fund for Women, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1abfacc-048f-4bf4-8799-1c2bc51f6947": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1abfacc-048f-4bf4-8799-1c2bc51f6947", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Taking Care of Business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54e018327300d2dca804c4b2f27c03fdb14ab47b75d70b17444abe15f4763d0c"}}, "hash": "54e018327300d2dca804c4b2f27c03fdb14ab47b75d70b17444abe15f4763d0c", "text": "and the International Organization for Migration; national governments; civil society and community- based organizations and their regional networks; and regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and Secretariat of the Pacific Community. Our Results The Regional Centre focuses attention on integrated and multi-sectoral responses to help countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals, including halting the spread of HIV/AIDS. We address the vulnerability of sexual minorities, marginalized communities and mobile populations, as well as the empowerment of people living with HIV, particularly women. Capacities of communities and civil society organizations are enhanced for their meaningful participation in policies and programmes. This has resulted in: \ufffd Creation of a joint initiative on HIV/AIDS in Southeast Asia and southern China that brought together governments, civil society and the United Nations to promote universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support for mobile and migrant populations. This has been recognized as a global best practice by the European Union and UNAIDS. In addition, high-level advocacy has brought migrants\u2019 right to health, including HIV services, to the forefront. \ufffd A pioneering seven-country study on the HIV vulnerabilities of Asian migrant women in the Arab States region, conducted with United Nations and civil society partners, has led to programme interventions in Philippines and Sri Lanka. Action is proposed in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. \ufffd The Centre, linking the HIV/AIDS and Poverty/Millennium Development Goals teams, developed a model regional tool to help governments and others estimate short-, medium- and long-term resources needed for comprehensive HIV responses, as well as per-unit costs. The tool, developed in consultation with UNAIDS, Asian Development Bank and the UNDP Bureau of Development Policy, has significantly broadened the approach of costing beyond the health sector only. It has been used in Mongolia, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Papua New Guinea. \ufffd Two innovative, high-level Courts of Women, organized by the Regional Centre, have brought the critical HIV-related issues of inheritance/property rights and human trafficking to a wider regional audience through powerful testimonials by HIV-positive women, analysis by leading experts and statements by an eminent \u201cjury.\u201d Policy outcomes have included legal steps in Nepal on women\u2019s inheritance and property rights and moves in Indonesia to address trafficking and HIV. Important partners in introducing the Courts have included the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, United Nations Development Fund for Women, Asian 13 Women\u2019s Human Rights Council, Asia Pacific Network of People Living With HIV, and Yakeba, a leading civil society organization in Indonesia. \u201cOn behalf of the Indonesian Government, I would certainly support any kind of means to follow up the commitment of the forum in advocating [for] women with HIV/AIDS and combating human trafficking.\u201d Meutia Hatta, Minister for Women\u2019s Empowerment, following participation in the Court of Women at the 9th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, August 2009 \ufffd To address the vulnerability of men having sex with men as well as sexual minorities, the Centre has helped to initiate strategic interventions for these groups, built capacity to reduce stigma and discrimination, and mobilized key financial and technical resources for regional and country-level interventions. We have supported Indonesia and Philippines in designing and implementing specific relevant programmes, and have been instrumental in establishing the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health and forming national networks of men having sex with men. \ufffd The Asia-Pacific Community of Practice on HIV, Gender and Human Rights is an interactive, dynamic regional knowledge network of nearly 200 members. It was initiated by the Centre\u2019s HIV, Governance and Gender Equality teams along with UNAIDS, the United Nations Development Fund for Women, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Asia-Pacific Network of People Living With HIV. To complement its first regional e-discussion, it has provided country-level support with UNAIDS and the United Nations Development Fund for Women for national studies on the issue of HIV and intimate partner transmission in Sri Lanka and Nepal. This has provided evidence that is being integrated into national programmatic actions. \ufffd Based on a large-scale study in India led by UNDP, the Regional Centre has developed a methodology for assessing the socioeconomic impact of HIV at the household level and is supporting Country Offices and governments in finding ways to mitigate such impact. The need for further such assessments has been acknowledged and is being used for large-scale studies in China, Cambodia and Indonesia as well; related technical support is being provided to Viet Nam. The Centre also is engaged in helping to mitigate the impact of the external shocks", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5a24ea4-e5d4-4e54-85d9-f09ec61f1f7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5a24ea4-e5d4-4e54-85d9-f09ec61f1f7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Taking Care of Business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3c5458f2c46e6e4e4efd3598245d7855bfe4b83d5cbc62c1a5c00bb719334cdc"}}, "hash": "3c5458f2c46e6e4e4efd3598245d7855bfe4b83d5cbc62c1a5c00bb719334cdc", "text": "such as food, fuel and financial crisis on people living with HIV and their households. Our Biggest Success Using creative advocacy, research, high-level policy discussions and capacity development, the Regional Centre has been able to raise a number of highly sensitive HIV-related issues across the region, including trafficking, migration, human rights, men having sex with men, violence against women, and inheritance and property rights. This has created an enabling environment for such issues to be addressed at national levels, through joint United Nations programmes and civil society interventions alike. Policy or programmatic action on one or more of these has directly resulted in countries including China, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bangladesh. 14 f) Gender Equality: Strong Partnerships Women constitute 70 percent of the poor in Asia and the Pacific. Moreover, during the current food, fuel and financial crisis, and with the acceleration of climate change issues, the development vulnerabilities for women have only been exacerbated. In the face of these dynamics, the Regional Centre has built momentum by working across various development disciplines, connecting people and leveraging the diverse knowledge of not only UNDP but also our partners to work toward gender equality. Our Results Knowledge management, capacity development and expanded partnerships, both internal and external, represent the Regional Centre\u2019s three pillars for gender equality. Our partners have included GTZ, the Asian Institute of Technology and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, among others; these entities have specifically requested our assistance in harnessing cross-country experiences to enrich the development agenda in the region. Other achievements include: \ufffd From 2005, the Regional Centre\u2019s Gender Equality team began partnering with others from the Centre, including the Regional Indigenous Peoples Programme and the Democratic Governance team, to maximize impact through capacity development and joint events. This led to the convening of an Asia Young Leaders in Governance programme, which has provided a platform for young women identified as potential leaders in government, civil society, media and the private sector to receive relevant training and share experiences. This initiative supported pilots in China, India, Philippines and Bangladesh, and has since had several offshoots at national and sub-national levels. We also have paired the Gender Equality and Capacity Development teams to produce a package of sustainable capacity development initiatives that ensures the integration of gender into government strategies and plans; this will be rolled out in 2010 in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Philippines and Timor-Leste. \ufffd In Cambodia, as in other Country Offices, our sustained assistance to both programme and policy work has resulted in a gender-sensitive national household survey and questionnaire, as well as the gathering of sex-disaggregated data, that have allowed important national development tools to reflect gender concerns more effectively. Our technical expertise also enabled development of a \u201croad map\u201d to set up the first cross-party caucus of women parliamentarians, an important step in ensuring women\u2019s meaningful participation in public affairs. \ufffd Associations formed through the Regional Gender Community of Practice have enabled the Centre to connect countries with corporate thinking on gender equality, and to support them in integrating gender in national-level policies. To review a proposed capacity development package on gender integration, for example, a regional working group formed through the Community of Practice has inspired seven countries to express interest in rolling out the full package in 2010. 15 Our Biggest Success Citing virtually evidence of reduced violence against women across the region despite decades of work by the international community, UNDP\u2019s Asia-Pacific Regional Gender Steering Committee in 2006 challenged the Regional Centre to explore the following questions: (1) What else could be done to prevent violence against women in the region? What is innovative and can complement existing work? (2) What is the value addition of a regional programme on this topic? and (3) What should be UNDP\u2019s role in supporting this process? In response, the Centre spent 18 months conducting broad-based consultations with leading United Nations partners, including the United Nations Population Fund, United Nations Development Fund for Women and United Nations Volunteers, as well as with governments and non-government organizations. What we came up with was the Partners for Prevention programme, an influential joint regional initiative for gender-based violence prevention that addresses the strategic niche of deeply engaging men and boys as allies with women. The programme offers cutting-edge technical assistance in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and Viet Nam, selected by criteria of combined government, civil society and United Nations demand. Programme resources are used in a catalytic fashion to spur longer-term national-level support; UNDP\u2019s contribution is US$1 million over four years.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abb63beb-1636-444d-a7de-f73ccb955b5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "abb63beb-1636-444d-a7de-f73ccb955b5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Taking Care of Business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e884941673fc58c6b918a6b8253591c4567a8d3ff470ea4e140e9f635bcda6a"}}, "hash": "2e884941673fc58c6b918a6b8253591c4567a8d3ff470ea4e140e9f635bcda6a", "text": "We consolidate the four United Nations partners\u2019 various areas of work, using new media such as Facebook and Twitter to build awareness of gender-based violence with young people and building capacity by convening sub-regional groups of expert trainers. In 2009, the programme helped form the Asia-Pacific Standing Committee of Male Parliamentarians, which is committed to addressing violence against women and in Asia and the Pacific. We plan a number of regional policy dialogues in 2010 based on consolidated evidence. g) Capacity Development: The Heart of UNDP\u2019s Mandate Capacity development is the \u201chow\u201d of making development work better, and represents the heart of UNDP\u2019s mandate. Without supportive policies and laws, well-functioning organizations, and educated and skilled people, countries lack the foundation to plan, implement and review their development strategies. The Regional Centre\u2019s Capacity Development Team provides strategic and on-demand services to all our core areas as well as to Country Offices, whether focused on elections, poverty reduction strategies or climate change adaptation. We bring to our clients a more systematic approach to understanding, analyzing and investing in change that transforms and sustains the capacities of individuals, institutions and their communities to contribute to the Millennium Development Goals and broader people-centred development. We offer diagnostics, change management and learning tools, capacity development indicators and trackers, quality assurance, and global as well as regional knowledge of what works. 16 Our Results Among our initiatives toward institutional reform, access to global knowledge and learning systems, and support to strategic planning and leadership, our notable results have included: \ufffd Facilitating a \u201ctwinning\u201d agreement whereby Government officials from India coach and advise their counterparts in Afghanistan, resulting in enhanced Afghan civil service capacities and institutional strengthening, as well as the establishment of effective new rules, systems and procedures. \ufffd In Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Indonesia, Lao PDR and Philippines, institutional change and capacity development strengthening for national disaster management agencies has allowed the smoother implementation of national disaster management plans and strategies under the Hyogo Framework for Action. \ufffd In Malaysia, we assisted the Human Rights Commission to establish internal procedures and processes, coordination mechanisms and accountable decision-making processes, backed by standardized monitoring and evaluation policies and mechanisms. Support came not only from our Capacity Development and Democratic Governance teams, but also from UNDP Malaysia, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the Asia-Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions. \ufffd In Nepal, we have helped to formulate a system of performance-based grants that have been institutionalized in national policy and provided to all districts for local-level development (see also Democratic Governance). The public is made aware of the funds that their District Development Committee has received, thereby enabling them to hold officials accountable. The public also is informed of whether their local government has met specific performance criteria to receive bonus funds. Our Biggest Success Globally, much of the work on climate change adaptation and mitigation has been largely at the technical level, focused on climate change science. But at the Regional Centre, we have been influential in recognizing the increasing urgency to address the institutional capacity development needs that also must be answered in order to effectively tackle climate change challenges. In Philippines, the Government is systematically assessing such needs by sector to produce capacity assessment frameworks for a range of key actors and localize climate change adaptation, such a \u201cclimate-proofing\u201d land use, into local government plans. As the first such attempt in Asia and the Pacific, it identified line Ministries, agencies, Civil Society Organizations, academic institutions, Local Government Units and others that have functions related to climate change. Based on Government officials\u2019 and civil society ratings, the agencies with the least capacity to adapt to climate change were found to be the Department of Health and Department of National Defence. A multi-sectoral capacity development plan to support climate change adaptation will be rolled out in 2010. This innovative exercise also represents an important \u201cone UN\u201d approach in the region; in addition to UNDP, other United Nations Agencies are supporting this innovative programme, including United Nations Environment Programme, UN-Habitat, Food and Agriculture Organization, International Labour Organization and World Health Organization. 17 h) The Pacific: A Special Focus Since early 2006, the Regional Centre\u2019s Pacific branch has worked with the three UNDP Country Offices as a key catalyst on behalf of 15 Pacific Island Countries, partnering governments, intergovernmental organizations and non-government agencies across the sub-region. The basis for UNDP\u2019s Pacific work is the October 2005 Pacific Plan, which promotes regional cooperation and integration and national solutions that are coordinated as well as effective.

We undertake targeted trans-national research, pilot initiatives and advocacy relevant to the Millennium Development Goals, focusing on pro-poor macroeconomic and human development policies, democratic governance, gender equality and crisis prevention. In all our work, we promote the role of women in development. Our Results Whether it be increasing the number of women in parliament or getting governments the data they need to establish better social protection or disaster risk management measures, these programmes started with the Regional Centre educating, building consensus, creating partnerships regionally, and providing targeted technical expertise at national level to show how it is done. The team in the Pacific has raised the profile of UNDP in the Pacific while attracting substantial additional resources for key development activities. For example: \ufffd Through stressing poverty analysis and achievement of the MDGs as key policy issues, the Regional Centre has helped introduce substantive gender-, child- and age-disaggregated poverty indicators in the Pacific. These are being used to shape targeted economic and social policies on behalf of the poor; by 2010, 12 countries had completed at least one national Millennium Development Goal Report, and nine new poverty analyses had been conducted. As a result, donors decided to provide additional budgetary support to Tuvalu equivalent to 15 percent of Gross Domestic Product. Kiribati initiated a revision of its governance, investment management and investment strategies, and Samoa used disaggregated data on household education expenditures to introduce new social protection measures with support from Asian Development Bank. \ufffd Responding to the acute lack of female representation in Pacific parliaments, the Centre has worked with partners to advocate the use of temporary special measures for women, resulting in legislative reform in Papua New Guinea, Federated States of Micronesia, Solomon Islands and Cook Islands. Working with UNIFEM, the Centre also has advanced implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, through development of pioneering legislative compliance indicators for 12 Pacific Island Countries that are being adapted in South-East Asia as well. 18 \ufffd The Centre has promoted Freedom of Information and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption as entry points for strengthening government accountability systems. In Nauru, it assisted in drafting Freedom of Information provisions in a new Constitution approved by Parliament. In Fiji, technical advice on Freedom of Information has informed the Government of international good practices and implementation challenges. The number of Pacific Island Countries ratifying the anti-corruption Convention has risen from one in 2007 to three in 2009. The Centre has given technical assistance in Papua New Guinea to develop an anti-corruption strategy and will undertake corruption gap analysis in Palau in 2010. \ufffd The Centre\u2019s Pacific branch has pursued a vigorous resource mobilization strategy that has yielded close to an extra US$20 million for the period 2006-2009 \u2013 nearly triple the regular resources. Australia and New Zealand have contributed nearly half of the resources for our work in the Pacific, along with other parts of UNDP and the United Nations as a whole. \ufffd Our advocacy on the human dimension of security issues has led to a key shift in policy by the leadership body of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat that sets the sub-regional security agenda. Pacific leaders have adopted guiding principles for land management and conflict minimization, and strengthened regional crisis response as well as dialogue with civil society organizations. Underpinning our conflict prevention approach is a focus on gender equality, which has resulted in sustained input by women\u2019s organizations into regional security processes. Technical advice to the Solomon Islands led to the design of a Cabinet-approved socioeconomic rehabilitation package for ex-combatants, vulnerable groups and host communities, along with legislation to establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. \ufffd We have mobilized US$72 million for country-level energy and environment projects in the Pacific. Technical backstopping for biomass/biofuels, solar, wind and other renewable energy initiatives has been provided to the Republic of Marshall Islands, Tokelau, Palau, Tuvalu and Solomon Islands. \ufffd Since 2006, the Centre has partnered with the Pacific Islands Applied Geosciences Commission to advocate for the mainstreaming of disaster risk management into national planning and budgeting. As a result, Vanuatu has made its first allocation for risk reduction \u2013 about US$270,000 \u2013 and the Republic of Marshall Islands and Cook Islands have directed more donor support toward activities in this area. The process also has resulted in greater alignment between disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. \ufffd Rapid support has been provided to Tonga and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1325494-a1b6-4ad5-995b-296312eb1ad1": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1325494-a1b6-4ad5-995b-296312eb1ad1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Taking Care of Business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb3e4db8513e494c6e8b7b690d4921aad889f29b3994f2bfee7931f76c46637a"}}, "hash": "fb3e4db8513e494c6e8b7b690d4921aad889f29b3994f2bfee7931f76c46637a", "text": "Samoa for early recovery following a tsunami in September 2009, and US$800,000 was mobilized. For Fiji, the Centre mobilized US$100,000 for early recovery to support the agriculture sector following major floods in January 2009. Risk reduction and early recovery efforts also have been enhanced through a newly initiated programme of cooperation between the Pacific and Caribbean regions, which has resulted in establishment of a web-based portal used as a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d by Government and humanitarian agencies after natural disasters. 19 Our Biggest Success The Centre has been instrumental in bringing financial education to the Pacific and catalysing a new, multi-donor programme to promote financial competency among children and adults. In its first month of existence, August 2008, the Centre\u2019s Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme partnered with the International Monetary Fund for a meeting of Pacific Islands finance ministers, central bank governors and donors, resulting in a written commitment to financial education for citizens. Through expert assistance, the programme also has helped central bank governors develop national regulations and policies that make it easier for low-income households to have access to savings and other financial services. In a key partnership with ANZ Bank, the Centre has addressed the growing importance of remittances from migrant workers by delivering financial literacy training to nearly 23,000 rural people in Fiji, of whom 41 percent were women. Fiji also has developed a five-year financial inclusion strategy with our assistance. A further 20,000 rural people (43 percent women) have received financial literacy training from ANZ and UNDP in Solomon Islands, Tonga and Samoa. The Centre also helped develop a financial education school curriculum that was piloted in Samoa, which has led to other countries, including Tonga, adopting a similar approach. A business mentoring programme we designed has been institutionalized at the Pacific Islands Private Sector Organization with support from New Zealand. The Financial Inclusion Programme approved six grants in 2009 to banks, mobile network operators and others to develop or launch branchless and mobile phone banking services across six Pacific Islands. These grantees have committed to reaching an additional 500,000 \u201cun-banked\u201d Pacific Islanders with financial services by 2011, of which 200,000 will be women. i) Asia-Pacific Human Development Reports: Powerful Advocacy Tools The Asia-Pacific Human Development Report is a powerful tool for promoting the idea that development is about people rather than economic growth alone. The Regional Centre\u2019s Human Development Report Unit prepares this important Report, which has been cited as one of UNDP\u2019s best publications. The work, which addresses often-sensitive regional issues, is inherently long- term and multi-dimensional, encompassing all UNDP programme areas. Because the building of relationships with internal and external experts and institutions is critical to produce an Asia-Pacific Human Development Report, a team approach is employed. Our partners include academia, think tanks, government agencies, civil society organizations, the private sector, the media, Country Offices, other UNDP regional programmes and teams, and additional United Nations Agencies. The Asia-Pacific Human Development Report process is highly participatory and uses expertise from within the region, promoting national buy-in and cooperation as well as building capacity to ground strategies and policy in the human development perspective. To support Country Offices\u2019 work across Asia and the Pacific on people-centred development, we develop capacity, assist with data and statistical analysis, and provide in-depth review and feedback on human development-focused documents. Requests also come from countries in other regions, 20 including Sudan and Uzbekistan, and other parts of UNDP, such as the Regional Centre for Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, Regional Bureau and Regional Centre for Latin America and the Caribbean, and the global Human Development Report Office. Because the number and complexity of requests have been growing, the Regional Centre has begun to prioritize Least Developed Countries and crisis countries. Individual requests from Country Offices for capacity development training are considered together and multi-Country Office learning events organized. This also promotes experience sharing. Our Results \ufffd The popularity of Human Development Reports is in itself an example of their influence. In Asia- Pacific nearly 100 Human Development Reports have been completed, including about 70 national reports, 21 state reports, 2 district reports, and one for a city government. \ufffd With the award-winning 2006 Asia-Pacific Human Development Report, Trade on Human Terms, the Senior Minister of Commerce in Cambodia used the Report to convince other Members of Parliament to further open up the economy and consciously promote the poverty reduction and human development potential of trade. Malaysia brought out a companion national report. \ufffd The 2008 Asia-Pacific Human Development Report, Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives, also garnered high-level attention and action to its central messages and recommendations.

In addition, an expert panel debating the Report at the 13th International Anti-Corruption Conference in Athens, Greece, used the Report to reach out to global partners. \u201cI implore all Government officials to read and analyze the [Asia-Pacific Human Development Report on corruption]. As Head of State, I also ask the same of all State institutions.\u201d President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Republic of Indonesia \ufffd The forthcoming Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010, Power, Voice and Rights: A Turning Point for Gender Equality in Asia and the Pacific already has gathered substantial attention (see Communications). \ufffd Another human development-focused publication, Building Security for the Poor: Potential and Prospects for Microinsurance in India (2007), also has received much attention within and outside Asia-Pacific. This study was extensively quoted in the 2008 Report of the Committee on Financial Inclusion set up by the Government of India. Outside the region, in 2007 the Microfinance Unit of the Central Bank of Sudan, after discussions in Khartoum, agreed to take into account many of the study\u2019s recommendations for micro-insurance programmes in the country. Copies also have been requested by the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany; because of continued demand, in 2009 the study has been updated and re-printed. 21 \ufffd Also in 2009, requests from Country Offices for virtual support to National Human Development Reports and related work increased by more than 50 percent over 2008. Over the last five years, the Regional Centre has contributed to research for reports in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Mongolia and Nepal, as well as sub-regional reports for South Asia. Advisory services were provided to the Government of Sri Lanka Bribery Commission on behalf of the Sri Lanka Country Office. For Bhutan the Regional Centre calculated a sub-national Human Development Index for all 20 districts in the country and developed methods to calculate such indices in the presence of limited information. Our Biggest Success The policy and advocacy impact of Trade on Human Terms, the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006, was considerable. The Report foresaw a number of issues that have surfaced in the current global food, fuel and financial crises: the neglect of agriculture, \u201cjobless growth\u201d and rising inequalities, all of which now demand solutions. It thus raised issues that are crucially important for Asia and the Pacific, with countries now beginning to address them in different ways. In addition to influencing Cambodia\u2019s actions, the Report has been used to provide policy advice to the Government of Indonesia on grounding its trade policy within a human development framework. In the first six months after launch, the Report saw coverage through 160 print and broadcast news articles; eventually webpage downloads reached some 50,000. Demand was so great that it led to high-level presentations to the U.S. State Department and the Ambassadors\u2019 Circle in New York. Trade on Human Terms received UNDP\u2019s award for excellence and innovation for a regional Human Development Report. j) Communications: Impact in \u2018Real Time\u2019 The Regional Centre has been responsible for numerous advocacy initiatives with lasting impact. The two Asia Regional Communications Advisors, based in Bangkok and New Delhi, serve as a \u201creal- time\u201d relay team with the Office of Communications in New York, the Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific, and Country Offices in the region. They offer communications training to national communications officers and programme officers as requested by Country Offices, shape key UNDP messages, contact major media and provide critical outreach support to Country Offices. Our Results The Regional Centre has developed a strong, lasting network of international contacts among journalists in the region and elsewhere. Advocacy opportunities are very wide and coverage of UNDP initiatives favourable, particularly through opinion articles in major regional and international news outlets that reach policymakers and influential readers or viewers.2 This includes: 2 Among others, BBC, CNN, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, International Herald Tribune, Washington Post, AlJazeera, Newsweek, The Economist, BusinessWeek, Bloomberg, Financial Times, The Guardian, South China Morning Post, Straits Times, The Times (London), Bangkok Post, Far Eastern Economic Review, StarTV, and national broadcasting networks across Asia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "374f77b5-7144-4732-812c-68ddbf71c8e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "374f77b5-7144-4732-812c-68ddbf71c8e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Taking Care of Business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9688d460cdf133bb0b75562acbc0e50c717fac532e9f5f919bf7a30ff8e9e4df"}, "2": {"node_id": "24c8c7d8-06ae-4098-8b4d-13d748b9e7fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b1babf62733669ecc6c683b6dae25e194ac8753142fc9c14d757d129292e09a"}}, "hash": "65474ee1fd57cec192db025ee8f0179c495ebe155cb4fd220cbe95b2a482587b", "text": "22 More than two dozen prominent editorials and letters, drafted, edited and placed by the Regional Centre, on such key UNDP advocacy topics as \u201cMelting Himalayas,\u201d \u201cOn Deepening Democracy in Asia\u201d and \u201cClimate Change and the Pacific.\u201d Creation of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c70635f-18eb-4737-b0f5-afc17677756a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c70635f-18eb-4737-b0f5-afc17677756a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Taking Care of Business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7424a58cb14918b17de6978da00f41cde3ea78d5b57548d927537ba67330f6ea"}}, "hash": "7424a58cb14918b17de6978da00f41cde3ea78d5b57548d927537ba67330f6ea", "text": "long-running commercials aired throughout the region, such as Public Service Announcements in several Asian languages on climate change, the Millennium Development Goals, corruption and gender. The anti-corruption commercial, for example, won a silver Saatchi and Saatchi advertising award for advocacy and was used as the premise for a global anti-corruption campaign by UNDP and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Interviews with UNDP senior management on the impact of the food, fuel and financial crises in Asia and regular publication of other UNDP features. Better understanding of UNDP\u2019s response to the region\u2019s major natural disasters, and media outreach support such as during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami or Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar in 2008. Acknowledgement of UNDP\u2019s role in historic, free and credible elections, including in Bangladesh and Bhutan. Recently in Indonesia, this also resulted in coverage of UNDP\u2019s voter education work. Meeting of the news needs of media in Asia and the Pacific during launches of flagship global, regional and national reports. The Centre coordinated the global launch in Bangkok of the 2009 Human Development Report on migration, which resulted in widespread coverage building on a series of prominent editorials on migration placed across the region, while a 2007 report on Oil Price Vulnerabilities in Asia garnered lengthy news stories in more than 60 major newspapers. More than a dozen video success stories from the region on YouTube and the UNDP website following Flipcam training for all national communications officers, organized by the Regional Centre. Exposure of tens of thousands of schoolchildren, as future decision makers, to UNDP themes from global and regional Human Development Reports. Annual Mahbub ul Haq Memorial School Debates on Human Development, organized in partnership with the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, are held in more than 1,300 schools in all eight South Asian countries. 23 Our Biggest Success A groundbreaking regional legal partnership with the Discovery Channel is putting the organization\u2019s disaster recovery work front and centre in the first one-hour UNDP documentary to air on commercial television. For the five-year anniversary of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, UNDP and Discovery Channel produced the documentary \u201cAnatomy of a Recovery,\u201d which is airing repeatedly throughout Asia in 2010. The legal framework for making the documentary, overseen by the Regional Communications Advisors, was the first of its kind for UNDP globally and opens up important new avenues for advocacy through production of future documentaries on commercial networks. In addition, a two-part film produced in partnership with the Television Trust for the Environment (tv/e) reached more than 200 million viewers worldwide, illustrating the key findings of the upcoming Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010 on gender. The film ran repeatedly on BBC World News and will be further broadcast on national networks when the Report is launched. Short \u201cspots\u201d using extracts from the film have been produced and will be used on YouTube and UNDP websites and for advocacy by the Regional Centre and Country Offices. The film also is being widely distributed to partners. k) Knowledge Management: In Many Ways, It\u2019s a SNAP Ease of access to information and knowledge generated and collated by the Regional Centre is an important aspect of knowledge management. The community of practice approach, bringing many individuals and organizations together, has proven a very effective mechanism to deliver on this priority. With Microsoft and others, the Regional Centre led the development in 2007 of the Solution Networks of Asia-Pacific Portal (SNAP), a customized portal built to meet the region\u2019s need for collaborative knowledge and information tools. SNAP has proven effective in supporting regional knowledge management and as a platform where the Centre\u2019s experts are able to perform their outreach and advisory functions more efficiently and to a broader audience. In all, SNAP has become a recognized and popular collaboration tool within UNDP, as well as for the regional United Nations community and other partners. More than 1,500 practitioners and partners are now connected through one doorway where the rooms abound with relevant material. With SNAP, the Centre has been successful in moving practitioners toward the most current technological and organizational means of knowledge management. 24 l) South-South Cooperation: A Catalytic Role Integrating South-South cooperation \u2013 the exchange of knowledge, resources and technology among developing nations \u2013 into all UNDP programmes is the responsibility of Asia-Pacific Country Offices and the regional programmes alike. The Regional Centre highlights good practices and shares knowledge to promote this. Our Results While each team at the Regional Centre can report on its use of South-South cooperation in programming, successful stand-alone South-South initiatives include: A catalytic role in mobilizing Southern expertise for recovery after the 2004", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1e2e467-dd02-42e0-9ef2-4ce9be2b008e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1e2e467-dd02-42e0-9ef2-4ce9be2b008e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Taking Care of Business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/taking-care-business", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be7dadba8647a70911d23281b6285edc15cefd05b487a2962af3beb79fe76ca9"}}, "hash": "be7dadba8647a70911d23281b6285edc15cefd05b487a2962af3beb79fe76ca9", "text": "Indian Ocean tsunami, filling assistance gaps faced by the disaster-affected countries and Country Offices. Developing- country experts were quickly mobilized to assist in designing, implementing, coordinating and monitoring recovery projects. The Regional Centre\u2019s flexible support has been commended not only by Country Offices, but also by UNDP\u2019s Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific. On community- based disaster risk reduction, the Centre has brought together non-government organizations and other parts of the United Nations that had limited opportunities for sharing best practices. Over the years, the Centre has increased its support for inter-regional exchanges, particularly with Africa or Latin America. Such arrangements usually address specific development challenges that a country or region may be working on, such as policies for promoting economic competitiveness. After these exchanges, several countries, including Ethiopia and Mexico, have gone back to finalize their work through use of the knowledge gained. The Centre also has assisted in Afghanistan in recovery of the fruit drying industry and strengthening of the civil service, bringing in experts from Malaysia and India respectively. Our Biggest Success The Regional Centre has partnered with the UNDP Country Office in Thailand and the Thailand International Cooperation Development Agency to move forward the global agenda with regard to South-South cooperation. It helped to engage the private sector, non-government organizations and academic institutions to clarify the principles of South-South cooperation and discuss these institutions\u2019 roles in Thailand\u2019s South-South strategy. At the 2009 United Nations High Level Conference on South-South Cooperation, Thailand\u2019s presentation of this strategy was lauded as highly informative on how to use and implement South-South cooperation. 25 m) Management and Operations Support The Regional Centre has offered dedicated management and operations support that complements our interventions on behalf of specific programmatic themes. Although the Regional Management Practice Team was dismantled on 31 December 2009, the purpose for which it was launched remains important: providing professional advisory support to Country Offices in finance, human resources, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), procurement, project/programme management, and security. Management and operations country missions were based on Country Office requests; specific expertise was marshalled on issues ranging from staff retreat facilitation to technical-level planning. Learning events, such as for finance managers, were consolidated from individual requests and thus responsive to similar issues in a large number of countries. Our pre- or post-audit reviews have helped to mitigate UNDP risk exposure in high-visibility countries such as Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan and Afghanistan. We also have promoted the rollout of important corporate initiatives in Country Offices across the region, resulting in establishment of the largest regional pool of UNDP project/programme managers trained in Prince2 technology; a regional advisory committee credited by Country Offices with improving procurement feedback and accelerating delivery; and development of a prototype that will be used to ensure Country Offices use corporate ICT standards. The Centre likewise has embraced UNDP\u2019s leadership role in the United Nations reform agenda, through capacity development of United Nations Country Teams in implementing the Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfers (HACT), a priority in support of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. 26 III. Does the Regional Centre make a Difference? As our five-year results show, the Regional Centre provides a pooled source of capacity that can both anticipate and respond to emerging regional and country challenges. The core of dedicated regional policy advisors underpins UNDP\u2019s practice architecture across Asia and the Pacific, via long- term engagement with the country offices, providing policy advice and implementation support, while linking and aligning this with global corporate work. \u201cI think the main unique selling point for the regional advisors is that they are an integral part of the substantive policy capacity of a Country Office,\u201d states Deirdre Boyd, Resident Representative a.i. and Country Director in India. \u201cWhen we want to interact with Government, donors or civil society, being able to deploy or use our own UNDP staff, albeit regionally based, enhances our credibility and substantive depth.\u201d Looking ahead, the Regional Centre still needs to develop and evolve. We must build on the lessons of the last five years. We must align the three major dimensions of our work \u2013 Country Office support, management of Regional Programmes and regional public goods, and knowledge management \u2013 while also ensuring we can articulate the different key results. We must balance responsiveness and service orientation with the ability to identify proactively emerging trends. Our work must evolve to take in forward-looking initiatives on issues such as the Millennium Development Goals+10; social protection, especially in response to the global financial crisis; gender equality; and others that do not fit neatly into one of UNDP\u2019s four core areas.

Key questions that we must address include: How can we introduce a broader approach to knowledge sharing, through our Communities of Practice and other initiatives? We must place even more emphasis on bringing holistic knowledge management to the forefront. That will entail understanding yet more deeply what is going on in each of our 37 countries, what UNDP\u2019s strengths are, what country-level projects are achieving, and deepening knowledge exchange across the region. How do we measure results better? For example, measurement of the impact of capacity development at regional or national levels is complex. It requires measuring progress toward implementation of new or revised policy positions, with subsequent changes in budget allocations and effective implementation; or even internal structural and cultural changes within governments, organizations or individual human behaviour. This can take time and require contributions from a range of partners and others. And, fundamentally, how do we organize ourselves to meet these emerging issues? All this will require even closer collaboration among our teams to break down any remaining silos. Deepening our understanding of development in the region will involve out locating staff to deal with key sub- regional issues, closer networking with regional institutions and improved knowledge capture. The Regional Centre also has both a responsibility and an opportunity to work closely with other UN agencies to provide coherent support to UN Country Teams. 27 IV.

The report builds on the statistical analysis undertaken for the Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VSNO) by David Abbott. The work benefited from support and technical input from the Vanuatu Government Statistician, Simil Johnson, who guided the analysis, and Kim Robertson, Poverty Consultant, Millennium Challenge Account (MCA).

Ahmed Moustafa Pacific Regional MDGs, Poverty Reduction and Macroeconomic Advisor and Team Leader UNDP Pacific Center Suva, Fiji Foreword The publication of the 2010 Vanuatu Hardship and Poverty Report comes at a particularly critical time. The Vanuatu economy, which had been growing at a rapid pace for several years, has had much slower growth over the past three years. This growth has made us aware of two realties: it has lifted some of our people out of poverty; but the growth has not been broad based enough to benefit all the poor. The Vanuatu Hardship and Poverty Report is about simple propositions: \u2022\ufffd Economic\ufffdgrowth\ufffdis\ufffdthe\ufffdonly\ufffdrealistic\ufffdmeans\ufffdto\ufffdlift\ufffdthe\ufffdpoor\ufffdout\ufffdof\ufffdextreme\ufffdpoverty\ufffdin\ufffdVanuatu;\ufffdbut\ufffdthe\ufffdcapacity\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdpoor\ufffd to participate in economic growth must be enhanced if they are to share in its benefits. \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdbuilding\ufffdblocks\ufffdof\ufffda\ufffdpro-poor\ufffdgrowth\ufffdstrategy\ufffdbegin\ufffdwith\ufffdnatural\ufffdresources.\ufffdThese\ufffdprovide\ufffdthe\ufffdbase\ufffdupon\ufffdwhich\ufffdthe\ufffd vast majority of the poor now depend for their fragile existence, but over which they exercise little control, and therefore can\u2019t exercise full stewardship. \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdrole\ufffdof\ufffdgovernance\ufffd\u2013\ufffdtransparent\ufffdand\ufffdaccountable\ufffdgovernance\ufffd\u2013\ufffdis\ufffdcritical\ufffdto\ufffdfostering\ufffdpro-poor\ufffdgrowth,\ufffdand\ufffdessential\ufffd to ensuring that the engine of that growth, natural resource wealth, is managed wisely. For some time now we have known that economic growth, growth that expands the availability of opportunities, is necessary to any permanent effort to alleviate poverty. But the quality of that growth is crucial if its economic benefits are truly to extend to the poor. Change in governance must necessarily include reforms that give the poorest a real stake in their future. Building the framework for broad based economic growth, especially in rural areas, continues to be a key priority of Government. We have made significant and visible progress since adopting the Priorities and Action Agenda (PAA) in 2005. This success has enabled us to devote increased resources to social services, the primary sector and infrastructure in areas such as health, education and transport networks for remote rural and island communities. Despite this success, we continue to face the challenge of tackling poverty and social exclusion. That is why this Government is working on a wide-ranging and comprehensive programme of action to assist those who continue to be socially excluded from the greatly improved living standards and opportunities that the majority of us enjoy. This report identifies a wide range of interventions, which together with the high level strategic goals in the PAA, will be necessary in order to achieve the overall objective of reducing poverty. Working together, in a true spirit of partnership, will ensure that we build on what has been achieved, that no one is left behind and that we achieve the common goal of building an educated, healthy, wealthy and safe society for all.

The paper classifies households and individuals as poor if they are below the Basic Needs Poverty Line (BNPL) (defined below), vulnerable to becoming poor if their expenditure is no more than double the BNPL and non-poor if their expenditure level is more than double the BNPL. The paper analyses inequality in the distribution of expenditure and calculates Gini coefficients from expenditure data. The analysis includes calculations of the value of subsistence production consumed by households. The analysis identifies three sub-national areas: the two urban areas of significance, Port Vila and Luganville, with all other areas classified as Rural. They respectively contain 20%, 6% and 74% of the population. Household composition and expenditure The overall national average household size was 4.9 members (3.9 adult equivalents1). Poor households were larger on average in both rural and urban areas. Nearly one in eight (12.2%) of households were headed by women; in Port Vila, 13.5% of households were headed by women, compared to 8.3% in Luganville and 12.2% in rural areas. There were 99,350 children under the age of 15 years in 2010, accounting for 40% of the population. Household weekly expenditure averaged 17,576 Vt with the average total weekly expenditure per capita adult equivalent (p.c.a.e) was 4,455 Vt. For the lowest expenditure quintile, the average weekly household expenditure was 7,259 Vt, compared to 33,577 Vt per week for the highest expenditure quintile. Household average total weekly expenditure is higher in urban areas (23,711 Vt and 17,927 Vt per week in Port Vila and Luganville, respectively) than in rural areas (15,986 Vt per week). The ratio of non-food to food expenditure increases for each expenditure decile (i.e. as expenditure increases the proportion of total expenditure on food decreases). The average weekly expenditure of households increased on both food and non- food items, and overall per capita adult equivalent (p.c.a.e) expenditure increased by 37.8%, between 2006 and 2010. Proportionately, the expenditure of lower decile households increased more than that of higher decile households. In 2010, households produced, on average, 58% of their own total food consumption, compared to 52% in 2006. In both years, the proportion of household produced food was significantly higher in rural areas than in urban areas, and rural households consumed the highest proportion of household produced food. In urban areas, higher expenditure households consume a greater proportion of household produced food than households in the lowest quintile. The Vanuatu National Poverty Lines In Vanuatu, consumption levels are used to quantify poverty. Vanuatu\u2019s poverty measures draw on the \u201cCost of Basic Needs\u201d methodology. The Basic Needs Poverty Line (BNPL) is made up of two components: the cost of a minimum food basket; and an amount of expenditure for \u201cessential\u201d non-food basic needs. Separate estimates were made for Port Vila, Luganville, and Rural (other islands/rural) areas. The Food Poverty Line (FPL) has an absolute base (2,100 kilocalories/day per adult equivalent) with items that make up those calories derived from the actual consumption patterns of the lowest three deciles in each of the three areas. An adjustment factor of 0.8 (compared to market price) is applied to household production. The non-food component of the BNPL is based on the average total non-food expenditure per week of households in the lowest three deciles per capita adult equivalent. 1 Adult equivalents refer to the number of adults per household and are derived from \u201cequivalence factors\u201d where children of 14 years and under are counted as half an adult, thus a household with two adults and two children both under 15 years would be equivalent to 3 adult equivalents. Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 10 There are significant differences in the BNPLs between the urban and rural areas. Because the cost of food is less in rural areas, the rural FPL is less than 70% of the Port Vila FPL. Expenditure on non-food items is restricted by what is available. In 2010, the rural BNPL is 55%, and Luganville\u2019s BNPL is 72%, of the Port Vila BNPL.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80147b04-c206-4fc0-9b2e-6e2bd0c4769e": {"__data__": {"id_": "80147b04-c206-4fc0-9b2e-6e2bd0c4769e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afaaf445db2cc5333ab90f4f5b26a7a637366dcfa3e78b47c85fb65482866d12"}, "2": {"node_id": "875b5780-065a-4172-8d57-234dc5d723c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "039701229ab3b4d13d13e0e7475083f750de4b9cae8c285897615b1f33359c4a"}}, "hash": "4d2b6d9c33bfb5fa75ff444772101ebd2bb67b034516e849e8d8ad704937c2a0", "text": "Poverty Indicators and 2006 and 2010 comparative analysis Expenditure poverty is measured in terms of poverty incidence, and the depth and severity of poverty.

Food Poverty Between 2006 and 2010, the incidence of food poverty across Vanuatu more than halved, with the proportion of the population affected dropping from 7.4% to 3.2%. This is consistent with the increased consumption of household produced food and strong economic growth over 2006-2010. However, the incidence of food poverty in Luganville increased from 2.2% of the population in 2006 to 8.2% in 2010. While the consumption of household produced food increased between 2006 and 2010 for all expenditure deciles in Port Vila and rural areas, for the lowest quintile in Luganville, it declined from 32.1% to 22.8% of all food consumed. Basic needs poverty and vulnerability to poverty The incidence of basic needs poverty has barely changed; in 2006, 13.0% of the population were below the BNPL and in 2010, the incidence was 12.7%. Whilst the incidence of basic needs poverty has fallen slightly in both Port Vila and the rural areas, it almost doubled in Luganville, from 10.4% of households (12.2% of population) in 2006 to 19.4% of households (23.6% of population) in 2010. The proportion of the population very vulnerable to becoming poor (per capita expenditure that is 10% or less above the basic needs poverty line) rose, slightly, from 3.0% to 3.4% of the population between 2006 and 2010. There were small increases in Port Vila and rural areas, but a nearly threefold increase in Luganville (6.9% in 2010). Incidence of Food Poverty Proportion of HH and Population with Weekly p.c.a.e.

It seems that whilst Port Vila and the rural areas benefitted from the general economic growth, led by tourism, favourable commodity prices, increasing remittances resulting from the New Zealand Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme and infrastructure investment, Luganville has been left behind. Vanuatu has adapted MDG One Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger targets to a target to reduce poverty levels to 2% by 2015. Achieving this would be an enormous task and would require higher levels of annual growth, and growth that is broader based. Depth and severity of poverty At the national level the PGI (depth of poverty) for Vanuatu has declined from 5.6 in 2006 to 2.9 in 2010. This means there needs to be an average 2.9% real increase in income of households below the BNPL for them to reach the BNPL.

While fewer people are below the FPL and BNPL in 2010, compared to 2006, there has been a small increase in the group vulnerable to falling back into poverty. Luganville has deteriorating indicators for all targets. Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 13 Consumption distribution and inequality Between 2006 and 2010 there was a substantial decrease in the Gini coefficient (a measure of inequality where 1 is total inequality and 0 total equality). This occurred at the national level (from 0.41 to 0.31) and in rural areas (0.40 to 0.31) and, to an even greater extent, in the urban centres - Port Vila (0.41 to 0.25) and Luganville (0.46 to 0.28). The decrease in Port Vila is consistent with the pattern of economic growth over the period from 2006 to 2010. Changes in the level and distribution of expenditure At the national level, the 2010 BNPL was 60.1% higher in real terms than it was in 2006 and the average weekly expenditure by the lowest three deciles was 51.3% higher than in 2006. The lowest quintile\u2019s share of total expenditure increased from 7.4% in 2006 to 8.3% in 2010. The lower middle (decile 4 and 5) quintile\u2019s share of expenditure remained the same and upper middle (decile 6 and 7) quintile\u2019s share increased to 20.4%, up from 18.7% in 2006. The share of total expenditure by the highest quintile declined from 41.7% in 2006 to 38.2% in 2010. It is the redistribution of expenditure away from the top expenditure decile that has largely led to improvements in the Gini coefficient. In Port Vila, the lowest quintile\u2019s share of total expenditure increased from 7.5% in 2006 to 10.0% in 2010, while the share of the highest quintile in Port Vila declined from 40.8% in 2006 to 35.7% in 2010. This shift is attributed to employment and income growth being greater for the lowest and the lower middle expenditure households, than for higher expenditure households. Expenditure growth for the poorest households also explains the significant reduction in the incidence of severe (food) poverty. In Luganville, most of the changes in expenditure distribution were confined within the highest three deciles with a shift from the top decile, to the 9th and 8th deciles. The limited improvement in inequality was, mainly, at the expense of the middle expenditure households. This is consistent with the increase in the incidence of basic needs poverty as more lower-middle income households slipped below the BNPL. The agriculture, fishery and forestry sector stagnated between 2006 and 2010. Most of the reduction in poverty and improvement in income distribution in the rural areas, therefore, may be attributed to increasing government expenditure and internal (urban to rural) remittances. Manufacturing also performed poorly, including agro-processing industries, and this may have contributed to deteriorating conditions in Luganville.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "325e6a24-b7d6-4fbd-bbb5-19f901f0a46d": {"__data__": {"id_": "325e6a24-b7d6-4fbd-bbb5-19f901f0a46d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29c70788c06d2f38cbfc64ab63192c7a1f3b945a9830fbc071be8b0b385274d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3b36ad2-375e-4555-826a-47b0b127239c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3fae334086f9a32d861e11aea606a6747f0b1ab1b7b77cfe8a902b0361a137e"}}, "hash": "9ef1f89c0c7d86962e0fd749faacfab2f896eb636d2fea0c907ad457b89ddd5e", "text": "In addition, migration from rural areas to the urban area of Luganville contributed to the increasing incidence of poverty.

Luganville varies from this pattern with overrepresentation (30%) of female-headed households in the highest quintile and underrepresentation in the lowest three deciles (22%) and the lowest quintile (12%).The degree of inequality within female- headed households increased between 2006 and 2010, apart from in Luganville. The proportion of women in the lowest quintile, and the lowest three deciles, declined from 24.6% and 35.7% in 2006 to 23.3% and 33.5% in 2010, respectively. Most of the improvement in the economic status of women occurred in the rural areas. In Port Vila and Luganville the proportion of women in the lowest expenditure quintile and the lowest three deciles increased. In Port Vila and rural areas girls below 14 years of age are more vulnerable to food poverty than women and girls above the age of 14, while in Luganville vulnerability for women of all ages was about the same. Around half of the female population in rural areas are not poor on any measure (as is the case for the whole population), compared to less than third of females living in urban areas. Economic activity and poverty At the time of the 2009 Census, labour force participation in Vanuatu was 71% - with men\u2019s labour force participation rate 80%, compared to 61.4% for women. The participation rate was higher in rural than urban areas. Women are more likely to be unemployed and looking for work than men, especially in urban areas. Producing goods for sale is the main income source for 46% of households, while wages and salaries are the main support for around 36% of households. Being in formal employment does not necessarily keep individuals and their households out of poverty. Note that this analysis is based on HIES data from 2010, and prior to the increase in the minimum wage to 30,000 Vt per month in 2012 (from 26,000 Vt). In Port Vila, 16.8% of government employees and 17.1% of private sector employees were below the BNPL; the respective proportions in Luganville were 15.8% and 21.3% and, in rural areas, much lower at 5.1% and 7.1%. On average, female government employees were more likely to be below the BNPL than their male counterparts in all areas, but in the private sector, the reverse was true. In all areas, over half of all employers had expenditure at least 100% higher than the BNPL; that is, they were not poor. Amongst employers, men fared significantly better than women and rural areas had the highest proportions of employers who were not poor. Around half of subsistence farmers were not poor in rural areas, but this was only the case for 20% of this group in Luganville. People who produced goods for sale were generally less likely to be below the BNPL in Port Vila than employees were, but this was not the case in Luganville or rural areas. In Port Vila, nearly a quarter of disabled people were under the BNPL (23.3%) whereas retired people were less likely to be below the BNPL (18.1%). In Luganville, the reverse was true with 12.5% of people with disabilities, but 29.2% of retired people below the BNPL. In urban areas, women who were engaged full-time in housework were generally less likely to be under the BNPL than other groups not in employment. Education The incidence of food and basic needs poverty is significantly higher among people with low levels of education (no schooling or primary education only), particularly in urban areas. However, males with no schooling in urban areas are less likely to be vulnerable to poverty than all other groups with low levels of education.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2865bf0-3a82-49ef-b401-ec88745f0293": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2865bf0-3a82-49ef-b401-ec88745f0293", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30ee574e9e07ad246baf7fa4c9bc1dd2198376b5abe4d6f19e957de77fcbe67a"}, "2": {"node_id": "91932530-da90-42c0-8ba3-0de3af4d3cd5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb4992aaf057e733e206df6d338ac95a19809478a2a2613511c6fd05c9091ec0"}}, "hash": "c599098fbb36314b3fab12a77a52abde1cb2f2da1467bc77f3ba12a7d8efc236", "text": "This may be because the employment opportunities that do not require schooling (particularly in the booming construction sector), tend to be male-dominated and concentrated in urban areas.

In urban areas, children living in households headed by an elderly person are more likely to be poor. In most areas, children living in female-headed households are no more likely to be poor than other children. A UNICEF study on child poverty and disparities, based on the 2006 HIES, found nearly 20% of children in Port Vila lived in households which suffered from poverty and deprivation, with 17% suffering health deprivation. Human multidimensional poverty Access to basic services and energy depends more on the geographic location, less on the vulnerability status, of households. Consequently, households below the BNPL in rural areas suffer significantly more multiple deprivations than their counterparts in urban areas. Inequalities and geographic disparities are more severe when viewed through a human poverty, rather than just income poverty, lens. Therefore, while income poverty may be relatively lower, multidimensional human poverty is higher and more sever in rural areas. Energy use Access to energy remains a major challenge. Eight out of ten (82%) of households in Port Vila rely on electricity as the main source of household lighting, compared to 86% in 2006. Electricity is more prevalent in higher decile households. The proportion with electricity is lower in Luganville (73% up from 30% in 2006) and rural areas (30% up from 10% in 2006), but reliance on electricity as a source of energy has increased significantly since 2006. Wood and coconut shells are the main source of energy for cooking, contributing around 46%, 81% and 91% of energy used for cooking in Port Vila, Luganville and rural areas, respectively, followed by gas in urban areas. Nearly all poor households in rural areas and Luganville (90%), and about two thirds of poor households in Port Vila, rely solely on coconut shells and wood for cooking. Drinking water and sanitation Access to improved water and sanitation systems depend more on the geographic location, less on vulnerability status, of households. At the national level, the average proportion of all households with access to piped water (private and shared) is 35% compared to an average of 39% for households below the BNPL. Meanwhile, on average, 21% of all households rely on wells, springs, rivers and other sources for drinking water compared to a slightly higher average of 24% of all households below the BNPL. The proportions of households below the BNPL with access to piped water (private and shared) are 76%, 55% and 21% compared to 85%, 78% and 21% of non-poor households in Port Vila, Luganville and rural areas, respectively. Very few households in rural areas have access to private, shared piped and/or standpipe water (14%, slightly higher than 12% in 2006) as there are very few distribution systems in Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 16 rural areas. Similar to access to water, access to improved sanitation systems depends more on the geographic location, less on the vulnerability status, of households. Interestingly, however, the link between the vulnerability status and access to improved sanitation systems is stronger than in the case of access to improved water systems, particularly in urban area. Around 56.5% of households in rural areas rely solely on a pit latrine (private/shared), compared to 11.8% and 22.7% in Port Vila and Luganville, respectively. Access to sanitation did not improve between 2006 and 2010. Housing In Port Vila, 45% of households live in permanent houses and 18% in traditional houses with permanent material.

The proportion of non-food expenditure devoted to education declines as overall expenditure increases. Education attainment of household heads In Port Vila, 6% of household heads have no schooling and 30% only primary education, in Luganville, 7% have no schooling and 37% only primary education, and in rural areas the proportions are 31% no schooling and 44% only primary education. Health expenditure Health related expenditure accounted for 0.5% of all non-food household expenditure. For households below the BNPL, health was 0.9% of their non-food expenditure. Income Three-quarters of all household income in Port Vila (82% for those below the BNPL), two thirds of household income in Luganville (75% for those below the BNPL), but only 23% of household income in the rural areas (10% for those below the BNPL) came from wages and salaries. While men\u2019s income from wages and salaries is significantly higher than women\u2019s, wages and salaries account for similar proportions of income for male and female heads of households. Income from remittances, gifts and other miscellaneous sources accounted for 3.6% of income in Port Vila and 2% in Luganville and rural households. On average, poor households receive only about 1% of their income from this source compared to over 2% for households above the BNPL. Concluding remarks Apart from in Luganville, there was a significant reduction in hunger (food poverty) between 2006 and 2010. Overall, food poverty more than halved and now affects 3.2% of the population. This progress was, primarily, driven by economic growth Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 17 during the period from 2005 to 2009. Growth, however, was not structured in a way to reduce basic needs poverty, which only declined from 13% to 12.7%, and reduce the large proportion of the population concentrated marginally (20%-50%) above the BNPL and vulnerable to becoming poor. However, the depth and severity of poverty have diminished with particularly impressive progress in rural areas. The inequality of expenditure distribution has also reduced with the expenditure-based Gini coefficient reducing from 0.41 in 2006 to 0.31 in 2010. The reduction in the Gini Coefficient was greatest in Port Vila which is consistent with it being the location of a disproportionate share of economic growth. The rise in poverty and inequality in Luganville demands attention from policy makers. Gender-based inequality is deeper in urban areas, compared to rural areas, and, to some extent, reflects wage inequality. Women\u2019s share of the benefits from economic growth has been less than men\u2019s with more of the growth being in male- dominated jobs such as construction. More women are vulnerable to falling below the poverty line than are men. The unemployed poor, elderly and people with disabilities are more vulnerable in urban areas than in rural areas. There is a strong correlation between vulnerability status and education level in urban areas, but less so in rural areas. A strong three-way relationship between gender, low or no education and poverty prevails in urban areas, as vulnerability and the incidence of basic needs poverty is higher among females than males with limited or no schooling. Children are highly vulnerable to poverty and hardship, with 37% living in households with expenditure less than the BNPL \u2013\ufffdup\ufffdfrom\ufffd31%\ufffdin\ufffd2006.\ufffdPoor\ufffdhouseholds\ufffd(lowest\ufffdthree\ufffddeciles),\ufffdand\ufffdhouseholds\ufffdin\ufffdrural\ufffdareas,\ufffdtend\ufffdto\ufffdhave\ufffdmore\ufffdchildren\ufffd than households in the highest expenditure quintile and households in urban areas. Inequalities and geographic disparities are more severe when viewed through a human poverty, rather than just income poverty, lens. Lack of access to quality services is a major issue, particularly in rural areas. Policy Implications Principles for intervention If interventions to reduce poverty are to be effective, they must be based on proven and cost effective mechanisms for allocating resources and assistance to poor households. Direct targeting is based on clearly identifying poor households or individuals. If providing assistance directly to the poor is not feasible, it may be possible to intervene on the basis of their characteristics. However, characteristic targeting has two potential drawbacks. First, some non-poor households could possess the same characteristics as the poor and, hence, receive benefits (leakage).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9c26f78-a3d2-4b88-8267-1177e42da73d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9c26f78-a3d2-4b88-8267-1177e42da73d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f97adda80a734437f6cc21a3bb5bde4abdc1f5b6832958b4e18dd0309882c7c7"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d935689-de24-4d1f-8b20-6d2cb2b1912f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23fc70b15ee3241229218e695012f793204f15ec3b4be5421ffb972f7c3ad5b0"}}, "hash": "260150dcf57b99d87ebd8d1953399b2cc35ff32bf528bab87515743c5a2d19c4", "text": "Second, not all poor households possess the designated characteristics to benefit from the intervention, and consequently all might not be reached (under-coverage).

However, the screening needed to identify the poor can be very expensive to implement. There are two alternatives to direct targeting of the poor. The first involves targeting types of spending or \u2018broad targeting\u2019. Under this approach, programmes target types of spending that are relatively more important to the poor. Spending on basic social services, such as primary education and primary health care, is one example. The second approach targets categories of people. Under this approach, which can be called \u2018narrow targeting\u2019, benefits are directed to certain types of people. Examples are food stamp schemes targeted to mothers in food-insecure communities or micro-credit schemes targeting women vendors. Narrowly targeted schemes are based on one or both of two methods. The first is indicator targeting (also called categorical targeting). This approach identifies a characteristic of poor people (an indicator) that is highly correlated with low income and is used as a proxy for targeting. The second approach is self- targeting. Under this approach, beneficiaries self-select through the creation of incentives that would induce the poor, and only the poor, to participate in a programme. Examples are public employment schemes that use work requirements and conditions to help self-screen out the non-poor. One drawback of indicator targeting is that not all of the poor can be identified by the same indicators. For example, even though most countries have poor regions, not all the poor live there, nor do all the rich live elsewhere. Geographical targeting at the level of the village or the urban community could reduce the leakage of benefits to the non-poor. Vanuatu Vanuatu\u2019s poverty-reduction programme needs to focus its efforts on building up the human capital of the working-age population. This would enable the working members of poor households to secure more rewarding employment and generate income. Programmes to improve educational institutions have very high returns over the long-run. Supply-side challenges facing public services, including education and health, are significant. However, there will not be any major progress in terms of human poverty unless such challenges are addressed effectively. Fiscal space needs to be found to increase expenditure on public services, social protection and investment in other social services. In addition, policymakers need to identify economic policies that can stimulate a broad-based, balanced and more inclusive and equitable pattern of economic growth, which can raise the standard of living of poor households across the country. Policy recommendations Maintaining the downward trend in income poverty and accelerating progress towards the achievement of MDGs, particularly goal one, requires further reforms that will allow Vanuatu to sustain and broaden economic growth and enhance its inclusiveness. This requires continued investments in transport and communication infrastructure and services, allowing the rural majority to access domestic and export markets, as well as quality and affordable health and education and financial services, which will directly contribute to the reduction of human poverty. A stronger sense of accountability is needed within the public service to achieve service delivery targets and improve the management of services, especially health and education, through the strengthened use of data and information systems, human resource development, performance management, and more effective use of resources. Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service also requires a more concerted effort to implement decentralization policies. This Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 19 includes the strengthening of provincial governments and municipalities and clarifying their roles and responsibilities for service delivery. A major concern across the health sector is the lack of personnel, both numbers and skill mix, to drive the health sector plan and deliver basic health services, especially in the rural areas. There is significant potential to work with civil society and faith-based organizations to provide health services. The next generation of policy reforms in Vanuatu should address human poverty, rather than narrowly concentrate on income poverty. Social protection in the form of non-contributory social pensions is a proven strategy for reducing poverty, vulnerability and inequality. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that social pensions both reduce the poverty and vulnerability of older people, and result in net contributions to multigenerational household economies and the wider community. Other recommendations for Vanuatu are for Local Economic Development (LED), addressing the needs of youth, and the development of a Women\u2019s Economic Security and Rights (WESR) strategy.

Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 20 A. Introduction 1. The purpose of this paper is to provide an in-depth analysis of poverty in Vanuatu, using the Food and Basic Needs Poverty Lines, including the incidence, severity and depth of poverty, and identification of the characteristics of the poor, using data from the Vanuatu National Statistic Office\u2019s (VNSO) 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES). 2. The paper estimates and analyses inequality in the distribution of expenditure and calculates Gini coefficients from expenditure data. In estimating expenditure, and the degree of poverty, the analysis takes account of the high levels of subsistence production and consumption by calculating the value of subsistence production consumed by households, thus providing a better picture of overall well-being. Subsistence production is also incorporated as part of income measurement. 3. The paper also compares findings on poverty and inequality from the 2006 and 2010 HIES surveys. In order to ensure comparability, some of the data for 2006 has been re-worked, in particular, the calculation of the Basic Needs Poverty Line (BNPL) for 2006. The paper links poverty and inequality trends in Vanuatu with growth and economic performance over the period 2006 to 2010, and highlights the key policy issues arising. 4. Poverty and hardship are being increasingly accepted as concerns in the Pacific which need greater attention. Some countries in the Pacific region, including Fiji, Papua New Guinea (PNG), and Samoa, have already fully embraced the need to deal with increasing levels of hardship and poverty and the consequent societal implications. Other countries, are now accepting that there are growing numbers of disadvantaged people who are being left behind as economic and social structures change in response to both external and internal developments. 5. Household survey data on subsistence production also provides a sounder basis for estimating the non-monetary sector in national accounts. In many countries, the value of such subsistence production in the national income (gross domestic product) has not been fully calculated; it may have been inadequately assessed in GDP estimates or occasionally it is missing entirely. 6. The paper is structured as follows: Section B provides background on Vanuatu, economic growth trends, and price changes; Section C provides the HIES results on household composition and expenditure, and the method for estimating poverty lines; Section D sets out the findings on poverty and compares the results for 2010 and 2006; Section E discusses distribution and inequality; Section F discusses linkages between growth, income distribution and poverty; Section G discusses the key characteristics of the poor; Section H identifies vulnerable groups; Section I discusses access to services; Section J provides an analysis of income sources; Section K provides concluding remarks; Section L discusses policy implications, and Section M makes policy recommendations. Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 21 B. Background 7. Vanuatu is a small Pacific Island Country (PIC) with a land mass of 12,281.25 square kilometres, a population of 249,853 at the time of the 2010 HIES, and population density of approximately 19 persons/km2 (2009 Census) living in six provinces (Torba, Sanma, Penama, Malampa, Shefa and Tafea). According to the 2009 Census, annual population growth averaged around 2.3% between 1999 and 2009. More than three quarters (75.6%) of the population live in rural areas. Urbanization is increasing, and the urban population is growing at an annual average rate of 3.5%, compared to the 1.9% annual growth rate\ufffdfor\ufffdthe\ufffdrural\ufffdpopulation\ufffd(1999\ufffd\u2013\ufffd2009\ufffdCensus\ufffddata).\ufffdThe\ufffdlargest\ufffdurban\ufffdarea,\ufffdPort\ufffdVila,\ufffdand\ufffdassociated\ufffdperipheral\ufffd settlements, are in Shefa province, and have the highest population growth (3.7% annually) and density (52 persons/ km2). The second largest urban area is Luganville in Sanma province. 8. In terms of economic growth, Vanuatu performed relatively well during the period 2003-2010, with an average real GDP growth rate of over 5% for four consecutive years (2005-2008). Unlike most of the Pacific region, Vanuatu managed to maintain positive GDP growth during the peak of the global economic crises in 2008 and 2009.

Economic growth slowed down in 2010 and 2011 as tourism and construction also slowed down, and, in both years, GDP per capita declined for the first time since 2002. 11. The strong economic growth from 2006 to 2010 was associated with significant growth in government expenditure (8,973 million Vt in 2010, up from 6,733, 6,728 and 6,843 million Vt in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively). Together, these contributed to the decline in poverty in Vanuatu. Household consumption grew by 11% in real terms over the same period.

Between 2000 and 2003, the consumer price index (CPI) and the food price index moved in very close alignment with an annual increases averaging around 1% to 2%. The food price index, however, increased by 4% in 2004 and 2006, while the CPI maintained the same average annual change. Figures 2.a and 2.b show that the CPI and the food price index rose sharply in 2007 and 2008 in response to the global food and energy crises. The food price index rose faster, recording an 11% increase in 2008. Inflationary pressure relaxed in 2009 and 2010. C. Overview of the 2010 and 2006 HIES results and methodology 13. The 2010 HIES, like that of 2006, was based on a national sample of 10% of private households. The survey coverage included only persons living in private households during the survey period, September to November. Persons living in institutions, such as school dormitories, hospital wards, hostels and prisons were excluded, as were expatriate temporary residents and permanent residents who had not resided, and were not intending to reside, in Vanuatu for at least 12 months. More discussion on the method for the HIES 2010 survey is included in the Vanuatu National Statistics Office (2013) publication on the 2010 HIES. Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 23 C.1. Households size and characteristics 14. As with the 2006 HIES, the reference period for the 2010 Households Income and Expenditure survey was the second and third quarters of the reference year (2010). Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the households (HH) included in HIES 2010 and the derived estimates for the total number of households and population in Vanuatu. For the purposes of analysis, three sub-national areas have been identified: the two urban areas, Port Vila (20% of the population) and Luganville (6% of the population), with all other areas classified as Rural (74% of the population).

This methodology has been adopted to: a) take account of the downward bias in per capita expenditure that would otherwise occur in households with more children, often those with lower expenditure levels anyway, and which might therefore have an upward bias in the likelihood of a particular household falling below the poverty lines; and, b) to make an allowance for the \u201ceconomies of scale\u201d in a household of larger size. 17. The overall national average household size was 4.9 members (3.9 adult equivalents). Poor households were larger on average in both rural and urban areas. Table 2 shows that, for the lowest quintile, the average household size was 5.7 (4.4 a.e). Households in urban areas were, on average, larger than those in rural areas. The largest average household size was in Luganville where the average for all households was 5.6 (4.6 a.e), while lowest quintile households had an average of 6.8 members (5.6 a.e). As is the case in other parts of the Pacific region, as well as most developing countries, households that spend more p.c.a.e tend to be smaller. The average household size in the highest quintile was 4.0 (3.3 a.e). Even in Luganville the size of households in the highest quintile was only 4.8 (3.9 a.e) compared to the average of 5.6.

Overall, 12.2% of households were reported as being headed by women (6,660 households), a high of 13.5% of all households in Port Vila, and a low of 8.3% in Luganville (Table 3). The highest proportion of female-headed households was recorded within the highest expenditure quintile in Port Vila, while the lowest proportion was recorded within the poorest quintile in Luganville. Table 3: Proportion of households headed by females by expenditure level 19. Female-headed households were smaller in size than households headed by males, with an average of 3.9 people compared with 5.1 people in male-headed households. Female-headed households had a higher per capita expenditure level at 16,400 Vt per month than compared to male-headed households (15,700 Vt). However, female-headed households had lower average household expenditure at 64,600 Vt compared to male-headed households (79,600 Vt), because they were smaller in size. Children 20. There were 99,350 children under the age of 15 years in 2010, accounting for 40% of the population. Nationally, the average number of children per household was 2, and this was also the case in Luganville and the Rural Areas. The average number of children per household is slightly lower in Port Vila (1.7). The number of children is higher in the poorest quintile; 2.5 children compared to 1.4 children in the highest quintile. Poor rural households have the highest number of children per household (2.6).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a4f152b-99b8-4344-8d69-c1665cdbfce3": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a4f152b-99b8-4344-8d69-c1665cdbfce3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b19ae717c2fc0a23bccc4c77c59b056e6d899e6f3dc85bb15847ac879c9aa8b9"}, "2": {"node_id": "58398946-f20b-41e9-999b-01ba20ba926b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b569c6a415d34d02395fd4212e41b2b87e26e5bebe6e60ac05e953587e9e3dd"}}, "hash": "41a237f763dfe57abed0faf8e9664f7cd8bd8d31ce173496e6ba2f88f1405529", "text": "Poor rural households have the highest number of children per household (2.6).

The overall average weekly expenditure on food per household in Vanuatu was 9,834 Vt (Table 6). Average expenditure on food is typically lower in rural areas due to subsistence food production. Luganville is the exception, where the average weekly expenditure on food per household was 8,924 Vt compared to 9,930 Vt in rural areas. The average weekly expenditure on non-food items per household was 7,742 Vt for all households, lower than average weekly expenditure on food. Households in the highest expenditure quintile in urban areas spend more on non-food than on food. Table 6: Average food and non-food household expenditure by expenditure level 23. Table 7 illustrates the ratio of non-food to food weekly expenditure per household and per capita adult equivalent (p.c.a.e). The 0.79 ratio (for all households) means that, on average, households spend 79 Vt per adult equivalent per week on non- food for every 100 Vt spent on food.

In real terms, the average weekly expenditure on both food and non-food items per household increased by 42.7%, and p.c.a.e by 37.8%, between 2006 and 2010 (Table 8). The expenditure of the low decile households, however, increased more than that of the high decile households. Table 8 illustrates the percentage change of total, food, and non-food household weekly expenditure in 2010, compared to 2006. Lower expenditure in 2010, compared with 2006, only occurs in the total, and non-food, expenditure per capita adult equivalent (p.c.a.e), in urban areas (Luganville and Port Vila) as well as the non-food expenditure of households in urban areas. Table 8: Total, food, and non-food household expenditure (percentage change from 2006) 25. Table 9 and Figure 3 show that, between 2006 and 2010, there was an increase in the proportion of all food consumed that had been produced by households for their own use (household production). In 2010, all households produced, on average, 58% of their own total food consumption compared to 52% in 2006. In both years, the proportion of household produced food was significantly higher in rural areas than in urban areas due to the dominance of agriculture as the main economic activity. In both years, rural households consumed the highest proportion of household produced food, followed by Luganville and then Port Vila. 26. One might expect that households in the lower expenditure deciles in both urban and rural areas would consume more household produced food than households in the highest expenditure deciles.

They assess the basic costs of an acceptable minimum standard of living in a particular society and measure the number of households and/or the proportion of the population that cannot satisfy these basic needs. As the costs and basic needs for individual households differ between the urban and rural areas of Vanuatu, the analysis separates Vanuatu into three areas: Port Vila urban area; Luganville urban area, and Rural (other islands and rural parts of Efate and Espiritu Santo). 28. In Vanuatu, expenditure levels are used to quantify poverty. This is the standard used in the Pacific region for the analysis of poverty by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Discrepancies are often observed between declared income and expenditure, with declared income being significantly lower than declared consumption.

Vanuatu\u2019s poverty measures draw on the \u201cCost of Basic Needs\u201d methodology. Using the \u201cCost of Basic Needs\u201d methodology, the estimation of food and basic needs poverty lines and hence the extent or Incidence of Poverty (IP) in Vanuatu follows a four stage process: i. calculating the Food Poverty Line (FPL); ii. estimating a non-food basic needs component; iii. combining the FPL with the non-food basic needs component to give an estimate of the Basic Needs Poverty Line (BNPL); and finally, iv. estimating the incidence of poverty against the BNPL benchmark using the Head Count Index (HCI) (the proportion of the population with a standard of living below the poverty line); also measured are vulnerability- to poverty status, and the prevalence of poverty by gender, age and other disaggregated characteristics and indicators of hardship and poverty. 30. The Basic Needs Poverty Line is made up of two components: the cost of a minimum food basket, and an amount of expenditure for \u201cessential\u201d non-food basic needs. The BNPL is therefore intended to represent the minimum expenditure that is required by an individual, household or family to: \ufffd \u2022 provide a basic, low-cost, minimally nutritious diet - measured in terms of the minimum daily calorie intake required for basic human survival. This food energy requirement is internationally benchmarked at an average of 2,100 kilocalories/day per adult per capita 2 and termed the \u201cFood Poverty Line\u201d (FPL). The FPL includes food that is purchased from markets or shops, as well as food grown for own consumption (subsistence) and any gifts of food received; \ufffd \u2022 an additional amount which is required to meet the costs of purchasing (or otherwise acquiring) essential non- food basic needs (e.g. costs relating to housing/shelter, clothing, utilities, school fees and/or other education related expenses, health, transport and communications) and to meet family/community/church obligations. Most of these non-food costs require cash payments and are often the underlying cause of the greatest financial hardship. 31. The Incidence of Poverty is then measured against the BNPL by estimating the proportion of households or population which have a Per Capita Adult Equivalent (p.c.a.e.) expenditure (including the value of subsistence production consumed) less than the BNPL value. This is referred to as the Head Count Index (HCI). 32.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f17ad99-4b14-4e7f-9103-eefe516c052c": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f17ad99-4b14-4e7f-9103-eefe516c052c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f30cf797fdf1894554b4a56f57e9eeff60fcf9352b50a7da57c7ebc963ae79f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "62663298-8420-4569-9c63-b72010c59ba7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59505ea90b2ebf02a96cc0def57bf7a4705a8e11cec78a34a0c18ffd096d5a0e"}}, "hash": "fe6f6bc00c1162f7c000072237ea4d8977c87421a6504aced3f5d4d8f27ec456", "text": "This is referred to as the Head Count Index (HCI). 32.

In the Pacific region, the extent of extreme or food poverty is generally very low. Most households, particularly those in the rural areas, have access to land for subsistence cropping, and many have access to the sea for fish and seafood. They are therefore able to meet a high proportion of their daily food needs from their own production. Even in many urban areas, households provide at least a proportion of their own food needs. This access to land and subsistence crops sets the Pacific apart from most of the developing world where access to land and subsistence crops is often much less widespread. C.4. Poverty line estimation I) Derivation of the food basket for the FPL 35. For the HIES 2006 and HIES 2010, an expenditure-based method has been used to calculate the basic food baskets and the corresponding food poverty lines. As discussed above, separate estimates were made for Port Vila, Luganville and Rural (other islands/rural). The expenditure-based food baskets were derived from the type of food and expenditure patterns of the poor (households with p.c.a.e. in the lowest 3 deciles), as reported by households. The food items (from purchases, household production, and transfers to and from households as gifts) were then weighted by expenditure shares and quantities. The first 30 or so items, with the highest weighted expenditure and covering approximately 80-85% of all food expenditure, formed the food basket used in the estimation of the FPL. The FPL has an absolute base (2,100 kilocalories/ day) but the items that make up those calories are derived from actual consumption patterns in each of the three areas; Figures 4.a, 4.b and 4.c illustrate.

Table 11 and Figure 5 summarise the Food Poverty Lines (FPL) derived for Port Vila, Luganville and the rural areas. The national FPL is a weighted average of the three regional FPL. What makes a good poverty line? We define a poverty line as the monetary cost of achieving a standard of living above which one is not deemed to be poor. A poverty comparison assesses which of two distributions (of an agreed indicator of living standards) has more poverty on average. The groups can be regions or sectors of a country, the same population at different dates, or the same population observed with and without a policy change. A special case of a poverty comparison is a poverty profile, where groups of households defined by some common characteristic (such as where they live) are compared at one date. The guiding principle in making a poverty comparison to inform policy is that it should be consistent with the policy objective. When that objective is to reduce poverty by increasing people\u2019s command over basic consumption needs, any two individuals (at one date or at different dates) with the same command over those needs should be treated identically. This requires the poverty line to have a fixed purchasing power over relevant commodities. The cost-of-basic-needs method The cost-of-basic-needs method bases poverty lines on purchasing power over basic consumption needs. This achieves the desired consistency for the purposes of the World Bank Poverty Assessments. But putting this method into practice with imperfect data can be difficult. Once \u201cbasic needs\u201d are defined, we need to be able to measure their cost over time and location. Setting basic needs requires an inherent value judgment, which often leads to disagreements. Also price data are often inadequate. World Bank, 1994 3 The weighted price is a mean of prices from the different sources, i.e. purchases, own production and private transfers, each at its particular price. 4 In the case of dry coconuts the consumable part is estimated at 150g per nut; for cooking bananas it is estimated that for each kg of product purchased in the market only 400g is consumable, the rest being skin and stalk. 5 The Pacific Islands Food Composition Tables, Second Edition, USP/FAO, 2004 6 The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend a minimum food energy intake of 2100 kilocalories per person per day for an average active person. Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 33 Table 11 and Figure 5: Estimated food poverty lines for 2006 and 2010 HIES III) The Estimation of Non\u2013Food Components 41. The FPL is not sufficient on its own to determine a benchmark of basic needs and poverty classifications. A household that can afford to meet food requirements of all members, but lacks the resources to purchase clothing, shelter, education, transport, communications, lighting and health care, experiences hardship in a very basic sense. A widely accepted scaling-up approach is used for non-food items to determine a Basic Needs Poverty Line (BNPL). This approach uses the FPL as the reference point for estimating non-food basic needs expenditure. 42. The rationale for this approach is that if a household is meeting all its food requirements, it is likely it would also be meeting basic non-food requirements. Conversely if a household is not able to meet its food requirements, it is probably not able to meet its basic needs for non-food items either. This is not necessarily always the case since as income increases, the share of food in total households\u2019 expenditure tends to decrease due to the low income elasticity of demand for food items. 43. Further, for Vanuatu and other Pacific Island Countries, taking the level of the FPL as a reference point for estimating non-food basic needs would give a very low figure for non-food basic needs expenditure. This is because subsistence production makes up a significant part of the FPL and, therefore, the proportion of households falling below the FPL is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "314aa5f3-5359-4eac-b033-1af72dfa5b13": {"__data__": {"id_": "314aa5f3-5359-4eac-b033-1af72dfa5b13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23452991824822f0a8a8b49bea38ee77e37414d3e66f3931ccfb9442ec213851"}, "3": {"node_id": "35df7b0d-9ae0-4319-b301-a621adc110f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02c126509ac9b5571ff0e258323eab27fdf4f29ee07520867da35bec628da6d2"}}, "hash": "66d97430b5b4c1e421d706a68b67c9da876286992879077a390d74c59a2cdd7c", "text": "very small and the non-food basic needs calculation would be based on a very small number of the very poorest households. This would not give a true reflection of the actual costs of essential non-food items. 44. Therefore, the basis for the estimation of non-food basic needs expenditure for Vanuatu and all other PICs is the average actual non-food expenditure of households in the bottom three deciles. The BNPL for both HIES surveys (2006 and 2010) was calculated by estimating the average total non-food expenditure p.c.a.e. per week for households in the lowest three deciles and multiplying it by the average size of households at the lowest three expenditure deciles (Table 12). This is the estimated cost of \u201cnon-food\u201d basic needs. This is a relative measure that will increase with growth in real incomes.

It is sometimes argued that this method leads to an over-inclusion of non-basic items and therefore raises the BNPL. However it is deemed preferable from a planning and policy perspective to slightly over-estimate than to under-estimate basic-needs requirements. Table 13 and Figure 6: Estimated non-food component of the poverty lines IV) The Basic Needs Poverty Lines 46. Combining the food and non-food components provides the Basic Needs Poverty Lines (BNPL) for the three sub national areas (Table 12). These represent the estimated expenditure (including household subsistence production) required per adult equivalent per week to meet the costs of a minimum standard of living in each of the regions. 47. There are significant differences in what is deemed to be basic needs and, hence, in the BNPLs in the urban and rural areas. The benchmark for food consumption is largely the same (set at 2,100 kcal per adult equivalent per day) except that rural households consume a much greater proportion of household produced food. The notional cost (farm gate or shadow price) of this subsistence production is less than the urban market price (as it excludes transport, marketing and mark-ups). Thus the FPL is lower for rural households; less than 70% of the Port Vila FPL in 2010 (Table 11). 48. There are also major differences in non-food basic needs between rural and urban households. Rural households frequently do not have access to power. Therefore, they are less likely to have utility costs as a non-food essential. Rural households often do not have easy access to, or need for, transport while, for urban households, bus fares are often an Vanuatu average Port Vila (urban) Luganville (urban) Rural 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 Non-Food Component of the Poverty Lines Vt per a.e. weekly Vt per a.e. 2006 2010 Weekly per capita adult equivalent Basic Needs Poverty Lines VT per capita adult equivalent per week Food Poverty Lines p.c.a.e.

Since what is deemed to be a basic need is more restricted in rural areas, the poverty threshold is materially lower in rural areas and the average material standard of living is also lower. This means a rural household that had per capita expenditure equivalent to the rural BNPL would be below the urban BNPL and in poverty compared to the urban standard. Conversely, an urban household with per capita expenditure equivalent to the urban BNPL has a material living standard above the rural BNPL. Table 14 and Figure 7: The Basic-Need Poverty Line 50. In general, it is easier for poor households to survive at a basic needs level in a rural environment where food can be obtained from subsistence production and where non-food basic needs are limited (either by availability or \u201cneed\u201d). A poor urban household would find it much more difficult to survive since there is less opportunity for subsistence production and a much greater need for cash to purchase food and other non-food basic needs. 51. The incidence of basic-needs poverty/hardship is measured by the proportion of households and population that fall below these levels of per capita adult equivalent weekly expenditure for the respective regions. This is discussed in the next section. Comments on BNPL measurement methodology 52. All poverty measures have limitations, in that there is no single measure that addresses all of the aspects of poverty. The approach adopted in poverty analysis of the Vanuatu 2006 HIES has been criticised for having such different BNPL for urban and rural populations, as this is seen by some as understating rural poverty compared to urban poverty7 . 53. The approach adopted for calculation of the food basket recognises the constrained preferences of poor households and therefore may actually deliver a nutritionally inferior diet to that used in the \u201cmodel-diets\u201d often developed by nutritionists. However, households do not eat model diets and this approach is reality-based. 7 e.g. Narsey, Wadan Lal (2012) Poverty Analysis in Vanuatu: A Critical Review and Alternative Formulation South Pacific Studies Vol 33 No 1 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 0 Vanuatu average Port Vila (urban) Luganville (urban) Rural 2006 2010 Basic Needs Poverty Lines Vt per adult equivalent per week Combined Food and Non-Food Components of the Poverty Lines: The Basic-Needs Poverty Lines Vt per adult equivalent per week Basic Needs Poverty Lines Change between 2006 & 2010 % 2006 2010 Vanuatu average 1100 1761 60.1 Port Vila (urban) 2090 2866 37.1 Luganville (urban) 1433 2065 44.1 Rural 849 1564 84.3 Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 36 National Poverty Lines; Income or Consumption There are two basic ingredients in measuring poverty. The first is a poverty line that refers to a benchmark level of consumption (or income) that enables a person to attain a threshold standard of living. A person whose consumption is below this benchmark level does not attain the threshold standard of living and is thereby defined as poor. The poverty line is said to be absolute, as opposed to relative, when the threshold standard of living is held fixed both over time and space. Given that absolute poverty lines, and the poverty measures derived from these, are widely believed to be the appropriate bases on which to inform antipoverty policies in developing countries, the discussion focuses on these. The second ingredient in measuring poverty is a survey that collects data on income and/or consumption levels from a sample of household\u2019s representative of a given population. The choice of income or consumption as an indicator of household welfare is often determined by the availability of data. Where choice is available, researchers have normally preferred consumption to income on the basis that the former is a better indicator of permanent income and standard of living of people due to consumption smoothing through savings and insurance opportunities. It has also been argued that it is easier to collect information from respondents on consumption than on income. Once a poverty line has been set and survey data are available, it is a simple matter to determine how many households or people are poor.\u2019 Unfortunately, the setting of poverty lines always involves some element of subjective methodological choice. The poverty line refers to a minimum level of living necessary for physical and social development of a person. A minimum level of living defined in monetary terms comprises both food and non-food components of consumption. An objective approach could, in principle, be adopted for computing minimum food expenditure, the dominant component in the total consumption", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73c55f58-f0e1-45aa-8e54-730c1ceead8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "73c55f58-f0e1-45aa-8e54-730c1ceead8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ec2efa4afb31421c3ac71c745b2f19e9e87266feaf25792fc1728b7f8ed6919"}}, "hash": "6ec2efa4afb31421c3ac71c745b2f19e9e87266feaf25792fc1728b7f8ed6919", "text": "bundle of the poor. However, non-food expenditure is clearly affected by social needs and the minimum on this count obviously differs from one society (or region) to another. \u2026. it is difficult to consider even the physical component of minimum needs entirely on an objective basis. Despite such problems, recent literature has grown substantially to define the absolute poverty line on a reasonably, although not completely, objective basis. Once the poverty line is defined, data are required on size distribution of income or consumption to compute the number and proportion of the population below the poverty line. Household income or consumption expenditure surveys are the principle source of such data\u2026.. ADB 2004, pages 7-8 Poverty lines are defined either in terms of income or consumption. In practice, this choice is restricted by the availability of household survey data since most countries collect data on either household income or consumption. A few countries \u2026 collect data on both income and consumption. Income is a better measure of opportunity for consumption than actual consumption in the case of households that save. But consumption might be a better measure of opportunity for poor households that save little or in fact dis-save. Most practitioners also prefer to define poverty in terms of total consumption expenditure because income data collection faces a wider range of measurement problems. Consumption is less affected by short-term fluctuations due to the consumption smoothing opportunities available to a household. Hence, total consumption expenditure is thought to be a better indicator of the permanent income of a household, particularly in an agrarian economy\u2026.. (ADB 2004, p 41) 8 Robertson, Kim (2011) HIES 2010 Poverty Analysis prepared for the Millennium Challenge Corporation Vanuatu 54. Being largely a relative measure, the BNPL will always register a proportion of the population as being poor and the very small reduction in the proportion living below the BNPL does not illustrate the overall upward shift in living standards that occurred between 2006 and 2010. For example, Robertson\u2019s analysis of the impacts of the Millennium Challenge Account roading projects found the proportion of the population living on less than $3US per day reduced by 27% on the Santo East Coast and halved in rural Efate between the 2006 and 2010 HIES surveys 8. Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 37 D. Poverty indicators and 2006 / 2010 comparative analysis D.1 Poverty Indicators 55. Expenditure poverty is measured in terms of poverty incidence, the depth of poverty, and the severity of poverty. Poverty incidence is the proportion of households/population below the defined food and basic need poverty lines for the particular sub-national area of Port Vila, Luganville or the rural areas. 56. The depth of poverty measures the gap between the average level of expenditures of the poor and the BNPL 9. It is expressed as the Poverty Gap Index (PGI). The PGI gives an indication of how much extra household expenditure would be required to bring people and households in poverty up to the BNPL. A higher PGI indicates a greater depth in the extent of poverty. 57. Poverty severity, expressed as the Squared Poverty Gap (the mathematical squaring of the poverty gap) or Poverty Severity Index, gives added weight to those households and individuals furthest below the poverty line. In the Poverty Severity Index, the higher the index, the greater the degree of poverty being experienced by those below the BNPL. This index helps policy-makers to see how \u201csevere\u201d the depth of poverty is by giving extra weight to the very poorest. It also helps to identify how resources might be redistributed among the poor to reduce inequality. D.2 Incidence of Food Poverty 58. The incidence of food poverty has more than halved, from 7.4% of the population affected in 2006 to 3.2% of the population in 2010. This remarkable progress meant cutting the incidence of food poverty by half throughout the country. This is consistent with the increased consumption of household produced food and the strong economic growth during the period 2006-2010, which resulted in an increase in total household consumption expenditure; particularly on food items (refer Table 8). 59. The incidence of food poverty declined from 5.4%, to 2.8% in Port Vila, and from 6.6% to 2.6% in rural areas, between 2006 and 2010. However, in Luganville the incidence of food poverty increased from 2.2% of the population in 2006 to 8.2% of the population in 2010; higher than the average incidence of food poverty anywhere in the country in both 2006 and 2010. This is also a high incidence of food poverty by Pacific standards.

It is not, however, unusual to have within country variations. In Samoa (2008), for instance, the incidence of food poverty in the rest of Upolu was 8.1%, more than four times the average incidence. While the share of household produced food consumed increased between 2006 and 2010 for all expenditure deciles in Port Vila and rural areas, it declined for the lowest quintile in Luganville from 32.1% in 2006 to 22.8%. This is the same segment of the population experiencing a higher incidence of food poverty. 9 If the BNPL were $50 per capita adult equivalent per week and the average level of expenditure of those households below this level was $40 per week the poverty gap would be 0.2 or 20%. Thus if there were 1000 persons in the households below the BNPL it would cost $10000 per week in direct transfers (1000x$10) to \u201cbuy\u201d these poor out of poverty. Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 38 Table 15 and Figure 8: Incidence of food poverty in 2006 and 2010 D.3 Incidence of Basic Needs Poverty and Hardship 60. Unlike the reduction in the incidence of food poverty, the incidence of basic needs poverty has barely changed; it was 13.0% of the population in 2006, down to 12.7% in 2010. Maintaining economic growth during the global economic crisis enabled Vanuatu to sustain some progress in reducing basic needs poverty. Overall, however, the relatively strong growth in Vanuatu did not trickle down to the poorest segments of the population and had very little impact on poverty reduction. The incidence of poverty indicators are shown in Table16 and Figure 9. The results are consistent with what might be expected from the general performance of the Vanuatu economy over the period between 2006 and 2010.

The HIES survey found that the population of Luganville increased by almost 39% between 2006 and 2010 and that the average household size is estimated to have increased from 4.6 to 5.6 over the same period. For households in the poorest three deciles the household size is estimated to have increased from 5.2 to 6.5. These are the largest increases in household size in any of the three areas and may have contributed to increased numbers falling below the BNPL. Proportion of HH and Population with Weekly p.c.a.e.

In-depth studies of the performance of various economic sectors in the country (e.g. agriculture, fishery, services, tourism and manufacturing), as well as the dynamics of labour market, are needed to better understand which sectors have performed comparatively well and who reaped the benefits of such performance. Further, economic policies should be analysed thoroughly to unravel biasness and lack of inclusiveness. 66. In an effort to localize MDGs targets, Vanuatu has adapted the targets of MDG One \u201cEradicate extreme poverty and hunger\u201d to a reduction in basic needs poverty level to 2% by 2015. Achieving that target would be an enormous task and would require higher levels of annual growth rate that is more broad based and inclusive. 67. Luganville, however, appears to be something of an anomaly with the rate of poverty incidence increasing between the two reference years. It seems that whilst Port Vila and the rural areas benefitted from the general economic growth, led by tourism, favourable commodity prices, increasing remittances from the New Zealand Recognized Seasonal Employer scheme and infrastructure investment, Luganville has been somewhat left behind. 25.0 20.0 15.0 10.0 5.0 0.0 % 2006 2010 2010 2006 Vanuatu average Port Vila (urban) Luganville (urban) Rural Households Population Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 40 68. According to the survey data, the average household size of the lowest three expenditure deciles (L3D) in Luganville increased by a quarter between 2006 and 2010. Over the same period the expenditure of these households rose by about 37% in current prices. Thus expenditure per capita increased by only about 12% with the food component of the CPI increasing by about 26%. This resulted in the increase in households falling below the BNPL. D.4 The depth and the severity of poverty 69. As discussed earlier (in section D1), the depth and severity of poverty are measured by the Poverty Gap Index 11 (PGI) and the Squared Poverty Gap Index (SPGI) 12 respectively (Table 17). The PGI is Indicator 2 of Target 1, Goal 1 of the MDGs. Table 17: Poverty Gap Index (PGI) and the Squared Poverty Gap Index (SPGI) in 2006 and 2010 70. At the national level the PGI (depth of poverty) for Vanuatu has declined from 5.6 in 2006 to 2.9 in 2010. This means there needs to be an average 2.9% real increase in income of households below the BNPL for them to move just above the BNPL. This PGI is significantly lower than, for example, Samoa (8.2 in 2008), Fiji (9.9 in 2008/09), Tonga (6.3 in 2009) and the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) (9.3 in 2005). Since the average inflation rate for 2011 was 0.6%, and rose to around 1.9% in 2012, assuming perfect equality in the distribution of income, a minimum of a 5% real increase in income is needed to achieve 100% poverty reduction by 2013 at the national level. The PGI was highest in Luganville, at 6.4 (up from 2.9 in 2006), followed by Port Vila (5.4, down from 10.4 in 2006), and lowest in the rural areas (2.3, down from 3.8 in 2006). This means that households with expenditure that falls below the BNPL have, on average, a total expenditure that is 5.4 % (Port Vila) and 6.4% (Luganville) below the BNPL. In contrast, households below the BNPL in rural areas have average expenditure that is only 2.3% below the BNPL (Table 17). 71.

Table 18 summarizes the MDG 1 poverty target indicators in 2006 and 2010. There has been progress towards the achievement of MDG 1, particularly in the area of eradicating hunger and food poverty. While fewer people are below the FPL and BNPL in 2010, compared to 2006, there has been a small increase in the group vulnerable to falling back into poverty. As discussed, Luganville lags behind with deteriorating indicators for all targets. Table 18: MDG 1 poverty indicators in 2006 and 2010 E. Expenditure distribution and inequality 73. The Gini coefficient is a measure of the level of inequality in the distribution of income or expenditure of households and individuals. In a situation of perfect equality (everyone has the same level of expenditure) the Gini coefficient would be equal to zero. At the other extreme, a Gini coefficient of 1.0 would indicate total inequality, where one household or individual received all the income while other households received none at all. Thus, an increase in the coefficient over time suggests an increase in the level of inequality. A \u201cnormal\u201d index level would be between 0.3 and 0.4; anything above this indicates a high degree of inequality. 74. The Gini coefficient has its limitations and must be interpreted cautiously as measure of inequality due to its inherent statistical bias towards the median income strata. It should be complemented by careful analysis of the actual distribution across expenditure and/or income deciles and the use of indicators such as the share of the poorest quintile in total expenditure and the ratio of the share of the poorest quintile to the share of the highest quintile, which are indicators 1.4 of MDG 1. For instance, in Vanuatu, the total share of the middle expenditure households (5th, 6th and 7th deciles combined) in 2010 was 29.3%, compared to 23.8% of total expenditure for the lowest four deciles combined; and 46.8% of total expenditure for the top three deciles (8th, 9th and 10th). Note that the 8th decile has only a slightly larger share of total expenditure (11.1%) compared to the 7th and 6th deciles, 10.5% and 10.0%, respectively (Table 20).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "287e2c02-98a4-4971-b018-050a7e008b5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "287e2c02-98a4-4971-b018-050a7e008b5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e04efc187debf58c0a7db272d726478c038efd0c649d6e56749a48234b2b6043"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa24d814-3c45-45cb-b094-e44772e68650", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc501683b603e101abbd7a0f48c29bea4a639033c9056cec588c5cf8094fae19"}}, "hash": "67b37b4a83fad68f354e60dff83ae4e35d881d90b102ea3f5d7c1989dd443c08", "text": "Millennium Development Goal (MDG1) Indicators 2006 & 2010 Vanuatu Port Vila(urban) Luganville(urban) Rural 2006 2010 2006 2010 2006 2010 2006 2010 1.1 Proportion of Population below Basic Needs Poverty Lines % 13.0 12.7 20.1 18.4 12.2 23.6 11.5 10.0 Proportion of Population vulnerable to falling into poverty; per capita adult equivalent expenditure <=10% above BNPL % 3.0 3.4 5.0 5.3 2.4 6.9 3.0 3.3 1.2 Proportion of households with per capita adult equivalent expenditure below the minimum level of dietary energy consumption (FPL) % 6.0 2.7 4.7 2.2 2.2 6.0 5.1 2.0 1.3 Poverty Gap Index (PGI) - Depth of Poverty 5.6 2.9 6.7 5.4 2.9 6.4 4.3 2.3 Squared PGI - Severity of Poverty 3.0 1.0 3.2 2.0 1.2 2.6 2.3 0.8 1.4 Share of poorest quintile (20%) in consumption by region % 7.4 8.3 7.5 10.0 8.2 9.3 7.2 8.4 Ratio of Share of poorest quintile (20%) to highest quintile 5.7 4.6 5.4 3.6 4.7 4.1 5.9 4.7 HH Gini Coefficient: (0 = perfect equality 1 = perfect inequality) 0.41 0.31 0.46 0.25 0.41 0.28 0.40 0.31 Population Gini Coefficient n/a 0.37 n/a 0.34 n/a 0.35 n/a 0.36 Note 1: Some indicators for 2006 have been revised to be consistent with 2010 methodology Note 2: Proportion of Population below", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38c39141-e4b5-4546-8dbb-0e21ec83cce8": {"__data__": {"id_": "38c39141-e4b5-4546-8dbb-0e21ec83cce8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca81f2453a1d48522df3211541a17af87dd7f295249fbfac9db811d2c2b68aa7"}, "3": {"node_id": "0aa5d9e7-7111-4b1e-8bc5-62f5258eb9ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7129199a21c674adcff38e9ef7d760c5678a1947c5bb387146f3370348e2e501"}}, "hash": "5c55f92a3fe2eeb9cd3530b0e6a9222546e3f2e99983c649863b73b5c68df425", "text": "US$1 (PPP) per day not available. Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 42 Table 19: National and sub-national Gini coefficients of expenditure in 2006 and 2010 75. In 2010, the Gini coefficient has been estimated for both households and for the population. The Gini coefficient tends to be higher for the population, as poorer households tend to be larger and this accentuates inequality. Table 19 shows a substantial decrease in the Gini coefficient at the national level (from 0.41 in 2006 to 0.31 in 2010) and for rural areas (from 0.40 in 2006 to 0.31 in 2010), but an even greater decrease in the urban centres (Port Vila, from 0.46 in 2006 to 0.25 in 2010, and Luganville, from 0.41 in 2006 to 0.28 in 2010). The largest decrease in the Gini coefficient was in Port Vila. This is consistent with the pattern of economic growth over the period from 2006 to 2010. Growth sectors were construction, government and public sector, tourism and other related services (e.g. wholesale and retail trade and transport) and most growth was concentrated in Port Vila and the surrounding areas in the island of Efate. 76. The Gini coefficients can be depicted graphically in Lorenz Curves where the further the expenditure line is from the line of equality, the greater the degree of inequality. Figures 10.a, 10.b, and 10.c illustrate the Lorenz curves for national level, Luganville, Port Vila and the rural areas. The greater the convexity of the line the greater degree of inequality.

The average weekly expenditure of the lowest three deciles increased by 51.3% (Table 20). The lowest quintile\u2019s share of total expenditure increased by 12.2%, from 7.4% in 2006 to 8.3% in 2010. The share of the lower middle expenditure quintile remained the same and the share of the upper middle expenditure quintile increased by 9.1% to 20.4% of total expenditure in 2010, up from 18.7% in 2006. Meanwhile, the share of the highest expenditure quintile declined from 41.7% in 2006 to 38.2% of total expenditure in 2010. Interestingly, there was a redistribution of expenditure away from the top expenditure decile to the 1st, 6th, 7th, and 8th deciles, leading to improvement in Gini coefficient, PGI and SPGI (Table

In Port Vila and surrounding areas in the island of Efate, the following sectors - construction, government, public sector, tourism and other related services (e.g. wholesale and retail trade and transport) - generated more employment and income for the lowest and the lower middle expenditure households than the upper middle and the highest expenditure households between 2006 and 2010. This explains the decrease in Gini coefficient, and reduced incidence of basic needs poverty, as well as the significant decrease in PGI. It is also consistent with the decline in the ratio of the share of the highest quintile to the share of the lowest quintile in total expenditure, from 5.4 in 2006 to 3.6 in 2010. The lowest quintile\u2019s share of total expenditure increased from 7.5% in 2006 to 10.0% in 2010, while the share of the highest quintile in Port Vila declined from 40.8% in 2006 to 35.7% in 2010. 79. The share of the lower middle (decile 4 and 5) and upper middle (decile 6 and 7) expenditure quintiles increased slightly, from 15.1% and 19.1% in 2006 to 16.4% and 20.6% in 2010, respectively, at the expense of the highest expenditure strata. This improved equality and reduced poverty. The lowest quintile in Port Vila, however, reaped most of the benefits of economic growth, with a 33% increase in its share of total expenditure. The lowest decile had the largest increase (49%) in total expenditure, compared to 9% and 8% increases in total expenditure for the lower and upper middle expenditure quintiles, respectively. This also explains the significant reduction in the incidence of severe poverty (food poverty). Table 21: Weekly per capita adult equivalent Food and Basic Needs Poverty Lines and average costs for the lowest three deciles: 2006 and 2010 80. In Luganville and the rural areas, average weekly costs faced by the lowest three deciles, increased by 113.8% and 124.8%, while their total weekly expenditure increased by 32.1% and 64.7%, respectively. As previously noted, the lowest three decile group in Luganville experienced the lowest increase in the total weekly household expenditure, and an even lower increase in p.c.a.e weekly expenditure (10.8%).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f870945c-c7e9-426e-a5ec-38818b569c43": {"__data__": {"id_": "f870945c-c7e9-426e-a5ec-38818b569c43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7db321b8958f4bdd76a9415e4793a5520dda01adf8fcb3f4d6fda6c5813a7c8d"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd949d00-2dcd-40e8-ba3c-8140d5befd21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0762c2eb9533c0fa93fec4170ec11959fae79a23175a5da752f221265b54db92"}}, "hash": "66223a7d98042cd90482d519f6b1878db7163bfb805a993b36668eb8a4dff161", "text": "As a result, the decline in the ratio of the share of the highest quintile to the share of the lowest quintile in total expenditure in Luganville declined from 4.7% in 2006 to 4.1% in 2010; in rural areas the same ratio declined from 5.9% in 2006 to 4.7% in 2010.

All deciles from 2nd to 6th experienced small increases or decline in share of total expenditure, which explains the high Gini coefficient. 82. In Luganville, most of the redistribution was confined within the highest three deciles, away from the top decile to the 9th and 8th deciles. The shares of the lowest and the lower middle expenditure quintiles increased by only 13% and 4%, respectively, while the shares of the upper middle expenditure and the highest expenditure quintiles decreased by 7% and 2%, respectively, this meant that the limited improvement in inequality was, mainly, at the expense of the middle strata. This is consistent with the increase in the incidence of basic needs poverty as more lower-middle income households slipped below the BNPL.

Agriculture, fishery and forestry, however, still employ 61% of total employed population (59% and 62% of employed males and females, respectively, according to the 2009 Census). Construction, which is relatively labour intensive, recorded the highest growth rates and contributed 5% of total employment in 2009 (9% of employed males and less than 1% of the employed females), and was mainly concentrated in Port Vila. The wholesale and retail trade sector, contributing 8.2% of total employment (6.7% and 10.2% of total males and females employed, respectively) has also experienced solid growth during the same period.

In 2010, 7.8% of the population, nationwide, and 10.8%, 11.6% and 6.5% in Port Vila, Luganville and rural areas, respectively, had expenditure that is less than 20% above the BNPL, meaning they are very vulnerable to falling below the BNPL. Moreover, 11.2% of the population nationwide is relatively vulnerable to falling below the BNPL as their expenditure level is more than 20%, but less than 50%, above the BNPL (Table 23). The sectors that drove the 2006-2010 growth, particularly construction, have slowed down, while the traditional productive sector continues to stagnate. GDP real growth rates fell to 1.6% (2010) and 1.4% (2011), compared to an average of over 5% annually over the 2006-2010 period.

The increased inequality across female-headed households can be related to the pattern of economic growth between 2006 and 2010, during which the booming sectors (e.g. construction) were male dominant and concentrated in urban areas. According to the 2009 census, 94% of construction workers were males and the sector contributed 5% of overall employment in Vanuatu. As illustrated in Figure 16, men dominated most formal employment, particularly in urban-based sectors such as construction, manufacturing, government and public administration, utilities, and administrative services. The few exceptions are wholesale and retail, financial and insurance, professional and scientific, education, and international organisations, Note agriculture numbers relate to formal (paid) employment and exclude subsistence agriculture. 94. In 2010, women were 49.3% of the total population (up from 48.8% in 2006). The proportion of women in Port Vila and Luganville declined from 49.9% and 49.7% in 2006 to 49% and 47.7% in 2010, respectively, but increased in the rural population from 48.6% to 49.6%. Women were slightly underrepresented in the top two deciles where they were 48.5% (9th) and 48.3% (10th), of individuals and slightly underrepresented in the bottom two deciles where they were 50.3% (1st) and 50% (2nd) of individuals; this was a slight deterioration from 2006.

Women in rural areas are better off than their counterparts in urban areas, particularly girls below 14 years of age. In urban areas, the proportion of girls under 14 below the BNPL ranges between fifth to a quarter of girls in this age group, compared to 11% in rural areas. 98. A sizable proportion of women live in households where expenditure is just 20% above the BNPL, and a larger proportion in household where expenditure is between 20% but less than 50% above the BNPL. This means they are vulnerable to dropping below the BNPL. Around half of the female population in rural areas are not poor, compared to less than third of females living in urban areas.

Men\u2019s labour force participation rate was 80%, compared to 61.4% for women. The participation rate was higher in rural areas (84% and 64.8% for males and females, respectively) compared to urban areas (70.4%, and 52.3% for males and females respectively). The unemployment rate was 5% but varied considerably between urban (12%) and rural (2.3%). Unemployment is higher for women (5.2%) compared to men (4.2%). The difference between male and female unemployment is larger in urban areas, with an unemployment rate of 14.7% for women compared to 9.9% for men. In rural areas the rates are 2.4% for women compared to 2.2% for men. 101. According to the 2010 HIES, the main sources of employment in urban centres (Port Vila and Luganville) are formal employment in the private sector (45%) followed by the government (19%), while in rural areas subsistence production and producing goods for sale are the main sources of employment and income. With 75% of the population of Vanuatu living in rural areas, the HIES results are consistent with the 2009 Census finding that subsistence production and producing goods for sale are the main income for 46% of households, while wages and salaries derived from formal employment (in both government and private sector) support only around 36% of households.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49fa1390-6ac2-4750-aee5-4459aaf93510": {"__data__": {"id_": "49fa1390-6ac2-4750-aee5-4459aaf93510", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6cbcc07f212f364aaaa3c650cc84c82f06d2958744db25eb9ac3f2ba65e51da"}, "2": {"node_id": "02a59585-f37b-4024-8c33-ab26cded3e2b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7264dfd636e7337b31e27936958491ad5652b79d7f5d9b34fa0b27880d6b8449"}}, "hash": "f01e3a0f2776aea70e85658e5e423ad7abd420d0ec0fa5638749c8aed264aa6f", "text": "G.3 Economic activity and poverty Figures 17.a and 17.b: Labour force participation and employment (2009) persons aged 15+ % 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Vanuatu Urban Rural Unemployed rate (%) Males unemployment rate Females unemployment rate % 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Vanuatu Urban Rural Employment-population ratio (EPR,%) Males (EPR,%) Females (EPR,%) Labour force participation rate (LFPR,%) Males (LFPR,%) Females (LFPR,%) Source: Vanuatu National Population and Housing Census, 2009 Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 56 60.0 50.0 40.0 30.0 20.0 10.0 0.0 % of all HH Port Vila Luganville Rural areas Work for pay: Employee (government) Work for pay: Employee (private) Employer Self Employed (no employees) Voluntary work Unpaid family work Produce goods for sale Produce goods for own consumption (Subsistence) None/not stated Figure 18: Main economic activities in households I) Port Vila 102.

This compares to 0.7% of male government employees being below the FPL, and 14.7% above the FPL but below the BNPL. This is consistent with wage, occupation and promotion policies and practices in government that effectively discriminate against women, resulting in the concentration of women in low paid occupations (e.g. cleaning and clerical positions). The government increased the minimum wage in 2012 from 26,000 Vt to 30,000 Vt per month and these women would have benefitted disproportionately since they are concentrated in minimum wage type work. 103.

Government employees are slightly better off than their counterparts in the private sector. Self-employed (no employees) and market vendors, particularly women, are among the most vulnerable. Self-employed males are significantly better off than their female counterparts. The majority of market vendors are female (91%) and are more vulnerable to falling below the BNPL than any other group, yet only a small portion of them (5.3%) are already below the BNPL. Business owners, employers, are less vulnerable, particularly females compared to their male counterparts (Table 29). Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 57 106. Table 30 shows that retirees and people with disabilities in Port Vila are particularly vulnerable to being below the BNPL with 18.1% of retirees and 23.3% of people with disabilities below the BNPL. There is no significant difference by gender in the vulnerability of these two groups. Students are also a vulnerable group, with 17.4% below the BNPL and at least 14.6% are highly vulnerable to falling below the BNPL. There are more female students below the FPL (2.5%) than male students (1.7%). 107. One in five unemployed people looking for work (20.8%) in Port Vila are below the BNPL, 1.9% below the FPL, and 20.8% are vulnerable to falling below the BNPL.

The higher incidence of poverty and hardship in Luganville is reflected throughout all categories of economic activities. Around 15.8% of government employees are below the BNPL, 3.8% are below the FPL, while 12.5% are vulnerable to falling below the BNPL. Gender differences are evident with the proportion of female government employees below the FPL and BNPL (4.0% and 13.3% respectively) higher than the proportion of their male counterparts (3.7% and 11.0% respectively). As in Port Vila, Table 31 shows that government employees, in general, are better off than their counterparts employed by the private sector. This is particularly the case for men. In the private sector, women are better off than their male counterparts, yet worse off than women working in the government sector. 109. Female employers are all above BNPL, but more vulnerable than male employers.

Unpaid family workers and subsistence workers are the two groups with the highest food poverty in rural areas (3.6% and 2.8% below the FPL, respectively). Women working in subsistence production are slightly better off than their male counterparts in the same group. This can be attributed to the fact that many women working in subsistence production live in male-headed households with a primary source of income from government or private sector employment. 115. People with disabilities in rural areas are highly vulnerable. While there are more men than women with disabilities below the BNPL and the FPL, women with disabilities are vulnerable to falling into poverty due to nearly half the group being clustered within 50% of the BNPL. Meanwhile, 63.8% of men with disabilities in the rural areas are not poor compared to 48.6% of women with disabilities. Retired people in rural areas are less vulnerable than in urban areas. 116.

Education level 117. The incidence of food and basic need poverty is significantly higher among people with low levels of education (no schooling or primary education only) in urban areas. However, this is less of a predictor of poverty in rural areas where agriculture and subsistence farming are the main economic activities. In urban areas one fifth of people with no schooling or only primary education are below the BNPL, 3.5% are below the FPL. The incidence of basic needs poverty is higher among women with no schooling or only primary education (21.7% and 20.5%, respectively) than for men with no schooling and Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 63 men with only primary education (18.1% and 18.9%, respectively). In rural areas the incidence of basic needs poverty for both men and women with no schooling and primary education is 13% and 9%, respectively. 118. The incidence of basic needs poverty is higher in Luganville for women with no schooling and primary education only, as well as for men with primary education only, compared to Port Vila.

In urban areas, men with no schooling are less likely to be vulnerable to poverty than all other groups with low levels of education.

Around 22.7% and 21.1% of elderly men and women, respectively, are below the BNPL in Port Vila (Table 36). In Luganville, 21.9% and 25.4% of elderly men and women, respectively, are below the BNPL. In contrast, only 10.9% and 9.0% of elderly men and women, respectively, are below the BNPL in rural areas. Half of the elderly men and women in rural areas are not poor, compared to around a third of elderly men and women in urban areas.

Most of the increase in children\u2019s poverty took place in Luganville, where the proportion of children in the lowest three deciles increased from 32.4% to 36.2% of all children in Luganville. Meanwhile, the proportion of children in the lowest three deciles has decreased marginally in Port Vila and rural areas from 37.4% and 36.1% in 2006 to 35.8% and 35.9% in 2010, respectively. The proportion of children in the highest expenditure quintile remained around the same at the national level, driven by an increase in Port Vila from 12.5% in 2006 to 14.1% in 2010 that was offset by a decline from 17.6% and 15.1% in 2006 to 16.8% and 14.3% in Luganville and rural areas, respectively.

On average, 81.8% of households in Port Vila rely on electricity as the main source of household lighting, compared to 86% in 2006, while 10% use candles and around 4.3% use kerosene lamps. Households in high expenditure deciles rely more on electricity (86.2%, 84.5% and 91.4 % of households in 8th, 9th and 10th deciles, respectively, around the same as in 2006) compared to households in lower expenditure deciles (71.9%, 75.9% and 79.3%, compared to 70%, 77.5% and 87.8% in 2006, of households in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd deciles, respectively). Reliance on electricity as a source of energy for lighting in rural areas has increased significantly since 2006 as electricity distribution systems have been established in a number of communities, notably provincial headquarters. Households in Luganville and rural areas rely less on electricity as the main source of energy for lighting (around 73% and only 39.9% of households in Luganville and rural areas in 2010, compared to 30% and 10% in 2006, respectively). 131. Kerosene lamps and candles are widely used in Luganville and rural areas. Households in high expenditure deciles rely more on electricity. Around 12.8% and 6.6% of all households in Luganville, but 42.5% and 2.9% of all households in rural areas, rely on kerosene lamps and candles, respectively. Most poor houses in rural areas, particularly within the first expenditure decile, lack access to electricity (only 19.2%, 27.8% and 26.7% of households in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd deciles in rural areas, respectively, have electricity). 132. Wood and coconut shells are the main source of energy for cooking, contributing around 46.2%, 81.4% and 90.5% of energy utilized for cooking in Port Vila, Luganville and rural areas, respectively, followed by gas in urban areas (37% and 14.4% of households in Port Vila and Luganville, respectively) and very few households in rural areas (around 3%), mainly due to the difficulty in getting gas to rural areas. Electricity is also a main source of energy for cooking for households in top three deciles in Port Vila and, to a lesser extent, in the top deciles in Luganville and rural areas. Nearly all poor households in rural areas and Luganville (around 90%) and about two thirds of poor households in Port Vila rely solely on coconut shells and wood for cooking. Meanwhile, more than half of households in the highest expenditure deciles in Port Vila use gas as a source of energy for cooking compared to a quarter and no more than 10.3% of the high expenditure households in Luganville and rural areas.

Access to improved water systems depends more on the geographic location, less on vulnerability status, of households. At the national level the average proportion of all households with access to piped water (private and shared) is 35% compared to an average of 39% for households below the BNPL. Meanwhile, on average, 21% of all households rely on wells, springs, rivers and other sources for drinking water compared to a slightly higher average of 24% of all households below the BNPL. The proportions of households below the BNPL with access to piped water (private and shared) are 76%, 55% and 21% compared to 85%, 78% and 21% of non-poor households in Port Vila, Luganville and rural areas, respectively. The gap between non-poor households and those below the BNPL in terms of access to water is, however, wider in Luganville. (Figures 20 and 21). Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 70 Figure 21: A comparison of access to drinking water by vulnerability status and area 135. Very few households in rural areas have access to private, shared piped and/or standpipe water (14%, slightly higher than 12% in 2006) as there are very few distribution systems in rural areas. A significant proportion of households in rural areas (26.4% of all households, 36% of households below the BNPL and 23.5% of non-poor households) rely on wells, springs, rivers and other unsafe sources of drinking water, compared to the national average of 20.5% and only 2.6% and 2.5% of all households in Port Vila and Luganville, respectively. (Figures 20 and 21). 136. Consequently, households below the BNPL in rural areas suffer multiple deprivations compared to their counterparts in urban areas. Figure 21 shows that only 20.2% and 17% of households below the BNPL in rural areas have access to piped and stand pipe water. In contrast, the proportions of households below the BNPL with access to piped water in Port Villa and Luganville are 76.5% and 55.3%, respectively. Around 18.8% and 16% of households below BNPL in Port Vila and Luganville, respectively, have access to stand pipe water. 137. Similar to access to water, access to improved sanitation systems depends more on the geographic location, less on the vulnerability status, of households. Interestingly, however, the link between the vulnerability status and access to improved sanitation systems is stronger than in the case of access to improved water systems, particularly in urban area. While modern sanitation systems (flush toilet) are available in urban areas, particularly in Port Vila, rural areas lack access to sanitation and rely, mostly, on pit toilets because there is no piped water system to provide the water required for a flush toilet system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49c96515-8932-479e-b0dc-8d2d925e09db": {"__data__": {"id_": "49c96515-8932-479e-b0dc-8d2d925e09db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d10c51f14ff0dcf0cd93ba02d1099422a3db21509adf8a648c0d18cb35c77c7"}, "2": {"node_id": "851bf5f0-5409-433c-b92b-5d0c9274c79a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db3d6fb2013739d6e0d2fd27bc3220442c52203dbb631c9c7609a7ec5946a193"}}, "hash": "3ae4437eb2c2475d09abc05a5b146cf71cdcf062f4770436a518a26402f58b41", "text": "Rural Area (belowBNPL) Luganville (belowBNPL) Port Villa (belowBNPL) Rural Areas (avarage) Luganville (avarage) Port Villa (avarage) 0 40 20 60 10 50 30 70 5 45 25 65 15 55 35 75 80 Well, spring, river and/or other Standpipe (private orshared) Piped water (private or shared) Household/community Tank % of households Well, spring, river and/or other 21% National (Average) Piped water (private or shared) 35% Household/ community Tank 27% Standpipe (private orshared) 17% National (below BNPL) Well, spring, river and/or other 24% Piped water (private or shared) 39% Household/ community Tank 20% Standpipe (private or shared) 17% Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 71 Figure 22: Access to sanitation by vulnerability status 138.

Only 1.7% of households have private landlines and 60% of these landlines are in top decile households. Households in Luganville mostly rely on mobile phones (95% of all households) and only 1% of households have private landlines, but these are distributed across all expenditure deciles. In rural areas, 82% of households have mobile phones, and less than 1% has private landlines. Around 14% of all households (15% of households in the lowest three deciles and 10% of households in the highest three deciles) have no access to phones. 142.

Only 4.3% of total mobile expenditure was incurred by households below the BNPL, but this represented 4.1% of their total non-food expenditure.

I.4. Education 143. Expenditure on health and education is very low, especially for those with total expenditure below the BNPL. This is not surprising since Vanuatu has a fairly comprehensive system of publicly provided health and education services. Since 2009, the government of Vanuatu and development partners have implemented a comprehensive policy package geared towards achieving universal primary education. This included a school grants programme that replaced school fees for years 1 to 6 of primary education. 144. The HIES data indicates that 6.7% of total non-food household expenditure went toward education-related costs. Households below the BNPL spent around 11.5% of their non-food expenditure on education compared to less than 9% by households above the BNPL. Overall approximately 36% of the expenditure on education was incurred by households in Port Vila, 6.0% by households in Luganville, and 58% by households in rural areas. 145. Levels of educational attainment vary considerably between urban and rural areas. A larger proportion of the population across all deciles in rural areas has no schooling or primary schooling only compared to urban areas. The weaker correlation, therefore, between education attainment levels and poverty in rural areas compared to urban areas, Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 74 Expenditure on Education % of Non-Food Expenditure by Poverty Status Poverty/Vulnerability Status Vanuatu Port Vila (urban) Luganville (urban) Rural Households below FPL 10.9 11.3 11.3 10.3 Households > FPL but < BNPL 11.5 12.9 8.4 10.2 Average Households below BNPL 11.5 12.8 9.2 10.2 Households < 20% above BNPL 9.4 10.2 7.8 8.4 Households < 50% above BNPL 8.3 8.2 8.1 8.4 Households < 100% above BNPL 8.3 9.1 7.1 7.5 discussed earlier, is mainly due to the lack of access in rural areas. While, on average, 6% and 30% of the heads of households in Port Vila have no schooling and only primary education, respectively, and, similarly, 7% and 37% of the heads of households in Luganville have no schooling and only primary schooling, respectively; 31% and 44% of the heads of households in rural areas have no schooling and only primary education, respectively. 146.Comparing the lowest expenditure quintiles in urban and rural areas, we find that only 3% and 6% of the heads of households in Luganville and Port Vila, respectively, have no schooling, compared to 40% of the heads of households in rural areas. Meanwhile, 27% of the heads of households in the highest expenditure quintile in rural areas have no schooling, compared to 5% and 7% of household heads in this expenditure group in Port Vila and Luganville, respectively. 147.The gender-gap is wider, however, in urban areas where more females, particularly among low decile households, lack access to school in comparison to rural areas, where lack of access to education affects both males and females equally. Expenditure on education in rural areas constitutes 58% of total expenditure on education in Vanuatu, compared to 36%, and 6% of total education expenditure for Port Vila and Luganville respectively. This is, chiefly, due to the exceptionally high transaction costs in rural areas. Table 41: Expenditure on education as a percentage of non-food expenditure by vulnerability status 148. Expenditure on education constitutes, on average, 11.5% of non-food expenditure for households below the BNPL. The proportion of non-food expenditure devoted to education is slightly higher in Port Vila, compared to Luganville and rural areas. The percentage of non-food expenditure, spent on education is lower for households above the BNPL and it declines as the overall households\u2019 expenditure rises, particularly in rural areas (Table 41). The proportion of non-food expenditure devoted to education declines as overall expenditure increases. I.5.

Table 42: Expenditure on health as a percentage of non-food expenditure by vulnerability status J. Income analysis 151. At the national level, income from wages and salaries accounted for 37% of total household income and about three- quarters and two thirds of all household income in Port Vila and Luganville, respectively, but only about 23% of household income in the rural areas. In urban areas, however, wages and salaries accounted for 82% and 75% of total income for households below the BNPL in Port Vila and Luganville, respectively. This suggests that there are a significant number of \u201cworking poor\u201d households in urban areas. In the rural areas, wages and salaries accounted for only about 10% of the incomes of those below the BNPL. 152. Wages and salaries accounted for 73%, 58% and 27% of the total income of households that are not poor in Port Vila, Luganville and rural areas, respectively. This suggests that non-poor households in rural areas rely on other sources of income such as producing goods for sale and subsistence production. This also suggests a significant degree of inequality in the wage structure, particularly in urban centres where wages are typically the main source of income. The proportion of men receiving wages and salaries is significantly higher than the proportion of women throughout the country and across all income deciles. However, for male and female heads of households, on average wages and salaries account for the same proportion of total income.

Concluding Remarks 154. It is hoped that the analysis contained in this report will stimulate national policy makers in Vanuatu, and users in the international community, to seek more detailed analysis on specific issues identified in this report such as human poverty, food consumption patterns, specific areas of expenditure including health and education, gender, children in poverty and geographic disparities. Further and more detailed analysis of broader socio-economic issues in Vanuatu, which can be done using the survey data, will add substance to the key poverty indicators. Most importantly, it would inform the formulation of policies and initiatives aiming at addressing the various dimensions of human poverty, and the better targeting of vulnerable groups. It would also assist in the further development of the conclusions and hypotheses relating to poverty in Vanuatu which are identified in this report. 155. The results from the analysis of the 2010 HIES demonstrate significant progress towards eradicating hunger (food poverty) in Vanuatu, apart from in Luganville. The incidence of food poverty (at the national level) declined from 7.4% in 2006 to 3.2% of the population in 2010. The incidence of basic needs poverty has declined, slightly, from 13% in 2006 to 12.7% of the population in 2010. Poverty reduction progress was, primarily, driven by economic growth during the period from 2005 to 2009. Vanuatu was able to withstand the global economic shocks which have negatively impacted most Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 78 Pacific countries. The structure and composition of growth influenced, to a great extent, the distribution of the benefits of growth and manifested into disparities based on geographic location, households\u2019 sources of income, gender, education levels and economic activity, as the distribution of the benefits of growth followed the same sectoral imbalances that inhibited the growth structure. 156.

For example, a person\u2019s location can interact with gender and labor market profile to produce different welfare outcomes across individuals and households. Similarly, inequality is deeper and wider when more than one vulnerability factor is present. 159. The standout geographic disparity was the rise in poverty and inequality in Luganville which should be addressed by policy makers. There is some degree of gender dimension to poverty in Vanuatu, particularly in urban areas. The gender dimension intertwines with other household characteristics and factors that are mutually reinforcing, such as geographic location, marital status, number of children, age, education level, economic activity and main source of income. Employment and wage gender-based discrimination is evident in both public and private sectors, particularly in urban areas where formal employment is main economic activity and, hence wages are the main source of income for individuals and households. 160. Gender-based inequality is deeper in urban areas, compared to rural areas. Women\u2019s share of the benefits from economic growth has been less than that of their male counterparts. Women have better access to resources and social/family support networks in rural areas, particularly single mothers, and female heads of households, widows and elderly women. The lower level of monetization in rural areas, compared to urban areas, also plays an important role in reducing women\u2019s vulnerability in rural areas. 161. Between 2006 and 2010, economic growth was mainly concentrated in urban areas and, disproportionately, in male- dominated jobs. This meant deterioration in gender-based inequality and increased vulnerability of women to poverty. A sizable proportion of females have an expenditure that is just 20% above the BNPL and a larger proportion has expenditure between 20% and 50% above the BNPL. This renders them very vulnerable to falling below the BNPL. Girls below 14 years of age are more vulnerable to food and basic needs poverty than women and girls above the age of 14. 14 Datt, G., and M.

Government continues to be the main source of secure, and relatively well-paid, employment, while the private sector is slowly making progress in terms of job creation and income generation. Subsistence and small scale commercial production and trade continue to be a major source of livelihoods and income, particularly in rural areas. People who are unemployed, elderly and/or have disabilities in urban areas are highly vulnerable to poverty, while in rural areas this is not necessarily true. Thanks to access to land and the slower pace of monetization in rural areas, compared to urban areas, unemployed people in rural areas are, generally, less vulnerable than their counterparts in urban areas. 163. There is a strong correlation between vulnerability status and education level in urban areas, but the correlation is much weaker in rural areas. A strong three-way relationship between gender, low or no education and poverty prevails in urban areas, where vulnerability and the incidence of basic needs poverty is higher among women with no schooling and only primary education, than in the case for men. 164. Children are highly vulnerable to poverty and hardship, with 37% living in households with expenditure less than the BNPL. Poor households (the lowest three deciles) and households in rural areas tend to have more children than households in the highest expenditure quintile and households in urban areas. Children are, therefore, concentrated in the three lowest expenditure deciles. Children in Vanuatu continue to suffer from multidimensional poverty and deprivation. 165. The gap between income poverty and human poverty is widening in Vanuatu, as there has been no significant improvement between 2006 and 2010 in most dimensions of human poverty. This is mainly due to the government\u2019s lack of capacity to provide public services, such as health, education, water and sanitation, particularly in rural areas and remote islands. Access to energy remains a major challenge. Access to basic services and energy depends more on the geographic location, and on the vulnerability status, of households. Consequently, households below the BNPL in rural areas suffer significantly more multiple deprivations than their counterparts in urban areas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1d27be6-dc56-4836-898b-d37d2e7cb9eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1d27be6-dc56-4836-898b-d37d2e7cb9eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ecf3ad273c0fa38a7318a0678a770c5c75c49614a47ae3186cb669fa58969e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8ebfcb2-054e-4b94-8403-b1be3bbc5cb5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-hardship-poverty-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80cf0c75807d7e5aeadc0ae1bafbbb332e1c476822deecc2357b81e46450119f"}}, "hash": "15cc01888120ca739afc4ca89b9c3d32c1d38016b126167a4c0e066499625e22", "text": "Inequalities and geographic disparities are more severe when viewed through a human poverty, rather than just income poverty, lens.

Salaries and high transactions costs in rural areas account for most of the government expenditure on health and education. L. Policy Implications Principles for intervention 166. The characteristics of the poor revealed by the HIES provide a wealth of information for policy makers to use to efficiently and effectively target poverty reduction strategies in Vanuatu. If interventions to reduce poverty are to be effective as well as financially feasible, they must be based on proven and cost effective mechanisms to allocate resources and assistance directly, efficiently and effectively to poor households, rather than relying on indirect effects, such as spillover, externalities and market forces in allocating benefits from economic growth. Although the explicit goal of many types of interventions is to reduce poverty, they are also likely to benefit some non-poor as well. Given the limited funding for programmes, it is preferable to direct available resources, and therefore benefits, as effectively as possible toward those who need them most. 167. Direct targeting is based on identifying poor households or individuals (e.g. identifying those who are below the poverty lines). If providing assistance directly to the poor is not feasible, intervening on the basis of their characteristics (characteristic targeting) might be the best option. For instance, where the poor are concentrated in certain regions, islands or districts (as is the case in Luganville), more public services could be provided to those areas. Other characteristics, such as education level, are useful to guide additional support. Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 80 168. However, characteristic targeting has two potential drawbacks. First, some non-poor households possess the same characteristics as the poor and, hence, receive benefits (leakage). Second, not all poor households possess the designated characteristics to benefit from the intervention, and consequently might not be reached (under-coverage). The success of characteristic targeting depends on the ability of programme designers to minimize these problems. 169. Targeting poverty reduction programmes to a subgroup of the population has an intuitive appeal for policymakers, but it also poses considerable difficulties. Direct targeting explicitly identifies individual households as poor or non-poor and directly provides benefits to the former group and tries to withhold them from the latter. The specific form of such targeting depends on the ability of governments to identify the poor. 170. If beneficiaries can be identified on a household or individual level, transfers and/or some other forms of direct assistance could be mobilized to reduce their vulnerability. For example, the provision of food or medical care to elderly and disabled individuals, or to households that displays clear signs of malnutrition, or to individuals who have special needs, such as pregnant and lactating women, are all forms of direct targeting of assistance. However, the \u2018screening\u2019, needed to identify the poor, such as their level of income, can be very expensive to implement. 171. In practice, there are two alternatives to direct targeting of the poor based on income measures. The first involves targeting types of spending and can be called \u2018broad targeting\u2019. Under this approach, no attempt is made to reach the poor directly as individuals. Instead, programmes hope to achieve gains by targeting types of spending that are relatively more important to the poor. Spending on basic social services, such as primary education and primary health care, is one example. Directing resources to rural development, because poverty is often concentrated in rural areas, is another. It is important to note that around 60% of poor households in Vanuatu are in rural areas, despite the significant reduction in poverty. 172. The second approach entails targeting categories of people. Under this approach, which can be called \u2018narrow targeting\u2019, benefits are directed to certain types of people. Examples are food stamp schemes targeted to mothers in food-insecure communities or micro-credit schemes targeted to women vendors. In Port Vila, for instance, households with a female head who has no schooling or only primary education are highly vulnerable. So targeting through combining gender, education level and head of household criteria could be effective. Also, while targeting female-headed households in general might not make sense, given that they are represented in highest as well as the lowest deciles, directing resources\ufffdto\ufffdhouseholds\ufffdheaded\ufffdby\ufffdfemale\ufffdsole\ufffdparent\ufffdwith\ufffdthree\ufffdor\ufffdmore\ufffdchildren\ufffd\u2013\ufffdwho\ufffdare\ufffdgenerally\ufffdin\ufffdpoverty\ufffd-\ufffdmay\ufffd be efficient. 173.

Alternatively, such indicators as gender, nutritional status, disability or household size could be used to identify beneficiaries. 174. The second approach to narrow targeting is self-targeting. Instead of relying on an administrator or a policy maker to choose participants in and /or beneficiaries of the poverty reduction programme, this approach relies on beneficiaries opting in through incentives that would induce the poor, and only the poor, to participate in a programme. Examples are public employment schemes that use work requirements and conditions to help screen out the non-poor, and subsidy programmes that target items that the poor consume but the rich do not. 15 UN System Task Team\u2019s report \u201cRealizing the future we want for all\u201d June 2012. Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 81 175. Both narrow targeting approaches offer the hope of avoiding two commonly identified errors of targeting: 1) leakage of benefits to the non-poor, which are measured by the ratio of non-poor beneficiaries to total beneficiaries; and 2) under- coverage of the poor, which is measured by the ratio of poor beneficiaries to the total poor population. 176. One drawback of indicator targeting is that not all of the poor can be identified by the same indicators. For example, even though most countries have regions which are poorer than others, not all poor people live there, nor do all rich people live elsewhere. Hence, geographic targeting can often benefit some of the rich and can bypass\u2014and perhaps even tax\u2014some of the poor who live in the better-off areas 14 . 177. Narrow geographical targeting at the level of the village or the urban community could reduce the leakage of benefits to the non-poor in countries or regions where, because of common agro-climatic or socioeconomic conditions, the standard of living in the majority of the households in most villages and urban communities is similar. The households in these villages would often have similar sources of income, and could be affected by the same factors, such as road conditions, the distance to the nearest town, and the availability of public facilities such as health, education and water supply. 178. Common methods of assessment can obscure some of the potential benefits of narrow targeting. Assessments of the benefits from geographical targeting provide an example. Several studies have examined the potential impact on poverty of allocating a predetermined budget optimally across regions. But the static gains of such an allocation are often found to be modest, reflecting, in essence, that the poor are heterogeneous. 179. Recent work, which allows for gauging the potential dynamic effects of programmes, suggests, however, that static assessments can greatly underestimate the long-term benefits. Gains could percolate through and strengthen over time as a result of the positive external effects of development in poor regions on the productivity of the private investments by poor households. Vanuatu 180. In order to enable poor households to take advantage of economic opportunities and access the benefits of economic growth, Vanuatu\u2019s poverty-reduction programme would have to focus efforts on building up the human capital of the working-age population. This would enable working members of poor households to secure more rewarding employment and generate better income. 181. An important implication is that programmes to improve educational institutions -particularly those providing technical training and helping to retain children in school -represent social investment with potentially very high long-run returns. A crucial prerequisite to the success of any demand-side interventions, however, is to tackle the supply-side challenges first. 182. Supply-side challenges facing public services, including education and health, constitute the government of Vanuatu\u2019s biggest barrier in its efforts to make progress on poverty reduction and other MDG goals. There will not be any major progress in terms of human poverty unless these challenges are addressed effectively. There is a need, therefore, to allocate and manage education and health expenditure more efficiently and effectively, focusing on reducing transaction costs and maximizing benefits to the targeted beneficiaries. Other public services (such as access to sanitation, water and energy) face similar challenges. Rural areas should be the highest priority of a well-designed strategy and action plan to improve the access, quality and coverage of public services. 16 Sampson, M.

M. Policy Recommendations 184. A social and economic policy package to accelerate poverty reduction will need to simultaneously address challenges at the macro and micro levels through micro-level and local people-centered development initiatives that complement overall macroeconomic policies and are geared towards balanced, sustainable and inclusive growth and widening the economic base. 185. At the macro level, maintaining the downward trend in income poverty and accelerating the progress towards the achievement of MDGs, particularly goal one, will require concerted and coordinated efforts to push ahead with reforms that will allow Vanuatu to sustain and broaden economic growth and enhance its inclusiveness in the country. This requires continued investments in transport and communication infrastructure and services, allowing the rural majority to access domestic and export markets, as well as quality and affordable health, education and financial services, which will directly contribute to the reduction of human poverty. 186. While some progress has been made in improving public services, there is a need to create a stronger sense of accountability in order to achieve service delivery targets. This requires a focus on improving the overall management of basic services, especially health and education services, through the strengthened use of data and information systems, human resource development, performance management, and more effective use of resources. Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service also requires a more concerted effort to implement decentralization policies. This includes strengthening provincial governments and municipalities, and clarifying their roles and responsibilities for service delivery. 187. Vanuatu faces a \u201cdouble disease burden\u201d where both communicable diseases and emerging non-communicable diseases coexist, putting severe stress on the health budget and overall health system. The Ministry of Health is facing difficult choices on how to prioritise health spending between primary health care and the increasing demand for tertiary care Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 83 particularly for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). At present around 23% of the health budget is spent on community health while 42% of health workers are absorbed by the two referral hospitals. 188. A major concern across the health sector is the lack of personnel both in number and skills mix, to drive the health sector plan and deliver basic health services especially in the rural areas. There is a significant potential for working with civil society and faith-based organizations in the provision of health services. There are opportunities to strengthen partnerships with these organizations to deliver community-based services that can complement and supplement government-run health services. 189. There is a need to finalize the development of a National Human Resources Development Plan to identify labor market skill needs and how these can be met based on likely population and labor market participation, in order to achieve better alignment between the supply and demand sides of the labor market. This has been identified as a high priority action by the review of the Vanuatu Priority Action Plan (PAA) conducted in 2011. 190. There is a need for a paradigm shift that is innovative, inclusive and progressive. In fact, \u2018Business as usual cannot be an option and transforma\u00active change is needed. As the challenges are highly interdependent, a new, more holistic approach is needed to address them\u2019 15. Discussed below are options to address some of the issues raised in this report. 191. The next generation of policy reforms in Vanuatu should address various dimension of human poverty, rather than narrowly concentrate on income poverty, and focus on inclusive growth and innovation policy and sound economic governance in order to meet the needs of the low income population. In other words, these policies should focus on delivering high performance products and services at low cost to the people whose needs are generally not addressed. 192. Innovative policies can improve quality of life by using new technologies to improve, for example: access to health services\ufffdparticularly\ufffdto\ufffdouter\ufffdislands\ufffdand\ufffdrural\ufffdareas\ufffd\u2013ultra-low\ufffdcost\ufffddiagnostics\ufffdand\ufffdtechnology,\ufffdeasy-to-understand\ufffd information about disease, mobile health clinics, access to medical expertise; education through online training or distance learning, virtual libraries, remote access to classroom and laboratory facilities,; access to financial services through online and mobile banking, financial inclusion/ literacy training, delivery of micro-finance services; farmer services through real-time information on: crop patterns and prices, weather forecasts, crop and livestock insurance; food security through improving crop yield, reducing post-harvest losses, integrating supply chains, expanding access to market demand and pricing information. 193. Social protection is a promising strategy to address poverty and vulnerability.

For example, social protection in the form of non-contributory social pensions is a proven strategy for reducing poverty, vulnerability and inequality for people of all ages. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that social pensions both reduce the poverty and vulnerability of older people, and result in net contributions to multigenerational household economies and the wider community. It is, also, possible to design social protection programmes that provide aging and vulnerable population with access to medical care, income opportunities and basic rights. 194. A recent study projected impact of various social protection interventions on poverty in Vanuatu, shows that a universal cash grant with a value equal to 30% of the national poverty line and an estimated cost of around 0.7% of GDP, targeting all children under 5 years of age may result in up to 10% reduction in the incidence of basic needs poverty and 10% to 18% in the depth of poverty. The study also included Kiribati, Samoa and Solomon Islands 16. Social protection schemes can be more effective when combined with abolishing school fees (which has already been implemented in Vanuatu) and/or providing school meals. Vanuatu Hardship & Poverty Report 2012 84 195. One option to address geographical disparity is through local economic development (LED). LED is a participatory process in which local people from all sectors work together to stimulate local commercial activities.. It encourages public, private and civil society sectors to establish partnerships and find local solutions to shared economic challenges. A LED strategy is a process-oriented and non-prescriptive endeavor incorporating local values (such as poverty reduction, basic needs, local jobs, integrating social and environmental values); economic drivers (value-added resource use, local skills training, local income retention, regional co-operation); and development (the role of structural change, quality of development). 196. Addressing the youth bulge in Vanuatu should be one of the key priorities, given their demographic dominance, energy and growing presence in society. Not only young people, but society as a whole, will benefit from empowerment initiatives. Studies have shown that return on investments in youth range from 200 to 1000 percent in terms of improved educational outcomes, crime prevention, healthier lifestyles, and more. Empowering young people through building capacity and creating access to opportunities can be an effective development strategy for Vanuatu. 197. The youth strategy should therefore aim to empower young people as agents of positive change, catalysts for peace and development, and as leaders and contributing members of society by building on their strengths, harnessing their dynamism, and championing their voices. Partnerships with regional and international agencies can help in tapping much needed technical and financial support to design programmes which can empower youth socio-economic empowerment. 198. Vanuatu needs to develop a Women\u2019s Economic Security and Rights (WESR) strategy which can apply new mechanisms and processes to promote women\u2019s economic security and rights. The WESR strategy should address legal, governance and decent work deficits in the market place operated within the local governments and city/provincial councils. The WESR can also help in raising awareness to policy makers about gender norms and biases that limit women\u2019s economic opportunities and work with stakeholders to legislate and to amend laws to end discrimination against women traders and home-based workers particularly in the informal economy, to build/strengthen organizations, movements and networks and leadership among women in the informal economy and encourage transformative dialogues and partnerships with influential national and local leaders and institutions.

Post-2015 Development Agenda Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/13 Asia-Pacific Aspirations: The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) promotes regional cooperation for inclusive and sustainable economic and social development in Asia and the Pacific, a dynamic region characterized by growing wealth, diversity and change, but also challenged with persistent poverty, environmental degradation, inequality and insecurity. ESCAP supports member States with sound strategic analysis, policy options and capacity development to address key development challenges and to implement innovative solutions for region-wide economic prosperity, social progress, environmental sustainability and resilience to external shocks. ESCAP, through its conference structure, assists member States in forging a stronger, coordinated regional voice on global issues by building capacities to dialogue, negotiate and shape the development agenda in an age of globalization, decentralization and problems that transcend borders. A key modality for this strategy is the promotion of intraregional connectivity and regional integration. ADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance. UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone. On the ground in 177 countries and territories, UNDP offers global perspectives and local insight to help empower lives and build resilient nations.

MDGs Report, eighth in the series under the partnership, comes at a critical juncture when we need one big final push to achieve the MDGs in less than 1,000 days. As we gear up our efforts, citizens and leaders of the world are also discussing the possible framework of a transformative development agenda beyond 2015. Thus, this 2012/13 report, while identifying the areas needing accelerated actions and emerging challenges is intended to inform this global process. The High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda submitted its report to the Secretary- General, marking a watershed in our quest for a sustainable and inclusive development agenda for all. The report reaffirmed that the MDGs have been a powerful development framework that has rallied political support, prioritization within national plans and budgetary reallocations to address the most abject forms of poverty in the developing countries of the world. This report presents some perspectives on the post-2015 development agenda as part of the system-wide discussion initiated by the Secretary-General. Being much less locked into traditional development pathways, Asia and the Pacific region has a clear window of opportunity to foster change. The perspectives and aspirations of this region for a new United Nations Development Agenda beyond 2015 should be of much interest to the global community. The report has been informed by a series of sub-regional consultations and briefings with a wide range of stakeholders. It has also been informed by a series of background papers commissioned among eminent regional experts. Most importantly, this report builds on the work of the strengthened regional partnership between ESCAP, ADB and UNDP. The Asia-Pacific region as a whole has achieved considerable success with the MDGs, particularly in reducing income poverty. Nevertheless, the region is off track in several areas: hunger, health and sanitation \u2013 and even in areas such as income poverty where achievements have been spectacular, large gaps remain. Nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor still live in this region. Even after 2015, there will therefore be a significant \u2018unfinished agenda\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a03b466a-8727-4741-9315-10ad8dc598de": {"__data__": {"id_": "a03b466a-8727-4741-9315-10ad8dc598de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f85490348d90d0e4f8409b45addbe061b3896e4f934c865471dce43f675e22ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "f587da22-e085-43be-98c7-ffb68bdb9294", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "115b1f2858e51bc41fc07b2c214862ec85cf9c5435105414d8c2fa6d3b2fa2c5"}}, "hash": "f5c7ee7de9e1558c0bceaa09d802db8378b76dd284096cb3851758d58af67399", "text": "Even after 2015, there will therefore be a significant \u2018unfinished agenda\u2019.

Moving forward, countries of the Asia-Pacific region will need to bring together the three broad pillars of sustainable development \u2013 economic prosperity, social equity and environmental sensitivity \u2013 and replace short-term horizons with longer-term sustained benefits. Likewise, they will need to address issues of social justice, human rights and fairness. In some cases, this may entail trade- offs and difficult policy choices depending on national priorities. A post-2015 global agenda that is applicable to all will still need to account for huge variations in country circumstances, considering the high diversity of Asia and the Pacific. This may require not only ensuring adequate living standards; it will also require customization of targets and indicators, along with flexibility for additional national goals. Lastly, it should be clear who is responsible for achieving the goals and ensuring the means of implementation of the new development agenda, at global, regional and national levels, recognizing the Rio principles. The Asia-Pacific region has been in the vanguard of global economic and social development. Now it has the opportunity to ensure that future progress is firmly anchored around the principles and goals of sustainable and inclusive development.

Nevertheless, the region is off track when it comes to hunger, health and sanitation \u2013 and even in areas such as poverty a number of countries are lagging some way behind. After the target date of 2015, there will therefore be a significant \u2018unfinished agenda\u2019. The region also faces many emerging threats including rising inequality and unplanned urbanization, along with climate change and environmental pressures such as pollution and water scarcity. Among the issues that will be of greatest importance in the years after 2015 are: Poverty and inequality Although levels of poverty have fallen, about 743 million people in the region still live on less than $1.25 a day. If the poverty benchmark is $2 a day, the number rises to 1.64 billion, revealing a high degree of vulnerability; some 900 million people could easily fall into abject poverty (below the $1.25 a day poverty line) due to personal misfortune or economic shocks or natural disasters. Another concern is increasing inequality. During the 2000s, while most Asia-Pacific countries enjoyed rapid economic growth, the benefits were being distributed unevenly. Between the 1990s and the latest available year, the population-weighted mean Gini coefficient for the entire region rose from 33.5 to 37.5. Income inequalities are evident between urban and rural areas, between women and men, and among different caste, ethnicity and language groups.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e0556fc-4d99-44c1-8518-5998073321b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e0556fc-4d99-44c1-8518-5998073321b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6008ee81295efbb543e15d9796b1fe9ce19714e06a9b4fbf1a2f66f5ad08fba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "71158c5e-6535-4ec2-9892-fc01acfe1690", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb17802251e0ae4b6224e7abf030db4e774ec17247882719abbf44de10ae9005"}}, "hash": "7c647e0311d6633f86f98068ea39e44bcf0dc2ab1edcd94595335ca84a80959c", "text": "Asia-Pacific Aspirations: Perspectives for a Post-2015 Development Agenda Asia and the Pacific has made good progress towards the MDGs, though the region will still need to make greater efforts if it is to meet some important targets.

This is due to the nature of growth and the pattern of structural change in many countries in which workers move from agriculture into low-productivity services. A consequence has been that many people are in vulnerable employment \u2013 working on their own or contributing to family work. Without adequate systems of social protection, they have to take whatever work they can find or generate, no matter how unproductive or poorly compensated or unsafe. About 60 per cent of the Asia-Pacific region\u2019s workers are in vulnerable employment. Continuing hunger and food insecurity Another major problem for the region is food insecurity. Asia and the Pacific accounts for more than 60 per cent of the world\u2019s hungry people. The situation is worst in South Asia where the proportion of people undernourished is 18 per cent. A particular concern is the level of undernutrition among women. OVERVIEW: Asia-Pacific Aspirations: Perspectives for a Post-2015 Development Agenda 2 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 As well as damaging women\u2019s health, this reduces their productivity and affects the nutrition and health of their children. Many countries also have high levels of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. An abiding bias against women The region is still a long way from achieving gender equality despite the successes in achieving gender parity at the three educational levels. Across Asia and the Pacific, women face severe deficits in health and education and in their access to power, voice and rights. The starkest evidence comes from skewed male- female sex ratios: in many countries households have strong preferences for male children, and take measures to exercise these. There have been some improvements in women\u2019s health, notably in East Asia, but in South Asia women on average have shorter life expectancies. A continuing problem in many countries is gender- based violence. Women in Asia and the Pacific are also less likely than men to own assets or participate in non-agricultural wage employment. They also tend to be informal workers \u2013 a consequence of their limited skills, restricted mobility and existing gender norms. In addition, women have the load of unpaid domestic work to which they devote large amounts of time and energy. Women also have limited political participation: the Asia-Pacific region has the world\u2019s second-lowest percentage of women parliamentarians. Limited achievements in health The Asia-Pacific region has not performed well on health targets compared to other MDG targets. In 2011, there were around 3 million deaths of children under five, and nearly 20 million births were not attended by skilled health personnel. While having been reduced by more than half, maternal mortality is still high, and limited access to emergency obstetric care as well as high unmet needs for modern contraceptives remain serious concerns. South Asia still accounts for the second- highest number of maternal deaths worldwide (26.8 per cent) followed by South-East Asia. The region has performed better on communicable diseases: the spread of tuberculosis has been reversed, and in the majority of countries efforts to control HIV are also bearing fruit. This, however, needs to be sustained. But, with rising living standards, countries across the region are also facing rising levels of non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory disease and diabetes. Low-quality education The Asia-Pacific region has expanded children\u2019s access to basic education. Nevertheless, as many as 18 million children of primary school age are still out of school. Even for children who are attending school, there are major concerns about the quality of their education and many drop out after primary school. Low educational attainment is partly a consequence of low public expenditure: government spending on education, relative to other sectors, is lower in Asia and the Pacific countries than in the world\u2019s low-income and lower-middle income countries. Heightened vulnerability and economic insecurity A common thread through many of these issues is vulnerability and economic insecurity. Many households are now facing higher levels of risk. These are often related to family or household events \u2013 such as death, disability or loss of employment of the breadwinner, or catastrophic expenditures resulting from illness of a family member. Moreover, with ageing populations, there are now more elderly people whose lifetime savings are no longer adequate to cope with the rising costs of living and health care. Households are also increasingly exposed to external risks \u2013 particularly economic crises. The Asia-Pacific region has been subjected, for example, to the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, and to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2879283-2de1-40fd-a890-a78947dd02e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2879283-2de1-40fd-a890-a78947dd02e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3aafad5017ba2898eab8fcc4f1140f7f3031ae3c2eb1d524e437e3a1c5928528"}}, "hash": "3aafad5017ba2898eab8fcc4f1140f7f3031ae3c2eb1d524e437e3a1c5928528", "text": "the global financial crisis since 2008. Families across the region have also faced rising food prices. In addition, there are external risks to health: in 2003 the region experienced the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and it is continuously exposed to emerging and re-emerging public health threats. Economic insecurity is heightened in the absence of decent and comprehensive social protection systems. Public social security expenditure remains low at less than 2 per cent of GDP in the one-half of countries where data are available. More than 60 per cent of the population of the Asia-Pacific region remain without any social protection coverage. Rapid demographic change Across the region people are living longer, and fertility rates are falling. These are signs of success but also present new problems \u2013 as some countries have to deal with higher dependency ratios of the elderly, other countries face the challenge of a large youth bulge. While the increase in the proportion of working-age OVERVIEW: Asia-Pacific Aspirations: Perspectives for a Post-2015 Development Agenda 3 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 population in many countries in the region can yield demographic dividends, it also poses the challenge of creating enough decent and productive jobs. Unplanned urbanization Every day an estimated 120,000 people are migrating to cities in the Asia-Pacific region and between 2010 and 2050, the proportion of people living in urban areas is likely to grow from 42 to 63 per cent. This is partly caused by demographic change. But more importantly this is the result of urban-biased development driven by globalization and the consequent lack of adequate opportunities in rural areas. Pressure on natural resources Economic growth, driven by industry and manufacturing, has largely relied on the exploitation of natural resources. At the same time, the patterns of consumption and production have become increasingly unsustainable and are taking a severe toll on the environment, posing a real threat to the planet \u2013 with heightened levels of air and water pollution. Water supply issues are also becoming more complex and difficult. Exposure to disasters The region is the world\u2019s most disaster-prone area and faces increasing risks of disaster. Between 1970 and 2010, the average number of people in the region exposed to yearly flooding, for example, increased from 30 million to 64 million, and the population living in cyclone-prone areas grew from 72 million to 121 million. Moreover, the impacts of disasters are being transmitted across national boundaries: as Asia- Pacific countries become interlinked through regional value chains, a catastrophe in one country can have significant knock-on effects elsewhere. The rising threat of climate change The Asia-Pacific region will be hard hit by a changing climate. This is likely to undermine both food security and livelihoods, and bring huge economic and social costs. Small island developing states in particular will be confronted with rising sea levels. While most of the accumulated CO2 has come from the developed countries, an increasing contribution is coming from Asia and the Pacific. For tracking CO2 emissions in the region, however, the perceived outcome depends on the measure: the region as a whole is an \u2018early achiever\u2019 when emissions are considered in relation to GDP, but regressing or making no progress in reducing CO2 emissions per capita. The MDG experience The MDGs have had a major impact. They have caught the popular imagination \u2013 through their engaging simplicity, quantitative targets, comprehensible objectives, and laudable intentions. They have helped rally political support for global efforts to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable human development. Inevitably, they have had their limitations. The MDGs tended to focus more on the symptoms of poverty rather than on the root causes, and could not respond to all development issues. Moreover, their genesis was not fully inclusive \u2212 having little input from civil society organizations, NGOs or other stakeholders \u2013 yet they derived from a series of intergovernmental processes and UN Summits held in the 1990s on various development issues. There has also been some debate on how the goals should be applied. They were originally intended as collective targets for the world as a whole rather than for individual countries. Subsequently, it was argued that every country should adopt every goal and target, which in some cases would set very ambitious objectives. In practice many Asia- Pacific countries localized the MDGs, adapting the targets to their own circumstances and adding new goals. The MDGs did not specify strategies. To a large extent this was deliberate. The MDGs aimed to build the broadest possible consensus around a common and uncontroversial agenda of poverty reduction. Nor were the goals presented as rights.

Such critiques offer important insights, and some would argue that given these weaknesses, and the likelihood that some goals will be missed, the MDGs should be allowed to expire. A more constructive approach, however, is to reconsider the strengths and weaknesses of the framework so as to fine-tune the goals and deploy their full potential. The impact of the MDGs In the absence of a counterfactual, development success cannot be unequivocally attributed to MDGs. In any case, it may be too soon to judge. Barely 10 years have OVERVIEW: Asia-Pacific Aspirations: Perspectives for a Post-2015 Development Agenda 4 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 passed since the adoption of the goals. It took some time for the MDGs to be accepted, adopted, and finally adapted. One criterion for success would be the extent to which the MDGs have shaped national policies. By this measure, they have clearly had an impact in some countries. A UNDP study found, for example, that the MDGs have influenced national processes and institutional frameworks in 11 Asia-Pacific countries. In addition, 14 countries across the region are applying the \u2018MDG Acceleration Framework\u2019, which helps countries identify bottlenecks and sharpen strategies for stepping up progress. The MDGs have also opened up a huge space for civil society. Grassroots organizations, think tanks and NGOs have used them to push their respective agendas \u2013 on gender equality, for example, health, education, and human rights \u2013 and to highlight wide inequalities, showing how the MDG achievement within countries has been uneven \u2013 much lower in poor regions and for disadvantaged or excluded groups. Another legacy of the MDGs is the improved monitoring and dissemination of social data. The MDGs provided a relatively simple monitoring framework. Almost all countries in the region prepare national MDG reports. Nevertheless, there are still many data gaps. Learning from the MDG experience The MDGs have contributed to a wide body of knowledge \u2013 for governments, civil society and international organizations. This will be invaluable in designing a new framework. This experience suggests that the new framework should enable: Greater integration \u2013 The existing MDGs were articulated goal by goal. A post-2015 framework should better reflect the reality that goals are multi- dimensional, multi-sectoral and interdependent \u2013 allowing for coordinated action on several fronts. More ambitious gender goals \u2013 By and large, the MDGs have not delivered on gender. The MDGs gender focus was limited and weak in such areas as universal access to sexual and reproductive health or violence against women and girls. Moreover, progress on gender equality cannot be based exclusively on gender-related goals. Rather, gender priorities need to be incorporated into each goal. A greater focus on emerging environmental problems \u2013 The environmental targets within Goal 7 were to some extent considered in isolation, and did not, for example, address the environment-poverty nexus, or reflect people\u2019s vulnerability and exposure to disasters, or put major emphasis on climate change. Renewed partnerships for development cooperation \u2013 Goal 8 of the MDGs was weakly formulated, hard to track and was only partially monitored. As globalization deepens, a new framework will need to reassess regional and global cooperation and governance, recognizing changes in global economic realities as well as the Rio principles. Designing a new framework To gather views on a potential new development framework, the ESCAP/ADB/UNDP Regional Partnership on the MDGs undertook a series of subregional consultations, and one dedicated to the least developed countries \u2013 bringing together stakeholders from government, civil society and United Nations agencies. The consultations concluded that the post- 2015 development agenda should drive transformative change \u2013 serving as an advocacy tool, a guide for national and global policies, and an instrument for policy coherence. The consultations also reflected the desire to build on the region\u2019s experience of adapting goals to national circumstances. Those attending the workshops gave their personal views on what should be the main priorities: their most popular choices were \u2018quality education for all\u2019, closely followed by \u2018eradicating income poverty\u2019. There was also broad consensus on the need to pursue inclusive economic prosperity, social equity and environmental responsibility. Participants believed that the new framework should enable people- centred development and incorporate the principle of universality of social protection, combined with specialized social assistance for the poor. Guiding principles for a successor framework This report argues that a successor framework should not only complete the unfinished agenda and aspirations of the MDGs but also tackle emerging issues not conceived of in the original framework. Drawing from Asia-Pacific perspectives, it presents some core principles.

Based on the three pillars of sustainable development \u2013 The pillars cover economic, social and environmental dimensions of development transformation. This would entail a people-centred approach that puts a strong emphasis on equity, social justice and human rights for the current and coming generations. OVERVIEW: Asia-Pacific Aspirations: Perspectives for a Post-2015 Development Agenda 5 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 2. Underpinned by inclusive growth \u2013 Sustained economic growth provides increased incomes that enable households to lift themselves out of poverty and gain greater access to education and health opportunities. But sustained growth will only maximize social outcomes if it is inclusive. 3. Customized to national development needs \u2013 The new framework could specify overall shared global goals, while individual regions or countries could identify the most appropriate targets to meet those goals and adopt indicators to measure their progress. 4. Embedded in equity \u2013 Development gains should not systematically bypass sections of the population. This principle can be operationalized by ensuring that indicators under the eventually selected goals track not just aggregate or average progress, but also progress at the lower end such as the bottom quartile. Hence development policies must address social and economic gaps in outcomes, access and opportunities. 5. Backed by identified sources of finance \u2013 Notwithstanding the continuous relevance of ODA, governments in Asia and the Pacific will need to mobilize more domestic resources and seek out and leverage innovative financing mechanisms. At the same time, governments will need to use public expenditure more effectively. 6. Founded on partnerships \u2013 The primary responsibility will rest with countries, but in a globalized world each country also has to deal with many cross- border spillovers whose solutions will rely on regional and global partnerships. While the agenda will be relevant to all countries, institutions and people, the responsibilities of implementing it should be shared in accordance with capabilities. 7. Monitored with robust national statistical systems \u2013 A new framework is likely to put statistical systems under greater pressure. It should therefore incorporate key measures of statistics delivery \u2013 setting targets for the development of new and improved existing datasets, including the strengthening of national statistical systems for policy analysis, advocacy and monitoring. Goal areas for the next framework The post-2015 goals should set a transformative agenda for Asia and the Pacific. Based on the above core principles, this report proposes the following goal areas: 1. Zero income poverty \u2013 The region should build on its recent achievements in poverty reduction and set an ambitious goal of \u2018zero poverty\u2019. 2. Zero hunger and malnutrition \u2013 The aim should be universal food security, through among other things, much more attention to agriculture. 3. Gender equality \u2013 Gender will need to be assessed comprehensively, with more indicators on empowerment and on violence against women. 4. Decent jobs for everyone of working age \u2013 This would require full and productive employment and government commitment as an \u2018employer of last resort\u2019 translated into an explicit recognition of employment goals and targets in all policies and programmes. 5. Health for all \u2013 Priority should go to maternal, newborn and child health, universal access to sexual and reproductive health, including family planning, and to reducing the prevalence of communicable diseases and controlling the spread of non-communicable diseases. 6. Improved living conditions for all \u2013 Everyone should have access to safe and sustainable drinking water and sanitation, as well as basic energy services. 7. Quality education for all \u2013 This should start with early childhood care and education, followed by higher quality education at all levels, including adult literacy and lifelong learning, and providing learning and life skills for young people and adults. 8. Liveable cities \u2013 The poorest city dwellers should have effective shelter and secure tenure along with essential social infrastructure. They should also have access to affordable, safe and energy-efficient mass transport. 9. Environmental responsibility and management of natural resources \u2013 This will mean protecting critical ecosystems while reducing resource intensity and avoiding overexploitation of natural capital. At the same time countries will need to address climate change. 10. Disaster risk reduction \u2013 The region has witnessed natural disasters that have wiped out long-term development efforts. Any new development agenda should help mainstream disaster risk reduction in national budgets and development programmes. 11. Accountable and responsive governments \u2013 There is a call for more accountable, transparent and effective government at both national and local levels for more OVERVIEW: Asia-Pacific Aspirations: Perspectives for a Post-2015 Development Agenda 6 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 capable and efficient management of public resources and service delivery. 12.

The reform of global governance should reflect the Asia-Pacific ascendance in the global economy. The prospect and scope of financial and economic crises and commodity price volatility must be minimized in order to protect development gains. Framework scenarios The goal areas can be drawn into a framework with its architecture based on the level of ambition that eventually gains consensus. The scenarios range from the least ambitious one of continuing with the current MDG framework with some adjustments, especially on the goals relating to environment and international cooperation, to a far more aspirational model that is applicable to all countries and transformative enough to end poverty, aim for shared prosperity, and safeguard the planetary resources for current and future generations. The applicability to all countries would underline shared agendas while the customization of targets and indicators would reflect not only local circumstances, but also distinct responsibilities in accordance with the countries\u2019 own capabilities. Global discussions are likely to gain traction as the work of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals intensifies. Seizing the future The MDGs have demonstrated the value of rallying global support around common objectives. This experience can now serve as the basis for an even more vigorous effort in the decades ahead. Asia and the Pacific has been in the vanguard of global economic and social development. Now it has the opportunity to ensure that future development is not just rapid but more sustainable and fully inclusive. Now is the time to reach out and seize the future \u2013 and ensure rapid and equitable progress for the region\u2019s most vulnerable people. CHAPTER I: MDGs in Asia and the Pacific: Where we stand 7 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 T he Asia-Pacific region as a whole has had considerable success with the MDGs, particularly in reducing levels of poverty. Nevertheless, the region is off track when it comes to hunger, health and sanitation \u2013 and even in areas such as poverty, where the region has been more successful, a number of Asia-Pacific subregions and countries are lagging some way behind. There are, however, still significant opportunities. Even countries that appear off track on certain indicators could yet meet their targets. This is evident, for example, in the case of child malnutrition. Of the 14 countries currently off track in halving their prevalence of underweight children, 12 could attain their targets by accelerating their rate of progress by less than 2 percentage points per year. Overall progress To assess progress, 22 indicators at the national level and 21 at the regional and subregional levels have been used from the United Nations internationally comparable MDGs dataset, World Bank and UIS, which may, in some cases, show data that differ from those published by national statistical offices. This is explained later in this chapter in the section: \u2018Demand for data\u2019. For selected indicators, based on trends since 1990, the report categorizes progress into one of four categories: CHAPTER I MDGs in Asia and the Pacific: Where we stand Asia and the Pacific has made impressive progress towards the MDGs. But as the world\u2019s most populous region it still has the largest absolute number of people living in deprivation \u2013 and will need to make greater efforts if it is to meet the targets by 2015. Early achiever \u2013 Already achieved the 2015 target On track \u2013 Expected to meet the target by 2015 Off track: slow \u2013 Expected to meet the target, but after 2015 Off track: no progress/regressing \u2013 Stagnating or slipping backwards Table I-1 shows individual results while table I-3 presents grouped aggregates. These tables indicate that the Asia-Pacific region as a whole has had two great successes. The first relates to poverty: between 1990 and 2011, the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 per day fell by more than half \u2013 from 52 to 18 per cent (Box I-1). The second concerns drinking water: the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water fell from 28 to 9 per cent. In both cases, the region is classified as an \u2018early achiever\u2019. The region has also been successful on a number of other targets. It has, for example, achieved gender parity at all levels of education, and is on track to reach full primary enrolment and primary completion by 2015. It has stopped the spread of tuberculosis. It has also increased the proportion of land area that is covered by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48f555c5-f9ca-43a2-8cb2-daf2fc472aef": {"__data__": {"id_": "48f555c5-f9ca-43a2-8cb2-daf2fc472aef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2fb4e4fce730bef7e74158200ad0c54c75f3b52421b23c512fb4330f7180d8c8"}, "3": {"node_id": "961cec8b-58c5-4746-993f-289cf19a6a0a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6a524e4b8119e47a30a178cb9c5ec6b4ba2c2d84bbedaf1ef22fee89305851a"}}, "hash": "79abc9ff25db97eaa2f4cfd77cd4eab987e036f40b638e620e84a19232e8bca0", "text": "forests or that has protected status.

Those results might differ from those presented in this report, due to the use of different data sources and assessment methods.1 For more information on the targets and classification method, please see Technical Note 1. Source: Staff calculations based on the United Nations MDG database accessed on 27 July 2013; UNESCO Institute for Statistics, for the education-related indicators under Goals 2 and 3 provided data on 15 May 2013; poverty and inequality database from the World Bank for the poverty-related indicators under Goal 1 accessed on 30 July 2013.

Across the region during 2011, around 3 million children under five died and nearly 20 million births were not attended by skilled health personnel. For tracking CO2 emissions under Goal 7 there are a number of options. One is to use emissions per $1 GDP (PPP); another is to use emissions per capita. Each presents a different picture. On the basis of emissions per $1 GDP (PPP), as presented in these tables, 25 countries out of 43 with sufficient data for analysis are early achievers. However, on the basis of emissions per capita, 39 countries out of the 51 with sufficient data are regressing or not making any progress in reducing CO2 emissions per capita. Thus the region as a whole is an early achiever when considering emissions in relation to GDP because of the influence of countries such as India, but regressing or making no progress when it comes to CO2 emissions per capita. Countries that are classified as off track on certain indicators could meet their targets if they manage to accelerate their progress, which in some cases is feasible. This is true for the target of halving the prevalence of underweight children under five, for example (Figure I-1). For 30 countries for which data are sufficient for assessing the progress on this indicator, 14 are classified as off track. Twelve of these off-track countries could reach their targets by accelerating their rate of progress by less than 2 percentage points per year, the pace at which many of the on-track countries have progressed (Table I-2).

Box I-1 Assessing progress in reducing poverty In this report, as established in the official list of MDG indicators, in assessing progress on halving extreme poverty between 1990 and 2015 and estimating the number of people living in extreme poverty at national and regional levels, the indicator used is the proportion of people whose income is less than $1.25 per day measured at 2005 international prices, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). The \u2018one dollar a day\u2019 international poverty line was anchored to the national lines found in the poorest countries in 1990. Using updated data, the international poverty line currently is $1.25 a day at 2005 purchasing-power parity. The international line is simple and provides a common standard to measure absolute poverty. The use of the international poverty line to estimate the number of people living in extreme poverty at national and regional levels facilitates comparisons across countries, as compared to the limited comparisons which can be done with data based on national poverty lines. On the other hand, the international poverty line does not adequately reflect current standards of defining poverty which tend to be higher in less poor countries. National poverty lines also tend to change over time to reflect changes in living standards, particularly for rapidly developing countries. Therefore, countries tend to prefer using data based on their own national poverty lines in assessing the reduction of poverty. Due to this and other reasons related to adjusting for purchasing power parity, one can reach different conclusions regarding a country\u2019s progress in meeting the target of poverty reduction depending upon whether the international or national poverty lines are used. Bangladesh exhibits faster progress in reaching this target if judged by its national poverty line. The contrary would be true for some other countries, including Indonesia, the Philippines and Fiji. On the other hand, the progress assessment would remain the same for some other countries. Differences in progress classification between this publication and those in other publications could be due to the different methods used in assessing progress. This series of Asia-Pacific MDG regional reports uses a logit transformation for the analysis of progress on halving extreme poverty. The selection of this transformation is based on its ability to reflect the increasing difficulty in reducing the level of the indicator as the achievement improves. Another source for different classifications is the selection of the base year. In this report, the base year is 1990 or the earliest year after 1990 for which data are available for the different indicators. Other publications might use as the base year the year 2000 when the Millennium Declaration was signed. For more details on the classification method, please refer to Technical Note 1.

The differences appear in only five indicators. In some cases, the two largest economies have beneficial effects for the region as a whole. The most dramatic difference is in forest cover: without China and India this region is not an early achiever but regressing.

Similarly, in primary enrolment and primary completion the region without these two countries is not on track but slow. On the other hand, due to poor performance by India, the reduced region performs better on underweight children \u2212 moving from slow to on track. South Asia \u2013This subregion is on track for three, and an early achiever for seven, of the 20 analysed indicators for which it is possible to assess progress \u2013 and slow for the rest of the indicators. Significant advances are visible in Goals 6 and 7, except for basic sanitation, where the subregion has been making slow progress. Another area where the subregion has performed very well is in achieving gender parity in primary education. The subregion is behind on reducing malnutrition and improving child and maternal health. In this case, India has the largest influence. For poverty, the outcomes for the subregion excluding India are more positive than those for the subregion as a whole. However, in many other cases, the reduced subregion does worse \u2013 as with primary enrolment, forest cover and tuberculosis incidence. The reduced subregion is on track for two, and an early achiever for only five indicators, while it is slow for 12 and regressing for two. South-East Asia \u2013 This subregion has made the greatest progress, being on track for two, and an early achiever for 12, of the 21 indicators. It is slow on just six, mainly those related to child and maternal health, and for only Note: For more information on the targets, aggregation and classification method, see Technical Note 1.

The Russian Federation is the largest influence in this subregion; nevertheless the outcomes for the subregion without the Russian Federation are similar to those for the subregion as a whole.

The reduced subregion is an early achiever in access to basic sanitation, whereas the whole subregion is slow. Pacific \u2013 Here the monitoring of progress is seriously hampered by data limitations and small populations, making tracking of progress for standard indicators difficult. The partial picture presented in Table I-3 reveals that the Pacific Islands are an early achiever on four, and only on track for one, out of the 17 indicators for which sufficient data are available: gender balance in tertiary education; HIV prevalence; TB incidence; protected areas; and CO2 emissions per $1 GDP (PPP). The subregion has been progressing slowly on another nine indicators and has been regressing or making no progress on the remaining three. The poor performance with respect to environmental sustainability is particularly worrying, given the region\u2019s high vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. In the Pacific the dominant overall influence is Papua New Guinea which is home to almost 70 per cent of the subregion\u2019s population. A reduced subregion, without Papua New Guinea, has made better progress on gender equality in education, TB prevalence and forest cover, but it is regressing or making no progress in primary completion and CO2 emissions per $1 GDP (PPP). Least developed countries \u2013 The group includes 13 least developed countries (LDCs), including some which are emerging from conflicts and others that are highly fragile. The group as a whole has been making no or slow progress on 11 indicators. On the other hand, the group is an early achiever in seven indicators and on track in another three. For example, many LDCs for which data are available have done well in poverty reduction and several other MDGs. Nepal and Cambodia are early achievers and Lao PDR is on track.

The case of Nepal is interesting: despite a period of internal conflict, the country has managed to reduce the incidence of poverty from 53 per cent in 2003 to 25 per cent in 2010. This impressive achievement seems to be a combination of several factors including a decrease in household size, increased access to services, an increase in remittances, improvements in real wages and rapid urbanization. Disparities within countries The preceding sections have highlighted the disparities between subregions. But it is also important to emphasize that there are large differences between individual countries and even within countries. National-level data mask continuing disparities. One of the most consistent is between urban and rural areas. This is illustrated for water and sanitation in Figure I-2 which, for a selection of countries, compares the levels in 1990 with those achieved by 2011. Figure I-2 demonstrates how, as countries move to higher overall levels of attainment, the disparities tend to narrow. As countries make overall progress in these indicators, they can expect to see disparities fall. One of the most dramatic cases is Afghanistan. The country has made huge progress in providing access to safe drinking water and the relative gaps between rural and urban areas have fallen. Despite overall progress, large disparities remain. By 2011 while urban access was 85 per cent, rural access was only 53 per cent. The widest rural-urban disparity among these countries is evident in Mongolia. Despite its significant progress in urban and rural areas, by 2011 the disparity was still almost 50 percentage points \u2212 comparable to that between Asia-Pacific\u2019s best- and worst-performing countries. The trend towards narrowing disparities in sanitation is clear in Myanmar. Overall access to basic sanitation increased, thanks to the improvement in rural areas, while the level in urban areas did not improve at the same pace. As a result, between 1990 and 2011, urban- rural disparities decreased by 20 percentage points. In Fiji, for example, although there are still urban-rural disparities, access in rural areas has improved. However, urban-rural disparities are higher for access to sanitation than for drinking water. Despite the narrowing of rural- urban gaps, access to basic sanitation was lacking for 20 per cent or more of the entire population in many countries, implying that much work needs to be done to achieve universal access. Disparities are evident not just between urban and rural areas, but also between different subnational levels, between sexes, and between various ethnic, caste and vulnerable groups. For example, while in most countries national HIV prevalence is less than 1 per CHAPTER I: MDGs in Asia and the Pacific: Where we stand 13 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 Figure I-2 \u2013 Disparities in safe drinking water and basic sanitation, selected countries, 1990 and 2011 Source: United Nations MDG Database accessed on 27 July 2013.

This was crafted as an enabling driver for the achievement of the other MDGs. It aimed to establish more conducive conditions of international cooperation, generate adequate resources, create new opportunities, and help build the capacities and skills needed to deliver on the first seven MDGs. It included measures concerned with official development assistance (ODA), trade, external debt, and access to essential medicines and technology. However, the goal was hard to track and its potential for strengthening regional and global cooperation was underutilized. The first three targets of Goal 8 are: \u2022 Target 8a \u2212 Develop further an open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system. \u2022 Target 8b \u2212 Address the special needs of the least developed countries. \u2022 Target 8c \u2212 Address the special needs of landlocked developing countries", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b2fe4e5-a2db-461e-855d-aedd9d40e3d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b2fe4e5-a2db-461e-855d-aedd9d40e3d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b4bf963c80d110a799c47d771ae12f3f7acccd2e7a9ab8708f5e4d04c03b273"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd3ecad9-09a9-49e3-a812-e04824248cbf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b4a35a4df248592df1f605e4979c4d4723a3885799927d48944b23a282da1d3"}}, "hash": "11da78e20e66ee362a4422cb8fdd00fdc69854ebc97731218d5d2b7e127dfc69", "text": "and small island developing states. Although a full assessment of the contribution of Goal 8 is beyond the scope of this report, it has tried to highlight some key aspects of this important goal. The discussion in this section is therefore confined to selected targets \u2013 particularly for LDCs in the areas of trade and development assistance. In general, LDCs in the region have weak productive capacities, limited space for domestic resource mobilization and are economically vulnerable to external shocks. Since the 1970s, only two LDCs, namely Maldives and Samoa, have graduated from LDC status, and several others like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar have intentions of graduating by 2020. Trade One of the key commitments in MDG 8 is to ensure tariff- and quota-free access for the LDCs. Even before the establishment of the MDGs, the LDCs had typically enjoyed duty-free and quota-free access to developed country markets \u2212 notably through the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). However, as tariffs have come down generally, the LDC margin of preference has effectively been eroded.

For Asia-Pacific LDCs, however, the proportion was only 69 per cent. This may be because the various unilateral trade preference schemes do not cover some of the goods produced by this region. Moreover, for the region\u2019s basket of exports to the developed markets the demand elasticity may be low. It should also be noted that the developed countries maintain protection for goods that are of particular importance for the Asia-Pacific region. This is true of agricultural products, textiles and clothing. The period 2005-2009 saw the expiry of the WTO Agreement on textiles and clothing along with the quota system that had regulated trade in those products. Between 2000 and 2010, there were modest reductions in the average most-favoured-nation (MFN) tariffs applied by the developed countries to textiles and clothing, while for agricultural products MFN tariffs largely remained unchanged. Nevertheless, as indicated in Figure I-4, the Asia-Pacific developing countries and LDCs generally enjoyed lower preference tariffs for all agricultural products, textiles and clothing. But the situation varies from one group to another. For agricultural products, the average preference tariff enjoyed by Asia-Pacific countries (3 per cent) is lower than that for the developing countries as a whole (7 per cent) and much higher than the rate applied to the LDCs (1 per cent). For textiles and clothing, on the other hand, the preferential tariff enjoyed by Asia-Pacific countries (5 per cent) is similar to that applied to the LDCs (5 per cent) and the developing countries (7 per cent).4 An issue of cross-cutting concern to developing countries in general, and LDCs in particular, is the selective application of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) especially in agricultural products and in textiles and apparel. NTBs restrict market access even more than tariffs, and in recent times have increased considerably: their impact is equivalent to a 27 per cent tariff.5 Another barrier to market access is the application of often-complex rules of origin; this raises the costs of exports of some countries by 20 to 30 per cent. Asia-Pacific emerging economies, however, have made some bold moves to grant preferential access to LDC products \u2013 now covering 32 to 95 per cent of their tariff lines (Table I-4).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd3ecad9-09a9-49e3-a812-e04824248cbf": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd3ecad9-09a9-49e3-a812-e04824248cbf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b4bf963c80d110a799c47d771ae12f3f7acccd2e7a9ab8708f5e4d04c03b273"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b2fe4e5-a2db-461e-855d-aedd9d40e3d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11da78e20e66ee362a4422cb8fdd00fdc69854ebc97731218d5d2b7e127dfc69"}}, "hash": "8b4a35a4df248592df1f605e4979c4d4723a3885799927d48944b23a282da1d3", "text": "A key outcome of the 2005 WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, China was Aid for Trade (AFT).

AFT should have addressed supply limitations and productive capacity problems, but the record has been poor. Official development assistance A second major area within Goal 8 concerned official development assistance (ODA). The 2002 International Conference on Financing for Development held in Monterrey, Mexico determined that 0.7 per cent of OECD/DAC donors\u2019 gross national income should be dedicated to ODA. Levels of ODA, however, remain well below that target. In 2011, the LDCs received a total of $44.6 billion as ODA, slightly up from $43.8 billion received in 2010. Except in Afghanistan and Bangladesh, the overall growth of ODA has been less than expected. In 2010, the principal LDC recipients in the Asia-Pacific region were Afghanistan ($6.3 billion) and Bangladesh ($1.4 billion), followed by Cambodia ($818 million) and Nepal ($734 million).

Figure I-6 shows that the aid received on a per poor-person basis amounted to $21 (i.e. if all the aid went to just the poor); while this figure was $221 for Latin America and the Caribbean; and $93 for Sub-Saharan Africa. The comparison for countries with special needs (LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS) for these three regions is also shown. This reveals that although aid received per poor person by the region\u2019s LDCs and other special category states was more than double that received by poor people in the region as a whole, such aid received is much lower per poor person than in both Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa. Most of these countries are low- income countries which cannot bridge the gap in resources needed for meeting their social objectives such as the MDGs, solely on the basis of their own domestic resources. Stepping up international assistance to them will be necessary. Given the current financial and economic crises in some donor countries, overall aid is likely to fall. World Bank research on the impact of previous banking crises suggests that aid rises for a couple of years soon after the crisis, and then falls steeply, not returning to its former levels for at least 15 years.6 The latest global aid figures suggest that a repeat of this pattern could be underway.7 Moreover, the international aid architecture continues to change; emerging economies like China, India, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa and others are becoming \u2018the new North\u2019, and are involved in the international cooperation Figure I-5 \u2013 Share of developing regions in aid and total world population in poverty Source: Staff estimates using data from the World Bank PovcalNet online database and World Development Indicators accessed 3 May 2013.

At the same time, there is an increasing role for private sector investments and philanthropy as sources of development finance. The new landscape became clearer at the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, held in Busan, Republic of Korea, at the end of 2011. In Busan, donors who had endorsed the Paris and Accra agreements renewed their pledges to implement their commitments in full, while the Southern partners agreed to adhere to new commitments only on a voluntary basis. Busan thus created a two- tier approach to development cooperation: one for traditional donors with their \u2018unfinished aid agenda\u2019 and another for emerging donors to be implemented on a discretionary basis. Levels of deprivation in Asia and the Pacific compared with other developing regions For MDG attainment as a whole, compared with other developing regions, Asia and the Pacific lies somewhere in the middle. While the region is lagging behind Latin America and the Caribbean, it is generally making better progress towards the MDG targets than Sub- Saharan Africa. However, in interpreting relative performance, one needs to take into account the initial conditions. Sub-Saharan Africa started from a much lower base. So although it might appear to have made slower progress, its performance is more impressive in historical and absolute terms.8 From another perspective, the problems are greatest in Asia and the Pacific because the region has a larger population, meaning it has the greatest number of deprived people on most of the indicators. Thus, although Asia and the Pacific is classified as an early achiever in halving the poverty rate, it is still home to 743 million people living on less than $1.25 per day.9 And while it has provided better water supplies, it still has 360 million people without access to safe drinking water. In both these areas, the region has more than 45 per cent of the developing world\u2019s deprived people. Another major concern is that the region is home to 1,722 million people without access to basic sanitation, which represents more than 70 per cent of the developing world\u2019s people who are deprived of this service (Figure I-7). The comparison with other global regions is encapsulated in Figure I-8 which compares the 1990 level and current levels for six indicators. These charts carry three key pieces of information.

But this is by no means inevitable; even countries that appear off track on certain indicators could yet succeed. This is clear in the case of halving the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 per day. Three out of the four off-track countries could reach the target by 2015 by accelerating progress by less than 2 percentage points per year; and there are similar opportunities on other indicators. If they were to succeed, the payoffs would be considerable. If Asia and the Pacific could halve the proportion of people without improved sanitation then 340 million people would gain access. The possible gains for selected indicators are summarized in Table I-7. Did the MDGs make a difference? Over the past few years, various methodologies have been applied for monitoring MDGs and development outcomes.10 One approach is to consider the extent of acceleration. Earlier sections of this report have compared absolute levels of attainment, but this does not fully take into account the initial conditions of countries or their development needs. Moreover, a country may appear to have made slow progress against the target but may actually have accelerated. This possibility can be examined by adapting a technique used by Fukuda-Parr and Greenstein based on how UNICEF evaluates the global trend in child mortality and underweight prevalence among children under five \u2212 the \u2018annual average rate of reduction\u2019 (AARR).11 The AARR quantifies the rate of change of an indicator between two given years. When estimates are available for multiple years, this method allows the calculation of the AARR using a regression analysis.12 Unlike the comparison of absolute changes, the AARR reflects the fact that the closer a country approaches the targets it gets progressively more difficult to move forward. For example, when a country has already achieved quite low levels of under-five mortality, any further absolute reduction obviously represents a greater percentage reduction. The results of an analysis comparing the periods before and after the introduction of the MDGs (around 2000) is summarized in Table I-8. It is clear that most countries have accelerated their rates of progress in reducing the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 per day; a result consistent with the outcomes presented earlier in this chapter.

CHAPTER I: MDGs in Asia and the Pacific: Where we stand 21 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 On the other hand, some surprising results are observed in the cases of infant, child and maternal mortality. Overall progress has been slow, and the 2015 targets are going to be missed. Nevertheless, for infant mortality, out of 48 countries with data available, 25 have accelerated their rates of progress and a further 16 countries have maintained them. The picture is similar for under-five mortality: 20 out of 48 countries have accelerated their rates of progress and 22 have managed to maintain them. In the case of maternal mortality, 24 countries out of 41 have accelerated and four have maintained their rates of progress. In many cases, more than half of the countries have been able to maintain or accelerate their rates of progress. For access to safe drinking water, the story is different. Although the region as a whole has been classified as an early achiever, 25 out of 51 countries have slowed down. Only 21 countries have been able to accelerate, and five to maintain, their rates of progress. The MDGs were meant to stimulate progress across a wide range of goals. Whether they actually did is impossible to prove since there is no counterfactual. Nevertheless, it is worth looking more closely at the issue, even if this does not produce definitive results. The demand for data The need to monitor MDG progress has increased the demand for timely, comparable and reliable data. The MDG framework has a total of 60 indicators, out of which 20 have been used for assessing the availability of data in two different datasets, 2010 and 2013. The analyses of progress towards various targets, as presented in this report require at least two data points three years apart. This requirement is minimal as it does not specify the starting or the ending year of the data points, or the timeliness of the data. Table I-9 summarizes the number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region with sufficient data in the global MDGs dataset and thereby meeting this minimum requirement by indicator. As can be seen, between 2010 and 2013, the number of countries meeting this data requirement increased on most indicators. One major improvement was in maternal health, where after 2011 comparable data became available to assess trends on maternal mortality for 41 countries. Nevertheless, there are still many data gaps. For example, 27 countries still have insufficient data on HIV prevalence. The situation is similar, though slightly better, for other indicators: underweight children and antenatal care. In addition to data availability another major issue is timeliness. The progress assessment presented in this report was based on the most recent version of the United Nations MDG Indicators database, which as of 2013 had major updates on all of the indicators examined in this report. For instance, the median year for the latest data point on indicators on safe drinking water and basic sanitation was 2011, while it was 2008 in the 2010 dataset. There were also updates in the estimates for extreme income poverty. On the other hand, for the indicators on underweight children and skilled birth attendance, the median year of the latest data point is 2009. Improving the timeliness of data so as to reflect the most recent progress on the various targets remains a challenge. In addition, the quality of the progress assessment will depend on the number of observations; the more the Table I-7\u2013 Gains in human well-being if targets were reached Notes: * Cumulative number of deaths from 2012 to 2015; ** cumulative number of deaths from 2011 to 2015.

CHAPTER I: MDGs in Asia and the Pacific: Where we stand 23 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 better. For the period 1990-2012, for indicators such as underweight children, skilled birth attendance and antenatal care, the median number of data points is only four or five, meaning that half of the countries have a maximum of four or five data points or fewer, which may not fully reflect the trajectory of the progress. The United Nations MDG Indicator dataset relies on household or other ad hoc surveys for many of the indicators. A shortcoming of household surveys is that they tend to be infrequent and are limited in producing disaggregated data for small population subgroups. One alternative is to strengthen administrative data sources so that data can be delivered on a continuous basis and for all population subgroups. One such data source is a civil registration system (Box I-2), which in principle should be able to provide inputs for 42 MDG indicators.13 Data discrepancies have been a persistent concern. There are often discrepancies between national and international data. This report uses the United Nations MDG Indicators database which is coordinated and maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division. This database, which is the product of the Inter- Agency and Expert Group on MDG Indicators, draws from official national statistics. Ministries and national statistical offices provide these data to the respective international agencies which may then adjust them to ensure comparability across countries \u2013 and thus create discrepancies between national and international datasets. A further issue is that countries sometimes have recent data that have not yet been added to the global database. In addition, if the national statistical system does not generate the relevant data, the responsible international agency may fill the gap by using data collected through surveys sponsored or carried out by international agencies. These adjustments, time lags and the use of other data sources create discrepancies between national and international datasets. This could affect the assessment of a country\u2019s progress \u2013 for a given MDG indicator, it could be on track based on the national dataset, for example, but off track based on the global dataset. As international agencies continuously extend their sources of data and refine their methods, data can also be different in the United Nations MDG Indicators database. In some cases they also revise the data for earlier years as better information becomes available. This results in better-quality data, but it has the Table I-9 \u2212 Number of countries, out of 55, meeting minimum data requirements, by indicator Sources: Staff calculations based on data from the global MDG dataset; 2010 dataset: downloaded on 30 September 2010; 2013 dataset: downloaded on 27 July 2013. $1.25 per day poverty Underweight children Primary enrolment Reaching last grade Primary completion Gender primary Gender secondary Gender tertiary Under-5 mortality Infant mortality Maternal mortality Skilled birth attendance Antenatal care (\u2265 1 visit) HIV prevalence TB incidence TB prevalence Forest cover Protected area Safe drinking water Basic sanitation Number 25 28 32 26 40 45 41 29 47 47 0 43 28 30 55 55 51 52 48 48 Number 25 30 38 38 44 47 45 42 48 48 41 46 36 28 55 55 53 52 52 52 Year 2005 2005 2008 2007 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 2000 2006 2006 2007 2008 2008 2005 2009 2008 2008 Year 2009 2009 2011 2010 2011 2011 2011 2011 2011 2011 2010 2009 2009 2011 2011 2011 2010 2012 2011 2011 % 46 51 58 47 73 82 75 53 86 86 0 78 51 55 100 100 93 95 87 87 % 45 55 69 69 80 85 82 76 87 87 75 84 65 51 100 100 96 95 95 95 Observations Observations No. of countries (out of a total", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "975673b5-d3ce-4a85-b48b-fc55e24a0ad8": {"__data__": {"id_": "975673b5-d3ce-4a85-b48b-fc55e24a0ad8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2012/2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2202cfd49efea79a65d3a97be874cb6291f17c996533332ff1ece73f9f61dcfd"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ce9ef38-f415-4a51-8c81-8f847e8967ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2012/2013", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dcae527982166224bbb4c96b784c1fc5c42100aeef62dfa1a2dc95a5272146ca"}}, "hash": "3a9d85b32b3415b70b2829eb25c78bc6647c8ba9c9f1fc36ce2ceb48ead3fe3a", "text": "of 55) meeting minimum data requirements, by indicator Median 2010 dataset 2010 dataset 2013 dataset 2013 dataset 4 4 7 6 8 10 9 10 5 5 0 3 3 2 19 19 3 20 5 5 6 5 10 8 12 16 13 13 22 22 5 5 4 22 22 22 4 4 22 22 CHAPTER I: MDGs in Asia and the Pacific: Where we stand 24 Asia-Pacific Regional MDGs Report 2012/2013 disadvantage that the results in this 2012/13 Asia- Pacific MDGs Report are not comparable to those in previous editions. Strengthened national statistical capacity is the ultimate solution to all of the above challenges. Therefore the ESCAP/ADB/UNDP partnership places great importance on boosting national statistical capacity to produce, analyse and disseminate statistics. Particularly important are issues such as: civil registration and vital statistics; disaggregated data; and the effective use of statistics for policy analysis and advocacy. Approaching the finish The data in this chapter have highlighted Asia-Pacific efforts to meet the MDGs. Now, just two years away from the finishing line the likely outcome is becoming clearer: a mixed picture of achievement and shortfalls. The next chapter examines some of the underlying reasons for these results and highlights the key areas that will need to be addressed by any MDG successor framework. Box I-2 \u2013 Civil registration systems Civil registration as a development imperative Civil registration, according to the United Nations, \u201cis defined as the continuous, permanent, compulsory and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events pertaining to the population as provided through decree or regulation in accordance with the legal requirements of a country\u201d. Every individual benefits from the legal documentation, identity and civil status that registration accords. Civil registration is the enabler for every individual to have a legal status in society, participate in public life, formal employment and gain access to services, such as health, education, social welfare and social protection. It underpins efforts to reduce child marriage, child labour, family separation, human trafficking and violence against women and children. Civil
