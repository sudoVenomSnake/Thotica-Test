ractions that occur in the context of traditional business cycles wherein finance takes a more passive and accommoda- tive role. 43 See Rajan and Shen (2006), which also discusses other possible explanations and reviews studies on the income effect of crisis-induced devaluations in Latin America and Asia. 44 See, however, Tovar (2006), which contends in an econometric analysis for Korea that devaluations are expansionary despite the balance sheet effect. 15 4.1 Policy trade offs and exchange rate regimes According to conventional economic theory, it is not pos- sible to pursue simultaneously an independent monetary policy, control the exchange rate, and maintain an open capital account. All three are potentially feasible, but only two of them could be chosen as actual policy \u2013 thus, the dilemma known as impossible trinity or trilemma. Once the capital account is opened, a choice has to be made between controlling the exchange rate and preserving an independent monetary policy. Using monetary policy as a countercyclical tool to stabilize economic activity could result in large cyclical swings in the exchange rate and the balance-of-payments. Conversely, if monetary policy is used to stabilize the exchange rate, it cannot act as a countercyclical macroeconomic tool and prevent large cyclical swings in economic activity.

This trilemma, however, is not absolute. In principle it is possible to choose among a variety of intermediate exchange rate regimes and secure a reasonable degree of currency stability by judiciously combining different degrees of monetary policy independence, financial integration, and currency-market interventions.45 Even under floating rates it may be possible for a central bank without an explicit exchange rate target to retain a relatively high degree of monetary policy autonomy and, at the same time, try to influence the exchange rate by 4. Managing capital flows and exchange rates currency-market interventions in order to curb excessive volatility. Intermediate regimes between corner or bipolar solutions include soft pegs, defined as \u201cexchange rates that are currently fixed in value (or a narrow range of values) to some other currency or basket of currencies, with some commitment by the authorities to defend the peg, but with the value likely to change if the exchange rate comes under significant pressure\u201d (Fischer 2001: 3). They also include crawling pegs, where the peg is shifted over time; fixed exchange rate bands, where the currency is allowed to float within a specified range; or crawling bands, where the band itself is allowed to move over time.46 Among examples of intermediate regimes are the Bretton Woods system of adjustable pegs, the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System (EMS), the fixed nominal pegs used in exchange-rate based stabilization programmes in Latin America to pin down inflation expectations, and the regime known as BBC \u2212 a basket parity, a band, and a crawl of the exchange rate \u2212 successfully implemented by Singapore and adopted in different versions by some other countries, including, since 2005, China and Malaysia.47 The BBC regime combines flexibility with stability; it allows the currency to fluctuate within a relatively narrow range and for the central parity to be shifted in response to changes in the underlying fundamentals and to large and durable shocks. These intermediate regimes call for the use of monetary policy, currency-market interventions, and rules over capital flows in appropriate combinations. Otherwise, instability and crises can be unavoidable. For instance, the Bretton Woods system of adjustable pegs operated under widespread controls over international capital movements but broke down with increased mo- bility of capital, which resulted from and exposed the in- consistencies between the pattern of exchange rates and domestic policy stances. Similarly, adjustable pegs in the ERM worked successfully under conditions of free capital movements as long as macroeconomic fundamentals were consistent with exchange rate targets, but broke 45 For an attempt to quantify these configurations and to link them to exchange rate stability, see Aizenman, Chinn, and Ito (2008), which measures the degree of monetary independence by correlation between home and international interest rates, and uses an index of financial openness and the ratio of reserves to GDP, and links them to exchange rate stability measured as annual standard deviations of monthly exchange rates. 46 On various regimes, see Edwards and Savastano (1999) and Williamson (2000). 47 In Singapore monetary policy is focussed on the management of the exchange rate, rather than money supply or interest rates, which is seen as the most effective tool in maintaining price stability and competitiveness in a small and highly open economy. The system also relies on a large positive net foreign asset position and tightly regulated financial system; see Parrado (2004) and Burton (2005). 16 down during 1992-1993 when high-inflation countries such as Italy and the United Kingdom failed to make the necessary currency and/or policy adjustments (Aky\u00fcz and Flassbeck 2002). Again, the combination of soft pegs, free capital flows, and high inflation and interest rates proved to be damaging in countries pursuing exchange- rate based stabilization programmes, creating not only currency gyrations but also costly financial crises. After recurrent crises in emerging markets with soft pegs in the 1990s, developing countries were advised to go for corner solutions. However, with the collapse of the Argentine currency board (convertibility), hard pegs fell from favour. The orthodox policy advice has increasingly emphasized assigning monetary policy to the task of infla- tion control (inflation targeting) and leaving the currency to float under a reasonably open capital account. The problems with corner solutions are well es- tablished.48 It is now widely recognized that hard pegs are not a viable option for a large majority", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1d8308e-aa05-4b0d-9772-7eaf7adcfa03": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1d8308e-aa05-4b0d-9772-7eaf7adcfa03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f913f3a319376cdf88f0ec282e4eea03bc6455740438d51713cfa196979334fe"}, "3": {"node_id": "f6394108-9e45-486e-89bc-c9630f4368ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b49c971adc63261b99b2a1597b644b78a25b25cbc6ea7f3d842f8c0b9301e307"}}, "hash": "e08fa3a5b11c5f1f03825990f3575894097d0acd0a1449618523f2351fc9be41", "text": "of develop- ing countries. Free floating, on the other hand, does not prevent boom-bust cycles in capital flows, unsustainable current account positions, and currency gyrations since exchange rate uncertainty cannot always curb herd behaviour in financial markets. Experience shows that crises are as likely to occur under floating rates as under soft pegs. The latest example is Iceland \u2212 an economy practicing inflation targeting and independent floating. It saw its currency strengthen during the surge in capital inflows after 2002; and its current account deficit grow to reach 18 percent of GDP in 2008, when its currency and economy collapsed with the global turmoil triggered by the sub-prime crisis (table 4). Most emerging-market economies with indepen- dent floating currency regimes have been affected more severely by the current global instability than those with intermediate regimes of managed floating. In indepen- dent floaters, exchange rates appreciated sharply during the surge in capital inflows, and many of these countries ran large and growing current account deficits despite a favourable global trading environment (table 4). With the deepening of the sub-prime crisis and reversal of capital flows after mid-2008, currencies in all these countries fell sharply from their peaks. In countries with managed floating, appreciations during the earlier boom were moderate and most of these countries succeeded in generating sizeable current account surpluses in the preceding expansion. Even though they too have been hit by the global crisis, declines in their currencies have been moderate compared to independent floaters. There is ample evidence against the bipolar view that with increased financial integration countries will move to the polar extremes of free float or hard pegs. It is true that with financial development and openness countries tend to move away from rigid exchange rate regimes, but instead of adopting free floating they seem to prefer intermediate regimes. A large majority of devel- oping countries were using intermediate regimes until the second half of the 1990s. Moreover, many countries that claimed to have allowed their exchange rates to float were actually managing them by using interest rates and currency-market interventions because of \u201cfear of floating\u201d (Calvo and Rheinhart 2002). Following recurrent emerging market crises in the 1990s, there was a shift towards independent floating. After recovery, however, many countries shifted back towards intermediate re- gimes: \u201cThe persistent popularity of intermediate regimes \u2026 suggests that such regimes may provide important advantages. Indeed, the absence of a general bipolar tendency may be indicative of the possibility that inter- mediate regimes are able to capture some of the benefits of both extremes while avoiding many of the costs.\u201d 49 4.2 Capital flows, monetary policy, and the exchange rate A key question for countries adopting intermediate re- gimes is, therefore, how best to combine monetary policy action, currency-market interventions, and regulation of capital flows in order to sustain stable and competitive exchange rates without giving up the objectives of price stability, full employment, and rapid growth. This is not an easy task, since for developing countries global finan- cial integration brings much greater erosion of monetary independence than is typically portrayed in economic theory. Monetary policy cannot always secure financial and macroeconomic stability whether it is geared towards a stable exchange rate or conducted independently as a countercyclical tool to pursue domestic objectives. Because of exchange rate pass-through and ex- tensive liability dollarization, there are strong spillovers from exchange rates to domestic economic and financial conditions. Thus, using monetary policy as a domestic countercyclical tool, with the benign neglect of external conditions, does not guarantee price and financial sta- bility when there are large swings in capital flows and exchange rates. On the other hand, the effect of mon- etary policy on exchange rates is much more uncertain 48 For a discussion, see Williamson (2000) and Aky\u00fcz and Flassbeck (2002) and the references therein. 49 Rogoff et al (2004: 14). For the evolution of exchange rate regimes in emerging markets, see also Edwards and Savastano (1999), Fischer (2001), and Stone, Anderson, and Veyrune (2008). On the basis of quantitative measures of degrees of exchange rate flexibility, monetary independence, and capital account openness noted above, it has been shown that, since the beginning of this decade, emerging markets have moved towards managed exchange rate flexibility, using international reserves as a buffer and retaining some degree of monetary independence; see Aizenman, Chinn, and Ito (2008).

Even when authorities are prepared to use greater discretion in monetary policy, they may face serious trade-offs because domestic conditions may call for one sort of intervention and external conditions another. This is most clearly seen at times of rapid exit of capital when liquidity expansion and cuts in interest rates needed to prevent financial meltdown and stimulate economic activity could simply accelerate flight from the currency. As a result, monetary authorities are often compelled to pursue a procyclical policy in an effort to restore confidence. However, this is rarely effective since, under crisis conditions, the link assumed in the conventional theory between the interest rate and the exchange rate also breaks down. When market sentiment turns sour, higher interest rates aiming to retain capital tend to be perceived as increased risk of default. As a result, the risk-adjusted rate of return could actually fall as interest rates are raised. This is the main reason why procyclical interest rate hikes implemented as part of IMF support during several episodes of financial crises were unable to prevent the collapse of the currency, instead serving to deepen economic contraction. Under such conditions, unilateral temporary debt standstills and exchange re- strictions present themselves as the only viable options to prevent financial meltdown and a deep recession. Monetary policy also faces hurdles at times of economic expansion associated with surges in capital inflows, asset bubbles, and currency appreciations. Tight- ening to check overheating could encourage external borrowing and short-term arbitrage flows. Lower interest rates could discourage such flows, but they fuel domestic credit expansion and overheating. Countercyclical fiscal policy can no doubt help manage expansions. When the economy is overheating due to a boom in private spending supported by capital inflows, fiscal tightening would obviate the need for tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates and, hence, prevent further arbitrage inflows and apprecia- tions. If budget revenues and expenditure structures are appropriately designed, this task could partly be done by automatic stabilizers. However, most developing countries lack either the policy space or the political will needed for the kind of fiscal tightening necessary to check strong economic expansions supported by a surge in capital flows. In reality, governments in many emerg- ing markets tend to run procyclical fiscal policy, notably those with chronic fiscal deficits and large public debt (Aky\u00fcz 2006). 4.3 Currency-market interventions and reserves Interventions and sterilization A policy of resisting appreciations and accumulating reserves through interventions in currency markets at times of strong capital inflows and economic expansion and using such reserves to prevent sharp depreciations during sudden stops and reversals appears to be a sen- sible counter-cyclical response to instability in interna- tional capital flows. However, this is not always neutral in its consequences for monetary policy. If interventions are not fully sterilized, they would result in credit expansion, thereby generating inflationary pressures in asset and/or product markets. If they are sterilized by issuing govern- ment debt, they could lead to higher interest rates, which could, in turn, attract more arbitrage capital. Whether or not interventions in emerging markets are successful in stabilizing exchange rates and prevent- ing credit expansion and inflation is highly contentious. Examining several episodes of surges in capital inflows since the early 1990s, the IMF World Economic Outlook (October 2007: 122-24) concludes that sterilized inter- vention is likely to be ineffective and inflationary when the influx of capital is persistent: \u201ca policy of resistance to exchange rate pressures does not seem to be associated with lower real appreciation while countercyclical fiscal policies have had the desired effect\u201d and \u201cthe policy of sterilized intervention\u2026often tends to be associated with higher inflation.\u201d By contrast, work done in the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) suggests that steril- ized intervention has generally been more successful in emerging markets than in advanced countries, par- ticularly where the banking sector is closely scrutinized.50 Evidence from Asian emerging markets discussed below suggests that currency market interventions have been quite effective in checking appreciations in the recent surge in capital flows, but they have been only partially successful in sterilization. The impact of sterilization on interest rates and arbitrage capital depends on the size and composition of capital flows. When capital inflows are moderate in size and concentrated in the market for fixed-income assets, sterilization by issuing government debt would not raise the interest rate. However, when they are broad-based and concentrated in direct and portfolio equity, as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a22159d-1f96-4de2-b24c-a67a5c4f2e37": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a22159d-1f96-4de2-b24c-a67a5c4f2e37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "527ce8c544006fcc68ff2134357f007e48e33b82819c82854bc5a4175537bd2a"}}, "hash": "527ce8c544006fcc68ff2134357f007e48e33b82819c82854bc5a4175537bd2a", "text": "in 50 See various studies in BIS (2005), notably Disyatat and Galati (2005) and Mihaljek (2005). See also Mohanty and Turner (2006). 18 most emerging markets in recent years, sterilizing them by issuing government debt can raise the interest rate and attract arbitrage flows, particularly when inflows are large compared to the size of the debt market.51 Sterilization by issuing government (or central bank) debt is also costly because interest earned on re- serves is usually much lower than interest paid on such debt. This fiscal \u2212 or quasi-fiscal \u2212 cost of reserves has two components: a part due to the difference between external borrowing rate and the rate earned on reserves, which constitutes a net transfer of resources abroad, and another due to the difference between the interest rate on government debt and the external borrowing rate, which is an internal transfer to the private sector.52 Sterilization by raising non-interest-bearing reserve requirements of banks could address some of these problems; it could help reduce the fiscal cost of intervention and check credit expansion. However, by increasing the cost of credit, it could also encourage firms to go to foreign creditors. Banks may also shift business to offshore centers and lend through their affiliates abroad, particularly where foreign presence in the banking sec- tor is important. A relatively tight supervision over the banking system would be needed to impose high reserve requirements and prevent regulatory arbitrage. Reserve accumulation as self insurance Traditionally, reserves covering three months of imports were considered adequate for addressing the liquidity problems arising from time lags between payments for imports and receipts from exports. The need for reserves was also expected to lessen as countries gained access to international financial markets and became more willing to respond to balance of payments shocks by adjust- ments in exchange rates. However, capital account liber- alization in developing countries and their greater access to private finance has produced exactly the opposite result. Private capital flows have allowed running larger and more persistent current account deficits beyond the levels that could be attained by relying on international reserves or borrowing from the IMF. But this has also resulted in an accumulation of large stocks of external liabilities. Consequently, debtor countries have become increasingly vulnerable to sudden stops and reversals in capital flows, and this has increased the need to ac- cumulate reserves to safeguard against currency turmoil and speculative attacks. Indeed, evidence shows a strong correlation between capital account liberalization and re- serve holding, and a growing tendency to absorb capital inflows into reserves rather than using them for current payments (Aizenman and Lee 2005; Choi, Sharma, and Str\u00f6mqvist 2007). Vulnerability to a sudden stop and reversal of capital flows is often assessed on the basis of short- term external liabilities in relation to reserves. Foreign investment in equity and local-currency debt is not considered a serious potential threat to stability because the exchange rate risk is assumed by investors. Indeed, according to the so-called Greenspan-Guidotti rule for- mulated after the Asian crisis, in order to avoid a liquidity crisis, international reserves in emerging markets should meet short-term external foreign-currency denominated liabilities, defined as debt with a remaining maturity of up to one year.53 A problem with such rules is that vulnerability is not restricted to short-term foreign currency debt; what matters in this respect is liquidity of liabilities, including those denominated in domestic currencies. A move by non-residents from domestic equity and bond markets could create significant turbulence in currency and asset markets with broader macroeconomic consequences, even though losses from asset price declines and currency collapses fall on foreign investors. This potential source of instability naturally depends on the relative importance of foreign participation in local financial markets. The degree of vulnerability in this sense can be measured in terms of stock of foreign portfolio investment as a per- centage of reserves. Cost of reserve holding Even when the fiscal cost of interventions is reduced by control over interest rates or higher reserve requirements, there could be a large transfer of resources abroad since the return earned on international reserves is less than the cost of foreign capital, including the cost of foreign borrowing and the foregone return on assets sold. In fact, it is more so for equity flows for the acquisition of ownership rights of existing assets, since rates earned by transnational companies exceed the cost of international borrowing by a very large margin (UNCTAD TDR 1999: chap.

V); for an attempt to empirically determine the optimum level of reserves, see Jeanne and Ranci\u00e8re (2006). 19 Reserve accumulation in developing countries accelerated after the Asian crisis, particularly with the strong recovery of capital inflows in the early years of the 2000s. It has gained further momentum as developing countries taken together started to run twin surpluses in their balance of payments, that is, on both current and capital accounts.54 Since 2001 reserves have increased at an average rate of $600 billion per year, exceeding $5.5 trillion, or 7 months of imports, at the end of 2008.55 Of the $4.6 trillion additional reserves accumulated by developing countries after 2001, less than two-thirds was earned from current account surpluses. The rest was accumulated from capital inflows; that is, they are \u201cborrowed\u201d in the sense that they accompany increased claims by non-residents in one form or another, includ- ing direct and portfolio equity investment, which entail outward income transfers. Other than China and Fuel Exporters, reserves in developing countries are entirely borrowed since, taken together, their current account has been in deficit. Since in previous decades the current account of developing countries was in deficit, the entire stock of re- serves held at the beginning of this decade was borrowed reserves. This means that almost half of the current stock of reserves in developing countries \u2212 that is, some $2.6 trillion \u2212 are borrowed reserves. This is more than twice their short-term debt and over 65 percent of their total debt to private creditors. Assuming a moderate 500 basis points margin between the borrowing rate and return on reserves, the annual carry cost of these reserves would reach some $130 billion.56 This constitutes a net transfer of resources to major reserve-currency countries and ex- ceeds total official development assistance to developing countries.57 4.4 Regulation and control of capital flows While interventions in currency markets and reserve accumulation can prevent unsustainable currency ap- preciations and current account positions and provide self-insurance against sudden stops and reversals, it is not necessarily the best way to deal with volatile capital flows. In fact, this strategy lacks a strong rationale since it implies that a country should borrow only if the funds thus acquired are not used to finance investment and im- ports, but held in short-term, low-yielding foreign assets, resulting in large fiscal and social costs. Furthermore, currency market interventions are not neutral in their impact on domestic monetary condi- tions. Failure to sterilize them fully would lead to domestic credit expansion, fuelling inflation in asset and/or prod- uct markets while debt financed sterilization can attract further destabilizing capital flows. Finally, such a strategy does not prevent currency and maturity mismatches in private balance sheets, or increased presence of foreign- ers in domestic financial markets, which often increases vulnerability to external shocks and contagion. Thus, regulation and control over capital flows would often be necessary to address the problems caused by volatile capital flows and the costs and difficulties encountered in dealing with them through monetary policy actions and/ or currency market interventions. There are several ways of influencing unstable capital flows, including market-based and administra- tive measures, widely used in industrial countries before the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s and in many European countries until the late 1980s.58 Since a large proportion of cross-border and cross-currency operations are intermediated by domestic financial institutions, notably banks, prudential rules such as capital and liquidity requirements and provisions for non-performing portfolios no doubt have implications for international capital flows.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "663d00f6-0edd-4827-99f2-028cd7287c39": {"__data__": {"id_": "663d00f6-0edd-4827-99f2-028cd7287c39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "077688b76e6e1ae286d34747b5a75c3a6b6e5d61e5fcee7a9dbaea00e6ddc76e"}, "2": {"node_id": "871bf649-c185-4945-974b-bf821d1554c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ec9356ba4ed4fd51585751c4f9cbb569216b0404f4402db459eb65f00b015ba"}}, "hash": "36f9e86f41a03967bfc3ec28a4b3661f9c75c912397a6d09649e6b458ec6be11", "text": "Similarly, market-based (indirect) measures of control over capital flows, such as unremunerated reserve requirements used in Chile and elsewhere, can be considered as part of prudential regu- lations insofar as they contribute to the solvency of these institutions.

The risks associated with capital flows through the banking system could be addressed by applying more stringent rules for capital charges, loan-loss provisions, and liquidity and reserve requirements for transactions involving foreign currencies. In this respect, banking regulations need to address three fundamental sources of fragility: maturity mismatches, currency mismatches, and exchange\u2013rate related credit risks. Maturity transformation is a traditional function of the banking system, but this should not be encouraged in the intermediation between international financial 54 Here capital account refers to non-reserve financial account as defined in IMF (2007). 55 These figures, derived from the IMF World Economic Outlook Database, exclude the NIEs. 56 The spread exceeded 700 basis points during the 1990s and never fell below 400 basis points. In the early years of this decade it fell towards 200 basis points but climbed up sharply after the sub-prime crisis, exceeding 400 basis points. As noted, foregone return on assets sold is generally much higher. 57 The method used here to estimate reserve costs differs from that in the literature (e.g. Rodrik 2006) in that a distinction is made here between borrowed and earned reserves. Polak and Clark (2006) also refer to borrowed reserves in their estimation of the cost to poorest developing countries. 58 For various measures of control used during the 1960s and 1970s, see Swoboda (1976); for international regimes applied to cross-border capital, see Aky\u00fcz and Cornford (2002); for the experience in developing countries, see Epstein, Grabel and Jomo (2003); for more recently introduced capital account measures, see IMF WEO (October 2007) and IMF GFS (October 2007). 20 markets and domestic borrowers, particularly since na- tional monetary authorities cannot act as lenders of last resort in foreign currency. Banks tend to rely on central banks for the provision of international liquidity, trying to shift the cost of carrying large stock of reserves onto them. This exposes them to exchange rate and interest rate risks since, in the event of a sudden stop in capital inflows and inadequate central bank reserves, they may not have access to international liquidity or can do so only at very high costs. To reduce the liquidity risk, restrictions can be applied to maturity mismatches between foreign exchange assets and liabilities of banks with a view to preventing borrowing short in international markets and lending long at home, through stricter liquidity and reserve requirements and even direct limits. Similarly, it is important to restrict currency mismatches between bank assets and liabilities and to discourage banks from assuming the exchange rate risk. Banks with short foreign exchange positions (that is, where forex liabilities exceed assets) run the risk of losses from depreciations while those with long positions lose from appreciations. Furthermore, maturity mismatches between forex assets and liabilities imply exposure to exchange rate risks even when assets are matched by liabilities in the aggregate. Currency mismatches can be restricted through quantitative limits on short and long positions (e.g., as a proportion of equity or total portfolios) or high capital charges on foreign exchange exposures. In most cases it may be more appropriate to prohibit currency mismatches altogether. The third important risk associated with foreign ex- change borrowing and lending by banks is the exchange- rate related credit risk. Banks can eliminate currency and maturity mismatches by lending in foreign currency, but unless their borrowers have foreign exchange earning ca- pacity, this simply implies migration of the exchange rate risk which, in turn, results in greater credit risk. This kind of lending is particularly common in economies where an important part of bank deposits are in foreign currencies. It also proved problematic in some countries in East Asia in the run up to the 1997 crisis, where banks lent heavily in foreign currency for investment in property as well as to firms with little foreign exchange earning capacity. Such practices could be discouraged by applying higher risk weights and capital charges for foreign assets and more stringent standards of provision for foreign currency loans, or by prohibiting altogether. However, evidence suggests that only a few emerging markets have ad- dressed the vulnerabilities arising from currency-induced credits risks even though many of them appear to have taken measures to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risks (Cayazzo et al 2006). External financial fragility can no doubt be con- tained if prudential regulations could be appropriately extended to address specific risks associated with capital flows. Contrary to a widely held view, however, this does not imply that capital account liberalization should not be a cause for concern if it is accompanied by more com- prehensive prudential", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ad821be-5fa9-4809-ac24-552d57a0cf7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ad821be-5fa9-4809-ac24-552d57a0cf7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de403ee54a389e0c8702cae3a3771b6fd9d76eaf93ef375325019889adcb3178"}}, "hash": "de403ee54a389e0c8702cae3a3771b6fd9d76eaf93ef375325019889adcb3178", "text": "regulations and supervision. First of all, conventional risk assessment methods and pruden- tial rules tend to aggravate the cyclicality of the financial system. They need to be designed in a counter-cyclical fashion, tightened particularly at times of strong surges in capital inflows.59 Second, regulatory safeguards are pretty ineffectual in the face of macroeconomic shocks that can drastically alter the quality of bank assets, and this is more so when the capital account is open. Finally, capital flows are not always intermediated by the domestic financial system. Indeed, the proportion of bank-related capital flows has been falling rapidly in recent years, with port- folio and direct equity flows now accounting for a large proportion of total inflows.60 Therefore, direct restrictions over foreign borrowing and investment as well as market access may have to play a key role in managing the risks associated with capital flows. When capital inflows are excessive, liberalization of resident outflows is sometimes seen as an option to relieve the upward pressure on the currency. This is, in fact, an alternative to sterilized intervention and it avoids the cost of carrying large stocks of international reserves. But, like interventions, it effectively does nothing to prevent currency and maturity mismatches in private bal- ance sheets, or instability and vulnerability to shocks as- sociated with greater presence of foreigners in domestic asset markets. It may encourage inflows, particularly the return of flight capital of residents (Reinhart and Reinhart 1998). In countries with weak property rights, it could also facilitate asset stripping and money laundering (Yu 2009). Its rationale as a longer-term strategy for closer integra- tion of developing countries into global financial markets is highly contentious. As a countercyclical measure, it can be even more problematic: once introduced for cyclical reasons, it may not be easily rolled back when conditions change. Thus, unlike official reserves, these do not provide self-insurance against payments and currency instability and may even aggravate them when market sentiments change. 59 Countercyclical design of prudential regulations is finding growing support after several boom-bust cycles in industrial countries, including the sub- prime expansion and crisis in the United States. For such measures, see BIS (2001); Borio, Furfine, and Lowe (2001), and White (2006). 60 According to the Institute of International Finance (IIF, January 2009), net flows from commercial banks never reached 50 percent of total private flows during the past several years. Since the IIF gives equity flows on a net-net basis (that is, net outflows of equity by residents are deducted from net inflows by non-residents) and debt flows on gross basis, the share of net inflows from banks in total net inflows from non-residents is even lower. 21 Capital account and exchange rate policies in many Asian countries in recent years have been shaped by a determination never to allow a repeat of the 1997 crisis. A key lesson drawn from that experience is that if capital inflows are allowed to create large currency and maturity mismatches in private sector balance sheets and unsustainable bubbles in asset markets under conditions of weak payments and reserve positions, there is not much that governments can do at times of a sudden stop and reversal of these flows. There is, thus, an increased awareness that vulnerability to financial contagion and shocks depends in large part on how capital inflows are managed. After a brief interruption, capital flows to emerg- ing markets recovered strongly in the earlier years of this decade, and Asia has been among the main recipients. These flows were greatly influenced by the very same factors that led to a surge in speculative lending in the United States and elsewhere in the developed world \u2212 notably, ample global liquidity resulting from a policy of easy money and search for yield. Rather than applying tighter countercyclical restrictions over capital inflows, most Asian countries chose to relax restrictions over resident outflows and to absorb excess supply of foreign exchange in reserves while building strong payments positions by maintaining competitive exchange rates. In this way they have successfully avoided unsustainable currency appreciations and payments positions, and ac- cumulated more than adequate international reserves to counter any potential current and capital account shocks without recourse to the IMF. However, they have not always been able to prevent capital inflows from generat- ing asset, credit, and investment bubbles and reduce the vulnerability of domestic financial markets to adverse shocks and contagion from financial instability abroad. These policies are now exposing them to certain risks due to spillovers from the global financial turbulence, but not always of the kind that hit the region in the 1990s. 5.1 The surge in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa14063e-a272-49d4-83a6-a8a75db1f8a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa14063e-a272-49d4-83a6-a8a75db1f8a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3dce7c505b985430ff05422f079b4c98dcc5f1ffc9e4efe6861b33e4568cc146"}, "3": {"node_id": "d908da7e-5160-4117-b10c-dd46149070a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85e6a78a8e2cf0e2b2face7b32920234470f091fa8018712119fc63d40d774f2"}}, "hash": "61f7b08c29f2daf151593faf9933eb7bdcad945edb4bd71ff634bead3f576361", "text": "capital inflows After falling to some $100 billion at the beginning of the millennium, private flows to emerging markets picked up rapidly, reaching an estimated level of $929 billion in 5. Recent experience in Asia 2007 before falling drastically to an estimated $465 billion in 2008 (table 5).61 Recovery in capital flows to Asia was also strong, exceeding $300 billion at their peak in 2007. In gross terms capital inflows to Asia as a proportion of GDP have been close to historical highs, but in net terms they have been around the long-term average because of increased resident outflows (IMF REOAP April 2007; IIF October 2007). During 2003-2007, about 60 percent of private capital inflows to Asia were in equity investment, of which two thirds were in direct equity and one third in portfolio equity.62 Equity flows were particularly strong in China where a relatively large proportion of financial in- flows appear to have been motivated by expectations of appreciation of the yuan (Setser 2008; Yu 2008). Some of these are reported to have entered the country through over-invoicing of exports. According to some estimates, the so-called \u201chot money\u201d amounted to $5\u2013$10 billion a month during 2007 (Anderlini 2007). India also received large amounts of equity capital, but much of this was in portfolio equity rather than for- eign direct investment (FDI). This is also true for Malaysia where cumulative equity portfolio inflows during 2002- 2007 were nine times cumulative inflows of FDI (Khor 2009). Hedge funds from the United States and the United Kingdom have been very active in equity markets in the region, with assets managed by them being estimated to have grown sevenfold between 2001 and 2007. Following the cutback after the 1997 crisis, interna- tional bank lending in Asia started to exceed repayments in the early years of this decade. There was a visible growth in syndicated loans privately placed by corporations in several countries. Private financial and non-financial cor- porations also engaged in carry-trade-style short-term external borrowing in India, Korea, and the Philippines, particularly through low-interest yen-linked loans. Highly leveraged hedge funds are also known to have been very active in carry trades in Asia. While restrictions on foreign entry to domestic bond markets were generally main- tained, in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia there have been marked increases in foreign holding of local- currency debt instruments. In the region as a whole, local 61 The underlying figures in table 5 are on net-net basis for equity flows and gross basis for debt flows; that is, net outflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio equity by residents are deducted from net inflows by non-residents. Thus, the current account balance plus private capital flows minus net lending by residents (and errors and omissions) would give changes in reserves \u2212 see IIF (October 2007: Box 3). 62 For further discussion of components of capital flows to Asian emerging markets, see BIS (2007), IMF REO (October 2007), IMF GFS (October 2007), and McCauley (2008). 22 claims of foreign banks, including local bond holdings, as a percentage of all foreign banks\u2019 claims more than doubled since the beginning of the decade, suggesting a growing preference for international banks to lend in local currencies at higher rates. 5.2 Policy response: Currency market interventions and reserve accumulation As noted above, after the Asian crisis several countries in the region moved towards more flexible exchange rate arrangements. But they have followed various shades of managed floating rather than leaving their currencies entirely to the whims of international capital flows. In order to build a strong payments position, most countries in the region successfully intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets to prevent appreciations. Asian developing countries taken together had a current account surplus of 7 percent of GDP in 2007 and over 5 percent in 2008, up from 1.5 percent in 2001. Although this is largely due to China\u2019s strong export performance, a number of other countries have also been enjoying surpluses, in some cases in double-digit figures, as a percent of GDP. India has been running cur- rent account deficits, but at moderate levels.

Reserve requirements of banks were continuously raised from 7 percent in 2003 to 17.5 percent in 2008, and banks have come to hold over 80 percent of central bank securities issued for that purpose, with their share in total bank assets exceeding 20 percent (Yu 2008; BIS 2009: Box D4). In India the cash reserve ratio was also increased in several steps to reach 7.5 percent in 2008, but because of higher interest rates the cost of intervention is reported to have reached 2 percent of GDP in 2007 \u2212 more than half of the central government deficits. 63 As in some mature economies, monetary policy in many countries in Asia has been expansionary and real interest rates have been considerably lower than those in other regions. After 2003 private credit growth in real terms reached nearly 9 percent per annum in China and 5 percent in many other East Asian countries.64 The surge in capital flows was an important reason for the rapid expansion of liquidity since interventions in foreign ex- change markets could not always be fully sterilized. As of end-2008 total reserves in developing Asia (excluding NIEs) exceeded $2.2 trillion, and 86 percent of this figure was generated after 2001 (table 6).65 Asian reserves now account for more than half of total reserves of the developing world. The twin surpluses that the region as a whole has been running on its balance of payments have been fully converted into reserves. Of the $2.4 trillion reserves accumulated after 2001, 60 percent is earned and the rest is borrowed. However, excluding China, almost three quarters of Asian reserves in recent years were from capital inflows. In countries running cur- rent account deficits, such as India, Pakistan, and Vietnam, reserves are 100 percent borrowed. Asian reserves exceed the level needed to prevent a currency and balance-of-payments crisis under the Greenspan-Guidotti rule noted above. They are several times the total short-term external debt of the region, which stood at around $400 billion at the end of 2008, and more than twice the total external debt of some $1,160 billion. They now cover more than nine months of imports. However, in many countries reserves are not large in comparison with the stock of foreign portfolio investment. In 2008 the ratio of the latter to total reserves was greater than unity in Korea, Indonesia, and the Philip- pines and exceeded 80 percent in Singapore and Malaysia (ESCAP 2008). About half of the total stock of reserves in Asia is borrowed. This is a little more than the existing stock of external debt of the region. Again assuming a 500-basis-point spread, this would give an annual carry cost of some $60 billion for the region as a whole \u2212 that is, this is how much the region as a whole could save per year by paying up its external debt by drawing on reserves.66 63 Fiscal cost from ESCAP (2007: 21) and government deficits from IMF REOAP (October 2007: 20). 64 For credit conditions and interest rates in Asia, see BIS (2007: 39-41), Mohanty and Turner (2006: 43), and IMF WEO (October 2007: 5). 65 It should be noted that reserve figures are subject to a valuation effect, which can be large because of sharp changes in cross rates among reserve currencies. 66 Since \u201cborrowed\u201d reserves of some countries fall short of their total external debt, realization of this aggregate benefit would require lending by countries with excess reserves to those with deficits, at rates earned on reserves. 23 5.3 Policy response: Liberalization of resident outflows Many Asian emerging markets have been incurring high reserve costs and facing macroeconomic policy dilemmas mainly because they have chosen to keep their economies open to the surge in capital inflows rather than impos- ing tighter countercyclical measures of control. Capital accounts in the region are more open today than they were during the 1997 crisis.67 In China, for instance, one of the countries with the tightest restrictions, calculations based on an IMF formula are said to show that 80 percent of the capital account has been liberalized.68 In several cases the opening to inflows has been selective, such as raising the limits on the QFII (qualified foreign institutional investors) in China. Some countries, including India, have liberalized sectoral caps on FDI. Foreign banks have generally been allowed greater free- dom to operate, with many domestic borrowers receiving funding from such banks directly from abroad or through their local offices.

In 2006 China extended to foreign banks the restriction over borrowing abroad to fund domestic dollar assets. In 2007 its foreign exchange regulators took action against 10 international banks for breaching capi- tal account regulations by \u201cassisting speculative foreign capital to enter the country disguised as trade and invest- ment\u201d (Anderlini 2007). Exporters have been required to park their export revenues in temporary accounts in order to enable officials to check and verify that invoices are backed by genuine trade transactions. In December 2006 Thailand imposed a 30 percent unremunerated reserve requirement on capital inflows held less than one year, including investment in portfolio equity, in order to halt continued appreciation of the currency. This provoked a strong reaction from the stock market, forcing the government to exempt investment in stocks from the requirements. The remaining restrictions were removed in March 2008. With a continued surge in capital inflows, India reversed the liberalization of the limits on external commercial borrowing, tightening them in 2007. Similarly, Korea restricted external funding of domestic lending by foreign banks and reintroduced limits on lending in foreign currency to domestic firms. However, the main response to the surge in capital inflows has been to liberalize outward investment by residents. This is partly motivated by a desire to allow national firms to expand abroad and become important players in world markets. This has particularly been the case in China and India. However, while in China assets acquired abroad are financed from trade surpluses, in India these are, in effect, funded by capital inflows. As remarked by an observer, \u201cthe global flood of money (and attendant hubris) has enabled Indian companies like Tata to buy themselves a place on the world stage rather than earning it through export success or technological advance\u201d (Bowring 2008a). There has also been considerable liberalization of portfolio outflows. China took a decision to permit invest- ment by its residents in approved overseas markets and raised the limits on corporate and individual purchases of foreign currency for mitigating the pressure for ap- preciation through the so-called QDII (qualified domestic institutional investor) scheme. The share of portfolio investment in the total international assets of China in 2006 was three times that of FDI abroad. In Malaysia, where limits on foreign assets held by some institutional investors were increased significantly, cumulative port- folio outflows during 2004-2007 were slightly below cumulative portfolio inflows and nine times direct invest- ment abroad. In 2007 there was a net outflow of capital (excluding reserve accumulation), which absorbed as much as half of the current account surplus (Khor 2009). India, Korea, and Thailand have all liberalized rules limit- ing portfolio investment abroad, and Thailand abolished the surrender requirement for exporters. 5.4 Credit, asset, and investment bubbles Recent capital inflows have resulted in a rapid increase in foreign presence in Asian equity markets. Figures for net equity inflows understate this because, as noted, there has also been a rapid increase in resident outflows. Non-resident holding of Korean equities reached almost half of market capitalization (McCauley 2008). In China foreign share as a percent of market capitalisation rose from 2.5 percent in 2001 to 23.2 percent in 2006, and in India from 6.6 percent to 10 percent in the same period (BIS 2009: table E1). The share of foreigner transactions in 2005 in average daily turnover was around 20 percent in Korea, 30 percent in Thailand, and 70 percent in Taiwan (Chai-Anant and Ho 2008). There is also strong evidence that foreign investors tend to move in and out of some of the different Asian markets simultaneously. The IMF Global Financial Stabil- ity Report (IMF GFS October 2007) finds evidence on 67 For recent measures in Asia, see BIS (2007), IMF REOAP (April 2007), IMF GFS (October 2007), and McCauley (2008). 68 See Yu (2008 and 2009). It has been argued that China\u2019s capital controls remained substantially binding during the period of a de facto dollar peg until July 2005, as suggested by sustained and significant gaps between onshore and offshore renminbi yields. It is also found that since July 2005 there has been a partial convergence between onshore and offshore yields; see Ma and McCauley (2007). 24 herd behaviour among institutional investors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0043da5d-a47d-4cd7-a225-2b5e0fd669a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "0043da5d-a47d-4cd7-a225-2b5e0fd669a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2169772fc9ff2d2510a33c1db5d886006b237a1c99ea825f849eaf71b5b03fcd"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b2948f3-1d3c-4f3b-941f-4ab5259bbf43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af6cde7a3c1baf43c1cb7524232691297ac20ce529e2df742f071aedf0fa59cf"}}, "hash": "ae9d217257606ad0e93afa0ba51220467099fc8d9c105af3becb2e91d036b6f2", "text": "24 herd behaviour among institutional investors.

For the region as a whole equity prices tripled between 2002 and 2008, with increases exceeding 500 percent in China and India. The price/earnings ratios also rose rapidly, resulting in a sharp drop in equity costs.70 That such in- creases more likely reflected bubbles than improvements in underlining fundamentals was cautioned by the Insti- tute of International Finance (IIF March 2005: 4): \u201cthere is a risk that the pickup in flows into some emerging market assets has pushed valuations to levels that are not com- mensurate with underlying fundamentals.\u201d The two largest countries, China and India, that saw the strongest surge in capital inflows and stock markets also experienced a boom in property markets. During 2002-2006 residential property prices rose in real terms by over 8 percent per annum in China and 10 percent in India, and the price-to-rent ratio rose by more than 20 percent.71 There was also acceleration of property price increases in Korea (15 percent), Singapore, and Vietnam during 2006-2007. While these were not as dramatic as increases in the United States \u2212 where the price-to-rent ratio rose by 30 percent over the same period \u2212 there are large pockets in China, India, Korea, and the Philippines where increases were comparable and even greater.72 Housing loans expanded faster than other types of lend- ing and have been a major factor in sharp increases in household indebtedness. In Korea where bank lending to households grew rapidly after 2005, household debt reached 140 percent of disposable income \u2212 above the level of household indebtedness in the United States (ADB 2007). Such booms in equity and property markets are often a potential source of macroeconomic instability. There is evidence, not only from industrial countries but also from a number of Asian emerging markets, including Hong Kong (China), Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, that asset booms (defined as periods in which asset prices exceed their trend by more than 10 percent) significantly raise the probability of output being eventually pushed below its potential level and the price level above its trend (Gochoco-Bautista 2008). In China and India ample liquidity, low equity costs, and low loan rates together have also created an investment boom, which may not be sustained with the return of normal financial conditions. In China where the share of investment in GDP reached 46 percent, the increase appears to have been associated with consider- able excess capacity and wastage of capital.73 Similarly, in India growth in investment has been faster than GDP by more than 5 percentage points per annum, with the investment ratio rising to over 30 percent of GDP from less than 24 percent in the early years of the decade. 5.5 Shocks and contagion from the global financial crisis As a result of closer global financial integration, notably the increased presence of foreigners in domestic finan- cial markets and liberalization of resident investment abroad, Asia has become highly susceptible to external financial influences. The region has indeed been receiv- ing severe shocks and contagion from the global financial turbulence triggered by the sub-prime debacle through various channels, and facing the risk of asset deflation, a high degree of currency instability, and a sharp economic slowdown. The increased holding of foreign assets has no doubt resulted in greater exposure to instability in their market valuations as well as exchange rate swings. Asian economies do not have large direct exposure to securi- tized assets linked to sub-prime lending, even though some losses have been reported in the region.74 However, they appear to have invested large amounts in debt issued by United States Government-sponsored enterprises, including mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 69 In China the equity market is segmented between residents and non-residents in A-share and B-share markets, with the former being reserved exclu- sively for residents. Both residents and non-residents are allowed to use foreign exchange to invest in B shares. Large inflows of capital, together with growing current account surpluses, affect A-share equity prices mainly through liquidity expansion. 70 Data on equity prices and price/earnings ratios are from IMF GFS (October 2007). 71 For an analysis of developments in Asian housing markets, see IMF REOAP (April 2007), which somewhat underplays", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9869483b-34bf-4c7d-ba37-09f8347e3994": {"__data__": {"id_": "9869483b-34bf-4c7d-ba37-09f8347e3994", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c644faad66c7457c25e3d7d6417fa9ecd607a8b9c0d10b41defabe4f95ff5de"}}, "hash": "8c644faad66c7457c25e3d7d6417fa9ecd607a8b9c0d10b41defabe4f95ff5de", "text": "the extent of the bubble and the risks involved, but nevertheless points out that speculative dynamics cannot be ruled out, notably in China, India, and Korea. 72 Korean and the United States data from OECD (2007: annex table 60). For others, see BIS (2007: 50) and IMF (2007b). 73 On excess capacity, waste, and sustainability of the investment boom in China, see BIS (2007), Goldstein and Lardy (2004), Nagaraj (2005), and Bran- stetter and Lardy (2006). 74 The Bank of China is reported to have lost some $2 billion on its holdings of collateralized securities, including those backed by US mortgages (Pearl- stein 2008). Standard Chartered, in which Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, Temasek, owns a 19 percent stake, is reported to have been walking away from its $7.5 billion special investment vehicles (SIVs) sold in Asia and the Middle East (Bowring 2008b). 25 with combined liabilities of around $5.5 trillion. Holding by central banks outside the United States of such debt is estimated to be in the order of $1 trillion, and large amounts are also known to be held in private portfolios. China\u2019s holding of US agency debt is estimated to be at least 10 percent of its GDP, mostly in Fannie and Freddie assets (Pesek 2008). Had the United States government not bailed out these institutions, losses would have been severe. Moreover, should the dollar come under pressure, countries with a large stock of dollar reserves stand to incur considerable exchange rate losses. There is considerable variation among Asian emerging markets in their vulnerability to sharp swings in the risk appetite and capital flows. Capital flows to emerging markets, including bank-related flows, initially kept up after the outbreak of the sub-prime crisis, but with the deepening of the credit crunch there is now a sharp decline that is more marked in Asia than in other re- gions (table 5). FDI remained relatively resilient, but with the widespread credit crunch in the United States and Europe there has been a sharp drop in commercial bank credits, from $156 billion to an estimated $30 billion, and this is expected to turn negative in 2009. Net portfolio equity flows to Asia, including outflows by residents, were already negative in 2007, and they are expected to have become even bigger in 2008, reaching $55 billion.75 Redemption by highly-leveraged hedge funds from the United States and the United Kingdom is an important factor. These institutions, which had been very active in Asian equity markets in earlier years, are now hard hit by the crisis, and deleveraging by them appears to be a main reason for the exit of equity portfolio investment not only from Asia but also from emerging markets as a whole.76 With rapid exit of foreign capital and global re- trenchment of risk appetite, asset bubbles in Asia have come to an end. Equity markets lost almost half of their values in 2008 in China and India. Booms in property markets too are now bust. In China house prices declined in December 2008 for the first time since the government started releasing the data in 2005, and urban fixed asset investment has been falling since September 2008. The government is now taking measures to revive the prop- erty market.77 In Korea the slump that started in 2008 is now threatening to set off a process of debt deflation, reminiscent of the 1997 crisis when housing prices fell by some 13 percent (Citigroup 2009). This cycle in Asian asset markets has many features reminiscent of the cycle in the 1990s, but is different in an important respect. In the current cycle asset deflation is not associated with currency crises and interest rate hikes, but severe trade shocks. The combination of asset deflation with sharp drops in exports and consequent retrenchment in investment can no doubt wreak havoc in the real economy.78 This explains why in Asia \u201cthe slump in industrial production has been more significant and more rapid than in 1997-98.\u201d 79 It is important to avoid destabilizing feedbacks between the real and financial sectors, particularly in China because of its wider regional ramifications. A sharp drop in growth can threaten the solvency of the banking system given the high degree of leverage of many firms, which can in turn lower growth further.80 Whether or not the massive fiscal package introduced by the government would prevent such an outcome remains to be seen. In any event, the challenge faced by China is not only to overcome the deflationary impulses from the global financial crisis but to shift to a growth trajectory led by the expansion of domestic consumption.

Given strong deflationary impulses from the crisis, this may be viewed as a welcome development; and unlike 1997, governments now seem to be wary of throwing all their reserves into stabilizing their currencies. However, in some of these countries, notably India and Korea, re- serves have declined rapidly as a result of exit of capital and growing current account deficits.81 75 Net portfolio investment outflows in 2008 from emerging markets as a whole is estimated to have been $89 billion (IIF January 2009).

According to preliminary estimates, as of January 2009 some Asian countries, notably Korea and Singapore, experienced severe contraction in output during the last quarter of 2008. In China, where manufacturing output also dropped and loss of employment reached some 20 million, more recent indicators seem to be more encouraging; see Xinhuanet (2009b). 80 BIS (2007: 56) notes that in China the bulk of recorded profits are earned by relatively few enterprises while the rest have high leverage, so that if growth slows significantly a substantial proportion of bank loans can become non-performing. 81 For the behaviour of reserves on India and Korea during 2008, see Obstfeld, Shambaugh, and Taylor (2009) and RGE Monitor (2009a and b). 26 6.1 Global instability and the search for regional solutions The main objective of the planners of the post-war economic architecture was to avoid the repetition of the breakdown of international trade and payments that had devastated the world economy during the interwar years. Exchange rate stability was believed to hold the key to the realization of this objective. This was most emphati- cally expressed by Keynes (1944: 5) during the Bretton Woods negotiations: \u201cTariffs and currency depreciations are in many alternatives. Without currency agreements you have no firm ground on which to discuss tariffs.... It is very difficult while you have monetary chaos to have order of any kind in other directions.\u201d The Bretton Woods architecture was based on three legs: multilateral discipline over exchange rate policies, restrictions over destabilizing capital flows, and provision of adequate international liquidity to countries facing temporary pay- ments imbalances. The convertibility of the dollar vis-\u00e0-vis gold at a fixed rate was designed to exert multilateral discipline over policies of the main reserve-currency country, the United States. Other countries undertook obligation to maintain their exchange rates within a narrow range of their par values and were allowed to change their par values under fundamental disequilibrium only with the consent of the Fund. Restriction over short-term capital flows, which had proved highly destabilizing during the interwar years, was seen as a key to stability of exchange rates. The IMF was to provide short-term financing to countries facing temporary shortfalls in international liquidity in order to avoid destabilizing currency adjust- ments, retrenchment in domestic absorption, and con- traction in economic activity. All three building blocks of the Bretton Woods system disappeared in the early 1970s with the default of the United States on gold convertibility and adoption of floating with incongruous commitments to exchange rate stability. Free movement of capital became the norm. And the Fund started to impose exactly the kind of procy- 6.

Initial efforts to stabilize intra-European exchange rates through ad hoc arrangements led to the creation of the European Monetary System (EMS) in 1979, which culminated in the European Monetary Union (EMU) three decades later.82 Instability among reserve currencies after the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system had relatively limited impact on developing countries that were pursu- ing intermediate exchange rate regimes under relatively tight control over capital flows. But shortcomings of the third leg of the Bretton Woods arrangements \u2212 the pro- vision of adequate international liquidity by the IMF \u2212 became highly visible with the increased volatility of the global economic environment, particularly in the early 1980s when a combination of hikes in interest rates and recession in industrial countries produced severe payments difficulties in several indebted countries, culminating in a debt crisis in Latin America. These shortcomings became even more visible with the 1997 Asian crisis. Realizing that developing countries could no longer rely on international financial institutions to address their liquidity problems during such times, an at- tempt was made to bring a regional solution by establish- ing an Asian Monetary Fund. After this was abandoned because of opposition from the United States and the IMF, the \u201cASEAN+3\u201d (the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus China, Japan, and Korea) went ahead with swap arrangements with the so-called Chiang Mai initiative, building on the existing ASEAN Swap Arrangement (ASA) established in 1977.83 However, 82 The first major political initiative for a European monetary union was taken in 1969 with the Werner Report, which proposed: for the first stage, a reduction of the fluctuation margins between the currencies of the members of the European Community (EC); for the second stage, complete freedom of capital movements; and for the final stage, an irrevocable fixing of exchange rates. For a critical account of the EMS and its applicability to other regions, see Bofinger and Flassbeck (2000) and UNCTAD TDR (2007). 83 For ASA and Chiang Mai, see Henning (2002). These are not the first initiatives for regional monetary cooperation among developing countries. The Andean Reserve Fund and the Arab Monetary Fund were among the earlier examples, both going back to 1976; see Aky\u00fcz and Flassbeck (2002) and UNCTAD TDR (2007: chap. 5). 27 the initiative was largely symbolic, since the swap lines agreed would have been inadequate in the face of a strong region-wide attack on currencies. Thus, countries went for a more reliable solution by accumulating large stocks of international reserves. Again, with the spread of shocks and contagion from the global financial crisis in 2008, ASEAN+3 decided to establish an $80 billion fund to safeguard regional stability, replacing the existing bilateral currency swaps under the Chiang Mai Initiative with a reserve-pooling mechanism (called the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateral- ization) and coming closer to a regional monetary fund. Subsequently, the amount was raised in February 2009 to $120 billion as pressure mounted on currencies and reserves of several countries, to be accompanied by an independent regional surveillance mechanism to help determine the conditions for activation of and access to the fund.84 There have also been further bilateral swap agreements among some countries in the region, e.g., between China and Korea, Japan and Indonesia, and Korea and Japan. These initiatives no doubt reflect a shared concern over currency instability, against a background of rapidly deepening regional integration through trade and invest- ment. However, the region lacks effective arrangements for the coordination of exchange rate policies. It is true that recent sharp swings in intraregional exchange rates (table 7) have been greatly influenced by differences in capital flows, current account balances, and macroeco- nomic conditions in different countries. Nevertheless, their origin also lies in differences in currency regimes pursued by the countries in the region, which now span the entire spectrum between the two corners, compared to widespread de facto dollar pegs before the crisis. At one corner there are economies with independent float- ing \u2212 Japan, Korea, and the Philippines; at another there is Hong Kong with a currency board. The intermediate regimes adopted in the region also show significant variations, with China and Malaysia using very tightly managed pegs against Thailand\u2019s and Singapore\u2019s more flexible regimes.85 The coexistence of a variety of regimes in East Asia implies that the intraregional exchange rates tend to manifest a high degree of instability in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c7e3f32-b83b-4b9d-aecb-557fdf2a04ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c7e3f32-b83b-4b9d-aecb-557fdf2a04ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63951c6ab571269c902b90e3f2fdafac704197127e4da6e3819342bb7dbcd805"}}, "hash": "63951c6ab571269c902b90e3f2fdafac704197127e4da6e3819342bb7dbcd805", "text": "periods of large swings in the dollar. Lack of regional cooperation in exchange rate policies is of particular concern in the current juncture not only because the ongoing instability evokes the memories of contagion that led to a severe crisis about a decade ago but also because contraction in export markets often raises the temptation of beggar- my-neighbour exchange rate adjustments. 6.2 Rationale for exchange rate cooperation in East Asia Significant changes in policy and institutions often follow severe economic shocks and disruptions. The Bretton Woods system was established after the world went through one of the bloodiest armed conflicts in the his- tory of mankind following the breakdown of international trade and payments in the interwar period. The European process of monetary integration was triggered by the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, and the Asian monetary cooperation was sparked off by the 1997 crisis. Now, the global spread of financial crisis is giving rise to several initiatives for tighter regulation of international financial markets. Likewise, current difficulties provide considerable food for thought for deeper monetary inte- gration in East Asia, including a common currency regime and, eventually, a monetary union. It is generally recognized that Asia lacks a culture of regionalism, that is, the political will and regional institutions needed for such a drastic change. To date regional economic integration in Asia has been driven by markets, notably by transnational corporations, rather than by governments. By contrast, the European integra- tion was a politically-driven process based on post-war transnational reconciliation in Franco-German relations, and on a shared vision by political left and right alike that regional political stability depended crucially on economic integration and stability. Such a reconciliation is lacking in East Asia where some countries have still failed to come to terms with their past. This is no doubt a major impediment to regional monetary integration even though there appears to be a strong economic rationale for it. Nevertheless, exploring various options can still help prepare the ground for the time when political realities become favourable, even though at present such efforts may appear to be no more than academic exercises. After all, history teaches that big changes almost always look implausible until they happen. 86 East Asia has been undergoing rapid economic integration associated with fast and broad-based growth. 84 Thailand proposed to go even further, using 10 percent of reserves of ASEAN+3 to establish a reserve fund of some $350 billion; see Kate and Adam (2008) and RGE Monitor (2009d). For more recent developments regarding the Chiang Mai Initiative, see Henning (2009). 85 This classification is from IMF (2008) based on members\u2019 actual, de facto arrangements as indentified by IMF staff, not officially announced arrange- ments. 86 This was expressed with some foresight by Rogoff (1999: 28) during the debate on the reform of the international financial architecture after the Asian crisis: \u201cIt is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that big institutional changes are unrealistic or infeasible\u2026. Not so long ago, the prospects for a single European currency seemed no more likely than those for the breakup of the Soviet empire or the reunification of Germany. Perhaps large institutional changes only seem impossible until they happen \u2013 at which point they seem foreordained. Even if none of the large-scale plans is feasible in the present world political environment, after another crisis or two, the impossible may start seeming realistic.\u201d 28 Intraregional trade among ASEAN+3 has been growing faster than trade with the rest of the world.87 Intraregional exchange rates no doubt play an increasingly important role in determining the division of labour in the region. Maintaining stable and properly aligned currencies is essential for this process to be driven by underlying economic fundamentals, and for preventing financial instability and trade tensions in the region. It is quite un- likely that these objectives could be achieved with each country acting alone. They require closer monetary and financial cooperation to underpin the ongoing regional economic integration. The main benefit of a regional monetary integra- tion comes from greater currency, payments, and financial stability. This depends, of course, on how integration is designed, including supporting institutions and mecha- nisms. The European experience in this respect is quite encouraging. Despite the temporary setbacks in 1992- 1993 and shortcomings in the design of policies and insti- tutional arrangements (to be discussed below), the EMS was very successful in securing stability in intraregional exchange rates, containing financial contagion, and deal- ing with fluctuations vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar and the yen. The main beneficiaries were smaller economies.

Besides, none of these countries, including Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, had to go to the IMF after the establishment of the EMS in 1979, even though economically they were less advanced than Korea when it had to resort to IMF support in 1997. In the absence of the EMS, open and smaller European countries would have had little option but to peg their currencies to the deutschmark and follow German monetary policy without enjoying the protection and support provided by the EMS. The cost of giving up autonomy in exchange rate policy depends on the difficulties this would cause in maintaining stable and high levels of employment and economic activity. This issue is often examined in terms of whether the countries concerned could form an opti- mal currency area (OCA). According to the OCA theory, a monetary union would bring benefits if the economies concerned are sufficiently closely integrated, the shocks they are expected to receive are symmetrical, and their labour markets are flexible enough to absorb such shocks without causing unemployment. Several studies examined empirically whether East Asia (ASEAN and/or ASEAN+3) adequately meets the con- ditions for a monetary union so as to generate benefits to all its potential members, often taking the European Union as a reference point. As in most empirical studies of this kind, the findings are inconclusive. According to some, Asia is too diverse to meet the criteria for an OCA: intra-regional trade and financial integration are limited, and regional shocks are not always symmetrical. Accord- ing to others, however, it comes very close to meeting OCA conditions: income gaps of Asian countries have been closing not only with the rest of the world but also with each other, business cycles are closely correlated, and the shocks they receive are sufficiently symmetrical because of similarities in their trade patterns and integra- tion into the global financial system. A study by Goto and Hamada (1994) found that in some areas East Asia was more closely integrated than Europe. Similarly, an analysis conducted at the beginning of this decade showed that, in terms of various economic criteria, the region was no less ready for a regional mone- tary arrangement than Europe was before the EMU (Kawai and Takagi 2000). Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1999) came to the conclusion that East Asian countries satisfied the standard OCA conditions almost as well as Europe and that a common currency peg would be particularly ben- eficial for smaller and more open economies, while point- ing out that because of the lack of an institutional frame- work such an arrangement would be risky. A subsequent study by Kawai and Motonishi (2005) reached a similar conclusion. According to Bayoumi and Mauro (1999) and Bayoumi, Eichengreen, and Mauro (1999), ASEAN is less suited for a regional currency arrangement than Europe was before the Maastricht Treaty, although the differ- ence is not large. Plummer and Wignaraja (2007) argue, on the basis of increased correlation of business cycles, that the economic potential for monetary integration is strong, while Zhang, Sato, and McAleer (2004) maintain that labour markets in East Asia are no less flexible than in Europe. By contrast, Nicolas (1999) contends that similar- ity in ASEAN countries are exaggerated because of high levels of aggregation, and Chow and Kim (2003) and Kim (2008) find that macroeconomic shocks are quite asym- metric and heterogeneous not only in East Asia but also within ASEAN. More recently, Shirono (2008) has followed a different approach, focussing on the trade aspects of monetary integration, and found that a currency union could double bilateral trade in the region and bring wel- fare benefits, particularly if Japan were included. While the OCA theory provides insight into un- derstanding the factors affecting the costs and benefits of a monetary integration, it cannot be relied on to draw practical guidelines to decisions over monetary union. First, it pays little attention to costs of potential conflicts that may arise from beggar-my-neighbour trade, FDI, and exchange rate policies.

More importantly, the theory of OCA ignores that trade patterns and income levels are endogenous; that is, joining a monetary union is likely to move countries closer to each other and hence to the conditions for an OCA. This has clearly been the case in Europe where considerable convergence of income and macroeconomic conditions occurred throughout the process of integration culminat- ing in the EMU.88 However, it is also important to recog- nize that endogenous convergence depends very much on institutional and behavioural changes that would be required to manage integration and to compensate for the loss of the exchange rate instrument \u2212 issues to which the theory of OCA pays little attention (Buiter 1995). Intraregional trade was no doubt much higher in Europe than it is in East Asia today, reaching almost 70 percent of total trade of the former, compared to less than 50 percent in the latter. But in East Asia, too, it is likely to reach similar magnitudes if recent trends are maintained, and if initiatives such as the ASEAN Economic Community can be put into practice and extended to include China and Korea. Besides, intraregional trade and monetary integration can constitute mutually reinforcing processes in East Asia in the same way as they have in Europe: stable exchange rates help to expand trade and deepen regional economic integration, which can, in turn, achieve greater convergence to conditions needed to increase the ben- efits from common currency arrangements. The contagion which spread the currency attacks during the 1997 crisis from Thailand to several other countries was partly caused by the belief that regional integration was deep enough to trigger competitive devaluations. In reality there is both competition and complementarity in East Asian trade. An important part of trade among the countries of the region is comple- mentary intraindustry trade in intermediate goods linked to international production networks, with China at the centre.89 In these networks based on vertical intraindus- try trade specialization, China imports components and parts (mostly from the NIEs) and capital goods (mainly from Japan and Korea) as inputs into consumer goods exported largely to industrial countries, but also partly to other developing countries, including in the region.90 Clearly, this is different from western European-type intraindustry trade, where countries both import and export final products produced by the same industries and compete in these markets. In vertical production net- works competition is largely among countries supplying intermediate goods (e.g., computer chips) rather than in markets for final consumer products. Although intra-industry trade in final consumables has also been developing rapidly in East Asia, the increase in intraregional trade over the past decade is largely due to growth of trade between China and other East Asian countries within industry-specific production networks, mirroring rapid growth of Chinese exports to the United States and the European Union. Thus, trade shocks from advanced economies tend to generate symmetrical effects across the region. Because of a high degree of import content of Chinese assembly industries, a one dollar decline in China\u2019s exports to the United States and Europe tends to reduce its imports from the rest of East Asia by more than a one dollar decline in its domestic consumption. This is clearly seen in the current crisis, dur- ing which declines in China\u2019s exports to the United States and Europe are mirrored by sharp contractions in its imports from the region and intraregional trade, with all major Asian economies experiencing double-digit drops in exports (RGE Monitor 2009c and 2009e). Competition among East Asian countries in the United States and European markets for final products appears to be more intense than competition in intrare- gional trade in these products. Not only did the countries hit by the 1997 crisis export to the same destinations but they also exported the same products. Their exports to the United States was concentrated in two groups, namely, (i) semiconductors and capital goods industries and (ii) apparel, footwear, and household goods (Kochhar, Loungani and Stone 1998: 18-19). Competition among 88 The pioneering study in this area is Frankel and Rose (1996), which empirically shows, using the intensity of intra-union trade and correlation of business cycles, that countries are more likely to satisfy the criteria for entry into a currency union after taking steps towards economic integration than before. The OCA indices developed by Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1997) also show considerable convergence in Europe towards criteria for monetary union after 1987. 89 For the nature and extent of intraregional trade in East Asia, see MAS (2007: chap. 5) and Shafaeddin (2008: section 5).

Half of the latter was used in production for domestic markets and half for exports; see MAS (2003). Since 1995 there has been a rapid expansion of industry-specific production networks, notably in electronics. Therefore, more up-to-date input-output tables are likely to show a higher share of intermediate imports in production for exports. The same study also finds that about 68 percent of China\u2019s imports from East Asia are used, directly or indirectly, for domestic demand in China, including investment. However, no account is taken that an important part of investment in Chinese manufacturing is directly linked to exports. 30 Asian producers in third markets has certainly intensified since the 1997 crisis with growing penetration of China in the United States and European markets in areas of export interest to other Asian NIEs. In finance, Asian regional integration is much more limited than in trade (MAS 2007: chap. 5; Kawai 2007). In fact Asia is integrated more closely with global financial markets than regionally. A very large proportion of port- folio investment in Asia comes from the United States and Europe, which also constitute the main destinations for Asian portfolio investment abroad. This provides a strong rationale for closer regional monetary cooperation because it implies, in effect, that Asian emerging markets are exposed to similar external financial shocks and con- tagion, and require similar policy responses. As already discussed, this has indeed been the case in the current global turmoil where such shocks have caused sharp de- clines in asset markets across the region. Such common financial shocks and contagion are generally neglected in the literature on OCA, which tends to focus on real supply and demand shocks. 6.3 Options for regional currency arrangements As noted above, the main objective of European mon- etary cooperation after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system was to secure intraregional stability while floating collectively vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar and other reserve curren- cies. After the initial and barely successful experiments with \u201csnake\u201d and \u201csnake in the tunnel,\u201d parity grids were established for each member currency vis-\u00e0-vis all other ERM currencies in two-tier bands of \u00b1 2.25 percent, with the Italian lira enjoying a wider band of \u00b1 6 percent, widened further to \u00b115 percent when it came under at- tack in the early 1990s.91 The ERM was anchored to the deutschmark not only because it was the main reserve currency in the region but also because Germany was a large economy with a good track record in price stability. France was also big but not stable, while Holland was stable but not big enough (Bofinger and Flassbeck 2000). Joint intervention and unlimited short-term bilateral credits to weak-currency countries were the main instru- ments for maintaining currencies in parity grids. Parity adjustments were allowed to prevent build-up of funda- mental disequilibria, at least until the 1987 Basle-Nyborg agreement, which sought to avoid further parity changes by liberalizing intra-marginal interventions in order to strengthen the credibility of the EMS.92 Could and should East Asia try to replicate the European experience by aiming at intraregional stability while adopting a benign neglect towards the values of their currencies vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the world? Or should they go for a common mechanism designed to attain both internal and external stability, with provisions for appropriate adjustments if and when needed? What are the options in common exchange rate arrangements? Replicating the ERM in East Asia can pose serious problems. First of all, there would be practical difficulties in pegging bilaterally and floating collectively without an independently floating reserve currency as an anchor. The yen is the only such currency at present, but there are political impediments to forming intraregional cur- rency arrangements around the yen. More importantly, floating collectively \u2212 with or without an anchor reserve currency \u2212 would mean a significant degree of instability vis-\u00e0-vis third currencies. This would not have mattered much if East Asian developing countries traded mainly with each other and/or competed among themselves in third markets. But for the region as a whole and for most countries, the share of non-East Asian trade as a propor- tion of GDP is still very high and competition from third countries is quite intense.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ad4f189-809b-4229-a0a9-b287aa13116a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ad4f189-809b-4229-a0a9-b287aa13116a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25ac986b3a6f96ad7c717071f353667bd498fb6f253f592dcd676e524bdb3d4f"}, "2": {"node_id": "4135ecac-1c39-4779-975b-a45be55734f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b06ac6d591f23b74adbd1ef91a40657fecb6b8733929e9b0fe6733ddb900403b"}}, "hash": "2cbdd5965575ab237e5519a9b0c2181674868d885c5071689b1ac19d4962f204", "text": "This means that fluctuations vis-\u00e0-vis third currencies could generate considerable swings in economic activity and undermine export-led growth strategies.93 Adopting managed floating vis-\u00e0- vis the rest of the world would", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7629a24d-54cf-428d-a1d5-d64acc6fc4b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "7629a24d-54cf-428d-a1d5-d64acc6fc4b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37142a4777b888209662723b6a28d9f818274bb3fcc2e460dc47300ff3ce5f38"}}, "hash": "37142a4777b888209662723b6a28d9f818274bb3fcc2e460dc47300ff3ce5f38", "text": "also be difficult without an internal reserve currency as an anchor. Thus, an AMS modelled on the EMS, with or without management of external parities, may have to wait until the Chinese yuan becomes a fully convertible world currency. If the main objective is simply to maintain a stable pattern of intraregional exchange rates, a solution would be to move collectively to the other corner and fix all regional currencies to a reserve currency, notably the dollar.94 This was advocated by McKinnon (2001) for most 91 After the suspension of gold convertibility by the United States, the 1971 Smithsonian agreement established a 4.5 percent margin (the tunnel) for other currencies against the dollar (that is, \u00b1 2.25 percent relative to the central rate). This effectively meant that European currencies could move by up to 9 percent against each other. Soon after the European Community established the snake, that is, bilateral margins of 2.5 percent, which effectively limited such movements among members of the EC to 4.5 percent. The snake in the tunnel came to an end in 1973 when the dollar started to float freely. 92 This, in effect, helped create one-way bets against fundamentally misaligned lira and pound sterling, leading to the 1992-1993 turmoil; see Aky\u00fcz and Flassbeck (2002). 93 Park and Wyplosz (2007: 14), who otherwise favour the replication of the EMS by establishing an Asian Monetary System (AMS) in the way suggested by Wyplosz (2004) over other regional alternatives, recognize that should a significant number of Asian countries adopt the European strategy, \u201cthey would be unlikely to sustain the export-led strategy. Either the exchange rates would jointly float, both up and down, or, given the economic weight of the AMS countries, attempts to manage the external parities would quickly meet strong resistance from the G7 and the IMF. This would likely signal the end of the export-led strategy for the region.\u201d 31 East Asian countries on grounds that soon after the 1997 crisis they had all gone back to some form of de facto dollar peg, but lack of any formal agreement left the door open to beggar-my-neighbour exchange rate policies, in- stability, and contagion. On this view, such threats could be avoided by a collective formal dollar peg, which would also insulate the intraregional exchange rates against fluctuations in the dollar. In order to avoid instability, it is argued, it would be necessary to strengthen prudential regulations limiting banks\u2019 foreign exchange exposures. As noted above, since the beginning of the decade Asian developing countries have moved away from dollar pegs towards intermediate regimes of managed floating. Indeed, as indicated by wildly disparate fluctuations of regional currencies against the dollar since 2003 (table 7), the region is not a de facto dollar block. Returning to the dollar peg could defeat the central objective of improv- ing the ability of the countries to collectively manage their exchange rates in the service of stability and growth. Unilateral pegging to the dollar is not the same thing as going into a monetary union with the United States, since it would not entail any commitment on the part of the lat- ter country in the conduct of its monetary and exchange rate policies, or for financial support. The consequences of loss of monetary autonomy could be particularly severe given that the United States and East Asia do not come close to forming an OCA. Moreover, fixing to the dollar would not eliminate instability vis-\u00e0-vis third currencies and, hence, of effective exchange rates. Nor can vulner- ability of such a regime to instability and crises be easily eliminated through standard prudential regulations for reasons discussed in section D, above. Such a solution may be appropriate for countries looking for a credible external anchor to stabilize the domestic price level, but not for East Asia where the record in monetary and fiscal discipline is as good as, and even better than, the United States.95 An alternative proposal is to collectively target a basket of three reserve currencies, rather than the dollar alone, with a common set of weights determined on the basis of regional trade shares.96 Each country would an- nounce a central parity vis-\u00e0-vis the basket and commit to keep it within a unilaterally chosen band. There would be no restrictions over the choice of the exchange rate re- gime by individual countries; that is, each country would be free to choose its own regime with respect to the com- mon basket, including hard pegs and managed floating, provided that its exchange rate action is disciplined by the central basket rate.

However, central parity and the band would also be allowed to crawl in response to changes in economic fundamentals and large and durable shocks. Here, too, as in the dollar peg, changes among re- serve currencies would not affect intraregional exchange rates: in other words, if each economy stabilizes its cur- rency vis-\u00e0-vis a common basket of reserve currencies, they would also stabilize against each other. Moreover, the common basket peg would have the advantage of se- curing greater stability of effective exchange rates. How- ever, these can still show considerable instability since weights used in the common basket would diverge from the optimal weights in unilateral country baskets. The compromise needed regarding the weights to be used in the common basket may face political hurdles when the trade of countries with the three reserve-currency countries differs widely. However, instability in effective exchange rates caused by pegging to a common basket (rather than their own optimal baskets) is expected to diminish over time as countries move closer to each other and, hence, towards the conditions for an OCA. The proposed system is more flexible and less for- mal than the EMS. It does not call for a drastic change in the existing exchange rate regimes except for changing the target currency to a basket of three reserve curren- cies with common weights. Moreover, its implementation 94 According to Calvo and Reinhart (2002) dollar pegging is a rationale response to the problem of original sin, that is, the inability of developing countries to borrow in their own currencies. This is not relevant for most East Asian countries, which do not need to borrow in any currency. It has also become less relevant in Latin America where domestic-currency debt held by non-residents has been increasing rapidly, with international investors assuming the exchange rate risk in return for high yields. Some countries have also been able to issue local-currency-denominated global bonds at rates below those in domestic markets to benefit from lower jurisdiction spreads; see Aky\u00fcz (2007). 95 These considerations are equally and even more valid for establishing a yen block in East Asia (Kwan 1998), which would face, in addition, political difficulties. 96 For the original proposal, see Williamson (1999). See also Kawai and Takagi (2000), Ogawa and Ito (2000), and Williamson (2000 and 2005). A similar proposal was made by the staff of the French and Japanese Ministries of Finance in a joint paper: a \u201cpossible solution for many emerging market econo- mies could be a managed floating exchange-rate regime whereby the currency moves within a given implicit or explicit band with its centre targeted to a basket of currencies\u201d and \u201ca group of countries with close trade and financial links should adopt a mechanism that automatically moves the region\u2019s exchange rates in the same direction by similar percentages\u201d (MOF Japan 2001: 3-4). 97 However, both Williamson (2000) and Kawai and Takagi (2000) consider a BBC regime combining a band and crawl with the basket as the norm for most countries. 32 would not depend on the existence of an anchor reserve currency in the region. An argument advanced against a common East Asian basket system is that, in the absence of support by the three reserve-currency countries, it would not be able to stand a determined speculation even under the Chiang Mai Initiative.98 However, this would not be a problem if East Asia could collectively maintain a cur- rent account surplus and large amounts of reserves, and establish adequate intraregional credit lines. The major problem, however, is that such an informal and flexible arrangement would not secure adequate discipline and commitment. Here, unlike in the EMS, central parities and bands would be unilaterally determined. Since any band width with a central parity in the common basket is permissible, there can be consider- able intraregional instability unrelated to shifts among the reserve currencies. Although changes in exchange rates unwarranted by changes in the basket currencies can be challenged by other members, this might not be very effective if there is no commitment to defend a par- ticular rate.99 On the other hand, despite the restoration", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d63bbd2f-eac4-44a4-bd9b-91c15c339eff": {"__data__": {"id_": "d63bbd2f-eac4-44a4-bd9b-91c15c339eff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "348f3db672ed9f02e250339617080ab7d45f93212445214ea07e57fcbd3ed5fb"}}, "hash": "348f3db672ed9f02e250339617080ab7d45f93212445214ea07e57fcbd3ed5fb", "text": "rule the proposed arrangement would not have effective safeguards against arbitrary changes in the central parity and even bands, and would not eliminate the scope for beggar-my-neighbour parity adjustments. Thus, it can only be an initial step until there is an economic and political convergence towards conditions needed for a formal and more tightly regulated system. 100 Given the difficulties posed by soft regimes, and the lack of political will and solidarity to put in place more robust institutions and currency arrangements, it is sometimes suggested that Asia should make an even slower start by replicating the European Currency Unit (ECU) rather than the EMS by establishing an Asian Currency Unit (ACU) and promoting its use as a parallel currency alongside national currencies.101 This is also seen as fitting better to the Asian approach to integration as a market-based rather than politically driven process. However, the ECU never played an important role in the European monetary integration. The use of an ACU alongside national currencies would lead to currency mismatches, and these could be quite damaging when intraregional exchange rates are highly unstable. This could in fact deter its widespread use in the absence of mechanisms to stabilize intraregional exchange rates. More importantly, the success of the ACU would depend in large part on strong government support, giving it legal tender status by using it in bond issues, settlements among central banks, and even pricing of public services. Thus, successful development of an ACU is politically no less untenable than effective intraregional currency arrangements.102 One may then try to go all the way to introduce arrangements that would secure a reasonable degree of extraregional and intraregional exchange rate stability, instead of selecting a half way house that would turn out to be neither one thing nor the other. 6.4 Supporting mechanisms: Lessons from Europe A regional arrangement designed to maintain stable in- traregional and effective exchange rates needs to be sup- ported by several mechanisms and institutions. The list of areas of cooperation needed is quite long, and includes macroeconomic policy coordination, market regulation, and surveillance, but here attention is focussed on two areas that hold the key for the viability of any arrange- ment for collective management of exchange rates: i) the management of capital flows and ii) intraregional lending and policy adjustment. In both respects, the European experience holds a number of useful lessons, both by its successes and shortcomings. A regional capital account regime Regional currency arrangements require a common set of principles regarding rules to be applied to international capital flows. This was indeed the case in Europe. The Treaty of Rome stipulated gradual removal of restrictions among the member states, but it also permitted introduc- tion of controls in response to disturbances in the func- tioning of financial markets due to international capital movements, and authorized use of protective measures by countries experiencing balance-of-payments difficul- ties. Until 1988 when the Council adopted a new direc- tive calling for the liberalization of capital movements within the community by 1990, the EEC regime for capital movements was governed by guidelines established by various Directives issued from early 1960s onwards. These divided capital flows into four different categories, 98 See Park and Wyplosz (2007: 13), which reiterates that an AMS modelled on the EMS would be as effective as pegging to a common basket in stabilizing the regional bilateral exchange rates. 99 If, as Williamson (2005: 11) points out, a country accepts only an obligation not to intervene in a way that would tend to push the market rate away from the reference rate, but no obligation to defend a particular rate, it can adopt a behaviour of benign neglect when markets push the rate away from the central parity, and this could generate considerable instability when the band is very wide. 100 For instance, Kawai (2007) sees a common basket system as a step towards a more rigid intraregional exchange rate stabilization scheme such as an Asian snake or an Asian ERM. 101 This idea of ACU was pioneered by the Asian Development Bank. Eichengreen (2007) gives support to it as a parallel currency, while recognizing some of the difficulties noted below. 102 Whether an ACU should be introduced and used alongside a common basket is contentious. According to Williamson (2005: 1) there is nothing to preclude the introduction and use of an ACU in the common basket system, but Eichengreen (2007) sees a major contradiction since a common basket in three reserve currencies would encourage use of these outside currencies in the region instead of the ACU. 33 with different rules for liberalization and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04207c43-074f-4473-87c6-688ce46c7484": {"__data__": {"id_": "04207c43-074f-4473-87c6-688ce46c7484", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42dd54b7aea9ca205ba5b310b2845cf5d3ad8595ebe4af93f1d681a79d796c42"}}, "hash": "42dd54b7aea9ca205ba5b310b2845cf5d3ad8595ebe4af93f1d681a79d796c42", "text": "regulation to be applied to each. They provided considerable leeway for restricting capital movements, particularly towards third parties. In fact, governments were required to have avail- able and be able to use certain policy instruments for the control of international capital movements and for the sterilization of their impact on domestic liquidity, and to have rules governing investment in money markets by non-residents, loans and credits unrelated to current transactions, net external positions of credit institutions, and reserve requirements for holdings by non-residents. In effect, until liberalization in the late 1980s the EMS operated under capital controls. The 1988 Directive prohibited restrictions among member countries and recommended that they should endeavour to attain the same degree of liberalization of capital movements with third countries. But recognizing that short-term international capital movements were capable of seri- ously disrupting the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies even when there was no appreciable diver- gence among countries in economic fundamentals, the Directive retained provisos concerning control over such capital movements during periods of financial strain. This was subject to authorization by the Commission, but the right to unilateral action was recognized in urgent cases. It was indeed exercised during the 1992-1993 turmoil by a number of countries, including Ireland, Portugal, and Spain. It is often argued that the main reason for the ac- celeration of the process of integration in Europe in the early 1990s towards full monetary union was because volatile capital flows made it very difficult to maintain parities (e.g., Park and Wyplosz 2007). Since this is not yet an option in Asia, any regional arrangement to stabilize intraregional and extraregional parities should be built on a common and effective capital account regime in the region. Even though the overall trend in East Asia has been towards greater capital account openness, there is still considerable disparity among countries regarding the regimes for non-resident and resident flows. Harmoniza- tion of these should seek considerable tightening of rules and regulations to be applied to capital flows with third countries, along the lines discussed in section D, above. By contrast, the East Asian countries, notably the ASEAN 5 countries plus China and Korea, can afford a greater degree of capital account openness among themselves than was the case in Europe during the first decade of the EMS. In this respect China could play a special role by making the yuan fully convertible within the region and hence promoting it as a regional reserve currency. The recent move by China to allow the yuan to be used as settlement currency with neighbouring countries (in- cluding ASEAN and Russia), partly triggered by problems caused by dollar instability for China\u2019s exporters, and a number of bilateral swaps that China\u2019s Central Bank has signed with countries inside and outside the region are important steps in the internationalization of the yuan (AsiaNews 2009). Such moves could be supplemented by opening Chinese financial markets to residents in other member countries, including those with weaker savings and payments positions, to tap its high savings through the so-called Panda bonds \u2212 a step that could also help develop regional bond markets for closer financial in- tegration and reduce the dollar-denominated external claims of China.103 Intra-regional lending and policy adjustment Maintaining currencies within agreed bands would call for, inter alia, occasional interventions in foreign exchange markets in both directions. Countries would be constrained in doing this when markets push down a currency towards the lower edge of the band. In the case where currencies are pegged to a common basket of three reserve currencies, intervention and stabilization would require adequate holding of or access to these currencies. The EMS did not incorporate a regional fund to sup- port countries having to intervene to keep their curren- cies within the grids. Rather, it relied on bilateral lending and borrowing between strong-currency countries (often Germany) and weak-currency countries. There were two types of intervention: intra-marginal and marginal. Intra- marginal interventions were carried out, often in dollars, by the country concerned at its own discretion, when its currency was within intervention points. But interven- tions had to be done jointly by both weak and strong- currency countries when a currency reached its bilateral intervention points, or by the strong-currency country making available unlimited amounts of a very short-term financing (VSTF) to the weak-currency country.104 Lend- ing and intervention by a strong-currency country were formally equivalent since reserves used in interventions were added to VSTF claims on the weak-currency country, and such claims had to be settled within 45 days. In the case of extension, the amount available was limited. 103 The ADB and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4bbc91f-f9d7-44b2-b2de-f31bc23affd2": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4bbc91f-f9d7-44b2-b2de-f31bc23affd2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc27ed665bbc215381d461d9d31e659bb15a1fbe0408099303462ba18b801767"}}, "hash": "cc27ed665bbc215381d461d9d31e659bb15a1fbe0408099303462ba18b801767", "text": "the World Bank IFC issued Panda bonds in 2005. China has recently given permission to two foreign banks to issue yuan-denominated bonds in Hong Kong for sale to overseas investors (Areddy 2009). Currently there are suggestions in China that the United States Government and the World Bank consider issuing yuan-denominated bonds in Hong Kong and Shanghai markets; see RGE Monitor (2009f). This would mean China lending foreigners in its own currency rather than in dollars, passing the exchange rate risk onto borrowers. 104 With the 1987 Basle-Nyborg agreement the VSTF was extended to intra-marginal interventions. 34 This VSTF did not have sufficient flexibility to provide breathing space for a country suffering from contagion. This was the case of France during the 1992- 1993 turmoil when its macroeconomic fundamentals did not justify the attack on its currency alongside the lira and pound sterling; indeed, tight German monetary policy was a main factor in the speculative attack on the French franc. Provisions for suspension of asset settlement ob- ligations for countries satisfying certain macroeconomic criteria linked to payments and fiscal positions and infla- tion would have certainly facilitated the stabilization of the French franc and prevented interest rate hikes and loss of jobs and incomes (UNCTAD TDR 1993: Part Two, chap. I). By contrast, the system left considerable discretion to strong-currency countries to opt out of their obligations to provide unlimited VSTF. This is what Germany eventu- ally did in 1992 for fear of inflationary consequences of its lending to countries under distress, thereby deepening the crisis. The EMS lacked symmetry in policy formulation and distribution of the burden of macroeconomic adjust- ment between weak and strong-currency countries. In fact, there were no clear guidelines for their respective re- sponsibilities for policy adjustment in the face of market pressures on parities. Hegemony by Germany was not al- ways balanced by its responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis other mem- bers. Its policies did not always pay enough attention to the overall macroeconomic conditions of the region and their possible adverse impact on other members. This, together with lack of effective intraregional financing and lender-of-last-resort facilities, often pushed the burden onto weak-currency countries. This was the price paid for the stabilization influence that Germany provided to countries lacking a similar degree of fiscal and monetary discipline and credibility. Moreover, German monetary policy had a deflationary bias, and was mainly responsible for sluggish growth and persistently high unemployment in the region as a whole \u2212 an approach now inherited by the European Central Bank. Multilateralization of regional credit lines would be necessary to avoid asymmetry. In this respect the move from Chiang Mai bilateral credit lines towards a regional monetary fund is a positive step in Asia. Furthermore, possible arrangements for guidelines for policy adjust- ment and conditions of access to an Asian fund should pay attention to shortcomings of the EMS as well as IMF lending practices to emerging markets in order to avoid deflationary and procyclical biases. This brings us to a final point about relative positions and responsibilities of members of a possible AMS among the developing countries of the region. It is sometimes argued that China is far too big for other developing countries to join in partnership \u2212 far bigger than Germany was relative to other European countries. This means that the terms of any agreement for regional monetary integration could be dictated by the needs of the Chinese economy, which may not always coincide with those of smaller and more advanced countries in the region. That China is likely to be more dominant than Germany ever was in Europe in shaping policies and prac- tices in an AMS is probably correct. But this is a matter of relative economic power, not existence or otherwise of formal agreements for monetary integration. China will wield considerable influence on policies in the region with or without an AMS. Under current trends, it can soon con- solidate its global position as an industrial powerhouse by becoming a major actor in the global financial system by moving to full convertibility and independent floating, making the yuan challenge the US dollar as the interna- tional reserve currency \u2212 possibly sooner than Chinese politicians are willing to accept and most observers ex- pect.105 This is likely to go through two stages: increasing the use of the yuan first in pricing and settlement of trade and financial transactions, and second in denomination of financial assets for lending and investment. As noted, China has already taken steps in both directions.

In this bargain they are in a better position than were weak-currency countries of Europe in that most of them have a good record of monetary and fiscal discipline and do not depend on the stabilizing influence of another central bank. 105 Empirical evidence indicates that the renminbi has been exerting significant impact on the exchange rates of the Asian currencies. It is also estimated, on the basis of a reserve currency model and counterfactual simulations, that the renminbi\u2019s potential as a reserve currency would be comparable to that of the Japanese yen and the British pound if it were to become fully convertible today; see Chen, Peng, and Shu (2009). 35 With increased integration of developing countries into the global trading system and international production networks, the exchange rate has gained additional importance in growth and development. The need to maintain stable and competitive exchange rates is further enhanced by loss of space in trade and industrial policies as a result of multilateral commitments in the WTO. How- ever, the ability of developing countries to achieve this has been greatly compromised by their closer integration into international financial markets and increased open- ness to inherently unstable capital flows. Maintaining stable and competitive exchange rates in most developing countries depends, inter alia, on how boom-bust cycles in capital flows are managed. An effective management should start in good times since options are quite limited under sudden stops and reversals. Failure to prevent surges in capital inflows and unsustainable currency appreciations do not simply lead to instability in exchange rates and balance-of-payments but also to virulent financial and economic crises with durable and severe consequences for jobs, incomes, and investment. However, the task has become particularly daunting since the most damaging swings in capital flows are caused by global factors beyond the control of devel- oping countries, notably by macroeconomic and financial conditions in major industrial countries, and there are no effective multilateral arrangements to discipline either policies in countries with disproportionately large impact on global financial conditions or financial markets. Management of exchange rates under free flow of capital faces serious dilemmas \u2212 even beyond that pre- dicted by the conventional impossible trinity. Monetary policy on its own is often quite powerless in influencing capital flows so as to stabilize the exchange rate even when all available instruments are used, particularly at times of sudden shifts in market sentiments. Currency market interventions designed to absorb a surge in capital inflows to avoid appreciations and to build self- defence against sudden stops and reversals by accumu- lating reserves are second-best policies because they are costly and their impact on domestic liquidity cannot always be fully neutralized. Nor can they prevent asset market bubbles and currency and maturity mismatches in private balance sheets. Under most circumstances regulation and control over capital flows would be necessary to prevent build- 7. Conclusion up of fragility. Standard prudential rules regarding capital charges, loan-loss provisions, and reserve and liquidity requirements can be extended and applied more rigor- ously and in a counter-cyclical fashion to foreign currency positions and transactions in the financial system with a view to reducing maturity and currency mismatches and exchange rate related credit risks. While useful and necessary, in most developing countries such measures would not be sufficient to prevent build-up of external fragility since not all foreign investment and borrowing are intermediated by financial institutions. Direct tools may need to be applied to prevent currency and maturity mismatches in private sector balance sheets. Easing or removing restrictions on resident outflows at a time of a surge in inflows to relieve the pressure on the currency carries the risk of opening the way to one-way traffic. Monetary policy would be quite ineffective at times of rapid exit of capital resulting from a sudden change of market sentiment for reasons beyond the control of the country concerned, such as the shocks and contagion caused by the current global financial turmoil triggered by widespread speculative lending and investment in major international financial centres.

In the absence of voluntary agreements by international creditors and investors to roll over their claims, unilateral temporary debt standstills and exchange restrictions may be the only viable option to check financial meltdown and economic contraction. For most developing countries intermediate exchange rate regimes, and particularly the BBC regime, provide the most viable option for combining a relatively high degree of stability with the flexibility needed for occasional adjustments in order to maintain competitive exchange rates. A successful pursuit of such a regime calls for a judicious combination of monetary policy adjust- ments, currency market interventions, and control over capital flows. Indeed, well aware of the risks of leaving the exchange rate to the whims of cross-border capital flows, most Asian developing countries have opted for interme- diate regimes in an effort to combine stability with flex- ibility against the orthodox advice to float independently and spare monetary policy for inflation targeting. They have been successful in maintaining relatively stable and competitive exchange rates and strong payments posi- tions, even though lack of adequate control over capital 36 inflows exposed their asset markets to adverse shifts in global financial conditions. By contrast, countries that chose free floating have been hit harder by the current international financial turmoil both because of unsustain- able appreciations and current account deficits, and the bursting of asset bubbles resulting from the earlier surge in capital inflows. In the absence of effective global arrangements to secure international monetary stability and difficulties in finding unilateral solutions, regional mechanisms pres- ent themselves as viable alternatives. This is particularly true for countries with close trade and investment links as in East Asia. Despite large stocks of international re- serves and strong payments positions, intraregional and extraregional exchange rates have been highly unstable in the region. This carries not only the risk of contagion but also the seeds of conflicts, particularly when global markets are shrinking. There is a strong economic case for establishing common currency arrangements with supporting institutions and mechanisms, including rules for policy coordination and adjustment, guidelines for capital account policies, and regional funds and lender- of-last-resort facilities. What is missing is not the need or the scope but the political will and solidarity. Perhaps current difficulties will provide an occasion for a common reflection for change before ever-growing international monetary and financial instability inflict irreparable dam- ages. 37 ADB (Asian Development Bank) (2005).

This report builds extensively upon prior work undertaken for the Policy study on Regional Mapping of Options to Promote Private Investments in Alternative Energy Sources for the Poor. The other two policy studies consist of Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific and Cross-Border Energy Trade and its Impacts on the Poor. The original study is the result of almost two years of evidence-based research and extensive consultations with experts to review the state of renewable energy options and to ensure that they can contribute to the sustainable economic growth, energy security, and poverty reduction goals of the Asia-Pacific countries. The research study was initiated in mid 2005 and completed by early 2007. The analysis and the discussions in this Report are based on the information that was available then (documented in volume I of the original study). Many people have contributed directly and indirectly to this collaborative effort. The original research study, including the six national assessments and respective case-studies (documented in volumes II to VII of the original study), was undertaken by Winrock International under a study commissioned by UNDP/ REP-PoR. We appreciate the work of the Winrock International, ably led by the principal researcher, Bikash Pandey. We also acknowledge the contributions of the team that supported the lead researcher, including Jerome Weingart, Soma Dutta, Ellen Bomasang- Son and Chris Greacen. We appreciate the work of the country leads in Bangladesh (Lutfiyah Ahmed, Suman Basnet, Mohammed Khalequzzaman, Hasna Khan and Firoz Mallick), Cambodia (Sierra Fletcher and Curtis Hundley), Indonesia (Conrado Heruela, Bernard Castermans, PELANGI), Nepal (Suman Basnet, Yuba Raj Adhikari, Bharat Poudel, Karuna Sharma), Solomon Islands (Herbert A. Wade and Kenneth Bukehite) and Philippines (Conrado Heruela and Cristina Cayetano) for their data gathering and analysis. We acknowledge the first round of bibliography support by Fay Ellis, Anita Khuller and Mallika Aryl. We express our appreciation to the individuals who participated in interviews, group discussions and questionnaires as part of the research undertaken for this work. These individuals are too numerous to mention by name, but include employees of government ministries, schools and clinics, energy companies, research organizations and, of course, members of the communities in which the case studies were conducted. The analytical structure and conceptualization of the report was developed by the REP- PoR team in the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok, comprising Nandita Mongia (Team Leader),Thiyagarajan Velumail, Thomas Jensen, Bhava Dhungana and Sooksiri Chamsuk. The report and study underwent several reviews including sessions of technical committee feedback from experts and external partners [the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), the South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE) and the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT)], as well as several UNDP in-house consultations. Candid views and constructive suggestions helped to significantly improve the report. In particular, we would like to thank Kamal Rijal, Pranesh Chandra Saha and Ram Shrestha for their timely suggestions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63816df4-0916-4495-99d9-b798f27cac5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "63816df4-0916-4495-99d9-b798f27cac5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa9a5447855192e78161a34280a40480233a6de6ef1d376482cc492ec4db1297"}, "2": {"node_id": "9535c7f9-a820-42c4-bf8e-5712671dac99", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e76699671acc6abe29163d820052d9dc70b47f2d7f76a4dd8bb4b0ed5a53eebb"}}, "hash": "30f4d9a503e7aff6832c4f27f7aca21d317c67feee445acee096d63ba7ea026b", "text": "We acknowledge the advice provided by K.

individuals in return for cash from lenders andinvestors. The borrower pays interest to the lender or investor throughout the life of the bond. Borrowers seeking funds from the public through bond issues and spell out the details in a prospectus available from stock markets, banks etc. Bonds are generally medium to long-term fixed-interest securities. Bond market Bond market is the market for trading bonds. Bond trading is carried out by phone and computer by organizations such as professional bond brokers and dealers, banks, investment banks and life assurance companies. Corporate financing Corporate financing refers to financing a company where lenders would have full recourse to all assets and revenues of that company rather than only the project account. It is also term as balance sheet financing. Lenders in a corporate financing arrangement look to the cash flow and assets of the entire company to service the debt and to provide security. Consumer financing Consumer financing is a loan made available to individuals, generally through hire purchase, personal loans, credit cards and other similar arrangements. It is also called consumer credit. Debentures Debentures are a type of fixed-interest security issued by borrowing companies in return for medium and longterm finance. Debenture-holders\u2019 funds are invested with the borrowing company as secured loans, with the security usually in the form of a fixed or floating charge over the assets of the borrowing company. Debentures are issued for fixed periods but can be sold before maturity at a discount. Debt financing Debt financing refers to funds loaned to the project company by financiers such as commercial banks, insurance and pension funds and multinational institutions. Financiers receive payments for principal and interest on the loans whether the company makes or loses money. Equity financing Equity financing refers to funds put into the project company by shareholders of the company. Equity holders are owners of the company and they receive a return on their equity investment based on net profit as dividends as well as capital gains. VI Mezzanine finance Mezzanine finance is a borrowing that falls between straight debt and equity, such as subordinated debt or equitylinked bond issues. Mezzanine debt generally has a higher risk and potential return than senior debt but a lower risk and potential return than equity. It is often provided by specialist investors in mezzanine finance such as venture capital funds or leveraged buy-out funds. Microfinance The definition of microfinance covers all mechanisms to provide financial services to the poor that includes microcredit, microsavings, micro-insurance and money transfer. Preferred shares Shares which rank ahead of ordinary shares for the purposes of claiming dividend payments or any assets of the company should it be liquidated. Preferred shares rank behind debentures. Project financing Project financing refers to financing for any particular type of project viewed as assets of the project company. In such arrangements, the project\u2019s assets and its cash flow secure the debt and lenders do not have recourse to other assets of the company. Refinancing Refinancing refers to applying for a secured loan intended to replace an existing loan secured by the same assets. Refinancing may be undertaken to reduce interest costs (by refinancing at a lower rate), to pay off other debts, to reduce one\u2019s periodic payment obligations (sometimes by taking a longer-term loan), to reduce risk (such as by refinancing from a variable-rate to a fixed- rate loan) and/or to liquidate some or all of the equity that has accumulated in real property during the tenure of ownership. Senior debt Debt ranked ahead of other debt. It has priority if debt has to be redeemed in cases of liquidation. Subordinate debt A type of debt which ranks behind other debts should a company be liquidated. Typical providers of subordinated debt are major shareholders or a parent company. Subordinated debt offers advantages similar to increased capital but with greater flexibility in that the subordinated debt can be repaid fairly easily. Venture capital Venture capital is capital provided by outside investors for financing of new, growing or struggling businesses. Venture capital investments generally are high risk investments but offer the potential for above average returns. 1 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Executive Summary Energy is the invisible element in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

A world in which over a third of the human population lives in poverty is neither equitable nor just, nor is it likely to be sustainable. Access to reliable, affordable, high-quality energy services makes it possible for the poor to increase incomes and obtain better education and health services. It also provides the energy underpinning of the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector which is the engine of economic development in both developing and developed countries. While the source of the energy service may be unimportant to the poor, renewables are a subset of the options for producing modern forms of the energy that is needed as an input to increased and diversified incomes. Poverty is a complex human condition, defined in many ways. The human development index (HDI) and the human poverty index (HPI) developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provide consistent statistical measures of overall human development. However, some of the central components of poverty are missing from or inadequately captured in the indices. Among these is the lack of or difficulty in gaining access to infrastructure including energy services. Trying to evaluate the impact on poverty of access to services derived from renewable energy (RE) and to renewable energy technologies (RETs) is very difficult because poverty reduction is the consequence of many factors and many inputs to communities and families and individuals. We show through examples that there are several ways in which availability of RETs and RE-derived energy services results in increased income, better health, improved education and knowledge, and so forth. What is more difficult to demonstrate is a clear causal link between expanded availability and use of renewables and improved conditions among the poor. We know that the relatively better off among the poor have resources that permit some access to modern energy services in many cases, while people living in extreme poverty typically do not, unless they happen to be in communities that help to provide access to vital services to their poorest members. For this reason, scaling up access and scaling up the use of renewables, within the context of expanded access, are considered as separate but related goals by, for example, the World Bank. As noted in a recent study, \u201c...if the primary objective is to meet the energy needs of the unserved and underserved populations, neither the optimal solution nor the most equitable solutions will be found if their energy options are restricted to renewable sources ...\u201d (Ramani and Heijndermans 2003). This study reviewed the role of private sector investment and financing for renewable energy technologies in meeting the needs of the poor. It was organized along two tracks: (a) the role of renewable energy in enhancing the security of modern energy services for the poor; and (b) the contribution of renewable energy technologies to progress towards achieving the MDGs. Trends in renewable energy investment were identified both globally and regionally. Policies, programmes and initiatives in the region were examined to assess their effectiveness in increasing investment in renewable energy. Specific studies were carried out in six countries to understand if that investment was able to increase access to modern energy services for the poor and to assess its contribution to reducing income and human poverty, as well as to the environment. The major findings of this study are that substantial investment is taking place in both production capacity for renewable energy equipment and in renewable energy projects worldwide but mainly in the rich countries of the North and a few large, developing countries such as China and India. The investment is principally focused on grid-based renewables and biofuels and is driven by concerns about energy security, the rising price of oil and, increasingly, climate change. In most developing countries in the Asia and Pacific region, other than in China and India, total investment in renewables \u201cPoverty is the absence of all human rights. The frustrations, hostility and anger generated by abject poverty cannot sustain peace in any society. For building stable peace we must find ways to provide opportunities for people to live decent lives.\u201d Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Nobel Lecture, Oslo, 10 December 2006 2 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences has been modest and has not been able to make a significant impact on poverty reduction.

UNDP has several financial and technical assistance instruments available that can support pathbreaking initiatives which in turn can lead to larger-scale renewable energy production and project investment and lending by the multilateral development banks, host countries, and industry. They include two Thematic Trust Funds, namely Energy and Environment for Sustainable Development, earmarked for US$100 million over four years starting in 2007, and Poverty Reduction which are now available to support the expanded application of renewable energy for poverty alleviation and development. Several low income countries have been able to increase the number of off-grid renewables, such as solar home systems (SHSs) and household biogas units, quite significantly through public- private partnerships. For the first time outside China, coverage of those technologies has begun to reach tens of thousands of households; in a few cases coverage has reached 5 percent of a country\u2019s rural households. Private-sector companies have developed the modalities for supply and maintenance support to those systems. However, the technologies have not been able to reach the poor or significantly increase the incomes of users. Community-based energy systems, often using microhydropower, have been able to provide energy services more equitably and also provide sufficient power for productive end-uses. Scaling up the community-based model and others that have demonstrated the use of energy for specific livelihood enhancement applications remains a challenge. In the evolution of off-grid renewables, a range of technological solutions is now sufficiently developed such that reliable and competitively priced energy systems, including packages for specific applications, are widely available. This is the outcome of a development process that started seriously in the 1970s and continues to this day. The commercialization models developed in the last decade have demonstrated how to get systems to large numbers of purchasers through a public-private investment model. The challenge now for development organizations is to integrate the technologies into income-generation and livelihood programmes to reduce poverty and to meet other MDGs. The report suggests how an appropriate agenda might be set for this in the coming years. Investment trends At the global level, private investment in RETs is the fastest growing among all energy sectors. Investment in RETs increased by close to 27 percent in 2004-2005, compared with 2-3 percent for fossil-fuel-based power generation and large hydropower projects. In absolute terms as well, investments are large with around US$38 billion invested in RETs in 2005 (REN21 2005). Roughly one dollar in four invested in the power sector in 2005 was invested in a RET. In 2006 and 2007 investments in RETs were around US$55 billion and US$71 billion (REN21 2008). Biofuels represent another area that has seen rapid growth in recent years. Ethanol production from sugar increased 8 percent worldwide in 2005, while biodiesel production grew 66 percent, albeit from a much smaller base. There were around US$16 billion of sales of ethanol and another US$1 billion of biodiesel in the same year. Much of the increased investment in RETs and biofuels has been concentrated in countries that are member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and in the larger developing countries, mainly China, India, and Brazil. Investments in RETs and bioenergy in OECD countries are driven by concerns about climate change and the need to meet Kyoto targets, as well as a desire to diversify energy supply sources away from overdependence on petroleum fuels. More recently, the high price of petroleum has become an important driver for increased investment in the production and use of RETs and biofuels. Although the growth in RET investment in developing countries has been at half the global rate, it is at historically high levels. The growth rate could accelerate and catch up with global rates as larger developing countries, particularly China and India, have started investing heavily in the two fastest- growing RETs, wind power and solar PV, in the last few years. So far, investment in developing countries has been dominated by small hydropower and biomass generation projects. Although grid- connected renewables account for much of the investment volume, in China there is large-scale investment in solar-powered water heating and the country is now the largest producer and user of solar water-heaters in the world by far. 3 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences The success of the larger developing countries in increasing the percentage of renewable power on their grids is being replicated in a small number of other developing countries in the Asian and Pacific region", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbc57efb-9920-4013-b9ec-573c04ec20c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbc57efb-9920-4013-b9ec-573c04ec20c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bb64b1bfb9254cee3a18e755e924f88cf919079a521cf7c84bb8562a6d93c79"}}, "hash": "5bb64b1bfb9254cee3a18e755e924f88cf919079a521cf7c84bb8562a6d93c79", "text": "that have established enabling regulatory and investment environments, such as standard power purchase agreements (PPAs), feed-in tariffs, net metering and the availability of bank financing for both producers and users of RE equipment. However, investment in RETs is very uneven in the region, with many of the smaller and less able countries lagging far behind the leaders in attracting such investment. The same is true for investment in biofuels. Several renewable energy implementation models introduced in relatively poor South Asian countries have provided successful examples of the scaling up of off-grid RETs such as SHSs, household biogas units and community based microhydropower. In almost all cases, the existing markets are the result of public-private partnerships. Public investments are used to provide a partial subsidy, to enforce standards and to leverage quality control. The private sector provides the technology under warranty, as well as repair and maintenance services. Users typically pay 50-80 percent of the cost of the systems and also bear the cost of repair and maintenance. The models began with household biogas in Nepal and SHSs in Nepal and Sri Lanka, and now Bangladesh, and have been shown to be sufficiently robust to be effective in other countries as well. The challenge is to build on robust technologies and supply mechanisms and to make use of those technologies to reduce poverty. Poverty impacts of RETs Renewable energy technologies that are being widely disseminated through market mechanisms as described above have had a positive impact on education and health status, gender issues and on the environment. Yet they are seldom able to increase the incomes of users. This limits their take- up to the more wealthy rural elite for whom their benefits are related to consumption rather than production. For the poor to make use of those technologies, they would have to become affordable by contributing to higher incomes. As some examples below show, access to a small amount of reliable modern energy has allowed some people living in poverty to lease or own small RE systems. Investment in grid-connected renewables in most Asian and Pacific countries contributes to poverty reduction by supplying power to often overloaded grids. Employment in the region is largely generated by agriculture and by SMEs that require reliable and affordable power from the grid to operate efficiently and profitably. This is one of the most important links between renewable energy technology and increased incomes for the poor. Adding lower-cost power on the grid from RETs at prices isolated from petroleum prices lowers the risks of higher energy prices and improves availability of power as petroleum prices increase. Most developing countries are perpetually short of investment for grid power. This results in regular brownouts with high costs to SMEs, hurting their profitability and limiting their ability to expand and create employment. Farmers\u2019 incomes suffer when there is insufficient power on the grid to operate pumps for groundwater irrigation during planting and other periods of high irrigation demand. Sufficient power availability on the grid is also a precondition to expansion of rural electrification. A number of studies have shown the positive impacts of access to grid power in terms of poverty reduction and meeting of MDGs. The poor can often benefit significantly from the manufacture of some of the renewable energy equipment and devices, even if opportunities available to increase incomes from their use are limited. Off-grid renewables tend to be labour-intensive in their production, as well as in their sale and repair. Moreover, many of the skills required for manufacturing, installing, and repairing some of the equipment can be easily mastered by poor people with little training and education. Improved cook stoves (ICSs) are largely manufactured by artisans as a small enterprise, while biogas units are built by masons from within user communities. Some of the grid-intertied renewables also provide opportunities to increase the income of the poor on the generation side. This is particularly true of rice husk and other biomass-based electricity generation projects where the raw material is often grown by poor farmers. However, despite this potential, farmers have not always been able to take advantage of those opportunities. Examples in Thailand suggest that farmers are receiving no benefits from the newly-found use of rice husks to generate power that is sold to the grid. The high global demand for biofuels in light of higher petroleum prices points to opportunities to increase employment for the rural poor in countries that can grow sugar cane and oil seeds. Here, too, the risk is that the high demand will give rise to corporate plantation farms where farmers will be reduced to selling their labour.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58f91423-649d-4fbe-9ba5-58b1f180e3ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "58f91423-649d-4fbe-9ba5-58b1f180e3ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6584070ed897b262825955dfa8ddd88da010c7aee938000871d0a54f0a2c4b90"}}, "hash": "6584070ed897b262825955dfa8ddd88da010c7aee938000871d0a54f0a2c4b90", "text": "Moreover, the need for high efficiency in production, harvesting and processing of sugar cane and oil-seed crops reduces employment opportunities for the poor, as has already happened in the most efficient sugar cane industries in, for example, Brazil and Australia. 4 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Despite the successful models of commercialization leading the way to sales of large numbers of off-grid RETs, few of the purchasers of SHSs and biogas are among the poor. Moreover, only a small number of purchasers have been able to use the systems to increase income and generate employment. Again, were the technologies able to generate higher incomes, they would become affordable for the poor and there have been some examples of successful initiatives where access to RETs has increased the incomes of users. However, adopting those examples on a larger scale has proved to be difficult since some of the other elements in the production value chain differ among communities and are often absent. It is proposed that UNDP and the development community at large make a concerted effort to link income generation into a broad range of enterprises that span agriculture, SMEs, crafts supported by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and so on. Renewable energy technologies are now of much higher quality and private sector modalities for supplying systems to large numbers of people are in place so that such a movement can be launched. Promising avenues for promoting the use of RETs to increase the incomes of the poor could include: (a) promotion of microfinance institutions as on-the-ground integrators of energy inputs into income-generation activities, especially if those institutions are already financing both income-generating enterprises and energy systems; (b) linking up with NGOs, Governments and bilateral and multilateral institutions engaged in initiatives focused on increasing the incomes of the poor to introduce energy services into poverty reduction programmes where they can add value; (c) linking up with SME-promotion programmes to identify where renewable energy might make a contribution; (d) strengthening private sector vendors of RETs to be able to respond to demands for applying RETs to income-generating activities; and (e) extending community- based microhydropower systems as multifunction platforms to many countries in Asia and the Pacific for productive end uses of energy. Investment drivers The main drivers for investment in RETs and biofuels in developing countries of the Asia and Pacific region are concerns about national energy security and the recent very high prices of petroleum. The countries that are most linked to global fuel markets have taken the biggest steps on the energy security front by investing in RETs. The supportive regulatory environment they have put in place follows from commitments many of those countries have made for meeting a certain percentage of their energy needs from renewable energy sources. Asian countries with renewable energy targets are Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. In addition to energy security, it is likely that concerns about local environmental pollution are also partially responsible for increased investment in renewable energy technologies, particularly in China. Although it cannot yet be considered a major driver, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is increasingly being used to improve somewhat the cost competitiveness of RET investments in developing countries. Through refinements in the programmatic CDM, many small renewable energy initiatives can be combined to reduce overhead costs and to leverage higher emission credit prices than if the projects had to be considered individually. This is an area that is under rapid development but is not yet mature, with methodologies still to be fully agreed upon. The commitment to achievement of the MDGs has not so far had a major impact on investment in renewable energy in most Asian and Pacific countries. Several countries have targets for universal electrification, which they intend to meet partially with renewables. Other countries have promoted renewables to meet local environmental challenges such as deforestation and pollution. However, the links between renewables and MDGs, while clearly demonstrated in many individual cases, has not been strongly supported in national programmes. A recent study on the impact of rising oil prices on the poor (UNDP 2007) presents four scenarios for oil prices through the year 20151. Countries that are most linked to the global petroleum economy have already set targets for RETs and biofuels and are encouraging investment in those sectors under the baseline scenario. They are likely to continue to accelerate investment in RETs in all scenarios except if oil prices were to come down drastically and stay at those levels.

However, for other countries where governance problems are significant, such as Cambodia and Solomon Islands, the peak oil scenario will have to occur before countries overcome their paralysis and put in the necessary policies and regulations and take the steps needed to attract investment. Countries that depend on imported diesel to a large extent to produce electricity, such as many Pacific island economies which are virtually 100 percent dependent on diesel generation and Sri Lanka (56 percent), suffer increases in power tariffs when petroleum prices rise. They should have 5 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences the strongest incentives to invest in RETs. The first reaction of countries that have access to other fossil fuels is to invest in exploration of those fuels. Bangladesh and Pakistan will invest in new natural gas fields and they may also move to coal, as Indonesia appears to be doing. Except for Malaysia, countries with fossil fuel reserves have generally been slow in attracting investment into RETs and biofuels. Countries with a large kerosene subsidy burden for rural lighting are likely to invest in scaling up of RET access. They will also look to investment from donor countries for much of the production and use of off-grid RETs. Barriers to investment in RETs and access for the poor There continue to be two distinct sets of barriers to the growth of renewable energy in developing countries of the Asian and Pacific region, as elsewhere. The first set prevents sufficient private investment being attracted to RETs. The fundamental barriers in this regard include: (a) lack of awareness of the technologies and their applications among users and policy makers; and (b) lack of understanding of the sustainability aspects of installed systems. An obstacle to private sector investment in pro-poor, renewable-energy-based systems is that earning an adequate profit on that investment is difficult if not impossible. Sustainability requires technical capability to operate, maintain and repair systems but it also requires profitability. This is both an issue of technical knowledge and of having mechanisms for collecting adequate resources from users, as well as from governments and donor partners, to meet operational and maintenance costs. In most countries there is some understanding of what can be termed \u201cfirst-generation barriers\u201d and how to overcome them, at least for some of the RETs. Those countries have had successful government-sponsored or donor-funded programmes, which have resulted in sustainable applications of RETs through a number of rounds of trial and error. Most Asian and Pacific countries today have active, private sector RET suppliers of good quality systems that are able to maintain them. However, this is not universally the case, especially among the smaller Pacific island countries, as well as countries such as Cambodia and Afghanistan that are emerging from conflict. In such countries, sustainable energy systems of high quality are hard to find and internal markets remain too small to support a technology base for RETs. A few Asian and Pacific countries have also been able to overcome \u201csecond-generation barriers\u201d that stand in the way of scaling up investment in RETs to supply large numbers of rural users with both equipment and modern energy services. The successful countries have been able to establish private sector suppliers that can respond to a significant increase in demand from users. They have also been able to stimulate substantial demand for RET systems from users. The principal obstacles to scaling up RETs include lack of confidence in the market on the part of suppliers and lack of confidence in product quality and long-term product support on the part of consumers. A shortage of suitable supplier, dealer and end-user financing to support meaningful scale-up is also a handicap. Countries that have been successful in bringing about a substantial scaling up in RET investment have developed modalities for a public-private partnership that typically provides for quality standards, subsidies and financing for off-grid systems. For grid-connected renewable energy systems, the main barriers to scale-up are the absence of clear government or utility policies on feed-in tariffs and net metering, and standard power purchase agreements which have faced some resistance. Another common barrier is the inability to obtain loans from banks for financing systems. Countries that have been able to attract private investment into grid-connected renewable energy systems, such as wind, small hydropower, biomass-based and geothermal have put in place clear policies and related tariff structures and have also developed mechanisms to provide credit to investors and developers. Insufficient financing often stands in the way", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0c1fd9a-3d1f-4a24-a07d-157a2118133d": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0c1fd9a-3d1f-4a24-a07d-157a2118133d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "055fc81c8c2e84df9b49aabd5fd960b08218100e96da6390e394d9238beac786"}}, "hash": "055fc81c8c2e84df9b49aabd5fd960b08218100e96da6390e394d9238beac786", "text": "of the poor gaining access to renewables, even in those countries where the first and second generation barriers mentioned earlier have been addressed. The high cost of good-quality renewable energy systems as well as lack of financing stands in the way of the poor gaining access to renewable energy equipment and RE-derived energy services. Furthermore, opportunities for the poor to increase their incomes directly through the use of energy services are limited as they often lack the necessary knowledge and resources to do so. Such obstacles can collectively be thought of as \u201cthird-generation barriers\u201d to adoption of renewable energy technologies. There are a number of pilot programmes in countries in Asia and the Pacific that illustrate how to this set of barriers may be overcome. But addressing those issues on a country-wide scale requires focused attention and commitment on the part of both Governments and civil society, aided by development partners. 6 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences The way forward Developing countries in the Asia and Pacific region need support to increase investment in renewable energy for greater energy security and reduced vulnerability to oil price increases, as well as to meet MDG targets. Global trends indicate that much of this investment will come from the private sector, often as the result of public-private partnerships. In light of global experience, including the experience of the larger countries of the region, the way forward for those developing countries might be as follows: a) Create the environment for increased investment in grid-connected RETs. Most countries in the Asia and Pacific region have largely untapped renewable energy resources. Countries that have achieved the largest investment volumes also have transparent and well-advertised mechanisms, such as feed-in tariffs and standard power purchase agreements, for connecting small generators to the grid. They also have financial organizations that provide credit on a project finance basis. Those are essential elements of an enabling environment for attracting private investment and public-private partnerships. b) Increase investment in biofuels but with caution. Domestic biofuels production can improve energy security for countries with large agricultural sectors or for landlocked or island states where the supply of petroleum fuels is irregular and expensive. Bioenergy crops can also generate rural employment but developing countries in the Asian and Pacific region need to understand the trade-off between energy farming and food security better. They also need support in developing models for farming bioenergy crops that are beneficial to communities particularly to ensure that local farmers obtain a fair and equitable share of the benefits. The social and environmental impacts of truly large- scale biofuels production are inadequately understood and they can be quite serious. c) Expand models for the commercialization of RETs for households and make them more accessible to the poor. Government officials and prospective private sector investors need to take lessons from the market-based expansion of RETs such as SHSs, biogas and ICSs in countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka that have seen rapid expansion of those markets. While the World Bank has already undertaken significant initiatives in this area, it should consider investing in those models even more widely across the region as could the Asian Development Bank (ADB). d) Replicate scale-up of community-based energy systems. Although community-based RETs such as microhydropower have been shown to provide reliable and low-cost energy in an equitable manner in a number of countries in Asia and the Pacific, the models have not been scaled up to their full potential. Approaches such as the Renewable Energy Development Programme (REDP) in Nepal and the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) in Pakistan are slowly being replicated in other countries in the region. This replication needs to be accelerated, ultimately on a vast scale, so that hundreds of thousands of communities that could benefit from those systems can do so. e) Develop a global alliance to integrate renewable energy for productive end uses. RETs must be used for generating income for the poor, if they are to become affordable. The RET community needs to form a global alliance with the larger development community to integrate energy into non- energy development projects and entry points need to be found to integrate energy into wider poverty reduction programmes. The pioneering efforts of Grameen Shakti and other organizations that have promoted productive end uses alongside sales of RETs need to be replicated widely. f) Increase the use of renewable energy for high-value public services. There is much room for expanding the use of RETs in powering high-value public services (vaccine refrigeration, telecommunications, distance learning and Internet connectivity). An example is the rural health posts and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9dcdcc07-8f72-4241-b3c8-dd06ccb41ec7": {"__data__": {"id_": "9dcdcc07-8f72-4241-b3c8-dd06ccb41ec7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f75f72065ef5b9b13e548952c2b2988a58753c5006619e4ab692a9cf1de9107"}}, "hash": "7f75f72065ef5b9b13e548952c2b2988a58753c5006619e4ab692a9cf1de9107", "text": "clinics in the developing world, which are almost all without electricity and therefore limited in the services that can be provided. The participation of the private sector in providing some of those services can be increased in the interests of sustainability. The best examples are telephony and Internet connectivity services provided by the private sector for a fee. g) Increase availability of RET finance. Banks and microfinance institutions throughout the Asian and Pacific region need to be encouraged and trained to provide financing for RETs. Finance must be made available not just to suppliers of modern energy services but also to the enterprises that will use the energy to generate income and provide employment. Financing institutions need to be encouraged to play a coordinating role to foster integration of energy inputs and income-generating activities at the enterprise and household levels. 7 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences h) Strengthen the role of carbon financing for RETs. The CDM executive board needs to be encouraged to provide preferential treatment for RET projects with a high MDG impact by simplifying the baseline and monitoring methodologies. This will reduce transaction costs and make it attractive for many developers to pursue RET projects under the CDM. In order to give priority to projects with high impacts on MDGs, indicators need to be developed to assess this and a methodology for monitoring such projects needs to be developed as well. The use of programmatic CDM initiatives to facilitate establishment of evolving portfolios of small renewable energy projects and programmes should be encouraged by the CDM executive board, the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and associated agencies. This will lower the transaction costs for such projects and should result in enhanced prices for carbon emission reduction credits. i) Changes in project monitoring procedures. In most RET programmes monitoring systems are not designed to capture poverty and gender-specific impacts. Project planning and monitoring protocols that are sensitive to those impacts need to be developed further and their widespread use encouraged. Such protocols could also be used by socially conscious buyers of carbon credits to pay higher prices for Certified Emission Reduction (CER) units from projects that also score high in terms of the MDGs. Endnotes 1The \u201cbaseline\u2019 scenario assumes prices remaining at an average of around US$70. A second \u201csupply shock\u201d scenario has oil prices rising to $100 and beyond in the short to medium term and declining to the baseline US$70 in the long term. A third \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenario shows oil prices rising gradually to US$100 per barrel as supply peaks and then increasing expo- nentially thereafter. The last scenario, \u201cenergy security\u201d, assumes reduced oil demand as a result of energy and environmental concerns with oil prices falling from the baseline value to US$50 per barrel in the medium term, remaining constant thereafter. The scenarios were defined during the study period 2006\u25002008. 9 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences United Nations Millennium Project, available at www.unmillenniumproject.org Background On 8 September 2000, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration (A/RES/55/2) and established the Millennium Development Goals. As a recent report on progress towards achievement of the MDGs in Asia and the Pacific noted, the absolute size of social and economic deprivation remains enormous. Two thirds of Asians or a total of 1.5 billion people are still without access to basic sanitation and the region has nearly three times as many underweight children and people living on less than one dollar a day as sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America combined [United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) 2007]. Even though access to modern energy services was not included as a separate goal, it is widely acknowledged that addressing the energy and poverty linkage is essential if the MDGs are to be attained. Access to reliable, affordable, high-quality energy services helps make it possible for the poor to increase their incomes and benefit from better education and health services.

Consequently the links between modern energy services and reduction of poverty are often indirect. Both direct and indirect links are discussed in this report. The global energy-poverty discourse The interest in renewables in the 1970s was driven by the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979, fears of depletion of fossil fuels reserves and other price-related pressures. Many national Governments launched research and development programmes and projected optimistic scenarios about what renewables could or should contribute in the years to come. There was resurgence in interest in the 1990s, the main drivers being environmental pressures, particularly climate change, and the loss of faith in nuclear energy as a desirable alternative to fossil fuels. Since publication of the Brundtland Report in 1989, sustainable development2 represents an impor- tant element in the political debate on future environmental, economic and societal development. The work of the Brundtland Commission led directly to the United Nations Conference on Environ- ment and Development (UNCED) held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Energy was viewed primarily as an environmental issue, particularly in the context of climate change. It was discussed in the Agen- da 21, one of the principal non-binding intergovernmental outcomes of UNCED, which highlighted the fact that current levels of energy consumption and production are not sustainable, especially if demand continues to increase. Agenda 21 stressed the importance of using energy resources in a way that is consistent with protection of human health, the atmosphere and the natural environment. 1. Introduction The MDGs are the world\u2019s time-bound and quantified targets for addressing extreme poverty in its many dimensions \u2013 income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter and exclusion \u2013 while promoting gender equality, education and environmental sustainability. They are also basic human rights the rights of each person on the planet to health, education, shelter and security. 10 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences An important milestone in the development debate took place in 2000 when leaders from across the world adopted the Millennium Development Goals. It initially appeared to be a setback for the energy sector that energy did not feature in the MDGs as a separate goal. The omission has however started a fresh debate on the energy-poverty linkage and it is increasingly being recognized that addressing that linkage is going to be a critical factor in the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals [see Table 1-1 below and Department for International Development (DFID) 2002]. Specifically: The goal of halving poverty by 2015 cannot be reached without energy inputs to increase production, income and education; to create jobs; and to reduce the daily grind involved in survival; \u2022 Halving hunger will not come about without energy for more productive growing, harvesting, processing and marketing of food; \u2022 Improving health and reducing death rates will not happen without energy for the refrigeration needed for clinics, hospitals and vaccination campaigns; \u2022 Acute respiratory infection, the major cause of infant mortality, cannot be checked until the smoke from cooking fires in rural homes is reduced; \u2022 Universal primary education will remain a distant dream unless children have light in their homes to study in the evenings; \u2022 Clean water will not be pumped or treated without energy; \u2022 Rural women cannot be empowered until such time that they are freed from the onerous tasks of fuelwood and water collection; and \u2022 Poor communities will remain most vulnerable to global warming because they lack the resources to cope with crises resulting from climate change. Energy, which is a derived demand, provides a wide range of services that can have a positive impact on enhancing the livelihoods of people and reducing poverty. UNDP has been at the forefront of this discussion, and has been advocating the adoption of a new global target for energy as a prerequisite to fulfilling other international development targets of the MDGs. The proposed target is to halve the proportion of people without access to clean and affordable fuels and electricity by 2015 (Ramani 2003). Increasing interest in the expanded use of renewable energy was also demonstrated in the Group of Eight (G8) Renewable Energy Task Force Report issued in 2001, which stressed the need to give priority to efforts to develop renewable energy markets, particularly in the industrialized countries. The underlying expectation was that this would lead to a decrease in costs and thus open the way for use of renewable energy in developing countries. The ninth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) in 2001 was an important landmark in the energy-poverty debate.

The Governments of the world concluded: \u201cTo implement the goal accepted by the international community to halve the proportion of people living on less than US$1 per day by 2015, access to affordable energy services is a prerequisite\u201d3. The follow-up international event, the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), held in 2002, brought discussions on energy to the centre of the global development debate. The WSSD gave new impetus to global action to fight poverty and protect the environment. The agenda for sustainable development was broadened, emphasizing particularly the linkages among poverty, the environment and the use of natural resources. The following important commitments related to energy and the environment were made at the summit (World Bank 2004): Access to energy \u2013 Improve access to reliable, affordable, economically viable, socially acceptable and environmentally sound energy services and resources, sufficient to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, including the goal of halving the proportion of people in poverty by 2015 Renewable energy \u2013 Diversify energy supply and substantially increase the global share of renewable energy sources in order to increase its contribution to total energy supply. 11 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Energy efficiency \u2013 Establish domestic programmes for energy efficiency with the support of the international community. Accelerate the development and dissemination of energy efficiency and energy conservation technologies, including the promotion of research and development. Energy markets \u2013 Remove market distortions, including through the restructuring of taxes and the phasing out of harmful subsidies. Support efforts to improve the functioning, transparency, and information about energy markets with respect to both supply and demand, with the aim of achieving greater stability and ensuring consumer access to energy services. An outcome of the WSSD was the adoption of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI) in which energy was addressed in the context of sustainable development. The JPOI stressed that access to reliable and affordable energy services facilitates the eradication of poverty and made specific recommendations on energy access to facilitate the achievement of the MDGs and established a clear link between energy and the eradication of poverty. The importance of producing, distributing and consuming energy services in ways that support sustainable development is also emphasized in relation to changing patterns of production and consumption as well as protecting and managing the natural resource base. The JPOI aims to promote the integration of the three components of sustainable development \u2013 economic development, social development and environmental protection \u2013 as interdependent and mutually reinforcing pillars. Among other things, the JPOI calls for action to: \u2022\ufffd Improve access to reliable, affordable, economically viable, socially acceptable and environmentally sound energy services; \u2022\ufffd Recognize that energy services have positive impacts on poverty eradication and the improvement of standards of living; \u2022\ufffd Develop and disseminate alternative energy technologies with the aim of giving a greater share of the energy mix to renewable energy and, with a sense of urgency, substantially increase the global share of renewable energy sources; \u2022\ufffd Diversify energy supply by developing advanced, cleaner, more efficient and cost- effective energy technologies; \u2022\ufffd Combine a range of energy technologies, including advanced and cleaner fossil fuel technologies, to meet the growing need for energy services; \u2022\ufffd Accelerate the development, dissemination and deployment of affordable and cleaner energy efficiency and energy conservation technologies, as well as the transfer of such technologies to developing countries; and \u2022\ufffd Take action, where appropriate, to phase out subsidies in this area that inhibit sustainable development. The WSSD also saw the launch of many partnerships between industrialized and developing countries to promote sustainable development with a focus on energy. In relation to energy, a total of 39 partnerships to promote sustainable energy programmes in developing countries were presented to the United Nations Secretariat for WSSD, 23 with energy as a central focus and 16 with a considerable impact on energy (Goldemberg and Johansson 2004). Some of the key partnerships that have emerged in the energy sector include the Global Village Energy Partnership, the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP), the Global Network on Energy for Sustainable Development (GNESD), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Sustainable Energy Finance Initiative (SEFI) and the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21).

However, it was agreed that the contribution of renewables to world energy use should be substantially and urgently increased. Increased use of renewables should be achieved by joint actions and improved efforts to work together at all levels, by public- private partnerships and by deeper regional and international cooperation in support of national efforts. 12 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences In the period 1998-2003, there were increased concerns about energy security (both physical security and security of supply), further emphasized by the 11 September 2001 events in New York and Washington, as well as the war in Iraq (Goldemberg and Johansson 2004). A number of countries \u2013 including Brazil, Germany and Spain and some states in the United States \u2013 adopted successful laws and regulations designed to increase the use of renewable energy sources. The International Conference for Renewable Energies, held at Bonn on 1-4 June 2004, was attended by over 3,000 participants from 150 countries and hundreds of non-governmental and intergovernmental organizations. The conference led to formal commitments by countries and organizations to renewable energy targets, programmes and initiatives. They are encapsulated in the main outcome of the conference, the International Action Programme, which was adopted by 170 countries, with 200 actions and commitments by Governments, international organizations and non- governmental organizations to accelerate the use of renewable energies. Other outcomes adopted by the conference reconfirmed the commitment to renewables and included a Political Declaration, outlining shared goals for increasing the role of renewable energies and a joint vision of a sustainable energy future; and Policy Recommendations for Renewable Energies, to support the development of new approaches, strategies and partnerships in scaling up those technologies. The financial sector\u2019s position statement after the Bonn conference emphasized that financial institutions, both regional and international, should play an enhanced role in financing and attracting private capital to renewable energy in emerging markets. Perhaps the most defining development for renewables came with the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by Russia, and its entry into force on 16 February 2005. The Protocol sets binding targets for developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an average 5.2 percent below 1990 levels. With its entry into force, Kyoto\u2019s emission targets become binding legal commitments for those industrialized countries that have ratified it. Some of the more recent perspectives on renewables include the following [United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affaris (UNDESA) 2005]: In July 2005, at the Gleneagles Summit, the G8 countries pledged to introduce innovative measures to achieve substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and promote low-emitting energy systems. This pledge was supported by five major non-G8 countries, namely Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa. Also in July 2005, Australia, China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea and the United States announced the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate to promote the development and deployment of existing cleaner, more efficient technologies and practices. The partnership, which has since been joined by Canada, will be consistent with and contribute to the efforts under the UNFCCC and will complement, but not replace, the Kyoto Protocol. The World Bank, after a five-year retrenchment, pledged to achieve 20 percent average annual growth in renewable energy and energy efficiency in the next five years, starting 2004. Other organizations such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), ADB, the African Development Bank (AfDB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Organization of American States (OAS) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) showed similar support for renewable energy, including for poverty reduction. The renewable energy sector saw an emergence of new players including Fortune 500 firms, large international banks, investment houses, venture capital firms, public banking institutions, development banks and foundations investing in renewable energy projects and programmes. The Beijing International Renewable Energy Conference took place on 7-8 November 2005 as a follow up to the Bonn Conference of 2004. The conference brought together policy makers, NGOs, companies and many others to discuss the current status of renewable energy worldwide, prospects for international cooperation (especially South-South cooperation), and efforts to monitor progress with existing international commitments and programmes. During the conference, host country China announced a target of 15 percent of total primary energy from renewables by 2020.

The fourteenth session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development which concluded on 12 May 2006 in New York focused on the areas of Energy for Sustainable Development; Industrial Development; Air pollution/Atmosphere; and Climate Change. The CSD deliberations had a major focus on poverty and the outcome document clearly \u201cstressed the urgency of concrete actions to increase access to energy by the poor in developing countries\u201d4. Improving access to modern energy services, particularly by poor women and children, was stressed as critical to meeting sustainable development goals. There was considerable emphasis on renewable energy but it was clearly in the context of improving access for the poor. Modern energy services Modern energy services are defined here in analogy with other infrastructure services such as telecommunications, potable water supply and Internet services. The service is the institutional mechanism that provides the physical and financial access to specific forms of secondary energy carriers such as alternating current (AC) electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in canisters or natural gas via pipeline. Secondary energy carriers are derived from primary energy sources including fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas; renewable energy sources including sunlight, wind, hydropower, geothermal energy and (sometimes) biomass, as well as nuclear fuels. The \u201cenergy chain\u201d for modern energy services is illustrated in Figure 1-1.

The secondary energy carriers power the devices (cooking or space-heating stoves, lights, motors, engines, computers, air conditioners, and so on) that we use to produce energy-enabled good and services. Service providers include individuals who generate and supply their own electricity from small diesel gensets (and sometimes sell it via crude hookups to a few neighbours), rural energy service companies, electric utilities and natural gas pipeline operators. 14 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences For access to modern energy forms to be considered a service, electricity, fuels, thermal energy and mechanical energy must be reliably available, of high quality and affordable. For high-quality electricity service, service characteristics can include 24-hour availability, a very low outage rate, excellent stability in voltage and frequency, high \u201cpurity\u201d in the AC power waveform and high power or amperage capacity for end users. The frequent outages, unstable voltage and the frequency and periods of extended unavailability in some urban and rural areas of many Asian and Pacific countries cause significant losses5 in productivity, damage to or destruction of sensitive electronic equipment, among other problems. It is no surprise that in many villages that have had well-maintained PV solar home systems, villagers have often preferred retaining SHS electricity services to switching to erratic poor quality grid power when it finally arrives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c0dac4d-d75d-49bc-9c44-3626c4392b62": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c0dac4d-d75d-49bc-9c44-3626c4392b62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "caf4ef116bfde84862e1cdf0dc554a0a2543b41fa6d9d3d992be611c5d33dc6d"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec214ec1-0d08-4e41-9a7b-2859e2499e0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d66f3d79d99689a45fcd54db075f9546d20a1cbb598d11e12759599a96ff02b"}}, "hash": "0cc358a974adf43542ca2b8b5574f62c7f0e8ae2b172ea2eab6faf7322c1526f", "text": "Table 1-1 provides a simple overview of some of the principal ways in which electricity, fuel, and thermal energy services based on renewable energy can facilitate achievement of the MDGs and where the possibilities lie.

Clean-burning, efficient fuels and electricity are especially important in helping the poor to meet their basic needs and to move out of poverty provided that the means to use that energy productively are available and accessible. However, over a billion people, primarily in South Asia and West Africa, rely almost entirely on the use of traditional biomass sources, which have low efficiency and high health and environmental impacts. For the poor those are almost always the only affordable and accessible options to address their current major energy need, which is heat for cooking. In general, the least expensive sources of relatively clean modern energy for the poor for cooking are often based on fossil fuels, such as LPG and propane. For electricity supply, the cheapest options are mini-grid and off-grid electricity services from diesel power generation. The rapid and very large increases in petroleum fuel prices in the last few years have consistently imposed an enormous fiscal burden on those developing countries that are already struggling to pay their fuel import bills. Funds that could have been used to create new income-generating activities and to expand the social services infrastructure have been diverted to pay for fuel imports at high prices. The poor and the lower income segments of society have thus been hit by a double burden from persistent, very high petroleum product prices and from curtailment of the development agendas in many of their countries. For those among the poor that use petroleum products, the dependence on fossil fuels has increased their vulnerability to price increases and supply interruptions. Ironically, the poorest segments of society, that have little or no access to fossil fuels and traditionally rely on biomass-based fuels such as wood, crop residues and animal dung for cooking along with meagre amounts of kerosene for minimal lighting, are more resilient to the petroleum price shocks. However, the prospects for bringing modern fuels and electricity services to those people are diminished because of the diversion of public funds for petroleum imports and private sector funds for higher fuel and electricity prices. While modern energy sources are essential in achieving MDG targets, such achievements can be undone if crucial energy services become unaffordable. Alternative investments in electricity and fuel supplies based on renewable energy, where the physical, financial, and institutional resources are available, can support increased attainment of MDG targets while providing increased energy security to the poor. Those options are discussed in this report and assessed in the context of sustained increases in petroleum prices. However, the increased competitiveness of electricity and fuels based on renewable energy in the wake of fluctuating oil prices is of little comfort to populations with modest means. If fuels and electricity based on petroleum are unaffordable for many people, so will be the alternatives based on renewable energy. This report examines the ways in which modern energy services based largely on renewable energy sources can be made widely available, reliable and affordable. As discussed here, partnerships among the public sector, the private sector and the international development community are essential to the establishment of widespread access to modern energy services that can work for the poorer segments of society. Increasing access to improved and modern energy services for those segments will require massive, sustained investment. Moreover, complementary investments in income-generating activities, especially in agriculture and agricultural processing and in off-farm small, medium-sized and microenterprises (SMMEs) is essential if the availability of modern energy services is to be a potent enabler of growing incomes and improved social conditions. 15 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences MDG and target Modern energy linkages 1 Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger \u2013 reduce by half by 2015 Energy inputs such as heat from fuels are essential to generate jobs and income, agricultural processing and value added through crop-drying and food preservation, microenterprises using heat such as glass-making, metal-casting, ceramics and commercial food-vending. Lighting permits income generation beyond daylight hours. Post-harvest losses can be reduced through improved preservation, refrigeration, and freezing. Almost all staple foods must be cooked, requiring heat and fuels. Electricity for irrigation helps increase food production and access to nutrition. 2 Achieve universal primary education, to ensure that by 2015 children every- where will be able to com- plete primary schooling Even with adequate schools, teachers and resources to supply books and materials, many children, especially girls, cannot attend primary schools owing to family fuel requirements entailing their car- rying wood to meet family subsistence needs.

Electricity and clean fuels can provide clean water, cooking for school lunches, provide good lighting and operate audio-visual equipment and information and communications technologies (ICTs), and support distance learning. Electricity and modern fuels for staff residences help attract teachers to rural schools. 3 Promote gender equal- ity and empower women, and ensure that boys and girls have equal access to primary and secondary education by 2015 Adult women are responsible for the majority of household cooking and water-boiling activities which take time away from other productive activities. Without modern fuels and stoves for food preparation and processing women often remain in drudgery owing to lack of heat-related energy services. Good lighting facilitates home study and improved security. Public lighting improves women\u2019s safety. Clean cooking fuels minimize indoor air pollution and associated morbidity and mortality of women and children. Modern energy for multifunction platforms, for example, can in- crease agricultural productivity and women\u2019s incomes. Electricity and fuels for lighting, refrigeration, entertainment, and so on permit women to develop small enterprises and increase their incomes and social power. 4 Reduce child mortality by two thirds between 1990 and 2015 for those under five years of age Disease caused by lack of clean boiled water and respiratory illness caused by the effects of indoor air pollution from traditional fuels and stoves directly contribute to infant and child disease and mortality. Diarrhoeal and respiratory diseases are the leading causes of under-five child mortality. Electricity is essential for integrated water pumping and reliable purification. Rural health clinics are the front line in the war on infectious disease, diarrhoea, and other illness. Electricity and efficient fuels (for example, LPG) are essential for the operation of effective health posts and clinics. 5 Improve maternal health and reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015 Lack of adequate fuels and means of sterilization in health clinics, as well as the daily drudgery and physical burden of fuel collection and transport, all contribute to poor maternal health conditions, es- pecially in rural areas. Many pregnant women continue to carry wood and charcoal long distances, contributing to premature delivery and low birth-weight infants. Indoor air pollution related to poorly ventilated stoves and traditional cooking methods adversely affects pregnant women. 6 Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other dis- eases, halting and revers- ing these scourges by 2015 Health-care facilities and health workers require electricity and clean fuels and the services that they provide (sanitation, sterilization, illumination, pressurized hot water, and so on) to deliver effective health services. Electricity is essential for integrated water pumping and purification. Electrified health centres with lighting and audio-visual equipment can provide education and training as well as medical services to help combat the spread of major diseases. 7 Ensure environmental sus- tainability; stop unsustain- able exploitation of natural resources and halve the proportion of people lack- ing access to clean water between 1990 and 2015 Energy production, distribution and consumption have many adverse effects on the local, regional, and global environment including indoor air pollution and local particulates. Land degradation results primarily from agricultural land clearing and sometimes traditional fuel-use patterns. Cleaner energy systems and sustainable forestry and biomass production are essential to contribute to environmen- tal sustainability. Modern energy can reduce the environmental damages of energy use by introduc- ing renewable energy sources, by supplying modern cooking fuels, by substituting cleaner fuels for dirty ones and by increasing energy efficiency. 8 Develop a global partner- ship for development The World Summit for Sustainable Development called for partnerships between public entities, development agencies, civil society and the private sector to support sustainable development, including the delivery of affordable reliable and environmentally sustainable energy services. The Global Village Energy Partnership, established with leadership from the UNDP and the World Bank, is forging networks and alliances to support sustainable human development and to integrate energy access issues with development investments.

Table 1-1 The Millennium Development Goals and modern energy services 16 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences There are challenges to meeting MDG targets through investment in power and fuels supplies based on renewable energy. Improving access of the poor to modest amounts of electricity and modern fuels has been the focus of many renewable energy programmes supported by specialized agencies of the United Nations, multilateral development banks, and bilateral development agencies.

Forging effective links between access to modern energy services and achievement of the various MDG goals presents technical, institutional, and financial challenges. Even for renewable energy programmes that have been able to meet the needs of whole communities, including the poor, documenting progress towards meeting MDG targets is non-trivial. Many approaches have been used to expand markets for renewable energy technologies to address some of the energy needs of the poor. Projects co-financed and supported by the GEF in Asia have focused on overcoming barriers to commercialization of renewable energy technologies. UNDP, ADB and World Bank are among the institutions with lead programmes to promote RETs in the region and during the past 10 years, those technologies have seen robust growth and increasing significance. Total capacity reached 182 gigawatts (GW) in 2005, while annual investment in renewable energy (from both public and private sources) almost quadrupled in the past decade to an estimated US$38 billion worldwide. To a large extent, the achievements are owing to aggressive shifts in national and local policies aimed at addressing the well-documented barriers that have put renewables at a disadvantage compared with conventional sources based on fossil fuels. Private sector-led technology improvements and cost reductions are other major contributing factors in this unprecedented growth in renewables. The main drivers for those efforts, which have been largely in developed countries and the three largest developing countries, Brazil, China and India, have been energy security and environmental concerns, particularly linked to climate change. To a lesser degree, local environmental concerns and rural development needs in the poorest countries have also contributed to the growth. The links among energy and development Increased access to modern energy services is a necessary component of initiatives to reduce poverty and increase productivity, improve education and health, support gender equality and improve the human environment. This applies to urban, peri-urban and rural communities. However, we recognize that by itself, access to modern energy services will not be sufficient to facilitate substantial and sustained economic and social development. Energy for the sake of energy is not useful \u2013 its utility lies in facilitating human development. Complementary investments in improved community services such as health and education, together with investments in infrastructure and in productive enterprises are necessary if modern energy access is to be a potent element in development. Increasingly, the poverty alleviation and developmental projects of agencies of the United Nations, the multilateral development banks and bilateral development assistance agencies are incorporating the role of infrastructure, including energy, into their designs as part of an overall integrated approach to development. The lack of basic infrastructure, particularly roads, transport, and water are seen as defining characteristics of poverty. Roads and transportation both increase physical and social connectedness and increase prices obtained for crops and products. Roads even to the next village are seen as expanding people\u2019s options and access to services. In the Philippines and Ghana, villagers often said7 that rather than having PV systems for (entry-level) household electricity, they would rather have improved roads, because with the roads the power lines would come. Access to clean drinking water and water for irrigation frequently emerges as a distinguishing characteristic between the rich and the poor. Agriculture \u2013 crop production, livestock raising, fisheries and forestry \u2013 constitutes the dominant economic activity in rural areas of the developing world. Poor access to reliable and affordable energy services in those areas reduces the range of the opportunities available for the development of many economically productive activities, including agro and other non-farm-based enterprises. Many agricultural production and post-harvest processes require electricity, shaft or mechanical energy, and heat. Besides being an important employer in rural areas, providing modern energy services to agricultural production and processing is a way to grow beyond subsistence farming and out of poverty. In addition, non-farm income-generating activities can support poverty reduction efforts and increase wealth in rural areas. The availability of modern energy services is one necessary element in the development of economic activities in rural areas (APERC 2004). Vigorous economic development in all sectors of a country\u2019s economy will continue to require affordable and reliable access to modern fuels and electricity. 17 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences In cities, peri-urban areas and in towns, reliable high-quality and affordable electricity and modern fuels are essential for virtually all aspects of enterprise and government operations.

Unless the non-poor have access to better quality, more reliable electricity and fuels, they will be constrained in their ability to expand employment and contribute to overall economic development. Thus modern energy access, including issues of availability, reliability and quality is a concern for entire nations and not just the poor. Scaling up access to modern energy services The International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that more than US$16 trillion of investment, or an average of US$550 billion a year, will be required over the next three decades in order for energy supply infrastructure worldwide to keep pace with the growing demand for modern energy services (IEA 2003). More than half of the investment will be needed simply to replace or maintain existing production capacity and to install new capacity. Half the investment will be in developing countries, where production and demand are expected to increase most. However, only marginally fewer people (1.4 billion in 2030 compared with 1.6 billion in 2001) are likely to remain without access to modern energy sources reflecting rapid population growth in much of the developing world, almost all of it in urban areas. Bridging the access gap will require additional investment of US$665 billion over the period, with 80 percent of the incremental investment devoted to South Asia and Africa. Scaling up access to modern energy services facilitates the poverty reduction and economic and social development agenda in developing countries. However, scaling up access to modern energy and scaling up renewable energy use are overlapping but separate objectives. The UNDP-Winrock study Against that background, Winrock International undertook this policy study on behalf of UNDP. The objective of the study is to identify the policy and investment actions that will be needed to ensure that environment-friendly renewable energy options can contribute to the sustainable economic growth, energy security and poverty reduction goals of Asian and Pacific countries. Unlike studies that focus on the extent of progress towards achievement of the MDGs, this study examines the current and potential role of modern energy services, especially via RETs, in facilitating such progress. Two energy-related goals are relevant here: (a) expanding access, especially for the poorer segments of society, to modern energy services; and (b) increasing the use of a broad range of renewable energy technologies to provide many of those services. The report briefly reviews the growth of the renewable energy industry worldwide, examines the extent to which RETs have been applied to the provision of the basic energy needs of the poor, especially in Asia and the Pacific, and identifies business models and practices that have been effective in providing key energy services to those who need them. Expansion of renewable energy industries and installations is important both at the global level, to address the urgent need to slow greenhouse gas emissions, as well as at the local level, where the energy services provided by RETs can serve the economic and social development needs of communities without adequate energy supplies and services, particularly in developing countries. A specific focus of this report is on the role of the private sector in the expansion of the renewable energy sector and the extent to which, and the ways in which, the private sector is contributing to expanded modern energy access in the Asia-Pacific region. The emerging role of public-private partnerships, with technical and financial assistance from the international development community, is highlighted. Specific objectives of this study are the following: \u2022 To identify and characterize major current and proposed renewable energy policies, programmes and initiatives in the region against global oil price trends, energy security concerns and socio-economic development and environmental goals, with specific emphasis on achieving the MDGs; \u2022 Within that framework, to identify and catalogue key policies, programmes and initiatives to promote private investment in renewable energy development, highlighting specific instances of successes and failures and their underlying causes, as well as an assessment of the various modalities for policy advocacy at national and regional levels to expand the contribution of renewable energy; 18 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences \u2022 To evaluate the impacts of the energy-related goals mentioned earlier on the overall energy supply mix and consumption patterns, with special attention to the contribution so far of renewable energy options in meeting the energy needs of the poor and the role of private investment in that regard; \u2022 To assess the qualitative and quantitative impacts of increased deployment of renewable energies on various components of the MDGs, such as incomes of the poor and employment, health, education, gender issues and environmental sustainability, as well as on progress", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f8316bc-0718-41d2-95ae-2d0859ea5c5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f8316bc-0718-41d2-95ae-2d0859ea5c5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "091a55dd9873cc6ca89fb1f7257be044dd9ab3e5f48a9df9486a33d0d1d2247b"}}, "hash": "091a55dd9873cc6ca89fb1f7257be044dd9ab3e5f48a9df9486a33d0d1d2247b", "text": "made towards meeting the MDGs by the year 2015; and \u2022 To identify strategic directions and policy options open to Governments of the region to realize opportunities for, and mitigate barriers to, the substantial scaling up of private investment in renewable energy (including what is potentially available under the Kyoto Protocol) with special reference to investment and financing options that cater to the social, economic and energy needs of the poor. Structure of the document The report has eight chapters. After introductory chapters on background and methodology, chapter three documents the trends in private sector investment in renewable energy technologies. Specifically, it captures the trends in private investment, capacities created and production levels for grid-connected and off-grid applications, at a global level and for the Asian and Pacific region. For the region, it also outlines the emerging facets of RET markets. The global perspective is important because many of the most important renewable energy technologies are evolving outside developing countries of Asia and the Pacific. Many of those technologies will have broad applicability in the developing world if the policies and investment support of national Governments create an environment conducive to a private sector-led expansion in the provision of crucial infrastructure services to the poor and to SMEs, with a beneficial impact on employment. The following chapter focuses on analyzing barriers to private investment in renewables as well as the critical barriers faced by the poor in accessing RETs. While much has been written about barriers, the creation of an enabling environment for private sector delivery of modern energy services, including through renewable energy technologies, is the central requirement for effective engagement and stimulation of that sector. In some Asian countries, government policies and ad hoc interventions have seriously damaged the local private sector in the renewable energy industry. Starting with an overview of the major drivers of the global renewable energy market, chapter five moves on to examine various policies adopted, globally and within the Asian and Pacific region, that promote private sector development of renewables and renewable energy for rural electrification. At the regional level, it discusses major strategies adopted, as well as regional initiatives on renewable energy and poverty. It also maps the various policy measures that are successfully being used to promote renewables in various countries of Asia and the Pacific. The next chapter is a synthesis of experiences with private sector-led RET promotion in the region in terms of the various models that have been tried in different countries, with the aim of identifying best practices and critical factors for success. We note that many of the models have failed because they have tried to mobilize financial resources from the poor who, by definition, have little money. Another issue is the reluctance, and often the inability, of large electric utility companies in the developing world to address the expensive and difficult requirements of traditional rural electrification. In this regard, agencies of the United Nations, including the multilateral development banks, have been working to expand the role of some of those utilities, both through policy changes and through technical and financial assistance. Chapter seven assesses the impacts of various policies and other measures on renewable energy markets; on energy access for the poor; on poverty and achievement of MDGs; and on the drivers of investment in renewable energy, such as energy security and climate change. In most cases rural applications of renewable energy systems are driven by a socio-economic development agenda and not by climate concerns. \u201cEnergy security\u201d in this report refers not to enhanced national energy security through use of renewables but to increasing the security of energy supply to poor and low- income rural populations in general. 19 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences The final chapter contains a summary of the findings with suggested policy directions for UNDP. In this report, we highlight the importance of cross-sectoral approaches to modern energy services delivery. The provision of such services alone almost never results in significant local economic development or even in social progress. By deliberately linking energy services to income-generating activities and to the activities and investments that underpin movement towards the MDGs, UNDP and other specialized agencies of the United Nations could foster a move towards intersectoral development initiatives. Helping local, regional, and national Governments understand and make those links would be a very significant contribution to development.

Approach and Methodology Energy security Energy security has been defined as the availability of energy at all times in various forms, in sufficient quantities and at affordable prices (Johansson and Goldemberg 2002). In the context of this study, the term energy security is used to describe ensuring access to modern fuels and electricity to populations currently without access or with inadequate access to them, while minimizing their vulnerability with respect to price fluctuations, fuel distribution and other uncertainties in fossil fuel markets. The use of renewable energy systems, with backup or hybrid operation with fossil fueled components (such as propane and diesel gensets) can provide greater reliability than some purely renewable energy systems while minimizing the percentage of energy coming from fossil fuels. Energy supply diversity can provide resilience to uncertainties in the availability of any single energy source, whether renewable or fossil-fuel based. An initial examination was carried out of the extent to which renewable energy policies, programmes and initiatives have contributed to improving access of the poor to modern energy services and brought about improvements in their standards of living through energy security. Changes brought about as a result of those measures in the energy mix of the country, the level of national and international support and private sector investment in renewable energy were also studied. Table 2-1 below identifies some of the means of verifying the degree of energy security. The past growth of specific RET markets was tracked in terms of number of installations, installed capacity, capacity utilization factor, scale of investment and number of consumers served. An effort was made to determine the extent to which RETs have reached the poor segments of the community, although in some cases data were difficult to access or were not available. A list of indicators and data requirements to assess the sustainability of a private sector-led market in RETs with positive poverty-reduction impacts follows. (a) Social sustainability (i) Access \u2022 Population below income-poverty line and corresponding energy mix; \u2022 Number and share of households with access to electricity and modern fuels; \u2022 Households with access to energy services (for cooking fuel, pumped water, electric lighting, milling); \u2022 Level (average electricity use per capita) and rate of electrification; \u2022 Commercial energy consumption per capita; \u2022 Share of traditional fuels in total energy balance; and \u2022 Number and distribution of people cooking with traditional biomass fuels or other non- commercial energy sources (ii) Affordability \u2022 Share of household income spent on energy (in total and for the poorest households); \u2022 Share of household disposable income spent on electricity and modern fuels; \u2022 Actual prices paid by final consumers for energy with and without taxes and subsidies; and \u2022 Extent to which RETs contribute to enterprise development, employment generation and productive applications. (iii) Equity \u2022 Household energy use by different income groups and corresponding fuel mix (energy use per household for each income group); and \u2022 Average electricity expenditure as a percentage of total household expenditure of the poor Study approach A simple approach was adopted for the study, which was organized along two tracks. The first considered the role of renewable energy in enhancing the security of modern energy services for the poor and the second focused on the contribution of RETs to progress in achieving the MDGs. The study reviewed the role of the private sector and financing for renewables in the context of the two tracks. For each track, renewable energy policies, programmes, and initiatives were examined, starting with the use of specific indicators to assess their degree of success or failure.

Availability of energy has a direct impact on poverty, employment opportunities, education, the demographic transition, indoor pollution, health and gender equality. At the household level, some of the ways that modern energy services may contribute directly to poverty reduction are as an amplifier of human capacity, by making small enterprises possible and by reducing unit costs. Indirect contributions to poverty reduction may come in the form of free time for other productive activities, improved health and education, improved access to and supply of clean water and reduced local environmental degradation. This component of the study was carried out through case studies in six countries which documented the contribution that renewable energy has made or can potentially make towards the achievement of the MDGs. This was further supplemented with a literature review of materials available on the subject. Specific questions that the case studies collected data on and tried to address are listed in Table 2-2 below.

With this in mind, policies were examined to ascertain the extent to which they supported or impeded access to modern fuels and electricity for the poor and whether they promoted energy service enterprises run by the poor, so improving livelihoods. In addition, whether the policies supported energy needed for social services (education, communication, health), met the specific energy needs of women and contributed to reduced costs and improved quality of energy supplied to low-income households was assessed. At the same time, specific ways in which the policies succeeded in mobilizing governmental and non-governmental actors, particularly in the private sector, to accelerate efforts to bring about universal access to modern energy were reviewed (Table 2.3). Global assessment The global assessment documented growth trends in renewable energy markets, highlighting worldwide achievements in terms of private investment in RETs, contribution to increased access, affordability and poverty reduction. An overall assessment of international, bilateral and multilateral renewable energy initiatives covering developing countries of the Asia and Pacific region was also undertaken in order to capture key trends in renewable energy promotion and draw appropriate linkages between them and regional policy developments. The assessment examined the impacts of traditional drivers of RET investment, such as concerns for the local environment, and gauged how effective they have been in attracting investment to the sector. It also looked at more recent drivers including the high price of petroleum fuel and concern for climate change and documented any trends towards increased investment as a result of these. Special attention was paid to initiatives taken after the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development that incorporate a poverty focus and those taken after the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in February 2005. Renewable energy investment promotion and financing initiatives by United Nations agencies, multilateral bodies, bilateral donors, subregional groupings (including through South-South cooperation), NGOs and private foundations, as well as in national poverty reduction strategies were also studied.

The questions that Winrock developed and used for the consultations were the following: \u2022 What steps need to be taken in order to increase private sector investment in, and financing of, renewable energy? What have been the barriers to private investment? \u2022 In your experience, are ongoing renewable energy programmes having any significant poverty reduction impacts? Can you name specific projects, programmes, initiatives or country policies that have such impacts? \u2022 What are the barriers to and risks faced in marketing energy products and services to the poor? What are the most serious problems and difficulties for the private sector in extending renewable energy services to the poor? \u2022 How can the private sector be encouraged to increase investment in the sector? How can the private sector be encouraged to cater to the needs of the poor better? \u2022 How big a role can RE projects for productive uses play in poverty alleviation? \u2022 What is the role of public sector investment through subsidies and other incentives in leveraging private investment and financing of RETs? \u2022 What policy changes can bring about increased investment in grid-connected renewables? Can you cite examples of success stories in your country or region? \u2022 How crucial a role does credit play in increasing private sector investment in grid- connected renewables?

The regional assessment included: \u2022 examining policy incentives and barriers to renewable energy development at large; \u2022 reviewing the policy climate for private investment and financing; \u2022 assessing the effectiveness of policies in addressing the energy needs of the poor; and \u2022 drawing lessons from successes and failures. The existing literature was reviewed to identify trends in the development of markets for renewables in the Asian and Pacific region, as well as major policy developments, projects, programmes and initiatives at the national and regional levels on renewable energy. Emerging thinking and experience on linkages between renewable energy, poverty reduction and the MDGs were also highlighted. Existing energy policies, particularly for the renewable energy sector, and legislation relating to the policy-making processes in the region were analyzed. Finally, qualitative interviews and consultations with policy makers, researchers, manufacturers and end users of renewable energy technologies were carried out. National assessments The national assessments covered Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal, Philippines and Solomon Islands. The selection of countries for those assessments was based on the prevalence of poverty and the potential role for RETs in its mitigation, as well on the existence of an investment climate conducive to private sector participation. Subregional balance among Asian and Pacific countries was another factor. 27 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences The assessments focused on the following: \u2022 Effectiveness of renewable energy policies, programmes and initiatives, with emphasis on the role of private investment and financing; \u2022 Analyzing barriers and opportunities in meeting the energy needs of the poor through renewable energy options; and \u2022 Discussions with policy makers, representatives of industry and financial institutions and other key stakeholders to understand their differing perceptions and ideas for the future. Stakeholders representing lending institutions and renewable energy companies provided helpful insights into the obstacles to growth of the RET market from their perspectives, while NGO staff and consultants working in, and on the edges of, the sector shared their experiences and frustrations as well.

Each case study was carried out in an iterative way, feeding into the national-level policy review while itself receiving inputs from that review, in the sense that specific policy instruments had been instituted to meet the energy needs of the poor and hence their effectiveness in the field needed to be ascertained. The case studies were carried out through a review of the literature, meetings with key stakeholders, field visits to project villages and interactions with communities through focus group discussions and sample surveys. Key stakeholders included private-sector firms, financing institutions, energy consumers in general and poor consumers in particular. Initial results of the case studies were presented during national consultations held in the target countries, with the exception of Cambodia. The consultations were attended by various stakeholders representing beneficiary communities, the Government, the private sector, financing institutions, donors, NGOs and academe and were presided over by the country leads. Scope and limitations of the study The study depended to a large extent on secondary sources of information, as well as stakeholder consultations, and several challenges were encountered while it was being conducted. First, the literature proved far more extensive and difficult to access than anticipated within the resources available for the project. Second, data availability, especially on markets and investments at the regional level, proved to be a major challenge. Another challenge encountered was that most RET projects and programmes in the past have been technology-oriented. Assessing RETs on the poverty and MDGs scale is a relatively recent phenomenon and as a result, most projects do not have monitoring mechanisms that track poverty outcomes systematically. Most data available on past energy projects on MDG impacts is anecdotal and not quantified. Finally, the resources available within the project did not permit extensive questionnaire surveys in the field level case studies. Conducting field surveys was also limited by the distances, remote locations, dispersed populations and, quite often, availability of the communities because of their engagement in agriculture and other livelihood operations. For those reasons, the samples covered in the surveys were not statistically significant and the data collected were not amenable to rigorous statistical analysis. 30 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences 3. Private Sector Investment in Renewable Energy Introduction Renewable energy resources include sunlight, wind energy, hydropower, ocean and tidal currents, ocean waves, ocean thermal energy and biomass. Geothermal energy is often characterized as a renewable energy source, in part because it is neither fossil nor nuclear in origin. However, it is es- sentially a depletable thermal energy stock. Renewable energy can be converted to heat, mechanical energy, electrical energy and chemical energy (fuels) to provide energy for the needs of human soci- ety. The practical production of useful energy for modern applications from renewables has emerged largely in the twentieth century, as in the case of hydroelectric power, with some systems such as solar photovoltaics, wind electric power and solar thermal electric power achieving commercial vi- ability only in the past several decades. Systems for the conversion of ocean currents and waves to mechanical and electrical energy are less advanced but under commercialization. In the past two decades, the private sector worldwide has invested in the development and manufac- ture of a broad menu of renewable energy equipment and in services for the distribution, sale, opera- tion, maintenance and repair of that equipment on a large and growing scale. The principal classes of commercially available systems include wind electric power, solar PV systems, solar thermal units for solar water and air heating, solar thermal electric power, hydropower and biofuels production from a variety of biomass forms. The scale of the output of practical RE systems ranges from watts to gigawatts. Industry has also invested increasingly in projects that use renewable energy equipment and renew- able/fossil energy hybrid systems to provide electricity to customers ranging from national electric utilities to municipalities and even individuals. IPPs established under clear and transparent rules and regulations, with feed-in tariffs for energy and power sales, have facilitated rapid growth in large- scale, wind electric power plants (\u201cwind farms\u201d) and in minihydropower systems. There has also been rapid growth over several years in the production of modern fuels from biomass, principally ethanol, and biodiesel fuels for use in the road transport sector. Solar water heating is a rapidly growing indus- try, with China dominating world production and use of solar thermal collectors for low-temperature, hot-water applications for residential, commercial and industrial use.

The same is true of the components needed for RE systems, such as inverters, charge con- trollers and voltage regulators, as well as efficient end-use equipment such as light-emitting diode (LED) lighting fixtures. Consequently, a family in Nepal benefits directly from large-scale PV develop- ment and manufacture in Japan, by being able to use high-quality, affordable, small PV modules for battery-charging to operate LED reading lights. India, Philippines and Thailand are starting to grow jatropha for use by new industries that produce biodiesel from this plant that can be grown on land not well suited to the production of edible crops. Investment directed principally at markets in devel- oping countries has also taken place in companies and projects to build biogas units for family use and to produce charcoal from sustainable forestry, as well as in microhydropower and small-scale PV installations. This chapter provides a concise overview8 of global trends in production and use of renewable en- ergy systems and highlights activities in the Asian and Pacific region. Next, some renewable energy systems which can support uses of energy that are socially and economically productive are indi- cated. Finally, specific examples of investments in, and applications of, renewable energy options are highlighted and the implications of those activities in facilitating poverty alleviation and increased achievement of the MDGs are explored. 31 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Renewable energy innovations that have created new possibilities Some innovations that have created new possibilities and opportunities for renewable energy have emerged just in the past decade. They include the following: \u2022 High-efficiency white light LEDs and practical low-power lighting units incorporating them; \u2022 Multifunction platforms which can be powered by locally-produced vegetable oil, as well as by diesel fuel; \u2022 Good quality pico-power units for low-cost, small-scale electricity production; \u2022 Standardized design and construction of biogas units for households; \u2022 Cleaner, high-efficiency biomass cook stoves; \u2022 Upgrades of traditional water mills for grinding and milling grain; and \u2022 Treadle pumps, which harnesses human power in an effective way for high-value uses. \u2022 The innovations are discussed below in the context of specific RET markets and applications. Decentralized renewable energy markets and applications A very broad menu of renewable energy and renewable/fossil fuel hybrid systems can support, and are supporting, socially \u2013 and economically-productive activities in the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific. Some renewable energy systems, especially microhydropower and minihydropower, and possibly small, modular, biopower systems, can provide electricity and cogeneration services at levelized energy costs that are competitive with or cheaper than fossil-fuel-based electricity or elec- tricity plus thermal energy. For renewables, the levelized energy cost is dominated by initial capital costs and it is those costs that are a barrier to direct purchase of the equipment. Mechanisms to pro- vide low-interest, long-term financing are essential for the large-scale use of renewables to produce energy services that cater to the poor and less well-off members of society. An overview of the many options available for renewable energy and renewable/fossil fuel hybrid systems, together with as- sociated economic and social applications, are provided in Tables 3-1 to 3-6.

All users would benefit from wider diffusion of improved cook stoves and from the use of more efficient charcoal kilns. The latter would reduce somewhat the pressure on wood supply and might result in lower prices for charcoal. Useful examples come from Cambodia and Thailand. The Cambodian example below (Box 3\u20131) was a winner of one of the Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy9 and was included as a case study in the Cambodian national assessment for this report. In Thailand, under a UNDP/GEF project10, farm- ers are using improved stoves and a new method of charcoal production using airtight steel drums as kilns. In this case, the poor benefit through new livelihood opportunities. Growth in renewable energy markets Growth trends in global renewable energy investment Renewable energy accounted for 13 percent of the world\u2019s primary energy supply in 2004 but their share is as high as 32 percent in Asia (IEA 2007). A regional study undertaken by UNDP identified several models introduced in the region that showcase successful examples of scaling up of decen- tralized RETs particularly in poorer countries of the region. Those models include household biogas in Nepal, solar PV home systems in Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, as well as microhydropower in Indonesia, Nepal and the Philippines. In almost all cases, those markets are the result of public- private partnerships. 36 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences The Groupe Energies Renouvelables, Environnement et Solidarit\u00e9s (GERES) set up the Cambodian Fuel- wood Saving Project (CFSP) which has developed a cheap charcoal stove, the \u201cNew Lao\u201d stove. This uses at least 22 percent less charcoal than the \u201cTraditional Lao\u201d stoves which are commonly used in Cambodia. More than 130,000 New Lao stoves have been produced by 14 entrepreneurs and sold in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, over the past three years. About 95 percent of Cambodians cook with biomass fuels. This is costly, has adverse health effects and is bad for the environment. Cambodia\u2019s great natural biodiversity is threatened by uncontrolled wood consump- tion. Much of this demand is for timber and a significant amount is turned into charcoal which is the preferred cooking fuel in cities, used by 40 percent of the population of Phnom Penh. The area of forest is diminishing but the price of charcoal has hardly increased over the last ten years, reflecting a thriving (but largely illegal) trade, and lack of taxes and other constraining factors.

CFSP is concerned with improving the sustainability of fuel supply as well as reducing fuel demand, and is working in a number of different ways to achieve this. One component of the work is the sustainable produc- tion of wood for charcoal through community forests and plantations. It is also undertaking field trials of two efficient charcoal kilns, which produce one kg of high quality charcoal, with energy content of 31 megajoule (MJ) per kg, from 4.6 kg of wood, compared with the current lower quality charcoal (26 MJ/kg) requiring 6.5 kg of wood. CFSP is also working on briquetting charcoal-dust and crop waste as additional sources of fuel. *From Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy 2006, www.ashdenawards.org/winners/geres Box 3-1 The Cambodian Fuelwood Saving Project* Among renewables, bioenergy supplies about 11 percent of the global primary energy demand of | 50 exajoule (EJ) per year, of which 7-10 EJ a year is consumed by industrial countries while developing countries consume between 40-45 EJ a year. Heating and traditional cooking consume two thirds of all biomass produced. Most of the biomass in the world is produced and consumed in China and India. Biomass is also used to produce electricity. For example, electricity from cogeneration using bagasse from sugar production is one widely used option in many developed countries and in several developing countries, especially in Brazil, China and a few other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean percent (UNDESA 2005). Investment in renewable energy sources has been growing rapidly recently because of significant oil price fluctuations and increasing concerns about climate change. The investment, which has been mainly in developed countries, coupled with ongoing technology improvements and cost-reduction policies and programmes, has made the cost of modern energy services from RETs increasingly competitive with those from oil-based systems. RETs are often ideal for rural or remote communities, providing them with sustainable energy services for heating, electricity generation, transportation and other mechanical power applications. They have the most potential for addressing the energy needs of the poor while reducing their demand for oil (UNDESA 2005). (a) Renewable energy for power generation and electrification Grid-connected renewable energy power generation technologies, such as small hydropower, wind farms and biomass cogeneration facilities, have experienced the strongest growth and now account for the largest shares of RE capacity both globally and in developing countries (figures 3-1 to 3-3). However, the viability and competitiveness of RET-based power generation facilities depend on many site-specific factors such as local renewable resource endowments and policy and programme support. Thus, some of those facilities may be cost competitive with fossil-based systems in one country but not in another. There can also be differences between subregions within a country. 37 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences In terms of technology, the fastest growth in investment in RETs is in solar PV and wind power systems (Table 3-7). But other renewable sources have expanded as well, as indicated in Figure 3-4, which shows the leaders in generating power from renewable resources other than large hydropower. In recent years, some of the fastest growth has been in Asia, particularly China and India. Installed PV capacity has grown from approximately 100 MWp in 1992 (REN21 2006) to estimated 10,500 MWp in 2007, with an annual rate of increase up to 50 percent in recent years (REN21 2008) (Figure 3-5). 2.5 million households in the developing world have basic electricity services from PV units, although this remains a small number compared with some 300 million homes without electricity (REN21 2008). In 1993-2003, off-grid solar capacity grew from 990 MW to 2,200 MW. The off-grid market for solar home systems in developing countries once drove the global solar PV market. This has changed dramatically in recent years with grid-tied PV systems in the IEA countries dominating the market (IEA 2006).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8b556d8-f500-4866-af8d-5d9a6e5fac97": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8b556d8-f500-4866-af8d-5d9a6e5fac97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a344deaf602b4a4f704f0e24bfdbaf8357c777a0b7e5f990f64eac99e28190ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "0e5f8f49-2562-42b5-b270-da8ce9d0a820", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94001c464091344021bf7a4e8574872c96d52802f7faed0a1e72ecc32a93cb97"}}, "hash": "133e70ad29dfb31102d5559b44a6b03f1d2bc36b026f1c0b7a7bdcbd40ecadf2", "text": "Ocean (tidal) power, 0 Solar thermal, 0 Biomass, 21 Wind turbines, 35 Geothermal power, 5 Small Hydro, 35 PV, 4 Biomass, 24 Wind turbines, 11 Geothermal power, 5 Small Hydro, 60 Figure 3-1 Global renewable energy installations, end-2006(GW) Figure 3-2 RET-based power generation capacity in developing countries, end-2006 Source: REN21 2008 Source: REN21 2008 38 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Figure 3-3 Renewable energy power capacity (GW) in developing countries, 2004-2006 Table 3-7 Global capacities for renewable energy in power generation, GW 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Small hydro Wind Power Biomass Power Geothermal Power 2004 2005 2006 Source: REN21 2005, REN21 2006, REN21 2008 Source: REN21 2006, REN21 2008 Added 2004 End-2004 Added 2005 End-2005", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6595d0e2-2329-4b2a-a4c2-ce2057f0b30b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6595d0e2-2329-4b2a-a4c2-ce2057f0b30b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "977f36ab9c293c0e55e57ce5fcba31ca95030abbe09a4a004ec85c00805503d5"}, "3": {"node_id": "7d1a2759-7e1c-43fe-9de8-99fa4f1b93a6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5dfd5c9d1b074364fc6e4f1f4f952c1690b084066676d75dbbb5f35b6ee996f1"}}, "hash": "47ea33960c2495026339db2d69f6fad5c752598f13ee7f31664994819e4d9bf3", "text": "Added 2006 End-2006 Added 2007 End-2007 (Est.)

Global sales of wind electric power installations worldwide is estimated at US$ 37 billion in 2007 (GWEC 2008)11, reflecting the average cost of about US$1,761 per kWe and the growth of 21,000 MW of installed capacity from end-2006 to end-2007. In 2007, the global capacity reached 94,000 MWe (REN21 2008, GWEC 2008). Over the past 15 years the small (0.2 \u2013 50kWe) wind turbine industry has registered remarkable growth. At the end of 2004 United States had a capacity of 30MW, of which 14MW was expected to be sold worldwide in 2005 (UNDESA 2005). Those technologies can benefit rural communities, and in wind/diesel hybrid configurations in locations with good wind resources (mean wind speed of 6 m/s and up), they can be a very attractive option for off-grid AC power supply. Wind energy systems are now also feeding main grids. Among developing countries, India has the largest wind-power system installation in Asia at 6,270 MW in 2006 and estimated 8,000 MW in 2007, followed by China at 2,600 MW in 2006. The Chinese wind energy capacity hit 6,000 MW in 2007 (GWEC 2008). The Philippines has the largest in the South-East Asia region at 25 MW and among the Pacific island countries, Fiji\u2019s is the biggest at 10 MW. Biomass is the third main type of renewable energy source feeding electricity to the main grid. Cogeneration systems using agricultural wastes, such as bagasse, rice husk, wood waste and oil palm empty fruit bunches, can generate heat and power simultaneously with high efficiency and short payback times of only 2-4 years. Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam have all installed such grid-connected biomass power production facilities (Lacrosse and Shakya 2004).12 Small hydropower systems contribute the most among electrification technologies based on renewable energy that feed the main grid. Over sixty percent of the total global installations are in China (REN21 2008). Other Asian countries that have substantial small hydropower plants include India, Indonesia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Compared with other renewable systems, small hydropower installations provide AC electricity full time and at greater power. They are usually developed as community-based energy systems and have often been able to provide energy services more equitably while offering sufficient power for productive end uses in rural and remote areas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d1a2759-7e1c-43fe-9de8-99fa4f1b93a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d1a2759-7e1c-43fe-9de8-99fa4f1b93a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "977f36ab9c293c0e55e57ce5fcba31ca95030abbe09a4a004ec85c00805503d5"}, "2": {"node_id": "6595d0e2-2329-4b2a-a4c2-ce2057f0b30b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47ea33960c2495026339db2d69f6fad5c752598f13ee7f31664994819e4d9bf3"}}, "hash": "5dfd5c9d1b074364fc6e4f1f4f952c1690b084066676d75dbbb5f35b6ee996f1", "text": "However, scaling up those community-based models remains a challenge. (b) Heating based on renewable energy Renewable energy sources remain the major fuels used for heating, with cooking and space heating being the main applications. Traditional biomass dominates globally but modern biomass heating systems are increasingly being used, while solar heaters are becoming more common and greater use is also being made of geothermal energy (Table 3-8). Traditional biomass is the main heating source for most developing countries especially in rural areas. It also remains significant in urban areas, particularly for poor households.

Modern biomass heating systems, coupled with sustainable biomass resource management practices, such as sustainable forest management, integration of fuelwood production in farm systems and use of agricultural wastes, can supplant traditional biomass heating and be competitive with petroleum-fuel-based technologies. Modern biomass energy systems include improved stoves, boilers, kilns and ovens. They also include biogas systems and biomass gasifiers. Biomass heating technologies are used not only in households but also in enterprises and institutions for large-scale cooking and other heating applications. 41 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Table 3-8 Global use of renewable energy for heating Figure 3-7 Biomass heating in developing countries of Asia Renewable energy source Added during 2005 Stock at the end of 2005 Added during 2006 Stock at the end of 2006 Added during 2007 (est.)

Biogas is a gaseous fuel with low heat value, as measured in British thermal units (BTU), and is composed of methane and carbon dioxide. It can substitute for LPG and kerosene for cooking and other heating applications. Three of the most successful countries in biogas applications are China, India and Nepal. They have developed the technology to commercial stages. It has been reported that Nepal provides 40-75 percent subsidies for family-scale biogas plants (Nepal 2008, REN21 2008). By 2006, China had 20 million biogas users but India too is now making biogas a priority and has about four million household- scale plants (Nepal 2008, REN21 2008) and Nepal (2008) reported that as of July 2007 there were 172 500 biogas plants in Nepal. Gasification, where biomass is only partially combusted to generate producer gas, is another alternative. Producer gas, composed of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, is another low-BTU gaseous fuel that can be used for high-temperature heating applications. There has been a revival of biomass gasifiers and their direct use for heating, led primarily by China and India. All types of biomass, including cut twigs and branches, can be used to generate producer gas which means that users need lop off only parts of trees and thus can harvest biomass more sustainably. 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0.00 Maldives Bhutan Lao PDR Cambodia Sri Lanka Nepal Myanmar Bangladesh Viet Nam Malaysia Philippines Pakistan Thailand Indonesia India China Percent Wood Energy Other Biomass Energy Sources Other Energy Sources 42 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences (c) Solar thermal systems Solar thermal systems have also now become cost competitive as a result of high petroleum prices.

China continues to be the world leader also in installing new capacity (about 80 percent of or 14 GWth) created in 2005. China has been installing solar water heaters at a rate of approximately 10-20 million sq. m. a year, which is 6 or 7 times the European rate (Palz 2006, REN21 2008). There are sometimes large variations in adoption of solar water-heating technologies even among neighbouring countries. Over 100 small workshops in Kathmandu, where the technology was first introduced in the early-1970s, fabricate solar water heaters. Many new houses in the Kathmandu Valley build-in solar collectors into their design. However, this technology is not common in other countries in the Himalayan region where it would be equally applicable. Pakistan and Bhutan have very few solar water heaters, perhaps as a result of inexpensive natural gas and hydroelectricity in the two countries respectively. However, solar water heaters are starting to be adopted in the hilly states of India.

Technological advances in the design of automobiles have also significantly contributed to the increased use of biofuels as the transport sector is the main target for biofuel use. Liquid biofuels have potential to displace petroleum fuels around the world and many countries are in the process of establishing policies to promote their use. Biofuels sales reached US$16 billion globally in 2005, achieving a 15 percent increase over 2004 (Makower at la. 2006). Biofuels consist largely of ethanol to replace gasoline in spark-ignition engines and methyl esters to replace diesel in compression engines. Ethanol (or bioethanol) comes mainly from corn or sugarcane, although it is also produced on a smaller scale from sugar beets and wheat. Biodiesel is presently derived from vegetable oils such as rapeseed, soy, palm and coconut. One of the newer crops being widely promoted for biodiesel production worldwide, including Asian countries, is jatropha. This is a drought-resistant perennial that can be planted even in wastelands, is easy to establish and grows relatively quickly. There have been substantial social and political pressures to promote its use, supposedly as a means of reducing poverty. World trends in the production of ethanol and biodiesel are shown in figure 3-9. Fuel ethanol production reached 39 billion litres in 2006. Output of biodiesel is expanding even more rapidly, though from a smaller base; by 2006 it had reached almost six billion litres. Even so, the 33 billion litres of ethanol produced in 2005 (REN21 2006) were equivalent to only 1.2 percent of the worldwide production of gasoline by volume \u2013 and an even smaller proportion, about 0.8 percent, in terms of transport-distance travelled, because of its lower energy content. Global ethanol production more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 (figure 3-10) and increased by a further 18 percent in 2006. Over 21 countries currently produce fuel ethanol (REN21 2008). Until 2005 Brazil was the dominant bioethanol producer, making the fuel from sugarcane. However, in 2006 it was surpassed by the United States, a corn-based producer. The United States produced 18.3 billion litres of fuel ethanol or 46.9 percent of the world\u2019s total, in that year while Brazil produced 17.5 billion litres or 44.9 percent of the total. Despite the increase in production, demand for imported ethanol increased six-fold in the United States. In Asia, the principal producers are China and India and they are also in the forefront of biofuels development (REN21 2008). Thailand aims to reduce the cost of oil imports while also supporting cassava growers, and has announced mandates for 10 percent ethanol mix in gasoline starting in 2007. For similar reasons, to support coconut growers, the Philippines announced mandates for 2 percent biodiesel and 5 percent ethanol beginning in 2007.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a248b45-4c66-4d8e-be75-d9a847ea463c": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a248b45-4c66-4d8e-be75-d9a847ea463c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf23060634f03ff68b6164277262d18d2a8aa1a66a75a7a0d12fc1c4b3a47151"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb86bd1a-290c-4a25-8ddb-173a8e94fa70", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6ae9074260a7b822861e60cbf7bbccef957adbcf67b74d0e5f9670f17150592"}}, "hash": "1cc6550bbc7ac63ab89f835326da8acde4e9b1bffd6c6005d8043ca2fdc1ad3a", "text": "In both Indonesia and Malaysia there are plans to expand biodiesel production from palm oil (REN21 2008, Worldwatch Institute 2006).

By way of contrast, ethanol accounts for just 2 percent of transportation fuel in the United States (Worldwatch Institute 2006). The European Union (EU) increased fuel ethanol production by 70 percent in 2005 and around 78 percent in 2006 although production remains at low levels relative to Brazil and the United States. In addition to Brazil, China and India that were the first countries to enact mandates for blending biofuels into vehicle fuels; at least 14 other countries have enacted similar mandates at the national level in recent years (REN 21 2005, REN21 2008). The Brazilian Government has recognized the need to ensure that economic benefits from biodiesel production also reach poor farmers when the production of biodiesel expands in that country (Worldwatch Institute 2006). Biofuels generate jobs in deprived communities where there are very few opportunities for work. The high profit margin in biofuels as a result of current petroleum prices allows investors to reinvest in, and expand, their operations.13 The Brazilian sugarcane industry provides work to about 1 million workers in activities related to ethanol production, implying that 20 cubic metres of annual ethanol production is required for each job created (Moreira 2005). 44 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences 50 40 30 20 10 0 Billion Liters/Year Biodiesel Ethanol 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 (est.) 2000 2005 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 World Billion Liters/Year Brazil United States China EU Canada 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 US\u00a2 per litre of oil equivalent Peak Oil Price Supply Shock Baseline Energy Security 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 Biodiesel Brazil Biodiesel other countries Figure 3-9 World ethanol and biodiesel production, 2000-2007 Figure 3-10 Global fuel ethanol production, 2000 and 2005 Figure 3-11 Comparison of diesel and biodiesel prices, 2007-2020 Source: REN21 2008 Source: REN21 2008 Note: Figure based on original REP-PoR oil scenario study 45 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Figure 3-12 Weekly prices for vegetable oils at Rotterdam, January 2006 to May 2007 900 850 800 750 700 650 600 550 500 450 400 Weekly Oil Prices in Rotterdam (US-$/T) Jan06 Mar06 Jun06 Aug06 Oct06 Jan07 Mar07 May07 From 1 Jan 2006 until 16 May 2007 Rape oil, EU Sun oil, EU Soya oil, EU Crude palm oil, EU Global biodiesel production amounted to around 6 billion litres a year in 2006, with most of this production concentrated in Germany and Italy, making the EU the leading producer of biodiesel. Germany alone continued accounting for half of global biodiesel production in 2006 (REN21 2008). Production had already increased by 75 percent in the EU and tripled in the United States in 2005. While conventional diesel vehicles can run on 5-30 percent blends of biodiesel and fossil diesel, several European vehicle manufacturers have approved the use of 100 percent biodiesel in their engines. Other supportive countries include Australia, China, India, Republic of Korea, and Japan. (e) Biofuel production costs Biofuel production costs depend on a large number of factors, including technology, economies of scale, the price of the feedstock materials and competition for land uses. As a result, they vary among producers. For example, the price per litre of oil equivalent ranged from US$30 in Brazil to US$100 in Germany for bioethanol. Biodiesel prices are generally higher, between US$60 and US$80 per litre of petroleum diesel equivalent [Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) 2005]. Figure 3-11 compares the current expected prices, after refining but without distribution costs or taxes, of biodiesel with diesel, using the four oil-price scenarios presented earlier. This shows that Brazil, at US$45 per litre of oil equivalent, would be capable of producing competitive biodiesel under all scenarios but that other countries, whose prices are currently above US$70 per litre of oil equiva- lent, would be competitive only under the \u201cshock\u2019 and \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenarios. There are some concerns that rising biofuels demand will push up the prices of vegetable oils. From January 2006 to mid-2007, there were substantial increases in the prices for soya oil, sunflower oil and especially palm oil, for which the price increased from US$425 to US$775 per ton (Figure 3-12).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c937701-00bf-49a4-a2bb-d6f820ad89dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c937701-00bf-49a4-a2bb-d6f820ad89dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79420e2073b20c55ac9109d9dccde7467e86dfc603a85dfb952d9c397a2c79c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa6ddbda-beca-4ef7-a717-c92003a99437", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69b25b6df1358f6624e5a1b3d3223cd7a5cc291bc204042061803c94edd5bad2"}}, "hash": "abcfa68b348b632391559875012733661513f4cd14ba648926db5deab413b082", "text": "This could inhibit long-term investments in biodiesel production even as investment in the production of the feedstock crops is increasing.

Multilateral, bilateral and other public financing flows for new renewables in developing countries reached US$600-700 million per year during 2005-2007. Much of those funds were used for supporting training, policy development, market facilitation, technical assistance and other non-investment needs. The three main funding sources have been the German Development Finance Group (Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau or KfW), the World Bank Group, and the GEF. KfW committed US$300 million to renewables in developing countries in 2007. In the same year, the World Bank Group committed US$ 220 million to renewables (excluding US$ 130 million in GEF co-financing and carbon finance) plus US$690 million for large hydropower. In total, the World Bank Group committed US$ 1.2 billion to renewables in 2007, almost double the amount during the two previous years. According to a pledge made in 2004, the Group is expected to keep increasing its funding on renewables and energy efficiency through the year 2009. The World Bank, UNDP, UNEP and several other agencies implement renewable energy projects that are co-financed by GEF. Over several years the GEF allocation on such projects has averaged US$100 million each year (REN21 2008). In addition, bilateral assistance agencies, other United Nations agencies and ADB finance renewable energy and recipient-country Governments contribute to development assistance projects. The aid from these sources for new renewables is often in the range of US$5 \u2013 US$25 million per year. Specific-purpose investment funds and credit lines established by some of the donors aim at attracting additional private financing (REN21 2008). Public sector investment in renewable energy seems certain to increase in the coming years. Local financing of developing country renewable energy markets Local financing for renewable energy in developing countries has been expanding. Donors and market facilitators are helping to increase the number of local financing entities for renewable energy and finding ways to mitigate financing risks for private investors. One often cited example is the India Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) that has provided almost US$1.5 billion in financing for 2.5 GW of renewables since its inception in 1987 (REN21 2005). The Renewable Energy Business Fund (REBF) has been established in Malaysia to support a full- scale model project under the \u201cBiomass-based Power Generation and Cogeneration in the Palm Oil Industry\u201d initiative. The purpose of this Fund is to provide a financing facility to enable palm oil mills to convert residues to generating electricity. The project, supported by the Government of Malaysia, UNDP-GEF and the private sector, amounts to some US$21 million of which UNDP-GEF is contributing about US$8 million. Key strategies include providing information services and awareness on biomass energy technology and addressing barriers to the adoption of renewable energy by improving institutional capacity, financial support and policy development. However, an unresolved issue is the extent to which expansion of palm plantations at the expense of complex tropical forest ecosystems and habitat is environmentally acceptable, much less sustainable. The Malaysia Electricity Supply Industry Trust Account (MESITA) provides financial assistance for rural electrification, energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, as well as for relevant research funding. A regular source of funding exists, since power generators are required to contribute 1 percent of their annual audited revenue to the Account [Australian Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE) 2005a]. In Thailand, the Energy Conservation Promotion Act has been in place since 1992 and promotes energy conservation investment in factories and buildings. Under the Act, the Energy Conservation Promotion Fund (ENCON Fund) has been established to provide financial support to sustainable energy initiatives. The support is targeted at government agencies, state enterprises, NGOs, individuals and businesses that are prepared to implement measures to conserve energy. A regular source of funding also exists for the ENCON Fund as it is financed by a levy on petroleum products.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d0aa875-dbe8-455c-a23a-a6c4569a6848": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d0aa875-dbe8-455c-a23a-a6c4569a6848", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "097e32bc3bf91460402c7d37ad5a0d3bf46b0d35e1cca82cede22cfbba4efc73"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b8af298-8e14-46e9-b305-52beafdce86e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "247e8e2b73db7e2da9e5923092d6ff1df1888bb3128a0d5eeb9e6fdb78fddce0"}}, "hash": "67a3695f8c9fa4fc8406bfd8be907b39dacaeb2f15b9511ad48e37a126a156cc", "text": "APEC reported that the inflow is approximately THB 1,500 million (US$38 million) per year into the fund and that the balance, as of April 2006, was in the ENCON Fund is approximately THB 6,000 million (US$150 million) (APEC 2006). 47 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences The Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund was initiated by Thailand\u2019s Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE) in January 2003 to support financial sector involvement in energy efficiency projects.

The ENCON Fund allocated an initial amount of US$50 million to the Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund in Phase 1 and a similar amount was drawn for Phase 2 (APEC 2006). The Clean Energy Finance Bank opened in Nepal in September 2006 as a private sector bank to make credit available to hydropower and to promote other clean energy projects. The renewable energy private sector During 2006 and 2007 large investors began to take an interest in the potential of the renewable energy sector worldwide and they are partly responsible for the aggressive growth in related technologies. By mid-year in 2007 some 140 publicly-traded renewable energy companies or renewable energy divisions of major companies all over the world shared a total market capitalization of more than US$ 100 billion. The number of such investors, who each had a market capitalization of more than $US 40 million, has increased by 65 percent since mid-2006. (REN21 2008, REN21 2006) In 2006, global wind and solar markets reached US$17.9 billion and US$15.6 billion, up 52 percent and 39 percent respectively, from a year earlier. In the same year, the global market for biofuels reached US$15.7 billion, up more than 31 percent from 2005 (Makower et al. 2007). In addition to growing investments in renewable energy capacity worldwide, the solar PV and biofuels industries made substantial capital investments in new manufacturing plant and equipment in 2006/2007. The solar PV industry investments were about US$8 billion in 2006 and they were expected to reach US$10 billion in 2007. Investment in new biofuels production capacity worldwide was estimated to exceed US$4 billion in 2007 (REN 21 2008). $0 $25 $50 $75 $100 $125 $150 $175 $200 $225 2006 2016 Biofuels Clean Energy Projected Growth 2006-2016 ($US Billions) Wind Power Solar Power Fuel Cells TOTAL $15.6 $226.5 $69.3 $60.8 $80.9 $1.4 $55.4 $15.6 $17.9 $20.5 Figure 3-13 Projected growth of clean energy, 2006-2016 (billions of dollars) Source: Makower et al. 2007 Investment in local and diverse biomass power and heat industries is often made by the same companies that generate waste biomass resources. They include timber and paper companies and sugar mills. China continues to dominate the market for small hydropower and solar water heaters. European industry is a major exporter to those countries that do not have their own small hydropower manufacturing base. There is also a recently established but growing market within Europe for upgrading and refurbishing existing plants (REN21 2005). Venture capital and major corporations Renewable technologies have started attracting funds from venture capitalists and multinational corporations alike (Sawin 2004). BP and Royal Dutch/Shell have been significant investors in renewable energy development, although Shell has since withdrawn from the PV business. GE, which supplied 15 percent of the global wind turbine market in 2003, has also entered the PV market and is participating in one of the largest solar power projects in Asia, a three-megawatt facility being developed at Yong Gwang, Republic of Korea, from which electricity will be transmitted to the national grid. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) with GEF has financed a 1 MW PV facility for use in 48 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences tandem with a 9 MWe hydroplant in the Philippines. Citigroup, one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, has announced plans to begin investing in renewable energy (Sawin 2004), while Goldman Sachs has also made major investments in the sector. Projections for renewable energy markets have been carried out by a number of market research companies, which forsee a positive scenario for renewables, especially wind and solar PV for power generation, as well as for biofuels. One market forecast put the size of the annual wind electric power market at over US$60 billion in 2016 (Figure 3\u201313). However, the location of this growth and its manufacturing base is set to change. Previously, growth has mainly taken place in Germany, Denmark and Spain in onshore wind. This is expected to shift towards the developing world, as well as the United States, where wind power has been growing over several years now owing to the extension of the production tax credit through 2008 with plans to extend it further to 2012\u25002013.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4022237-9402-40e1-9c75-d774d89b2e80": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4022237-9402-40e1-9c75-d774d89b2e80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92dbb142ac9af171dc1b299d576326289b9a198acb1780066793efbfe0e51d3b"}, "2": {"node_id": "695adece-ea3d-4a76-bedd-59c6acc5fc96", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4db865b9da880aa64b665199ea0ed7f00d667ae1abaa02ab4600f0b24f64f96c"}}, "hash": "8500a573408ec768b52098f0eeaf09ac81ed088f31ab5a9f244f6cf2afc932b8", "text": "In Asia, China plans for up to 20 GW of wind electric capacity by 2020.

According to another report, the PV industry is expected to continue its rapid expansion over the next decade (UNDESA 2005). Most of the growth is expected to be in grid-connected markets driven by PV-targeted subsidies in Germany and Japan, as well as in the United States. Biofuels are forecast to grow from around US$20.5 billion in 2006 to US$80.9 billion by 2016 (Makower et la. 2007). IEA projects that world biofuels production could nearly quadruple, to more than 120 billion litres by 2020, if supportive policies continue to proliferate (IEA 2005). 49 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Trends in costs of energy produced by RETs Renewable energy electrification technologies can be cost competitive with conventional large- scale power generation facilities as shown in a recent study (IEA 2002). Based on the experience of developed and developing countries, IEA (2003) estimated the costs of generating electricity using biomass, solar, small hydropower, wind and geothermal technologies. Table 3-9 presents the findings, showing that at the lower end of the cost spectrum a number of sources, such as biomass, small hydropower, wind and geothermal power plants can, under optimal conditions, generate electricity at 2 to 5 cents per kWh. The results show that renewables are on a par with wholesale electricity prices compared with conventional large-scale power generation facilities based on coal, natural gas and nuclear energy. Even at the higher end of the scale, small hydropower, thermal and wind systems produce energy at costs within the retail consumer power price. Off-grid and mini-grid systems are used widely in developing countries as electricity flowing through the national grid does not reach many rural areas, particularly those that are remotely located. In those rural and remote areas, gasoline \u2013 or diesel-powered gensets are operated by utilities or local governments and in some cases, also by private operators for local electricity supply. They are standalone systems, typically 5 kW or less in capacity, providing electricity needed for irrigation, agroprocessing such as grain milling and for nearby households. Where electricity demand is higher owing to more extensive agroprocessing and off-farm livelihood activities, the solution is to install bigger diesel generators, providing up to 500 kW to power mini-grids \u2013 electricity networks at the village or district level. In addition, nearby households connect to such systems. Even so, few poor rural households can be found connected to these mostly oil-based mini-grids as the electricity generation costs, driven primarily by fuel costs, remains unaffordable. Most off-grid and mini-grid systems based on renewable energy could be cheaper than gasoline or diesel generators. A recent study made an economic assessment of the relative costs of electricity generation from systems based on both renewable energy and fossil fuels that included off-grid and mini-grid electrification (World Bank 2005).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51e45872-260c-40aa-8804-023c35bde26c": {"__data__": {"id_": "51e45872-260c-40aa-8804-023c35bde26c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48d0d07ae31e51b308adbd1c5097dd4603baa8986f846acf7d2f54a4bbe3056d"}, "2": {"node_id": "45e40446-947c-43a3-8424-cbb4f8084e8d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fd44cd4fb73987144b35e28d0a199a6e6f3c956cc050eab8b761c1bc83f9f7da"}}, "hash": "cd8a376a1804a992daa8b8cd8257004d7ea11746068e82f6cee984233e90ee82", "text": "Different operating conditions were considered and the study anticipated that in 2004-2015 the prices of those technologies would fall as a result of technological innovation and mass production \u2013 though by differing amounts corresponding to the maturity of each technology (Table 3-10).

Off-grid renewable energy systems The competitiveness of off-grid renewable energy systems as compared with systems based on fossil fuels was analyzed under different crude oil price scenarios in a UNDP (2007) study (see Box 2-2). The competitiveness of pico-hydropower14, solar PV, wind power and a solar PV-wind hybrid with gasoline gensets for off-grid electrification was analyzed using assumptions made in the World Bank (2005) study cited above. A ten-year project life span was assumed in analyzing the generation costs of the various technologies. a) Renewable energy technologies versus gasoline gensets Using the lower cost estimates, all off-grid renewable energy electrification technologies are cheaper than gasoline gensets under all oil-price scenarios (Figure 3-14). Using the most probable cost estimates, wind, small hydropower and hybrid systems remain cheaper under all scenarios. But solar PV was more expensive, except under the \u201csupply shock\u201d scenario and in later years, except for both \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenarios (Figure 3-15). The same results are obtained if the higher cost estimates for renewables are compared with the generation cost for a gasoline genset (Figure 3-16). 50 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences A UNDP study analyzing the impact of rising oil prices on poverty eradication considered the following four oil price scenarios: \u2022 Baseline \u2013 Oil prices remain between US$65-US$75 per barrel \u2022 Supply Shock \u2013 A supply crisis suddenly pushes prices beyond $100 per barrel in the short \u2013 to medium- term, but over the long term prices decline to their previous levels. \u2022 Peak Oil \u2013 This assumes that the world is reaching peak oil production. Prices rise gradually towards US$100 per barrel and increase exponentially thereafter. \u2022 Energy Security \u2013 Concerns for both energy and environmental security lead to reduced oil demand, so prices fall back to a lower equilibrium at around US$50 per barrel Source: UNDP 2007 Box 3-2 Future oil price scenarios Figure 3-14 Cost comparison of off-grid renewable systems versus gasoline gensets, lower cost trends, 2004-2015 Figure 3-15 Cost comparison of off-grid renewable systems versus gasoline gensets, most probable cost trends, 2004-2015 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 2004 Gasoline baseline Gasoline supply shock Gasoline energy security Gasoline peak oil price 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Generating cost (US$/kWh) Note: REP-POR estimates based on the World Bank (2005) study Technical and Economic Assessment: Off-Grid, Mini-Grid and Grid Electrification Technologies and regional study, Overcoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices on the Poor and the Implications for the Achievement of the MDGs.

For remote and underdeveloped rural communities of the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific, the results have considerable significance. They underline the viability of renewable energy for use both by households and for income generation. RETs can be used to increase agricultural production by providing affordable energy for irrigation, grain milling and other crop processing activities that can be intensified with the use of electricity. Electricity can also be used for diversifying and increasing rural production by making possible the operation of hatcheries, aerated fish farms and refrigeration systems for storage and preservation of agricultural produce. Electricity can also be available to power small electric motors in rural, off-farm SMMEs, paving the way for rural industrialization. If agriculture and rural economic development programmes are successful in eradicating poverty, that success can be enhanced and strengthened through the use of RETs-based electricity supply. Growth trends in renewable energy markets in Asia and the Pacific Grid-connected systems Grid-connected renewables in Asia are dominated by small hydropower, biomass-based generation and wind power. Grid-connected solar PV systems are still a novelty in much of the region, with installations limited to a few pilots in the 100-1,000 kWp range. China dominates the small hydropower sector with almost 64 percent of global capacity in the end of 2006 (REN21 2008) and the fastest growth in installations Worldwide, small hydropower is growing at about 10-11 percent a year (REN21 2008, REN21 2006). Other countries in Asia with dynamic small hydropower sectors are India, Indonesia, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Modern industrial-scale, grid-connected, biomass cogeneration systems use agricultural wastes such as bagasse, rice husk, wood wastes and oil palm empty fruit bunches as fuel for efficient production of heat and power in the 1-10 MWe range. The systems are commercially very successful in the region, with typical payback times of 2-4 years. Malaysia and Thailand initiated cogeneration projects with the support of the European Commission (EC)-ASEAN Programme on Technology Transfer for Energy Cogeneration from Biomass in ASEAN countries (COGEN programme), managed by the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) and Carl Bro International AB of Sweden, and have subsequently formulated and implemented their own national programmes.15 Thailand had installed by mid-2006 over 1,500 MW of biomass cogeneration under its small producers programme since 1994 (REN21 2008). Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam also have some biomass-based IPPs but the numbers are much smaller than in Thailand owing to the lack of transparent, consistent and financially attractive IPP laws, regulations and feed-in tariffs. India is the leader in grid-connected wind energy systems in Asia, with an estimated 8.0 GWe of installed capacity in 2007 (GWEC 2008). India overtook Denmark to be the fourth-largest installer of such systems at the end of 2005. China had 2.6 GWe of wind electric capacity in 2006 and has been adding capacity quickly in recent years; 500 MWe were added in 2005 and 1350 MWe in 2006 (REN21 2006, REN21 2008). Chinese wind energy capacity is estimated to have jumped to 6,050 GWe in the end of 2007. China\u2019s on-shore and off-shore wind energy potential is estimated to be 1,000 GWe and 300 GWe, respectively, according to a national research study carried out in 2007 (GWEC 2008). Earlier wind energy resource mapping conducted under the UNEP/GEF Solar and Wind Energy Resource Assessment (SWERA) programme estimated that the potential is many tens of gigawatts,. In 2005 Japan had around 1.2 GW of wind-power systems and was ranked ninth in the world that year (REN21 2006), while a 20 MWe wind farm is under construction in the Philippines and there are plans to develop several hundred megawatts more over the next several years.16 Pakistan has recently taken some steps to develop its wind resources, signing Letters of Intent to develop over 1,000 MW.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d83e6682-56a6-4f41-95e8-62d484739cc2": {"__data__": {"id_": "d83e6682-56a6-4f41-95e8-62d484739cc2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "020c562f80e6491aed633ed07770b32fbcd15041ea1c1e2fc1451e850c45ad66"}, "2": {"node_id": "3077c606-6c90-4b6a-abb7-6780778744f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43f3f6991c0b9cb2e23db29ebdb491d17040ed4baf0a5126fe0bfc25a0a91795"}}, "hash": "a6a217d9d1326a297d57a4dfebae2b162815034475184a441151a67ebaeb5faa", "text": "In the Pacific, Fiji has a small, grid-tied, 10 MWe wind electric power plant.

Some 650,000 SHSs have been installed in China. The rural electrification programme in Thailand used such systems during 2003-2006 to electrify about 200,000 households and Bangladesh has over 150 000 households with SHSs (REN21 2008). Nepal and Sri Lanka have all installed close to 80,000 SHSs each. By 2004 in Indonesia there were about 40,000 of SHSs installed through several donor programmes but the continued growth had started slowing down owing to macroeconomic difficulties (REN21 2005). There are active programmes to promote off-grid solar home systems in Bangladesh, China, India, Mongolia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. Two major initiatives have been launched by the World Bank in collaboration with the host countries. One is the Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development (RERED) project in Sri Lanka, which expanded on the success of the earlier Energy for Sustainable Development programme. The other is the ongoing Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development Project (REREDP) in Bangladesh, which has incorporated end-user financing and has expanded the reach of the programme. Most of China\u2019s market has developed in recent years on a commercial basis, mainly in the north-western provinces and autonomous regions of Qinghai, Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and Gansu. In those isolated regions, a fairly well-developed solar industry and infrastructure now exist for installation, distribution and maintenance (REN21 2005). With the recent emergence of high-efficiency, white-light, LED lighting, it has become feasible to have bright reading lights and flashlights that can use very small rechargeable batteries. While small solar panels are available for charging, they can also be charged through simple hand cranks built into the lights, with a minute of cranking resulting in about 30 minutes of light bright enough for hand work and for reading. PV water pumping \u2013 There are now more than 50,000 solar-PV pumps worldwide, of which a large number is in India. The Solar Photovoltaic Water Pumping Programme of the Indian Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources installed over 4,000 solar pumps (ranging from 200-2,000 W) in the rural areas. Pilot projects in Maldives and Philippines have also introduced solar PV powered pumping and purification (REN21 2005). Small wind power \u2013 China has produced a large number of isolated wind energy systems that have been installed in Inner Mongolia and by pastoral communities in China. Village-scale mini-grids \u2013 Village-scale mini-grids serving tens or hundreds of households are powered by diesel or propane generators, or microhydropower units. Generation from solar PV, wind or biomass, often in hybrid combinations including batteries and diesel generators, provides an additional technical approach that is beginning to be used on a pilot basis, as for example, in China as part of the national \u201cBrightness Program\u201d. In China there are tens of thousands of mini- grids, which are primarily based on small hydropower, while in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam the numbers of existing mini-grids are in hundreds or thousands. The Township Electrification Program in China, completed in 2004, electrified 1.5 million rural people (or about 300,000 households) in 1,000 townships with solar PV, small hydropower and some wind power. In 2006, China was planning the next programme focusing on electrifying 10,000 villages and 3.5 million rural households with renewables by 2010 which include small hydropower and up to 270 MW of solar PV. It was also reported that full rural electrification is planned in China by 2015 (REN 21 2006, REN21 2008). Thermal applications There are several cooking and heating technologies based on renewable energy that are used primarily in developing countries, especially in rural or semi-rural areas, as described below. Improved cook stoves \u2013 Large programmes for improved cook stoves have been implemented in several countries, including Cambodia, China, India, Mongolia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam. The principal approach in the region includes dissemination of artisan-built stoves using fuelwood and charcoal, where artisans and manufacturers are trained to be entrepreneurs, for example, by the Centre for Rural Technology (CRT) in Nepal, the Appropriate Rural Technology Institute (ARTI) in 56 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences India and CFSP in Cambodia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eac072b4-c6d1-4edc-805f-050b8556dbee": {"__data__": {"id_": "eac072b4-c6d1-4edc-805f-050b8556dbee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4cc086a219ebcf90b2cf4e5409dcbc449ff90b0612278979b0bd0260468060c3"}, "2": {"node_id": "16cef02d-d9ce-464b-8877-29198fb29a07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1cc994771673b273dad4e92407a574eeb8245bee7442eb26262d899a1a080155"}}, "hash": "a2a09fa66808f75cb934c006cec8a29968e212c55f19fdaf189c750bc69ec58a", "text": "Rural households pay for artisans\u2019 services.

However, in the absence of sufficient maintenance, repair support and quality control, a large number of them soon fell into disrepair and were abandoned. Experience suggests that unlike the assumption that fuel saving is the primary benefit, users place a high value on the other benefits of the stoves such as cleanliness, time saved, convenience and aesthetics, among others. Stoves sold in the market have been able to meet those expectations. The element of space heating was incorporated in improved cook stove programmes in China, India, Mongolia and Nepal, especially in high altitude areas.

Unfortunately, there is little information on how the programme has been faring since this development. Worldwide there are 220 million improved cook stoves in use, while there are about 570 million households that depend on traditional biomass as their primary cooking fuel. China, with its 180 million existing improved stoves, has by far the largest share of the improved cook stove market (REN21 2005, REN21 2008). Biogas digesters \u2013 The number of biogas users continues to increase in China, India and Nepal, with China reporting 20 million existing biogas users in 2006 (REN21 2008). The technology behind the biogas digesters is relatively simple and requires no advanced expertise thus enabling small local companies to produce them locally. Once the framers are trained, they can build the digesters themselves. In China alone it is estimated that over a million biogas digesters are being produced annually in this manner (Martinot 2005). India has about 3.9 million household-scale biogas plants installed by 2006 (REN21 2008). The hallmark of the Indian biogas program has been an active involvement of NGOs in its implementation. Government-supported commercialization through private companies has been the dominant approach in the Biogas Support Programme (BSP) of Nepal since 1992. By the end of 2005 more than 150,000 units were installed, of which 96 percent were found to be performing well. The programme has provided quality control, financing and market development support for household- scale biogas plants (sized 4 \u2013 10 cubic metres, with the most popular being 6 cubic metres). Nepal 57 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences has also provided around 30 percent subsidies for those biogas plants. During the programme, technical and market capabilities of 60 private biogas companies were strengthened, 100 microcredit organizations were been mobilized to provide loans, and quality standards were developed (AEPC 2006, REN21 2005). A permanent market facilitation organization, Biogas Sector Partnership-Nepal (BSP-Nepal), was established to continue the successful model developed by BSP. The approach is now being transferred to Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam. Programme support has been in areas of technology standardization, quality control, training, grants and financing support for users. Biogas plants have been able to bring about significant quality-of-life benefits to users, but have succeeded to a lesser extent in terms of bringing about economic gains and poverty reduction. Biomass gasifiers \u2013 Small-scale biomass gasification is becoming popular as a commercial technology in many developing countries, especially in China and India but also, for example, in Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand. In China there are provinces, where producer gas from thermal gasifiers is provided through piped distribution networks for cooking (REN21 2005). All types of biomass, including cut twigs and branches, can be used to generate producer gas. Thus, users need lop off only parts of trees and biomass can be harvested more sustainably, resulting in a cheap fuel.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27dcd84f-808f-4f83-801b-a613d9ea63d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "27dcd84f-808f-4f83-801b-a613d9ea63d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44cf2920b7553e44e158ecc4641872fcc9c00fd7301654210fdb3025c1f8df86"}, "2": {"node_id": "0465f003-5cec-46e7-aec0-86f8c2843410", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3339fd02a16666f149995f39318717e4a3f74efd9ddd7ddf1951dbd30a1c0675"}}, "hash": "01c87a2d58629408e2f8025a5d9e006c016f550be5027036aea042cd92a8f897", "text": "In India, producer gas is less than one tenth of the price of grid electricity and costs less than logs, coal and petroleum products (Figure 3-23).

China expects to triple its capacity in PV module manufacturing between 2005 and 2008. India is already an important producer of solar PV components and systems. Growth of the installation of wind turbines has also lately resulted in the transfer of technology for manufacture of components to China and India. Emerging RET markets in Asia and the Pacific Disparities in investment and manufacturing capacities by regions, by country and by technology Developing countries account for around 43 percent of renewable power installations, with China and India responsible for 30 percent of the global capacity. In terms of technology, developing countries dominate in small hydropower at 70 percent of global capacity and in biomass-based generation at 49 percent of the global total in 2006. However, in the \u201cnew\u201d renewables, such as wind power and solar PV, the share of developing countries is much smaller. In 2003, industrialized countries accounted for 92 percent of the installed capacity in wind power and 88 percent of PV cell production (UNDESA 2005). At the end of 1995, developing countries had increased their share of installed global wind power to a still modest 11 percent. Just six countries \u2013 Denmark, Germany, India, Japan, Spain and the United States \u2013 account for about 80 percent of global PV and wind power capacity. In 2007, India and China accounted for almost one quarter of global wind power capacity (GWEC 2008). The fastest growing energy technology in the world is grid-connected solar PV, in which installed capacity grew 60 percent per year during 2000 to 2004 (REN21 2005). During 2005 and 2006 global capacity grew from 3.5 GW to 5.1 GW while the estimate for 2007 is 7.8 GW. The top three in existing and added capacity in 2006 were Germany, Japan and the United States (REN21 2008). There are large differences among the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific. Reflecting their combined populations, China and India account for over 70 percent of all RET installations among developing countries (REN21 2008). China dominates in terms of absolute investment in renewables, tying with Germany as the largest global investor. It also has the largest manufacturing base in the world for small hydropower and solar water heaters. Within the region, the Pacific island countries, which are most in need of renewable alternatives, are slowest as a group in their adoption. 58 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Despite the current global shortage of solar-grade silicon (Makower et la. 2006), Asia is leading the increase of PV manufacturing capacity worldwide. The total market share of photovoltaic manufacturing companies based in Asia rose to 60.8 percent in 2005. China more than doubled its market share from 4.1 percent for 52 MWp in 2004 to 8.3 percent for 151 MWp in 2005. With the passage of the Renewable Energy Law, China will probably continue to gain market share in the region. Companies in Malaysia and the Philippines have expanded solar-cell manufacturing capacity and Thailand is also intending to set up a solar-module manufacturing plant. The emerging roles of China and India China and India are clearly the leaders among developing countries in RETs taken as a whole, with Brazil the leader in worldwide ethanol production. So far, developing countries have shown leadership in the \u201ctraditional\u201d renewables. China is the worldwide leader for small hydropower, solar thermal and off-grid small wind electric power and biogas. China and India are now also asserting leadership positions among developing countries in the so-called \u201cnew\u201d renewables. India is now the fourth-largest installer of wind energy in the world and both China and India are adding rapidly to their manufacturing capacity for solar PV and wind. The advantages of strong manufacturing bases in those countries accrue not only to them but also to poorer developing countries which will be able to access RETs at lower costs. China is a major exporter today of small hydropower equipment and solar water heaters. China\u2019s total annual use of renewables surpassed 115 million standard coal equivalent, accounting for 20 percent of the nation\u2019s total energy use in 2004. China has climbed to the top position globally both in total applications of renewables and in the proportion of renewables in overall energy use. The other emerging leader in renewables is India. Government commitment to achieving ambitious targets, a supportive tariff scheme, a strong manufacturing base and excellent resource potential in wind, biomass and solar make India an attractive long-term proposition for investors.

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (formerly Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources) expects renewable energy capacity to double every five years. More innovative solutions are being pioneered in parts of India where grid access is weak and distributed energy generation is necessary to meet much of the energy demand. For example, the largest hybrid solar PV-diesel system in India has recently been launched, comprising a 50 kW PV array acting alongside a base load diesel generator. Status of other countries The status of RETs in other countries of Asia and the Pacific is quite mixed. A number of countries have set renewable energy targets which they are on their way to fulfilling, even though the targets may be ambitious as in the case of Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Thailand in particular has been able to attract substantial private investment in biomass-based generation for the grid. Other countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka in South Asia are looking to renewables to meet energy access targets. They have commercialization models in place to supply solar PV home systems, household biogas and, in the cases of Nepal and Sri Lanka, community village hydropower systems. Patterns of growth in RETs Booming wind energy markets in India and China Asia\u2019s wind energy market is led by India, with 8.0 GW installed capacity at end-2007. This is followed by China (6050 MW), Japan (1538 MW), Australia (824 MW), New Zealand (322 MW), Taiwan (282 MW), the Republic of Korea (191 MW), Philippines (25 MW) and Pacific Islands (12 MW) (GWEC 2008). India\u2019s estimated wind power potential is around 65,000 MW at 50 metres above ground level and wind farms have been installed in more than eleven states (GWEC 2008). More than 95 percent of installed capacity belongs to the private sector and a good number of wind turbine manufacturers are producing wind electric generators (WEGs) of 225 kW to 2000 kW rating. A large number of agencies have been set up to supply components, spares and accessories and to provide services such as installation, operation and maintenance, as well as civil and electrical construction and consultancy (GWEC 2008). Wind-solar and wind-diesel hybrid systems have also been installed at a few places. Suzlon, India\u2019s largest manufacturer and operator of wind turbines, with over 50 percent of the domestic market and about 10 percent of the global market, recently announced plans for a 100MW wind farm in the State of Kerala.17 59 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences China is also emerging as a major market for wind energy, with the fastest growth in energy supplied from this source over the past few years. It is hoped that domestic wind turbine manufacturing by subsidiaries of international corporations will bring local benefits and keep costs low (GWEC 2008). At the same time, purely local manufacturing facilities are also emerging as domestic wind-turbine manufacturers have entered the market in recent years. The two main Chinese manufacturers, Goldwind and Sinovel Wind, accounted for 33 percent and 6 percent of the domestic market, respectively, in 2006 (REN21 2008). In 2007, their combined share of new installations was 42 percent. GWEC reports that at the end of 2007 there were 40 domestic wind turbine manufacturers and that their share of domestic equipment installation is expected to increase substantially in future (GWEC 2008). Solar PV in Asia (a) Japan, China, India, Thailand Within Asia, solar PV technology recorded the highest growth rate among various RET applications in the last decade, albeit from a very low base. In 2004, photovoltaic devices manufactured in Japan had a global market share of just over 50 percent; four of the top ten manufacturing companies in the world for such devices are Japanese. A recent study by Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia concluded that despite planned future decreases of subsidies for PV, all 25+ companies interviewed anticipated continuous growth of at least 30 percent per year for the Japanese photovoltaic market (Rogol et al. 2004). Japan had an installed capacity of 860 MWp in 2003. It was followed by Australia (45 MWp), China (45 MWp) India (44 MWp) and the Republic of Korea (6 MWp) [Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre (APERC) 2004]. Besides Japan, China is emerging as a solar PV manufacturer For the first time in 2005, a company from Taiwan Province of China, Motech Industries, reached the top-10 list of producers (J\u00e4ger- Waldau 2005).

Module production more than doubled, from 100 MW to over 250 MW, with production capacity approaching 400 MW by end of 2005. Three Chinese PV manufacturers announced plans to expand PV production by more than 1,500 MW by 2008-2010 (Nanjing CEEG PV Tech, Yingli Solar and Suntech Power) (J\u00e4ger-Waldau 2005). In 2006, China was again the market leader for PV equipment outside of the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems (PVPS) programme countries , with additional capacity of about 15 MW and total installed PV capacity reaching 85 MW (IEA 2007b). Remote and rural electrification including solar home systems, village power and pumping applications accounts for a large share of the market (approximately 50 percent reported in 2005). The target of National Village Electrification Programme is to deliver solar power to 10,000 villages (265 MW) by 2010 and to additional 18,000 villages (1,700 MW) by 2020. The Renewable Energy Law came into effect in the beginning of 2006. It is the principal national policy framework that supports the Chinese Government\u2019s announcement to meet 15 percent of the total primary energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020 (IEA 2006). The preferential area covers all modern forms of renewable energy, such as wind, solar, biomass and biogas energy, for which the Chinese Government has also established specific short \u2013 and medium-term targets (IEA 2008). The Law includes support for PV via a feed-in tariff, preferential taxes and loans and specific encouragement of building-related solar (IEA 2006).18 In India, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has been supporting PV dissemination and development for over a decade. Of the total installed PV capacity in the country, the Ministry\u2019s programmes account for about 50 percent (IEA 2006, IEA 2007b). Even though PV home-lightning systems are targeted to those villages that are not likely to receive to a grid-electrification, PV home- lightning systems will be installed in some 900 000 households (IEA 2007b). (b) Malaysia In 2006, PV growth was low in Malaysia, amounting to only 4,52 kW (IEA 2007b). In 2005, the grid- connected PV amounted to less than 15 percent of Malaysia\u2019s total installed PV capacity of 3 MW. The focus of the domestic PV sector is on the development of grid-connected, building-integrated PV. The Malaysian Building Integrated PV project, worth US$25 million, commenced in 2005 with the aim of supporting and creating a sustainable PV sector in Malaysia (IEA 2006). 60 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences (c) Sri Lanka In Sri Lanka, PV market development have been mainly driven by the RERED project. At the end of 2006 about 3.6 MW or 80,000 units of PV solar home systems were installed under the project. Earlier the Energy Services Delivery Project had installed about 1 MW of 21,000 solar home system units during 1997-2002 (IEA 2007b). The project will provide around US$28 million specifically for solar PV investments along with other renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency and demand side management measures (IEA 2006). Some additional financing to electrify at least 60,000 more households with off-grid electricity services under the RERED project was approved by the World Bank (IEA 2007b). In the Pacific, a few countries, notably Kiribati and Tonga, have achieved relatively high percentages of rural electrification through solar power through donor support. Kiribati has a successful PV- based rural energy services company that collects fees for service to cover maintenance, repair and replacement of the equipment. In contrast, Tuvalu has moved backward from nearly 40 percent of rural households electrified by solar in 1995 to almost total electrification by diesel in 2000. But with almost one million households not connected to the grid, the few thousand homes with solar power or hydropower represent only a fraction of one percent of the total off-grid electrification needs in the Pacific. Solar thermal technologies in China China dominates the market for solar water heaters. Total sales volume in 2006 in China was 19.5 million square metres, a 25 percent increase in existing capacity. China continued to be the world leader in 2006 and installed 78 percent of new global capacity (over 13.5 GWth), with almost 65 percent of global installed capacity (REN 21 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51a1bc08-0dd9-4798-a240-bdda222db9a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "51a1bc08-0dd9-4798-a240-bdda222db9a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a2f4a1ccb1cbf60f4e22d01eb44097a9a3bc32ec1e5379c2bb66fcbbc3991a8"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f050fbc-4a12-45e0-b386-1777548c21ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fd1cbc560ab5d8d39f66f1639fe7e5dd88eee67dd9316c41d4a4e0044f5a1a19"}}, "hash": "be72729eafd4abad23a56b7acc3a27f1bc6802fe44cbb367423c4da5c228cd6c", "text": "Even though there are no explicit policies in place to promote the use of solar hot water technology in multi-storey urban buildings, due to the rising energy costs and an increase in public demand ,developers have already begun incorporating the technology into their building designs and constructions.

The Chinese solar- water-heating market is driven mainly by unmet demand for hot water, economics and systems that sell for a small fraction of the prices found in developed countries. Currently, the main use of solar energy in China is the supply of hot water to urban and rural households. The cumulative installed capacity of solar water heaters surpassed in end-2006 97 million sq. m. of collector area in China (REN21 2008). By 2020 the total installed capacity of solar water heaters is expected to reach 270 million sq. m., this figure is expected to nearly double by 2050 to 500 million sq. m. This translates into a potential savings of 81 billion kWh in 2020, reducing the peak power loads by up to 110 GW. While in 2050 the potential savings are expected to reach 150 kWh, reducing peak power loads by up to 200 GW (Martinot 2005). China\u2019s manufactures lead the world in terms of solar thermal equipment, more specifically solar water heaters, with a production capacity of over 16 million sq. m per year. The top ten brands of solar water heaters including Anhui Liguang, Lianyungang Taiyangyu Company, Nantong Sangxia Company, Guangdong Jiaputong Company, Yunnan Tongle Company and Shandong Sangle Company have combined annual sales of over 100 million RMB. The diversity of the market is highlighted by the fact that the top ten brands account for only 20 percent of the market which consists of over 1,000 manufactures. The industry is not only attracting attention from manufactures within the sector but also from outside recently famous household appliance enterprises Haier, Ocma and Huati ventured into the solar hot water market (Martinot 2005). Backed by supportive policies, India and several other countries are also witnessing a boom in solar hot water installations. Emerging biofuel markets in China, India, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand By contributing to transportation fuels and in some cases, power generation, biofuels can reduce the risk many countries face of escalating fossil fuel costs which then translate into higher rates of inflation. Commercial development of biofuels, which was limited to Brazil and had spread to China, India and Malaysia, is now likely to be of interest to many developing countries with large agricultural populations. Several countries including India have mandates for this. In India, the Government mandated 10 percent ethanol blending in nine states starting in 2003. Biofuels are of particular interest to island nations that are already suffering high fuel costs owing to their small size and remoteness. Those islands grow an abundance of palm and coconut which could be turned to biodiesel. 61 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences China was the fourth largest producer of fuel ethanol in the world in 2006. Fuel ethanol production in China was estimated at 1 billion litres in 2006 (REN21 2008). Four provinces, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning and Henan require ethanol to be mixed with gasoline in a 10 percent ratio (Martinot 2005) with five additional provinces slated for a similar mandate in 2005 (UNDESA 2005, REN21 2008). In 2006, China exported about 500,000 tonnes of ethanol produced primarily from corn and cassava and shipments are expected to increase \u2013 the country had virtually no ethanol exports for fuel in 2005. China is working to increase the use of biofuels to reduce dependency on imported oil and to secure incomes for hundreds of millions of farmers. The country has plans to reserve 44 million hectares of land for biofuel feedstock production. Over the longer term, the country is looking to develop biodiesel fuels from crops such as jatropha and ethanol from cellulosic products such as agricultural and forest waste. The Government opposes the use of edible grains for production of biofuels. Commercialization activities are being accelerated in several countries such as India, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, partly because of the dramatic increase in oil prices since 2005.19 \u201cGasohol\u201d or gasoline blended with up to 5 percent alcohol (produced from cassava, sugarcane or corn) is now sold at gas stations in those countries. The Government of Thailand is supporting the development of 18 new ethanol plants.

There is much room for growth in biofuels use globally, as the world relies for 3 percent of its petrol consumption on liquid biofuels at present (Palz 2006) and demand for transportation fuels is expected to continue to grow. The Philippines has the largest, continuous-process biodiesel refinery in Asia. The Manila-based facility, owned by Chemrez and dedicated in April 2006, produces 60 million litres per year of coconut methyl ester, a high quality biodiesel fuel produced from refined coconut oil, which has important particulate emissions reduction properties when mixed with automotive diesel and used in older, often smoky vehicles in Asia. Growing small hydropower capacity in China, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam More than half of the world\u2019s small hydropower capacity exists in China, where an ongoing boom in small hydropower construction added nearly 6 GW of capacity in 2006. In 2006, capacity increased by 7 GW to total 73 GW worldwide, with 47 GW installed in China alone as the boom in small hydropower investment there continued (REN 21 2008). With the aid of loans from agricultural banks rural entrepreneurs in China have been able to establish and run small hydropower stations. Three years of revenue from the sale of electricity is said to be sufficient to repay the initial bank loan. Interconnection of multiple stations into country-level grids has been facilitated by the fact that the industry has already been put through the process of standardization (Martinot 2005). Small hydropower systems, including pico-, micro \u2013 and minihydropower, are being developed by other countries of the region, including India, Nepal and Viet Nam. There are a large number of projects that have supported mini-grids based on community-managed microhydropower systems. Government and donor support has been in terms of providing social mobilization inputs through NGOs, grants and financing to communities, and training in operations and maintenance, as well as management of systems including the integration of productive uses of electricity. The experience in Nepal with small hydropower has been positive, in terms of market expansion, private investment and increasing access for the poor and 7.6 MW of microhydropower has been developed by 2005. However, other countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have had moderate to slow growth in this sector. Viet Nam has one of the world\u2019s largest markets for small, household-scale pico-hydropower systems for which up to 150,000 generation kits have been sold. Such systems provide between 100 and 1,000 watts. However, with the large, rural, dispersed market, quality remains a problem and often means high maintenance costs which can exceed the initial capital cost. Another problem with cheaper systems is that voltages vary with water flow and can damage electrical appliances. Safety standards are also less than adequate. Viet Nam has a significant internal manufacturing capacity in the hydropower sector. Engineers at the Institute of Materials Science of the Viet Nam National Centre for Natural Sciences and Technology have designed three new types of microhydropower 62 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Endnotes 8 Comprehensive reviews of the production and use of renewable energy systems are provided in the annual reports and periodic updates of REN21, IEA and renewable energy trade journals, as well as by renewable energy industry associations such as the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC). 9 www.ashdenawards.org/winners/geres 10 Project Records HTA-02-04 and THA-00-G29 from the GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP) project database available at www.undp.org/sgp 11 Global Wind Energy Council, February 2006, www.gwec.net 12 http://www.cogen3.net/ 13 Yale Global online, available at http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=6555. 14 Pico-hydropower systems are those generating up to 300W and microhydropower from 300W to 100kW. 15 http://www.cogen3.net/ 16 The potential in the Philippines for commercial wind electric power plants is well over 10,000 MWe, as revealed by a comprehensive, high-resolution, wind energy resource assessment by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) of the Department of Energy in the United States.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf968aa6-0bd3-4092-b478-b826dd8117d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf968aa6-0bd3-4092-b478-b826dd8117d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ddb071b5717897af229aaa58ea1513df0ba8eac25472652efcdf363383c0bc85"}, "2": {"node_id": "403f97bd-636d-4c14-a71f-19f1e8d2827d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb0d830cabe998f320bdd17517b55910ad54d91fbee065809ef80ee51d1b8391"}}, "hash": "1b807940dd8f0343ce094c8d3fae9d571f205ed50c3000dde87b16dd438509ee", "text": "17 http://www.suzlon.com/ 18 From the IEA PVPS programme web site, http://www.iea-pvps.org/intro/index.htm 19 As reported in the Second Biomass-Asia Workshop, Bangkok, Thailand, 13-15 December 2005, http://unit.aist.go.jp/internat/biomassws/02workshop/about.html 20 According to BP (2007) the installed geothermal capacity remained 1930 MW in 2005 and ac- cording to IEA (2008) Selected 2005 Indicators Electricity consumption in Philippines is 49.73 TWh.

Growth in the number of SHSs is taking place where the affordability problem has been overcome with grants or microcredit and where government and international donor programmes have supported markets and capacity building. Significant innovation is occurring in financing the systems with NGO-based microfinance, dealer-supplied credit and consumer credit through commercial banks. 63 4. Barriers to Private Investment in Renewable Energy Technologies and Barriers to Access by the Poor 64 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences 4. Barriers to Private Investment in Renewable Energy Technologies and Barriers to Access by the Poor There are barriers to investment by both the private and public sectors in renewable energy projects that specifically target the poorer segments of the population. In addition, there are barriers that the poor face in gaining access to modern energy services, independent of their energy sources. This chapter addresses both of those areas. Barriers to private investment in renewables The rapid and widespread diffusion of renewable energy options, especially for off-grid rural applications, is confronted by often substantial and pervasive market barriers. Potential investors and project developers are often dissuaded from investments in those applications because of uneven and often discouraging financial performance of initiatives based on renewable energy directed at providing energy services for poor communities. Although renewable energy applications for rural regions of the developing world have been underway for over two decades, in many developing countries a commercial investment track record is just beginning to be established. Even after all the effort that has been focused on bringing renewable energy solutions to rural areas, very few projects and programmes have yielded commercial returns that would justify large investments by the private sector, either in marketing RETs to the rural poor or to using renewables as the basis for provision of modern energy services. In part, this reflects the widespread lack of sufficient public- private partnerships that can provide the private sector with sufficient opportunities and incentives to earn an adequate return on investment. The outlook is not entirely bleak however. There are notable exceptions to this circumstance, including the commercial diffusion of solar home systems in India and Sri Lanka, residential-scale biogas plants in Nepal and minihydropower plants (with associated local mini-grids for power distribution) in Sri Lanka. Those private sector-led initiatives all received substantial \u201cjump-starting\u201d and risk underwriting to facilitate market entry and development. Within the Asia-Pacific region there is a broad spectrum of barriers that varies from country to country and, for larger countries, by province or state. The Cambodia and Solomon Islands national assessments and respective case studies (volumes III and VII of this study) provide illustrative examples. Cambodia has one solar supplier, an international donor project for supporting expansion of PV enterprise is several years late and market finance is very difficult to obtain. The Triodos Bank of the Netherlands has invested in the one supplier, who sells just a few hundred systems per year. In the Solomon Islands, the lack of local technology is a major barrier; there are no commercial equipment suppliers and solar water heaters are imported from Australia and New Zealand. Many of the often-cited barriers to investments in renewable energy projects and programmes have been largely overcome in some countries, including Bangladesh, China, India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. For example, lack of awareness about the technical and financial performance of renewable energy systems was a widespread barrier to investment almost everywhere a decade ago, but this barrier is no", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "358940bf-f1df-48cf-97b8-b0e888d39dd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "358940bf-f1df-48cf-97b8-b0e888d39dd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0396424ace33fbf4f193b285b5581335b1a3e0c5b325f328fe25f2539147730f"}}, "hash": "0396424ace33fbf4f193b285b5581335b1a3e0c5b325f328fe25f2539147730f", "text": "longer so pervasive. There remains an ongoing need to demonstrate the reliability of renewable energy systems by further establishing a track record of performance, cost- effectiveness, applicability to rural areas and sustainability through organized professional technical support services (APEC 1998). Where investors have come to understand the nature of RET investments \u2013 coupled with clear supportive policies and programmes \u2013 significant investment has often followed. This is evidenced by the rapid increases in investment in the biomass-based IPP sector in Thailand and in the minihydropower sector in Sri Lanka. Growing commercial investments are taking place with off- grid renewables (biogas, SHSs) in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, where the number of private companies and NGOs operating as private companies has increased rapidly to meet the needs 65 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences of the market as the \u201crules of the game\u201d have become clear. In India, Winrock International India has been conducting awareness-generation programmes on RET lending for the financial sector for many years. As a result of this and the efforts of other early entrants such as the Solar Energy Light Company (SELCO) in India in rural off-grid markets, solar PV has become a popular lending area for commercial banks in India. This, in turn, has facilitated rapid growth in markets for PV systems and services. Some of the remaining important barriers that persist in some countries of the region are summarized below. They can be characterized as \u201cfirst-generation\u201d barriers, because they are the initial barriers faced by the private sector, the public sector, NGOs and others in attempting to bring renewable energy applications to the development process. \u201cSecond-generation\u201d barriers, discussed below, apply to countries and regions where the first-generation barriers are largely ameliorated. They include the lack of good models for the robust and widespread scaling up of renewable energy investments and applications and inadequate or non-existent financing mechanisms for large-scale renewable energy initiatives for rural areas. The lack of effective \u201ctool kits\u201d for linking modern energy services based on renewable energy with socially and economically productive activities on a large scale constitute what may be considered \u201cthird-generation barriers\u201d. The poor have insufficient resources and lack the knowledge to adopt renewable energy technologies as a means to higher incomes and linking microfinance with renewable energy may be the way forward. First-generation barriers Uncertain (and typically low) rates of return \u2013 When compared to conventional energy projects, the returns on investments for renewable energy projects are often perceived uncertain and low. Predicting the rate of return for renewable energy projects is made even harder by the fact that renewable energy projects have a limited track record in most developing countries, which makes it difficult to accurately forecast sales and expenses. Uncertain government policies and regulations, political instability, changing markets and currency risk have a large bearing on the project\u2019s bottom line, however project developers have only limited control or no control over these variables (APEC 1998). Investors may require higher than usual rates of return and lenders may insist on high equity stakes by investors as well as higher interest rates and shorter payment periods than with more traditional energy projects. High transaction costs Projects at rural areas, such as small rural energy projects, usually have relatively small capital requirements. In some cases the transaction costs of undertaking the due diligence process for a small project can however end up becoming a significant portion of the overall financing sough for the entire project (APEC 1998), because transaction costs are relatively inelastic with respect to project size. Consequently, pre-investment costs (including financing, legal and engineering fees, consultants) have a proportionately higher impact on the total costs of RET projects. Bundling of small projects into larger projects can reduce unit transaction costs, and government assistance in fast-tracking such projects can speed investments and reduce risks to investors. Standardized procedures for establishment of small RET projects can contribute to fast-tracking and reduction of transaction costs. This approach has allowed the World Bank, in partnership with the Governments of Bangladesh, China, India and Sri Lanka, to overcome much of the transaction cost barrier. Unsuitability of conventional credit for financing RETs Conventional credit is not well suited to the specific conditions for investment in RETs for rural applications. Renewable energy systems are capital-intensive (but with little or no associated fuel costs) and require often significantly larger up-front investments per installed kilowatt of capacity and longer repayment periods than fossil fuel technologies. Investors may therefore prefer to invest in systems with shorter payback periods, thus lowering their long-term risk exposure, even if those systems based on fossil fuels are more expensive", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7694c7c1-1327-4dca-a06a-a2c4d0a14d45": {"__data__": {"id_": "7694c7c1-1327-4dca-a06a-a2c4d0a14d45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "709ea60bab750d6010b1bf87c37f237769e6c620d663b7416c84ecf42edbb301"}}, "hash": "709ea60bab750d6010b1bf87c37f237769e6c620d663b7416c84ecf42edbb301", "text": "and, owing to unknown future fuel costs, have greater financial uncertainties on a long-term, life-cycle basis. Governments, through valuing the greatly reduced future energy cost uncertainties from renewable energy systems over those of fossil fuel systems, could translate such decreased national risk into local incentives for RET projects. However, the capture of such important externalities into national energy policies has been slow to develop. This extends to internalization of external benefits of renewable energy systems including environmental advantages relative to fossil fuel use, minimization of fuel availability and quality risks, as well as reduced foreign exchange loss for renewable energy systems with high domestic value added. 66 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Lack of experience with renewable energy project and equipment lending The lack of experience on the part of local banks and national development banks has inhibited investment in renewable energy applications that could benefit the poor. Few commercial and development banks in Asia and the Pacific have the training, experience or lending instruments to lend for renewable energy initiatives. Over the years, barriers to private investment in grid-connected renewables appear to be less formidable than before, as evidenced by significant renewable energy investments over the past five years in China and India, as well as in Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand and, to a lesser extent, in Viet Nam. However, those barriers continue to present serious obstacles to investment in many other countries of the Asian and Pacific region that have yet to see established the enabling conditions that would lead to a flourishing of renewable energy IPPs. Private investment in off-grid renewables remains limited in much of the region, although there are markets where targeted public investments have encouraged private investment in household solar PV systems and biogas plants (see chapter 6). Second-generation barriers and the scale-up challenge For countries where the first generation barriers have largely been addressed, tackling the second- generation barriers \u2013 those that inhibit the rapid and widespread scaling up of renewables \u2013 is the principal challenge. Renewable energy technology has advanced to the point where large-scale production of fully commercial, reliable systems is now a reality for PV, small wind, microhydropower and biogas systems. Now we must cross the new energy access frontier and to do so \u201cintegrators\u201d that link the energy systems with income generation are needed. Ironically, failed development programmes sometimes leave behind technical expertise that can be employed in scale-up programmes, but there must be a more effective and efficient approach to develop such capacity than expensive failed projects. Moreover the failure of such projects seriously discredits the use of renewable energy systems, even though it is not the equipment but the project and programme design that usually fails. (The use of poor quality equipment and the absence of persistent, competent technical support for its maintenance, repair and replacement also result in unnecessary equipment failure.) Several conditions are essential for facilitating pro-poor renewable energy investments as well as the scale of investments and applications needed to reach a significant number of poor people. A strong enabling policy and regulatory environment is vital to create an environment conducive to the development of renewable energy; the lack of such policy and regulations is often the principal barrier to the scaling up of renewable energy applications. As this is still the case in many countries, it appears that modern energy services based on renewable energy and access for the poor to such services are still not priorities in most national development programmes. For scale up in applications and access, Government commitment is essential. There is too little knowledge of models for renewable energy commercial project and programme implementation. Behind successful energy access models are strong and effective local financing institutions. The urgent need for skilled human capacity in many sectors remains largely unmet. If renewable energy implementation is to be scaled up substantially, a significant reservoir of skilled staff in different sectors will be needed. Building this capacity is not addressed sufficiently in many countries of the region. Moreover, renewable energy projects that have provided strong training to local technicians and engineers are often left with inadequate technical support when those people take jobs in other sectors where their new technical skills are more highly compensated. This domestic drain of skilled people from the renewables sector to other higher-paying sectors remains a problem for many renewable energy projects and programmes. Projects are necessary to establish successful models for energy access and renewables, but moving from projects to programmes on a broader scale is essential for a meaningful impact on off-grid development.

At the point where effective technical and institutional expertise and sufficient human resources have been established, the projects are often ended without any follow up. Long-term programmes are absolutely essential for building the infrastructure, capacity and services that will enable the use of services based on renewable energy on a meaningful scale for poorer communities, enterprises and households. 67 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences There is a need for large-scale, long-term, public-private partnerships that bring capital, technology, management, supportive policies and other resources to facilitate clean energy development and energy access. Such partnerships are also essential to underwriting the long-term programmes that are required. It will take vision and courage for Governments, donors and lenders to commit to such partnerships but the fruit of such initiatives can be greater social and economic development. Access to financing is vital for establishing an enabling environment for renewable energy development and the lack of adequate financing is one of the main barriers to investment in renewable energy projects for the poor. If developers are to obtain commercial loans, access to financing for renewable energy implementation at a scale required for major scaling up needs to be found. To achieve this, subsidies will often be necessary initially to jump-start and underwrite the investments. Third-generation barriers: linking energy services with income generation Just as energy access is the invisible element in the Millennium Development Goals, there is inadequate recognition of the need and opportunity to bring modern energy services together with microenterprise so the poor can use small-scale finance to grow out of poverty. Market-driven, scale- up of renewable energy systems will bypass the poor unless mechanisms exist to link the availability of the energy provided by those systems with the poor who are able to make use of it. Microfinance has become a major instrument in helping the poor to help themselves and move out of poverty. It is a potent means of connecting microenterprise with access by the poor to renewable- energy-based energy services. According to the United Nations Capital Development Fund:22 \u2022 Comprehensive impact studies have highlighted four factors which need to be considered about micro financing and its role in helping the poor. Firstly, microfinance helps very poor households in meeting their basic needs and in protecting themselves against risks. Secondly, it has been shown that the use of such services by low-income households is directly linked with improvements within not only the households\u2019 well-being but also in terms of the enterprise stability and growth. Thirdly, microfinance facilitates women\u2019s economic participation and as such can be seen as a tool for empowering women. Finally, it has been shown that for almost all significant impacts, there is a positive relation between the length of time the recipient had been within the programme and the overall magnitude of the impact. \u2022 Estimates put global demand for microfinance at 400 to 500 million households, 30 million of which had access to sustainable microfinance services in 2002, leaving the majority of the demand unmet. In spite of this, the number of customers making use of microfinance has been increasing by around 25 and 30 percent annually over the past five years. Millions of people in Asia have benefited from microcredit and from the revolution created by the Grameen Bank . Microfinance institutions help the poor to develop small businesses that can move them above the poverty line, and those institutions can then help to finance access to the energy services that renewables can provide on a small and decentralized scale. Not having microfinance institutions can be a barrier to this. However, there are few examples of microfinance institutions that have made the link between access to renewable energy and income-generation activities. Bangladesh has been able to accelerate the adoption of solar home systems because the country had microfinance systems already in place. Still, only 10 percent of Grameen Shakti customers are Grameen Bank borrowers, the rest are middle-class, rural consumers who borrow to purchase SHSs but do not access microcredit for income generation. While the poor cannot afford solar home systems, they can afford smaller-scale renewable energy equipment such as solar-powered LED lights that are effective for reading and illuminating other tasks. Grameen Bank has pioneered the use of solar-powered phones with solar-powered kiosks operated by women. This is perhaps the one group that has focused strongly on the link between renewable energy and microenterprise for the poor. Another aspect, illustrated by Grameen Shakti, is that microfinance providers understand both sides of the equation as their primary business is lending for income generation and they are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d4bb751-c8a2-4307-bdd9-7b8247912986": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d4bb751-c8a2-4307-bdd9-7b8247912986", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5825dfd16221057590eee826c9821d7077a4d30517cbb9c7d04dbdfc4c6030a2"}}, "hash": "5825dfd16221057590eee826c9821d7077a4d30517cbb9c7d04dbdfc4c6030a2", "text": "the first to see the links between SHSs and income generation. Microfinance institutions, and Grameen Shakti is among them, sell biogas systems as well as solar home systems but their principal lending is for income generation. Sri Lanka has strong microfinance capacity with the Sarvodaya Economic Enterprises Development Services (SEEDS) programme and 30 percent of the portfolio of this national NGO is in lending for SHSs. In Nepal, there is no tradition of microfinance and such institutions do not exist in the mountain areas. As a result, 75 percent of SHS sales are financed by cash and 25 percent by debt, which is the opposite of the situation in both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. 68 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences In Sri Lanka, SEEDS has been able to transform the market by dealing with solar equipment vendors and getting them to provide sufficient guarantees and warrantees so the systems work reliably for five years and the loans can be repaid. Barriers to RET access by the poor At a workshop sponsored by the UN Millennium Project in 2004, an attempt was made to identify possible energy targets in support of the MDGs. It was emphasized that modern energy services are an essential element for creating the enabling conditions that can allow a country to meet the MDGs and that poor access and lack of modern energy services have direct impacts on opportunities for income-generating, productive activities and on health. An attempt was also made to evolve a vision for 2015 comprising a set of energy services that could provide a way forward towards meeting the MDGs. The workshop recommended the following energy targets that were deemed necessary for meeting the MDGs in each country: \u2022 Enable the use of modern fuels for 50 percent of those who at present use traditional biomass for cooking. In addition, support (a) efforts to develop and adopt the use of improved cook-stoves, (b) measures to reduce the adverse health impacts of cooking with biomass, and (c) measures to increase sustainable biomass production. \u2022 Ensure reliable access to electricity to all in urban and peri-urban areas. \u2022 Provide access to modern energy services (in the form of mechanical power and electricity) at the community level for all rural communities (Modi et al. 2005). The linkages between energy and poverty reduction were also conceptualized by the Global Village Energy Partnership (GVEP) Working Group on Impact Evaluation Methodology and Indicators Development in Figure 4-1. Regional disparities in energy consumption Energy consumption patterns are not uniform in different regions of the world (Figure 4-2). In 2005, modern energy (excluding traditional biomass and additional waste) was consumed at an average rate of 1,519 kgoe per capita. While in high-income countries consumption of modern energy was 5,228 kgoe per capita, in low-income countries this amounted closer to 250 kgoe per capita, resulting in a disparity factor of 20. Of the global primary energy supply, traditional biomass and waste make up 10.6 percent (Flavin and Aeck 2005). Use of traditional energy varies between industrialized countries and developing countries, traditional energy use accounting for less than 3.4 percent in industrialized countries while in the developing countries this figure stands at 17.9 percent (Goldemberg and Johansson 2004). This disparity is even more concerning in the low-income countries where on average traditional energy represents 49.4 percent of the total energy use, with some countries relying as much as 90 percent on traditional energy sources (Flavin and Aeck 2005). On the whole, the wealthiest 20 percent of world\u2019s population consumes 58 percent of total energy produced, whereas the poorest 20 percent consumes less than 4 percent (World Bank 2004). Access to energy services, including electricity, is most limited in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. A little over a quarter of the world\u2019s population does not have access to electricity in their homes; which roughly translates to 1.6 billion people. Projections show that in spite of major strides in renewable energy deployment, the situation for the poor is not likely to be vastly different in the future. Projections show that 1.4 billion people, some 17 percent of the world\u2019s population, will still not have electricity in 2030 despite assumptions of more widespread prosperity and more advanced technology (IEA 2002). The number of people without electricity will decline by only 200 million owing to the projected increase in world population (from 6.1 billion in 2000 to 8.2 billion in 2030). Energy needs of the poor Poverty is an overriding social consideration for developing countries. Some 1.3 billion people in the developing world live on the equivalent of less than US$1 per day.

The lack of access to modern energy services is inextricably linked to poverty and to the lack of fulfilment of other needs such as shelter, food, health care, education, secure land tenure, access to agricultural inputs, credit, information, and political power. Poverty in Asia and the Pacific is closely associated with low levels of access to electricity, which in turn is a proxy for limited access to other infrastructure services. Nearly one third of the population, more than a billion, in the region\u2019s developing countries had no access to electricity in 2000, with the average electrification rate in South Asia (41 percent) being less than half of the average for East Asia, including China, and the Pacific (86 percent). The challenge of meeting energy needs for rural populations in developing countries transcends access to electricity services. Electrical, thermal and mechanical energy are all needed for a variety of household uses, such as cooking, lighting, space heating and other appliances; for agricultural uses, such as tilling, irrigation and post-harvest processing; and for rural industry uses, such as milling and mechanical energy and process heat. Sectors such as commerce, education, health, transportation and water supply in the rural areas also require energy inputs.

Energy spending rises with income but generally at a less than proportionate rate. In rural India, poor households spend as much as 8 percent of their very small incomes on energy, most of it on kerosene for lighting (Saghir 2005b). In the Philippines, the top fifth of the population, in terms of income, pays on average US$ 0.66 per kgoe of energy, while the lowest fifth ends up paying more than double that at US$ 1.79 kgoe. The cost of modern fuels and energy services for the poor is high in absolute terms as well. The average cost of getting a new connection for households in rural areas in Kenya is seven times the national income per capita (Flavin and Aeck 2005). The rural poor have difficulties paying for energy services because of their seasonal, agriculture-dependent, income cycle. Barriers to obtaining credit make it difficult for them to pay the high start-up costs of improving their energy supplies. The rural-urban divide in energy use patterns The vast majority of the poor continues to inhabit rural areas with minimum or no access to electricity and can only afford a modicum of modern fuels such as kerosene for essential (albeit poor quality) lighting. Electricity and fossil fuels rely on capital-intensive distribution networks (transmission and distribution grids or pipelines and bulk transport by road or rail) to deliver centrally produced supplies to the rural areas. Rural electrification programmes have typically involved extending the grid incrementally, moving from large demand centres to smaller ones, reaching towns and settlements in order of increasing capital costs. The farther the areas are from the reach of such networks, the greater the technical and economic difficulties faced by energy supply utilities that have to operate on financial sustainability principles in order to remain viable. Under the circumstances, the primary problem for the poor is their inability to access modern energy because supplies simply do not reach them (Pandey 2007). In sub-Saharan Africa only 8 percent of the rural population has access to electricity, compared with 51 percent of the urban population (Figure 4-3). A similar disparity exists in South Asia, where only 30 percent of the rural population has access, compared with 68 pe cent of the urban population. Indeed, four out of five people without access to electricity live in rural areas of the developing world, mainly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Unregulated micro-grids based on diesel are a common phenomenon and are a very expensive energy option in rural areas. Any entrepreneur with a power generator can provide service to a local community. For example, a relatively small investment in a US$250 Honda generator set (of around 0.5 kWe) enables recharging services to be provided. In some countries, the cost of a low-cost, Chinese-made, 0.65 kWe gasoline genset23 has fallen to below US$50. The low barriers to entry have encouraged a highly competitive but relatively unprofitable industry to develop. Although the unit cost (in terms of dollars per kWh) of the energy is high, the fees charged by these informal \u201cutilities\u201d on a daily basis are affordable by many rural households. Continuing reliance on traditional fuels and the question of choice Because of the primacy of cooking, traditional24 use of biomass continues to account for by far the largest share of total primary energy supply (on a kJ per person basis) in many developing countries. Nearly 2.4 billion people in developing countries still rely on wood, agricultural residues and dung for cooking and heating (Table 4-3). Many developing countries still rely heavily on biomass to meet their total primary energy needs. Biomass is a major source of energy in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In 2001, the share of the total primary energy supply was, 49 percent in Africa, 25 percent in Asia, and 18 percent in Latin America. In 2000, the average per capita consumption of wood fuels (charcoal and wood) in sub-Saharan Africa was 0.72 tons. This roughly translates to 470 millions tons for the region as a whole, while China\u2019s and India\u2019s combined fuel wood consumption at the time was 340 million tons (REN21 2005). In India, an estimated 220 million tons of firewood is used for cooking in rural areas and about 160 million tons of non-fodder agricultural residues are produced every year (Kishore et al. 2004). Firewood consumption trends suggest that the consumption is, in fact, increasing steadily. 72 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Table 4-2 Share of energy expenditures in household income (Percent) Figure 4-3 Share of rural and urban", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72e95762-8c2b-4699-a958-fc823d40bbd7": {"__data__": {"id_": "72e95762-8c2b-4699-a958-fc823d40bbd7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c5bb3318de39d63815cff975b6cb9e9baf9bb1f1f4d3a6478ca398235361830"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c025a2a-2e09-40ad-a88e-73c25f922e86", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb9d952f834dc6c2e8d0e2f6a43a4ec3d34aac66157470b499f7ed554dac15fd"}}, "hash": "80b4bbcd8e71839d0af6cb2f90e9ce5030fb97a0219c8ac90f78dbd1d8119b20", "text": "population with access to electricity, by region Uganda Ethiopia India South Africa United Kingdom Lowest quintile 15.0 10.0 8.5 7.2 6.6 Highest quintile 9.5 7.0 5.0 5.5 2.0 Source: IEA 2002 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Total Urban Rural North Africa Sub-Saharan Africa Latin America East Asia South Asia Middle East Developing countries World Source: Saghir 2005a In sub\u2013Saharan Africa, 94 percent of rural households and 41 percent of urban households depend on wood and crop residues as their primary source of household energy. Four percent of rural households and 34 percent of the urban households in the region use charcoal as the primary energy source. Kerosine is the primary energy source in two percent of the urban and in 13 percent of urban households (REN21 2005). Although some individually collected biomass fuels cost little or no cash, they have huge social, environmental and health costs. Past trends indicate that even though fossil fuels are the fuel of first choice for most poor people, biomass fuels are likely to remain the main fuel of necessity. Projections by the World Bank indicate that the number of people relying on biomass fuels will grow to 2.6 billion by 2030 (Saghir 2005b). The contrast between rates of change in rural and urban areas of Cambodia in terms of choice of cooking fuel used is demonstrated by Figures 4-4 and 4-5. While consumers in urban Phnom Penh have an increasing number of fuel choices, the choices in rural Cambodia are largely limited to firewood and small amounts of charcoal, except for the highest income households The gender dimension of energy poverty In most communities women and children account for the majority of the poor people, and it is estimated that up to 70 percent of the 1.3 billion people currently living in poverty are women. Wood and residue fuels account for 80 percent of all household energy use in many developing countries and the task of collecting these sources of fuels is usually carried out by rural women and their children, with long hours being spent on this task alone. Because many of their day-to-day subsistence tasks and home-based enterprises are energy-consuming, the price and availability of energy has a direct impact on the viability of these activities. This gender bias is a further reflection of energy\u2019s largely non-monetized attributes among the poor, since much of women\u2019s work is characteristically unpaid work. Energy scarcity affects poor women and girls disproportionally, which can be seen in terms of their relatively poor nutritional status, health and low literacy rates. Fuel availability affects cooking habits and food availability. Poor women are more exposed to indoor air pollution due to cooking than men. Girls are more likely to assist their mothers in the collection of fuelwood and water than boys. 73 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Table 4-3 People relying on biomass for cooking and heating in developing countries, 2000 Figure 4-4 Fuel for cooking in Phnom Penh Source: MIME 2007 Country/region of population Millions Percent China 706 56 Indonesia 155 74 Rest of East Asia 137 37 India 585 58 Rest of South Asia 128 41 Latin America 96 23 Middle East and North Africa 8 1 Sub-Saharan Africa 575 89 All developing countries 2,390 52 Source: IEA 2002 Firewood Charcoal LPG Kerosene Electricity None Other Cooking fuels used in Phnom Penh 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 % of households 74 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Figure 4-5 Cooking fuels used in rural areas Source: MIME (2007a) and MIME (2007b) Firewood Charcoal LPG Kerosene Electricity None Other Firewood & Charcoal LPG & Electricity Cooking fuels used in rural areas 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1993-1994 1996 1997 1999 2003-2004 % of households Endnotes 22 http://www.uncdf.org/english/microfinance/facts.php 23 The very low capital cost of these small gasoline-powered gensets makes them widely ac- cessible to relatively poor individuals and enterprises, but the overall costs are very high.

At the regional level, it discusses major strategies adopted, specific policies used within Asian countries and key regional initiatives on renewable energy and poverty. areas. Drivers and motivations Energy security Energy security is an increasingly important driver for RET investments across the world. Initially, industrialized countries, particularly in the European Union, invested in RETs despite the higher initial costs. However, the desire to reduce dependence on imported fuel, particularly oil, and increase access to domestic renewables is no longer limited to developed countries. A recent study carried out by UNDP demonstrates that the oil price rise which started in 2003 is likely to be sustained into the future since it is supported by a crunch on the supply side concurrently with historically high levels of global demand (UNDP 2007). Global supply of oil appears to be reaching its peak and reserves are declining even as rapid industrialization in large developing countries such as China and India has pushed demand to new heights. It is increasingly recognized that petroleum is going to be a scarce resource in the future and countries that continue to depend on it exclusively to fuel their economic growth do so at their own peril. A number of key drivers have significantly increased global trade in fossil fuels since 1980, particularly oil and natural gas. They include a doubling of global GDP accompanied by an increase of 50 percent in global energy consumption in the past two decades; relatively low costs of energy in the 1990s; a decline in oil reserves outside the Middle East requiring larger imports; improvements in technology for liquefying natural gas which has reduced costs of transporting gas over long distances; and strengthening of multilateral trading systems that encouraged greater reliance on trade in energy. Fossil fuels accounted for over 80 percent of total primary global energy supply in 2003 of which one third was traded internationally. Until recently oil dominated, at 80 percent of traded energy, but cross-border trade in natural gas is growing rapidly. Asia-Pacific region has increased its share of global energy trade from 16 percent in 1980 to 23 percent in 2005. The large Asian fuel importers include Japan, Republic of Korea, China, Singapore and India. The growing share of world imports going to the Asia-Pacific region, especially China and India, has been one of the most significant trends in world oil trade in recent years. China\u2019s dependence on imported for crude oil increased from 11 percent of its consumption in 1995 to 61 percent in 2005. Energy security has become a major concern since 2002 both because of disruptions in supply in the Middle East and the related high prices of petroleum on the global market. The increased reliance on the Middle East is set to continue despite global exploration activities. Oil production in many countries outside the Middle East, including Indonesia and Malaysia in Asia, has begun to plateau and decline. As of 2005, the Middle East was estimated to contain 62 percent of global oil reserves and 40 percent of gas reserves. According to the IEA, by 2030 the Middle East is expected to account for two thirds of global oil exports, up from 40 percent in 2002. The largest trade flow in crude oil in 2030 is expected to be that between the Middle East and developing Asia (UNDP 2008a). Many of the larger countries in Asia and the Pacific have set themselves targets for increasing the share of renewable energy in their energy mix. Inclusion of renewable energy in a country\u2019s energy portfolio can serve as a hedge to protect against the price volatility of fossil fuels. Renewable energy is capital and engineering intensive and also creates domestic employment and enhances economic 77 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences development through backward economic linkages. Some countries had already set targets and made national-level commitments even before the latest round of petroleum price increases. With sustained fluctuations in fuel prices (during the study period), energy security concerns are likely to be an even stronger driver, most likely leading to more ambitious renewable energy targets than those committed to already. Petroleum prices The increasingly high petroleum prices since 2003 promised to be an important driver for renewable energy investments globally and in a number of countries in the Asian and Pacific region.

They have also meant high electricity prices in countries where electricity is largely produced using oil or, alternatively, they have resulted in utilities making large losses where prices have not increased sufficiently to cover costs. In many countries, subsidies have artificially depressed fossil fuel prices reducing incentives to economize on those fuels. As global fuel prices have risen, the budgetary costs of the subsidies have ballooned, jeopardizing the ability of governments to meet other social needs in the areas of health, education, sanitation and so on. Petroleum fuels are consumed disproportionately by urban residents, so that this policy has resulted in further discriminatory treatment of the rural poor. Renewable energy investments that could reduce dependency on petroleum fuels are often sacrificed to meet import payments for petroleum products. From an average of US$20 per barrel in the 1990s, the price for crude petroleum has shot up more than threefold and has remained in the high-US$60s and mid-US$70s in the early 2007, touching US$100 at the time of this analysis. The US$200 billion a year that governments worldwide have been spending to subsidize petroleum use could go even higher if countries continue to hold domestic petroleum prices below international market prices. Once instituted, fuel subsidies can only be eliminated with care. In some cases, extreme budgetary pressures have forced governments to remove those subsidies very rapidly, leading to severe dislocation in household and business budgets, forcing families to choose, for example, between continued schooling and higher transportation costs. Fossil fuel prices were raised 125 percent overnight by the Government of Indonesia in leading to the closure of several businesses, rising unemployment, reduced economic growth, falling real incomes and worsening poverty (UNDESA 2005). Another recent study on the impact of rising oil prices on the poor shows that increased oil prices since 2003 have not necessarily had major impacts on Asian and Pacific countries as a whole in terms of GDP growth but that inflationary trends were visible. The perception of limited impact may be a reflection of the exceptionally high rates of GDP growth in Asia in the past few years led by China and India, and the buffers many countries have built up of foreign exchange reserves. However, the study reports that micro-level case studies show that high oil prices have significantly impacted the energy expenditure of the rural poor in India, particularly for transportation and lighting fuel, as well as for cooking fuels among families that were using kerosene or LPG for that purpose. The prices of non-oil fuel substitutes have also gone up significantly. Those impacts have occurred despite the lag between the increase in global prices and local government-regulated prices. With sustained high prices globally, this impact is likely to be substantially larger in the coming months and years as consumers face the full international price of petroleum (UNDP 2007). The following section analyzes what the four future oil price scenarios (outlined in chapter 3) are likely to mean in terms of private investment in renewable energy in Asian and Pacific countries. The scope of this study allowed for only a cursory analysis for what is a rich and complicated topic. Clearly, deployment of renewable energy is not dependent only on oil prices. It depends on a diverse set of factors that includes a supportive legal and commercial environment, the expansion of the financial services sector to provide resources at favourable terms, local technical and managerial capacity, technology advances and the work (or lack thereof) of advocates and decision makers to champion renewable energy within their country. Nevertheless, oil prices are one important factor and, all other things being equal, oil price scenarios will have different implications for future renewable energy deployment of grid-connected renewable power projects, biofuels and off-grid renewable energy technologies. (a) Grid-connected renewable power projects For grid-connected renewables, the current high price of petroleum fuels is already an adequately strong driver in many countries where a large percentage of the power on the grid is generated using diesel and fuel oil. Sri Lanka, for example, generates 56 percent of electricity using oil (UNDP 2007). 78 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences At today\u2019s prices diesel-based electricity typically costs between 20 to 30 cents per kWh to generate. This price is easily matched by renewables which run from 5-15 cents for modern biomass, 4-15 cents for small hydropower and 3-10 cents for wind (UNEP 2006).

For the power sector in countries like Thailand that rely heavily on natural gas (about 70 percent of electricity generation according to the Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO) 2008), oil prices are still important because natural gas and oil prices are strongly correlated. Many countries in Asia and the Pacific, including Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Thailand and Viet Nam, have specific targets for renewable power.25 Although the intent is there, as expressed by those targets, not all countries have active investment portfolios of \u201cgreen IPPs\u201d. Countries with the most active green IPP investments are China, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The others have not been able to translate their commitments to actual investments and, as a result, are likely to miss their targets. The existing high oil prices under the \u201cbaseline\u201d scenario have encouraged many countries to commit to renewable energy targets. It is likely that both the \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenarios will encourage further investments in active countries and encourage others to overcome the bureaucratic hurdles that stand between expressed intentions and actual investments. The \u201cenergy security\u201d scenario is likely to reduce the incentives to change the regulatory environment in the more reluctant countries. However, investments from green IPPs are likely to continue in the more active countries many of whom already had investments even before the current high oil prices. Attracting investments from green IPPs also requires clear policies and a stable investment climate. Without those enabling conditions, a number of countries that are highly dependent on diesel generation, with correspondingly high electricity tariffs, have very few or no green IPPs. The Solomon Islands Electricity Authority depends 100 percent on imported diesel to generate power and yet does not have any policy to encourage independent power generation . In Cambodia, another country highly dependent on petroleum fuels (87 percent) for electricity supply, lack of a stable investment climate and inability to get project financing has discouraged many IPPs from investing in small hydropower and biomass-based generation. (b) Biofuels Governments in Asian countries are strongly encouraging private investment in biofuels under the current high level of oil prices (chapter 3). Those countries have enacted legislation for blending biofuels into gasoline and diesel giving rise to commercial production of ethanol, from sugarcane, corn or cassava, and biodiesel from palm oil, coconut and jatropha. The \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenarios will only accelerate investment in this sector in those countries. The \u201cenergy security\u201d scenario would slow investment down as many biofuels are not competitive at prices below the \u201cbaseline\u201d level. In Asia the principal producers are China and India and they are also in the forefront of biofuels development. In India, there have been calls for a wider availability of gasoline blended with ethanol, i.e. E5 gasoline (gasoline with 5 percent ethanol), E10 and later E20 (REN21 2008). Since October 2007 E5 gasoline became mandatory in India\u2019s states and it has been announced that E10 will become mandatory starting October 2008 (IEA 2008). In China, the E10 blending mandates exist in nine provinces (REN21 2008). In Japan, the Government has permitted low-level ethanol blends in preparation for a possible blending mandate, with the intention by 2030 of replacing 20 percent of the nation\u2019s oil demand with either with biofuels or with gas-to-liquid fuels made from natural gas. In South-East Asia, Thailand and the Philippines, have made efforts to diversify away from the use of oil and have mandates for biodiesel and ethanol. The Philippines has however indicated that it will shift its focus on jatropha as feedstock for biodiesel production. In both Malaysia and Indonesia, an increasing proportion of national diesel fuel requirements are to be met from palm oil, and Malaysia has announced a 5 percent biodiesel mix mandate to take effect by 2008 (REN21 2008). One of the newer crops being widely promoted for biodiesel production worldwide, including Asian countries, is jatropha. This is a drought-resistant perennial that can be planted even in wastelands, is easy to establish and grows relatively quickly. The seeds have an oil content of 37 percent and this oil can even be burned in a simple diesel engine without being refined.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9624a3e8-a58e-4770-8b39-0dc1843bc3fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "9624a3e8-a58e-4770-8b39-0dc1843bc3fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c02dc195efbcc8589b27df41306a270f723c55af385dedaecf5475a4e81e3622"}, "2": {"node_id": "be468a87-bf72-4592-852e-b57e36c31d68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3090932fccbf60644d8f02a8672eaaccbbc681410c0afd3c88c0ddacc9cf17f9"}}, "hash": "39759689fbf96ed8b4ba47279d901a5f82ae5afd833afa720caa3898d73f21a3", "text": "Jatropha could therefore be a very valuable crop for poor communities living on marginal land.

They include environmental impacts of primary forest clearance, competition for scarce water resources and the need to preserve grain production for food uses in China and other countries in the region. The consequences of very large-scale and unprecedented development and production of biofuels are only now becoming an important concern in biofuels policy and investment in Asia and the Pacific. Other countries in the region do not as yet have well-articulated policies on biofuels. This includes the Pacific island countries which are heavily dependent on imported petroleum, both for boat transportation and for power generation, and also have substantial potential for producing biofuels from palm oil, copra and sugarcane in some cases. In addition to already high prices, many of the small island countries have the additional cost of transporting oil to remote islands and could benefit tremendously from production of biofuels both for local consumption and for export. There is potential to increase rural incomes and at the same time reduce the dependency on imported oil. The case study of the Solomon Islands suggests that despite the fact that land is not a constraint, the investment climate in many Pacific island economies is not attractive for the external investment that would be needed to produce biofuels in any significant quantity. Only under the \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenario would there be sufficient pressures to change regulations to attract needed investment. The case study concludes that even the \u201csupply shock\u201d scenario is not likely to exert the requisite pressure for long enough, before prices come down again and the momentum is lost, to make those changes. This is compounded by the length of time needed for development of biofuel plantations and biofuel processing facilities, as well as for biofuel crops to mature. (c) Off-grid RETs Bangladesh, China, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand invested significantly in large programmes at the national level to promote off-grid renewables even before oil prices began their upward trend. In addition to the investment by the public sector, most of these programmes have a strong private investment component as well. Investment is likely to continue to expand under all the four oil price scenarios, \u201cbaseline\u201d, \u201csupply shock\u201d, \u201cpeak oil\u201d and \u201cenergy security\u201d as long as Government and, in certain cases, donor commitments continue. Wider awareness of successful models to attract private investment in off-grid RETs, coupled with high oil price scenarios, should result in those models being adopted by many other countries in the region, as well as the expansion of the models in those countries where programmes already exist. Extension to other geographical regions and to other RETs is likely to follow. However, in the case of distributed RETs as well, questions of governance and investment climate are key considerations in the minds of investors. An example of this is the more than 600 Rural Electricity Enterprises (REE) in Cambodia which generate almost 60 MW of power using off-grid diesel generators despite the high prices. The REEs have not invested in renewable energy generation to supply their consumers because of problems linked to their uncertain legal status and their inability to get financing for projects from banks. In Cambodia, uncertainty over future markets leads mini-grid operators to favour diesel (low capital cost, high ongoing cost) over renewable fuels such as gasifiers (higher capital cost, lower ongoing cost) even if the fossil-fuel option is more expensive in the long run. Net metering regulations, like the very small power producer (VSPP) regulations in Thailand, could help reduce the uncertainty by giving confidence to Cambodian investors that there would be a market for their renewable electricity if and when the national grid expands to their service territory. Demand for off-grid RETs will generally increase when oil prices go up. In Nepal, sales of household biogas plants jump in semi-urban areas every time kerosene prices are increased by the Government. The sale prices of biogas digesters stay fairly constant since the construction components, such as bricks and cement, rely on coal for their production. Non-poor rural households that are substantially participating in the fuel economy already will first realize the benefits of solar home systems and biogas plants when petroleum prices increase. But most poor rural households continue to cook with collected firewood and are little affected by the increase in petroleum prices . It is thus not clear how much of a driver higher petroleum prices will be for the very poor to acquire renewable energy systems since the poor,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "871c7fb8-36d0-430c-a287-642cf90e7399": {"__data__": {"id_": "871c7fb8-36d0-430c-a287-642cf90e7399", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c15419ee68417b90cf4b483d39e51d1a2d761e721d2376e28e6316ad0ab61e25"}}, "hash": "c15419ee68417b90cf4b483d39e51d1a2d761e721d2376e28e6316ad0ab61e25", "text": "particularly the rural poor, do not use significant amounts of petroleum in the first place. For many of the poor, higher prices for petroleum fuels is likely to mean diminished usage of kerosene for lighting and less frequent travel by bus. Table 5-1 below summarizes how the four oil price scenarios are likely to impact renewable energy investments in the six countries included in the policy study. 80 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences For all six countries, the rural poor appear to be less directly affected than their urban counterparts by energy price increases since their use of imported petroleum is limited to lighting and typically consumes less than 5 percent of their incomes. The urban poor are more seriously affected by increases both in transportation and cooking fuel prices since fuel costs make up a much larger percentage of their incomes. It would seem, however, that indirect effects on the rural poor are stronger. High transportation costs to rural areas, for example, hurt the rural poor in two ways \u2013 they pay higher prices for non-local goods, yet receive lower prices for products that they export from their communities. Investment in off-grid renewables for the rural poor are driven not so much by oil prices as by commitments of Governments to rural development and to meet MDGs. To understand how private sector investment in renewables will be affected as a result of oil price increases, Asian and Pacific countries can be classified under the following typologies: \u2022 China and India are a unique category \u2013 mega-countries with fast-growing demand for energy to support high rates of economic growth and advanced technological and industrial capacities, as well as enormous capital resources for investment; \u2022 Middle-sized countries with large urban populations with limited fossil fuel resources of their own compared to their needs (Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Viet Nam); \u2022 Countries with large urban populations having significant oil, gas and coal resources themselves or in accessible neighbouring countries (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Malaysia and Myanmar); \u2022 Less urbanized, landlocked countries with very limited developed fossil fuel resources but large hydropower resources (Afghanistan, Bhutan, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Nepal); and \u2022 Countries with small, largely rural, populations with little fossil fuel resources (Pacific island countries; Cambodia might also currently fall under this category because of its limited technical manpower and poor investment climate). China and India are already home to significant private sector investment in renewables and biofuels even under the \u201cbaseline\u201d scenario. The appetite for energy in those two countries is growing so rapidly that they are developing all sources of energy, both renewable and fossil fuel and are also importing substantial amounts of energy. Investment in renewable energy will likely accelerate in both countries under all scenarios except \u201cenergy security\u201d where it is likely to stay the same as in the \u201cbaseline\u201d scenario as a result of the established investment momentum. The better organized of the second category countries, particularly Thailand, are following the trend of China and India in creating an environment for aggressive investment in renewables under the \u201cbaseline\u201d scenario. Sri Lanka also has an active programme to promote investment in renewables both off and on grid. Viet Nam and Philippines have been slow in attracting investment in renewable energy. The second category countries are likely to accelerate investment in renewables under the \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenarios. International investment is likely to be attracted to those countries for the development of biofuels for both local consumption and export under \u201cpeak oil\u201d, and perhaps \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cbaseline\u201d scenarios as well. The investment will naturally come first to countries with the more favourable policies and business climates. As a group, countries in the third category have generally been slow to invest in renewables, with the exception of Malaysia. The focus of those countries will be to increase investment in oil and gas exploration under \u201cbaseline\u201d, \u201csupply shock\u201d and \u201cpeak oil\u201d scenarios for both export and domestic use. The availability of fossil fuel resources in their own countries or at a low price across their borders creates a disincentive to invest in RETs. The fourth category consists of landlocked countries that are largely rural with low per capita energy expenditure. They also tend to have hydropower resources but often not the investment or technical expertise needed to develop them. They often have neighbours with fast-growing energy needs. Under the \u201cbaseline\u201d and \u201csupply shock\u201d scenarios, and certainly under \u201cpeak oil\u201d, investment is likely to be attracted to those countries for development of hydropower to export to energy-hungry neighbours.

Its effects are likely to be most strongly felt by the poorest people in the least developed countries, who rely on the natural environment for their livelihoods.

National and local governments in developing countries will need assistance in responding to predicted increases in the incidence of natural disasters resulting from rising sea levels, as well as an increased incidence of extreme weather events and floods from glacial lake outbursts. With some of the fastest-growing emerging economies in the world, the Asian and Pacific region also contains many opportunities to mitigate climate change through reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). As energy use in power generation, transportation and industry, as well as for domestic purposes, is the leading emitter of GHGs in the region, extensive investment in renewable energy technologies could provide many of the mitigation opportunities. Carbon revenues can be a driver for renewable energy investments. Revenue from the Clean Development Mechanism generally cannot make an unfeasible energy project feasible but it can turn a marginally attractive renewable energy project into an attractive investment. It has been estimated that the internal rate of return (IRR) on a range of CDM projects undertaken by the World Bank would be raised if the price of carbon dioxide was US$4 per ton. For hydropower, wind and geothermal projects, the IRR would rise by 0.5-2.5 percent, while the impact on forest and crop residue projects was greater at 3-7 percent; on projects using municipal waste, the increase was in the 5-15 percent range (UNEP 2006). Recently (as of 1 April 2008) the renewable energy CDM pipeline was dominated in Asia, in terms of CERs, by biomass (6 percent), hydropower (24 percent) and wind (8 percent) energy projects in that order, with smaller amounts coming from biogas (2 percent) and geothermal (1 percent) projects (UNEP Risoe 2008). The impact on the IRR for solar PV projects from CDM revenue is marginal owing to the high capital cost of solar projects in comparison to carbon abatement. It is for this reason that solar PV projects contribute least to the pipeline of renewable energy CDM projects. Prices for carbon credits have been above US$4 and the expected higher prices in the future could increase the strength of carbon trading as a driver for investment in renewable energy. A total of 427 renewable energy projects were in the pipeline as of May 2006 awaiting validation by designated operational entities or registration with the CDM Executive Board. Between them, the projects have total annual emissions reductions of around 25 million tons of carbon dioxide out of a total pipeline of 142 million tons (UNEP Risoe 2006). This translates to between US$100 million and US$200 million annual carbon revenues for renewable energy projects at 2006 prices. Given annual investment of around US$38 billion a year in renewables worldwide (REN 21 2006), CDM revenue contributed less than 0.5 percent of the capital costs of those investments and slightly more than 1 percent in developing countries where the CDM projects are located. In 2006 and 2007 investments in RETs increased to around US$55 billion and US$71 billion, respectively (REN21 2008). Certified emission reductions (CERs) from developing countries were contracted at prices of US$10.90 in 2006 (World Bank 2007) and US$13.60 in 2007 and early 2008 (World Bank 2008). The volume of CERs from renewable energy projects like wind and solar energy and power from biomass and hydropower, which abate mostly carbon dioxide, is much smaller compared to the investment required than the volumes created by CDM projects which abate other greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons or methane \u2013 gases that have much stronger greenhouse warming potential per mole than carbon dioxide (Willis et al. 2006). More than half of the CDM pipeline of 142 million tons mentioned above, roughly 95 million tons of carbon-dioxide-equivalent abated, comprised of projects relating to those three gases. At the same time, renewable energy projects are at a disadvantage compared with projects that reduce other types of greenhouse gases, for example, landfill methane, in the CDM because their fixed costs are significantly higher per CER (Willis et al. 2006). A breakdown of the pipeline in April 2008 of renewable energy CDM projects from Asia (Figure 5-1) shows that wind, biomass and hydropower dominate the market. They are followed by biogas and geothermal, while solar energy has only 1 percent of the market. Compared to the pipeline in May 2006, the shares of different types of renewable energy projects have remained almost the same.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7912c945-7761-47bd-943d-ec54e9e49b4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7912c945-7761-47bd-943d-ec54e9e49b4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5983daf181447184b6147503f1519a456326c6be774ec23b7457285e3dc2365"}, "2": {"node_id": "9da50d02-ef31-46cb-aa92-e879b27c68a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db0d298bb9f16c1588a66b3dc7f982648f35b9b3b6411a3b403267fc68f807d7"}}, "hash": "3a5dc5c2d7f22f8ef047ac6d2ce8cf5ff7343d80fd56dc9ade661218a79db829", "text": "In terms of host countries for all types of CDM projects, China and India dominate with about 82 percent of the market between them (Figure 5.2).

Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic have each one registered CDM project (UNEP Risoe 2008). 83 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences With some exceptions, CDM is not yet a strong driver for most potentially pro-poor, off-grid renewable energy projects. RE projects that are most likely to increase access by the poor tend to be small, and many small individual projects would need to be aggregated to reduce transaction costs and make a worthwhile CDM project. This presupposes a project with a large number of installations to aggregate and the number of off-grid renewable energy projects that have reached that level of aggregation in the region is still very limited. The transaction costs of monitoring and verifying that the projects are working and abating GHGs for CDM purposes can also be quite high unless those activities are already part of the original project design. Solar home systems have particularly low carbon benefits compared with their capital costs. Solar PV typically substitutes for kerosene used for lighting \u2013 a relatively small source of GHGs. Microhydropower systems and other RETs that supply larger amounts of power through mini-grids generally have slightly larger carbon abatement on account of substituting for diesel used for milling in addition to kerosene for lighting. Biogas and improved cook stoves tend to substitute for the largest amount of GHG emissions when they reduce unsustainably harvested firewood and are potentially attractive CDM projects \u2013 leading to a situation where payment Figure 5-1 Carbon market share by renewable energy technology in Asia, April 2008 Figure 5-2 CDM market share by country, April 2008 Biomass 23% Biogas 9% Wind 24% Geothermal 1% Solar 1% Hydro 42% Malaysia 5% Indonesia 3% Philippines 3% South Korea 2% Thailand 2% Vietnam 2% China 44% India 39% Source: UNEP Risoe 2008 Source: UNEP Risoe 2008 84 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences received for global carbon benefits could pay for the full cost of the investment in some instances. For example, a SHS might typically receive credits for abating 250 kilograms of carbon dioxide annually compared with a household biogas plant which would abate over 5 tons of carbon dioxide per year. Renewable energy CDM projects that substitute for non-renewable biomass have the potential for significant MDG impacts. They include household energy technologies such as biogas and ICS as well as technologies like biomass gasifiers that can reduce firewood use in rural enterprises. Despite this potential, the only significant household energy projects that have been registered (by May 2006) with the CDM Executive Board are two household biogas projects from Nepal and one from India (UNEP Risoe 2006). In addition to having substantial carbon benefits, household biogas typically provides significant health and social benefits in terms of reduced indoor air pollution and drudgery for women and children in firewood collection, as well as local environmental benefits by saving forests \u2013 features that hit multiple MDG targets. The baseline that allowed such projects to be developed was permitted under the \u201cIndicative simplified baseline and monitoring methodologies for small-scale projects, I.C. Thermal energy for the user with or without electricity\u201d that covered renewable energy technologies that supply individual households or users with thermal energy that displaces fossil fuel or non-renewable sources of biomass.26 A decision taken at the twenty-first meeting of the CDM Executive Board, held on 28-30 September 2005, has removed the reference to projects that replace non-renewable biomass from the Small- Scale CDM methodologies I.C (thermal energy for the user) and I.D (grid-connected renewable energy generation).27 The decision of the Board was primarily designed to be consistent with the Marrakech Accords which limit land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) projects within the CDM to afforestation and reforestation activities and exclude other activities such as deforestation avoidance. Thus, a channel which allowed renewable energy projects that substitute for unsustainable biomass to qualify under the Small-Scale CDM methodologies was closed. Fortunately, a decision taken at the thirty-seventh meeting of the CDM Executive Board, held on 1 February 2008, has added to the Small-Scale CDM methodologies I.E.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f799a9a2-2716-4c80-8ef8-00a0b51496e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "f799a9a2-2716-4c80-8ef8-00a0b51496e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93112e75e9fec6c0c86e707cecdbe5e419fe7bcc75ef3bf9d8b114b9dff2213c"}, "2": {"node_id": "069a4731-18d8-4ebe-ae83-35aa09c5ad9a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d813cab590540175d3884d345783c8a0ffe3829db0b74c3478a5a41a0e05cb49"}}, "hash": "6248ab8b68f337a026bda23c2b4b6198b22ee2a13cd2a4b87a2b37be9b9135f9", "text": "(switch from non-renewable biomass for thermal applications by the user).28 The eleventh Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention and the first Meeting of the Parties, held at Montreal on 28 November \u2013 9 December 2005, had advised the CDM Executive Board to give priority to developing alternative baseline methodologies for small-scale project activities that effect a switch from non-renewable to renewable biomass.

Development of the new methodology will be crucial for many future household energy CDM projects. Substitution of unsustainable biomass will need to be included among accepted baseline methodologies if the CDM Executive Board wants to give a green signal to the promotion of improved household cooking technologies that can affect the health and well being of some half a billion families around the world. Without a similar baseline methodology, the verifiable greenhouse gas benefits of biogas and ICS programmes will be minimal. The new methodology (mentioned above) is being applied to a household biogas project in India, in which biogas will be used to replace kerosene and non-renewable biomass for cooking and hot water heating (UNFCCC 2008). As of May 2008 the project is at validation stage (UNEP Risoe 2008). The list of registered projects as well as the pipeline of projects waiting to be validated and registered shows a limited impact of the CDM in reducing poverty and achieving the MDGs. In addition, the CDM project pipeline is dominated by a small number of countries. The poorer countries in the Asian and Pacific region, particularly the Pacific island countries, have largely been unable to develop CDM projects. This results both from limited human resource capacities in those countries and from methodological challenges, as described above, which deter potential CDM projects in the rural biomass sector where the greatest potential exists for projects in less industrialized countries. UNDP has established the MDG Carbon Facility29 to promote a portfolio of CDM projects that will better meet the MDGs. The Facility strives to improve access to carbon finance in a larger number of developing countries and broaden the range of activities that provide real sustainable development benefits. UNDP supports carbon projects that clearly contribute to meeting the MDGs (for example, through creating employment opportunities; improving environmental quality; and creating marketable offsets locally). Other key objectives are market capacity development for the projects in host countries and bringing about market transformation that leads to an enabling environment for the Facility to operate, while at the same time generating substantial direct investment from the private sector. UNDP\u2019s focus is on the removal of barriers to direct investment for a range of mitigation technologies, the establishment of well-functioning host-country procedures for the review and approval of CDM and JI projects, as well as the development of such projects together with voluntary sector projects 85 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences by the Facility. UNDP\u2019s strengths lie in environmental project development expertise, local presence and understanding of the country-specific sustainable development needs and goals. By February 2008 the first four initial project agreements had been signed between UNDP, Fortis and the project proponents and they will now go through the due diligence process by UNDP and Fortis. The projects include three methane capture projects located in Macedonia, Uzbekistan and Yemen, as well as a renewable energy project in Rwanda (UNDP 2008b). In their Initial National Communications to the UNFCCC, Governments in Asia and the Pacific have made commitments to reduce greenhouse gases through the promotion of RETs. A summary of those commitments for the six case-study countries included in this report is presented in Table 5-2. Social and environmental concerns in biofuels development Among renewables, liquid biofuels have been touted as generating the most economic and social benefits which include: \u2022 Lower imports \u2013 successful large-scale domestic biofuels industries will offset petroleum imports and improve the balance of payments; \u2022 Greater energy security \u2013 biofuels offer a way not just of diversifying supplies but also of making countries less dependent on oil imports; \u2022 Less greenhouse gases \u2013 used on a significant scale biofuels could lower greenhouse gas emissions; \u2022 Less vehicle emissions \u2013 liquid biofuels in mixtures with gasoline and diesel will reduce vehicle emissions and help improve air quality in Asian cities; \u2022 More jobs \u2013 cultivation of biofuel feedstock creates additional employment and income for rural workers, especially for crops such as jatropha that use land not suitable for food production; and \u2022 Disposal of waste \u2013 converting biomass residues, such as forest products, wood waste, grease and used vegetable oil into biodiesel fuels will help dispose of waste. However, large-scale production of biofuels can have serious economic and social costs, namely: \u2022\ufffd Higher food prices \u2013 the current modest levels of production have pushed up the prices of many food commodities and this trend is expected to continue.

Options identified include: \u2022 Combined cycle and fuel-cells-based power generation for natural gas-based power; \u2022 Reduction in transmission and distribution losses; \u2022 Replacement of two-stroke engine vehicles by four-stroke engines in transport sector; \u2022 Use of improved cook stoves in rural areas to prevent deforestation; and \u2022 Modernization of brick-making industries. Cambodia Initial National Communication, August 2002: Country has developed energy policies and energy supply projects such as high-voltage power transmission lines, hydropower development, improvement of mass transit, improved cook stoves, among others. Those policies and projects if implemented will reduce the GHG emissions of the country. Indonesia Initial National Communication, October 1999: The country has documented the following initiatives in the Energy Sector to mitigate emissions of GHGs: \u2022 Gradual removal of energy market distortions, such as fuel and electricity subsidy; \u2022 Promote the use and development of renewable energy through incentives such as tax breaks for investors on the technology, encouraging research and so on; \u2022 Encourage public adoption of energy conservation and efficiency by adopting techniques such as public cam- paigns, while at the same time using economic incentives to promote energy efficiency products and energy conservation practices further; \u2022 Promote clean and efficient energy use for industry and commercial sectors; various technologies, for example, clean production, are available to help the industry and commercial sectors become more efficient; and \u2022 Restructure the prices of various energy sources according to the emissions and externalities that the energy source emits. Nepal Initial National Communication, July 2004: Policy options to reduce GHGs include promotion of renewable energy, energy efficiency, reduction in use of conventional biomass in rural area and switching to low-emission energy technologies. To enhance tapping and use of renewable energies, Nepal has constituted an Alternative Energy Promotion Center, which officially plans and manages the development of renewable energy resources in the country; the sectors of its responsibility include microhydropower, solar, biomass, wind and others. Mitigation options in residential, commercial and industrial sectors include: \u2022 Technology upgrading in the residential sector such as from three-stoves and wick lamps to improved stoves, biogas stoves and lanterns; \u2022 Use of electricity for cooking, heating, cooling and lighting in the commercial sector replacing a system based on fossil fuels; \u2022 Switching of fuel to hydroelectricity in the industry and transport sectors; and \u2022 Improving energy efficiency through demand management. Mitigation options in the transport sector include vehicle energy efficiency, switching to less emission-intensive technologies and increasing the occupancy of public vehicles among others.

Solomon Islands Initial National Communication, October 2001: \u2022 Government encourages climate-friendly technologies through research and information programmes, training, public awareness and education programmes.

Table 5-2 Commitments made by case-study countries to RETs in their Initial National Communications to the UNFCCC 87 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences In order for further development of biofuels to be effective and for transport to be sustainable, the following steps need to be taken: \u2022 Undertake comprehensive life-cycle analyses of crops and production processes in Asia in order to assess the relative energy and carbon-emission impacts of each fuel; \u2022 Develop and enforce technical fuel standards critical for large-scale use of biofuels and for vehicle manufacturers to support their warranties for engines; \u2022 Develop a harmonized set of biofuel standards for fostering both trade and investment; and \u2022 Develop and implement comprehensive and internationally approved assessment methodologies which evaluate the social and environmental impacts of biofuel projects. To sum up, biofuels can, in principle, reduce the GHG footprint of transport fuels by replacing a significant portion of fossil fuels. It will, however require several decades for commercial biofuels to displace more than 20 percent of the growing fossil fuels markets. Expanding the use of biofuels will require that the land-use and environmental impacts associated with large-scale biofuels production be adequately addressed. Poverty reduction and access for the poor One set of drivers for investment in RETs is the commitments that countries have made towards meeting Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and MDG targets. A profile of the Asia and Pacific region in terms of poverty and attainment of MDG goals was presented in chapter 4. Renewable energy projects like microhydropower, biogas, ICS and solar PV have been shown to contribute to a number of MDG targets. Universal supply of electricity in particular is a major political goal for many countries in Asia and the Pacific. In countries with large rural populations renewable energy has often proven to be the most effective way to get electricity to communities that are difficult to supply from the national grid. In practice, however, extensive rural electrification through renewables is rare. Despite expectations, as for example, of the solar home system programme in Thailand, Governments and/or rural electrification utilities have been unable or unwilling to invest in extensive electrification using renewables. Poverty alleviation was a key rationale in Thailand\u2019s programme, which had provided solar electricity to nearly 200,000 homes by May 2006. Nevertheless, case studies show that with sufficient commitment and investment from Governments and donors a number of RETs can be effective in increasing access to clean energy for at least some of the poor. Examples from Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka all show that with sufficient quality control, availability of financing and social mobilization access to technologies like microhydropower, biogas and solar PV can be expanded substantially. The methodologies are now available to other countries for market expansion of those technologies given sufficient commitment at the government level. The experience so far has been that the poor benefit from electrification based on microhydropower and small hydropower since the marginal cost of providing electricity to a poor household is relatively low once the hydropower plant has been built. The two case studies from Nepal show microhydropower and small hydropower can electrify close to 100 percent of homes in communities with such projects. Between 1997 and 2003, the World Bank approved 22 projects that include off-grid renewable energy components. The total investment in those projects was just over US$2 billion, with Bank loans and credits accounting for about half of the total funding. Governments of client countries, bilateral development agencies, GEF and others provided the balance. Most projects focused on rural electrification, including both grid extension as well as commercialization of off-grid alternatives, especially solar PV (International Resources Group 2003).

In rough order of relevance to poverty alleviation, they can be broken down into: (a) technologies for cooking and/or heating (improved cook stoves, biogas for cooking, solar cooking and water heating); (b) transportation (biofuels); (c) off-grid electricity and motive power; and (d) grid-connected electricity. Some policy approaches apply to all four categories. They include: \u2022 Targets and timetables; \u2022 Mandates; \u2022 Investment incentives (direct capital subsidies or tax deductions); \u2022 Grants for research, development and demonstration; and \u2022 Preferential finance. 88 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Additional policy instruments apply more specifically to grid-connected electricity production. They include: \u2022 Interconnection agreements; \u2022 Power purchase agreements; \u2022 Net metering; \u2022 Feed-in tariffs and production tax credits; \u2022 Renewable portfolio standards (RPS); and \u2022 Green power programmes. For each, this section explains the relevant policies, and discusses relevant international and Asian experience. Worldwide, renewable energy promotion policies are increasingly popular. At least 60 countries worldwide, including 23 developing countries, now have some type of renewable energy promotion policy (REN21 2008). Characteristics of RETs that limit or shape workable policy measures Renewable energy technologies span a wide range of scales, applications and technological complexity. Policies that work for one technology are not necessarily relevant to others. Before discussing policy measures, a brief discussion of technology characteristics that limit or shape workable policy measures is in order. Cooking and/or heating technologies are generally household in scale and relatively low cost compared with electrical renewables. It is also excessively expensive to measure individual performance of the systems (calories of heat, litres of water heated) for every household. For that reason, subsidies that lower initial capital costs or provide favourable access to low-interest loans are most common. Transport fuels (biodiesel, ethanol) are more easily measured (litres), and sellers of liquid fuels are already subject to government regulations (safety, taxes). For those reasons, biofuels are well supported by per-litre subsidies (generally to the seller, in the form of tax breaks) or through mixing mandates that specify that fuel that is sold must contain certain percentages of biodiesel or ethanol. Off-grid electricity and motive power are generally household or village-scale. High transaction costs of on-site measurement and performance verification augur for subsidies that reduce capital costs (direct payments or tax breaks of one kind or another). Grid-connected electricity is fairly easily measured and therefore suitable for measures that directly reward production (although capital subsidies are also used). Renewable energy targets and timetables Targets for renewable energy are a measure that Governments use to communicate intention and commitment to encourage the development of renewable energy. Often specified before the specific policy mechanisms are decided, targets are usually set as a quantity of units (improved cookstoves installed, square metres of solar water panels), or as percentage of the primary energy, transport fuel, and/or electricity generation mix. Renewable energy targets in most countries are indicative and non-binding. National targets for renewable energy have been announced in at least 64 countries worldwide, including 22 developing countries and all 27 EU countries. The EU\u2019s indicative targets are to derive 12 percent of total energy consumption and 21 percent of electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2010. In the beginning of 2007, the EU extended binding targets, including 20 percent of final energy and 10 percent of transport fuels from renewable sources by 2020. Developing countries in Asia with renewable energy targets include such as China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Thailand (REN21 2008). Other countries in the region with national or regional targets include Australia, Japan and New Zealand. Japan is targeting RE installations of 17.25 GWp by 2010, which would generate around 17.25 terawatt hour (TWh) per year (REN21 2006). China\u2019s targets are among the largest in terms of installed capacity. The Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress of China endorsed the Renewable Energy Law on 28 February 2005. At the same time as the law was passed, the Chinese Government set a target for renewable energy to contribute 10 percent of the country\u2019s gross energy consumption by 2020.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17a53c38-946f-4e08-87e7-a6f69d1cb4d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "17a53c38-946f-4e08-87e7-a6f69d1cb4d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56fb44ff415a2754dc91f8b809953671efd7e09920e47203f0f956db6942f21e"}, "2": {"node_id": "2b1499a1-cd86-4807-a75f-f024491976a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26641103cdb487a7f93e0158f8e4de7314241a9437ef5e00f0438e006be9cc2e"}}, "hash": "9ff073b571746596e24fe983fe4f5b3e61328277e156cd2fe60d4a1e7e173dd9", "text": "Those targets were revised recently and China announced a target of 15 percent of primary energy from renewables by 2020, including large hydropower, up from a 7.5 percent actual share in 2005 (IEA 2008).

Biofuels would increase to 15 billion litres per year by 2020. In addition to its short-term target of 10 percent of added power capacity by 2012, India has proposed long-term targets to be achieved by the year 2032 in several categories, including 15 percent of power capacity, 10 percent of oil consumption substituted by biofuels, synthetic fuels and hydrogen, and 100 percent use of solar hot water in all possible applications (with full coverage of users such as hotels and hospitals by 2022). Additional short-term targets include 100 percent use of cogeneration in the sugar and other biomass-based industries; and a significant increase in power use through renewables in a large number of villages starting with 10,000 remote un-electrified villages in 2012 (REN21 2008). In order to cater to the needs of their large rural populations, many Asian countries have explicit mandates for rural electrification (Box 5-1). They include Bangladesh, China, India, Nepal, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. Some also have a commitment to meeting at least some of their needs with renewable energy. India, for example, aims to establish enough clean energy to electrify all of India\u2019s villages by 2010. The Philippines launched a strategy in 1999 to achieve full village electrification by 2007, including renewable energy explicitly in that strategy. Sri Lanka is targeting 85 percent of the population with access to electricity and has promoted commercial development of solar home systems in rural areas with partial support for market development. Thailand decided in 2003 to electrify 230,000 of the remaining 300,000 off-grid households in the country with solar home systems by the end of 2005, and accomplished nearly 190,000 by May 2006 (REN21 2006). A EU directive driven by energy security concerns and the Kyoto Protocol requirements set the target of obtaining 5.75 percent of transportation fuel needs from biofuels by 2010 in all member states. In 2006, the EU adopted an ambitious strategy for biofuels with a range of potential market-based, legislative and research measures that aim at increasing the production and use of biofuels.31 France and Germany planned to meet the target before deadline by increasing rapidly both ethanol and biodiesel production (Worldwatch Institute 2006). In 2005-2006, France announced its ambitious biofuels plan, with goals of 5.75 percent by 2008, 7 percent by 2010 and 10 percent by 2015. Belgium set a 5.75 percent target for 2010 (REN 21 2006). Early 2007, EU set a target of 10 percent of transport fuels from renewable sources by 2020 (REN21 2008). Mandates Mandates are similar to targets in that they set explicit quantities and timetables but, unlike targets, they are obligatory and carry penalties if they are not met. In practice, mandates have generally been applied to biofuels and have been driven most recently by high oil prices. Biofuels blending mandates exist at the national level in at least 17 countries and, at the subnational level, in at least 36 states and provinces (REN21 2008). Brazil has a long history of promoting biofuels, mandating that ethanol be blended with gasoline since 1975. Gasohol and pure ethanol are available at all filling stations by law and the Government hopes to build on the success of the Proalcool program by expanding production of biodiesel. All diesel fuel is to contain 2 percent biodiesel by 2008, rising to 5 percent by 2013. In India, the Government mandated 10 percent ethanol blending in nine states starting in 2003. The sugar ethanol program requires E5 blends throughout most of the country but this is set to rise to E10 and E20 depending on ethanol availability (Worldwatch Institute 2003). In 2004, four provinces in China \u2013 Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning and Henan \u2013 required ethanol to be mixed with gasoline in a 10 percent ratio (Martinot 2005); five other provinces were due to adopt a similar mandate in 2005. In Thailand, a 10 percent ethanol mix in gasoline was mandated to commence in 2007 to reduce import costs and also provide support for domestic sugar and cassava growers (UNDESA 2005). For similar reasons, the Philippines will soon mandate 2 percent cocobiodiesel (cocomethylester or CME) to support coconut growers while reducing particulate emissions from diesel engines and generators, and 5 percent ethanol, beginning 2007.32 Malaysia has one of the most aggressive policies on promotion of biodiesel in the region and the production of biodiesel from palm oil has been promoted by the Government since 2001. The Malaysian Government had stated that all diesel sold at petrol stations must contain 5 percent biodiesel from palm oil from 2007.

Investment incentives Investment incentives provide funds upfront to reduce capital costs of project developers. The incentives are attractive because they are simple and they provide funds when most needed \u2013 at the beginning to help with project construction. They are usually most appropriate for household \u2013 or village-scale systems in which the costs of monitoring performance (heat or electricity production) and administering production incentives would be excessively expensive. Investment incentives require some way of ensuring that systems will perform as advertised. An example of such a safeguard is the requirement that equipment of a type which has passed a certification process, such as the Global Approval Program for Photovoltaics (PV GAP) or the Nepal biogas equipment standard, should be used, and that systems should be installed by competent technicians. A capable and vigilant regulator is thus essential in order for subsidy funds to be efficiently allocated and to monitor programmes against abuse. If implemented well, investment incentives can be very effective in leveraging quality control, as in the case of biogas in Nepal. Investment incentives can take various forms, such as subsidies and tax credits. Direct capital investment subsidies are paid as a percentage of total investment costs or on the basis of rated capacity. Increased subsidies for smaller systems and for remote locations increase the access of poor households to RETs. 91 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences A successful example of the use of investment incentives is from Nepal, which has a system of subsidies for solar home systems and for household biogas based on location and remoteness. The subsidies are described at length in chapter 6. On SHSs, the subsidy is a fixed rupee amount with a maximum ceiling not exceeding 50 percent of the total cost. This policy favours smaller system sizes which are more affordable for the poor. Systems installed in very remote and remote Village Development Committees (VDCs), as defined by the Government, have subsidy amounts almost 100 percent higher than for more accessible areas. Similarly, biogas has an additional subsidy for remote areas.

In Japan, capital subsidies of 50 percent for rooftop solar PV in 1994 had declined to approximately 10 percent by 2003, falling further to 4 percent by 2005. The policies resulted in over 800 MW produced in more than 200,000 homes (REN21 2006). Similar to investment subsidies, investment tax credits work by lowering capital costs through allowing developers to reduce their taxes by some percentage of the investment cost of the project. Investment tax credits have the advantage that their administration costs are lower than direct investment subsidies because it takes fewer state resources to lower taxes compared to collecting taxes and then redistributing the funds as rebates. A key weakness, especially in the context of poverty reduction, is that investment tax credits leave out small project developers that have insufficient profits to absorb the tax credits fully. Another disadvantage of investment tax credits arises because it is difficult to guard against investors who are more interested in maximizing their tax shelter than in producing energy. Lack of transparency has also been cited as a drawback of the credits. In countries in Asia in which ambitious rural electrification targets have been met, rural elec- trification has occurred through an ideological orientation that sees electricity as a basic right of citizenship and as a foundation for development.30 In practice, extensive grid-based rural electrification is not a profitable enterprise as loads are low and distances long. Rural electrifi- cation, where it has been extensive, is subsidized and lines are extended to rural areas below cost. In some countries progressive block-rate tariffs subsidize usage by providing reduced rates for customers that use small amounts of electricity. Many rural electrification programmes using renewable energy also cater to the poor through heavy subsidization. Thailand, for example, electrified 200,000 households with solar elec- tric systems with 100 percent subsidy. Microhydroelectric projects by DEDE in Thailand pro- ceeded with capital costs 100 percent subsidized and with tariffs set to cover only ongoing maintenance and repair. New rural electrification programmes using renewables have been launched in many Asian and Pacific countries. In a programme which commenced in 2006, Pakistan intends to elec- trify 8,000 villages with renewable energy and a pilot has been completed for 400 households using 90-watt solar PV systems. The Integrated Rural Energy Program in India which uses renewable energy had reached 300 districts and 2,200 villages by early-2006. Rural applica- tions of solar PV included 340,000 home lighting systems, 540,000 solar lanterns and 7,000 solar-powered water pumps. The Township Electrification Program in China had provided electricity to 1.3 million rural peo- ple using solar PV, small hydropower and a small amount of wind at the time of its completion in 2005 (REN21 2006). During 2006, China was planning the next programme which focuses on villages, with plans to electrify 10,000 villages and 3.5 million rural households with renew- ables by 2010, including small hydropower and up to 270 MW of solar PV. Full rural electrifica- tion is planned by 2015. Box 5-1 Rural electrification \u2013 a right of citizenship? 92 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences A classic example of investment tax credit problems was in the United States where they were used in the 1980s to stimulate wind energy development. Part of the problem was that the allowable tax credit was too high. Shrewd investors could make profits though tax credits even if the wind generators only actually produced a small fraction of their advertised annual energy generation. Although California wind tax credits helped significantly in the creation of the modern wind energy industry, they became infamous because the nameplate capacity of installations was vastly overrated and operations and maintenance were poor (Gipe 1993). Similar problems have been experienced in India where investment tax credits were used in the 1990s and spurred the largest wind power industry among developing countries. However, many installations were characterized by low performance caused by using wind turbines not suited for the resource, badly planned and badly sited wind farms, and inadequate transmission and distribution facilities. In contrast, investment tax incentives have been used fairly effectively for smaller-scale systems, such as rooftop PV systems. Successful programmes provide amounts of tax relief that are not excessive and use technology that is well developed and for which assurances of quality exist (for example, PV modules with long-term power warrantees). A variety of other investment tax incentives exist including accelerated equipment depreciation, value added tax (VAT) rebates, import duty exemptions or other reductions to lower the cost of imported equipment, and property tax reductions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aed3939f-fdb4-4947-8f29-ba2b88725cc2": {"__data__": {"id_": "aed3939f-fdb4-4947-8f29-ba2b88725cc2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca7153bb9c279befc694f6926a76746b98ee2ddaa7e1a77a08724ada31d74dac"}}, "hash": "ca7153bb9c279befc694f6926a76746b98ee2ddaa7e1a77a08724ada31d74dac", "text": "Tax incentives can be politically advantageous, as it is usually easier to avoid collecting taxes through tax credits than to collect and then disburse them as explicit subsidies. But this convenience must be balanced against the distortions and hazards discussed above. Nepal offers a 1 percent customs duty facility for renewable energy systems, which has had a significant impact in increasing private sector participation in RETs. China and Thailand also use import tax reductions for qualifying renewable energy equipment. In Brazil, tax preferences have been given to vehicles that run on pure ethanol and, most recently, to \u201cflexible-fuel\u201d vehicles as well. VAT or sales tax exemptions and production subsidies are a popular support mechanism for biofuels, offered in several states of the United States; Canada (production subsidies of 10 CAD cents per litre for ethanol and 20 CAD cents per litre for biodiesel, which decline after the first three years) (REN21 2008); Austria (95 percent exemption for biodiesel) (REN21 2005); Belgium; France; Greece (REN21 2008), Hungary; Italy (100 percent exemption for biodiesel) (REN21 2005); Slovenia; Spain; Sweden; and the United Kingdom. Germany had 100 percent exemption for biodiesel (REN21 2005), but it was abolished in 2007 (REN21 2008). Grants for research, development and demonstration, outreach and training Grants for research, development and demonstration (RD&D) play an important role in renewable energy deployment \u2013 especially in the initial stages for technologies that are promising but not yet commercial. Careful investment in demonstration projects can help develop experience in installation, maintenance and repair, and can increase the confidence necessary for early market development. Grants for installations arguably also make sense in providing for basic needs (medical clinic lighting, pumping and water purification) for communities that are in dire need, such as refugees and people displaced by war or conflict. Public funds, or private foundation funding, directly support a variety of essential programmes to lower barriers and develop markets for renewables, as well as develop communities of knowledgeable practitioners through information \u201cclearing houses\u201d, training, matchmaking, quality control, project evaluation and policy support. Training for practitioners is especially important. Throughout the developing world, the capacity to design, install, operate, maintain and repair quality renewable energy equipment is very limited. Similarly, the capacity to manage the \u201cpeople\u201d side of the projects \u2013 community mobilization and governance, economics, activities related to project-related income generation \u2013 is also severely constrained. Programmes, including curriculum and certification guidelines, to train and certify renewable energy practitioners have been developed for adoption in local vocational training centres (see, for example, the Institute for Sustainable Power in the United States) but the pace of implementation should be increased. However, repeated demonstration projects of well-established technologies, for example PV, accomplish little, deplete precious government funds, and can even hurt the market as potential customers refrain from investing in the hope that they will get a demonstration project too. Another disturbing effect of excessive emphasis on government-funded demonstration projects is that equipment suppliers determine that lobbying for an increase in such projects is more lucrative than finding and satisfying customers in the marketplace (Greacen 2005). 93 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Preferential finance The challenge of raising capital is a major concern, especially for renewable energy power generation projects which involve large initial costs and are perceived as risky and unconventional by banks. Long-term, low-interest, \u201cpatient\u201d financing can result in substantially lower costs for renewable energy. \u201cPatient capital\u201d can take the form of both debt and equity finance, and can range from multimillion dollar investments to small-scale end-user finance (see chapter 6 below where the topic is covered in depth). Interconnection agreements Interconnection agreements are the first of a number of measures of particular relevance to grid- connected power generation. In every country with significant installed renewable energy capacity there are laws that guarantee that renewable energy generators have access to the grid. The laws do not imply a subsidy; they only require fair treatment by utilities that control the transmission and distribution systems. Interconnection requirements specify the safety equipment and procedural steps necessary for connecting a generator to the grid. The critical principle is that all generators of electricity should have fair and non-discriminatory access to the grid. Under Danish law, renewable energy generators share the costs of grid interconnection with distribution utilities. Independent generators must pay the cost of connecting to the nearest technically suitable point on the grid. The costs include the line from the plant to the grid connection point, control and metering equipment necessary at the grid connection point, as well as labour.

The cost-sharing arrangement is important in that it guarantees that renewable energy generators will be able to interconnect to the grid at a limited and manageable cost that is easily predictable. Germany\u2019s laws are similar \u2013 plant operators have to pay for the grid connection, but the grid operator has to bear the cost of grid reinforcement if necessary (IEA 2005). Based on international experience, fair and non-discriminatory access to the grid requires an independent regulatory authority with: \u2022 The capacity to conduct rigorous independent technical analysis; \u2022 The legal authority to enforce utility compliance; and \u2022 A perspective that helps balance the needs of small producers and consumers against the needs of the utilities (Brown 2003). Power purchase agreements Electricity generation projects require a reliable, stable, long-term revenue stream in order to obtain finance at a reasonable cost. Reliable power purchase agreements, which are contracts that guarantee a market and a price for electricity generated, are thus critical for a successful grid- connected renewable energy project. The United States Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (PURPA) was among the first laws allowing IPPs to sell into the grid. PURPA mandated that utilities purchase all independently-generated power at their avoided cost. Other countries such as China, Denmark, Germany, India, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland have all developed explicit (but varying) rules providing guaranteed PPAs for renewable electricity, often requiring payments significantly higher than avoided generating cost (Greacen 2005). Standardized non-negotiable PPAs have been adopted in Indonesia, Malaysia, Mauritius, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Selected Asian countries with interconnection arrangements for small renewable energy are listed in Table 5-4 below. India also has policies that further facilitate grid-connected renewable energy through power transmission \u201cwheeling\u201d (selling power to a third party via the utility\u2019s transmission lines) and \u201cbanking\u201d (generating power for later consumption), as well as direct power sales from producers to end users. The Sri Lanka power market opened to third-party minihydropower developers for the first time in 1997 with the announcement of a standard offer. Today a pipeline of around 120 MW of small hydropower plants is set to supply more than 5 percent of the electricity on the Sri Lankan grid. The general perception of renewable energy power developers in developing countries is that they face problems, particularly with financing and with regulatory frameworks that define power purchase tariffs and transmission access (Martinot et al. 2002). 94 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences In Nepal, a combination of policies led by standard PPAs for hydropower played a catalytic role in increasing private sector investment in renewables. In 1998, the Government announced that it would buy power from hydropower plants below 10 MW through a standard PPA at a pre-announced purchase price with an annual escalation for five years. Even though the Electricity Act of 1991 provided an income tax holiday and a 1 percent import tax facility to small hydropower developers, it was the 1998 announcement that created a \u201cready\u201d market for small hydropower and attracted private sector investment in a big way. Over US$100 million has been invested by the private sector and over 58 firms were involved in the sector at the time the study was conducted. In general, power purchase agreements are most useful in encouraging significant deployment of renewable energy when they provide stable long-term revenue streams and they can be adjusted over time, but the adjustments affect only new generators that come online after the adjustment is made (Greacen 2005). Net metering Net metering permits consumers to install small renewable systems at their homes or businesses to offset local consumption and use the grid to absorb any excess or make up for shortfalls. Often regulations require utilities to purchase net excess generation at wholesale rates. Net metering laws exist in at least seven countries, 39 states of the United States and several Canadian provinces. Net metering laws are being enacted regularly, with six states passing such laws in the United States in 2004. Most recently, a 2005 federal law requires all electric utilities in the United States to provide net metering within three years (UNDESA 2005). In 2003, Thailand adopted net metering for renewable energy generators with power export not exceeding 1 MW (increased to 10 MW in 2006).

The prices are set higher than the prevailing market price and payments are usually guaranteed over a specified period of time. Production incentives can be superior to investment incentives by eliminating the temptation to inflate initial project costs and by encouraging developers to build reliable facilities which maximize energy production. The production incentive is a policy instrument preferred by many renewable energy project developers because it provides a guaranteed market for renewable energy at a guaranteed price (Greacen 2005). Production tax credits are similar to feed-in tariffs, but the benefit is accrued through a corporate income tax deduction rather than a cash payment. Compared to production subsidies, production tax incentives have similar advantages and disadvantages as described earlier for investment incentives. The advantage is that they are politically easier to achieve, while disadvantages include complexity and lack of ability of certain (especially lower income) parties to fully absorb the tax credit.

By 2007, feed-in policies had been adopted in at least 37 countries, more than half of which were enacted after 2002. By 2007, feed-in policies for were enacted in Asia in China, some states of India, Indonesia, South Korea, Sri Lanka and Thailand (REN21 2008). Feed-in tariffs have stimulated investment in wind power, biomass, small-scale hydropower, PV and solar thermal power generation, spurring interest and innovation particularly in Germany (box 5-2), Spain and Denmark. The feed- in law in Germany resulted in power from eligible forms of renewable energy more than doubling between 2000 and 2004 (REN21 2005). India was the first developing country to establish feed-in tariffs and it has since been joined by Sri Lanka, Brazil, Indonesia and Nicaragua. In China, a comprehensive law to promote renewable energy was enacted in February 2005 and included feed-in policies. Thailand also instituted feed-in tariffs in December 2006. Feed-in tariffs for renewable energy in selected Asian countries are listed in table 5-5 below (REN21 2005, REN21 2008). The States of Karnataka, Uttaranchal and Uttar Pradesh in India also adopted feed-in tariffs in 2005, bringing to six the number of Indian states with feed-in policies. Maharashtra also updated its 2003 wind power feed-in policy to include biomass, bagasse and small hydropower generation. In order to boost wind power, a limited feed-in tariff was enacted in Pakistan with a 9.5 cents/kWh tariff established for approved projects. Two further 50 MW projects are to be launched and a competitive selection is underway for project developers (REN21 2006). Feed-in tariffs provided much of the basis for growth in Denmark\u2019s largely community-owned wind industry. This sets a promising precedent for community-owned renewables in other countries, and ultimately a possible revenue generation opportunity for rural communities with renewable energy resources. Thus far, however, there are few developing country examples. Denmark also uses production tax credits in a clever way designed to encourage ownership of by local farmer collectives. Individuals who participate in wind energy cooperatives can own up to 20,000 kWh/year worth of shares in them. The first 400 Euros per year of income is tax-free, while the remainder is taxed at 60 percent of the regular tax rate. Because Danes pay very high income taxes (typically around 50 percent of income), the tax breaks for cooperative ownership provide a strong incentive for community involvement.

RPS policies are in place at the national, state or provincial level in Australia, Canada, China, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Most RPS policies require renewable power shares in the range of 5-20 percent, typically by 2010 or 2012. (REN21 2008) Few developing countries have moved to renewable portfolio standards. Thailand made early plans to develop an RPS but shifted primary focus to feed-in tariffs owing to the lack of independent regulatory oversight and remaining challenges in developing competitive electricity markets. The Regulator for the Southern Indian State of Tamil Nadu is expected to set a new requirement for distributors to purchase at least 10 percent of their power from renewable energy producers. This mandate resembles an RPS in many ways. Tamil Nadu accounts for more than half of India\u2019s total wind power resources, and this ambitious target, together with an annual increase in energy consumption of 5-6 percent, has helped to create a favourable environment for renewable energy producers. 96 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences In the early-1990s, Germany had virtually no renewable energy industry. Within 10 years, it had transformed itself into a renewable energy leader. In the space of a decade and with a fraction of the potential in wind and solar power of the United States, Germany now has more than twice as much installed wind capacity as that country \u2013 more than one third of global capacity \u2013 and is a world PV leader as well. The German Government passed an energy law in 1990 that required utilities to purchase the electricity generated from all renewable technologies in their supply areas and to pay a minimum price for it \u2013 at least 90 percent of the retail price, in the case of wind and solar power. The \u201cElectricity Feed-in Law\u201d was inspired in part by similar policies that had proved effective in neighbouring Denmark. The preferential payments for renewable energy are in- tended to help internalize the costs of conventional energy and compensate for the benefits of renewables. The pricing law ended uncertainties regarding whether, and at what price, producers could sell electricity into the grid. It also boosted investor confidence, making it easier for even small producers to obtain bank loans and drawing money into the industries. Increased investment drove improvements in technology, advanced learning and experience and produced economies of scale that have led to dramatic cost reductions. The average cost of manufacturing wind turbines in Germany fell 43 percent between 1990 and 2000, and the cost of total PV systems declined 39 percent between 1992 and 2002. In 2000, the German Bundestag required that the burden of additional costs arising through feed-in tariffs be distributed among all suppliers based on their total electricity sales, ensuring that no one region would be overly burdened. With scientific input and advice from the vari- ous renewables industries, the Bundestag established specific per-kilowatt-hour payments for each renewable technology, based on the real costs of generation. The tariffs are paid for 20 years, while the rate for new projects is adjusted regularly to account for changes in the marketplace and technological advances. Electric utilities also qualify for these tariffs, thus re- ducing utility opposition while further stimulating the renewable energy market. Soon after the first pricing law was established, farmers, small investors and start-up manufacturers started to create a new industry from scratch, and wind energy development in Germany began a steady and dramatic surge. The success of the feed-in law was further strengthened by a host of other supporting mea- sures. Major banks offered low-interest loans, refinanced by the federal government. Income tax credits granted for projects and equipment that met specified standards were provided. In addition, the federal and state governments have funded onshore and offshore renewable resource studies, have established institutes to collect and publish data and have promoted awareness about renewable technologies through publication of subsidies, as well as through architectural, engineering and other relevant vocational training programmes. *From Sawin 2004.

Green Power programmes are in place in over 700 United States utilities, as well as a number of Northern European countries, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand (REN21 2008). Experience with Green Power programmes has been that a very small fraction (typically 1 percent or less) of all customers sign up and several programmes have been abandoned altogether. There are few Asian utilities with Green Power programmes but Thailand has studied the possibility. Major renewable energy policy initiatives in the Asia and Pacific region Several countries in Asia and the Pacific have undertaken major renewable energy policy initiatives (Table 5-6). The countries listed in Table 5-6 vary in their levels of commitment to renewable energy and in the types of measures adopted. Ignoring, for the moment, important differences between similar-sounding policies implemented in different countries, in general terms renewable energy policies in Asia have included targets for renewable energy deployment, measures that prioritize or integrate renewable energy into national plans and/or national bureaucracy, financial support through subsidies (including tax breaks) and provisions that require utilities to allow grid access for renewable energy generators. China, India, Nepal and Thailand stand out as countries that have adopted one or more measures in most of those categories (table 5-7). In most countries there is an overall move away from demonstration projects and entitlement programmes and towards greater reliance on market mechanisms to accomplish deployment. Access for renewable energy generators and targets represent the most common measures adopted \u2013 perhaps because they require little or no investment by Governments. However, development of bureaucracies and granting of subsidies require considerable time and expense. This study strives to deepen understanding of the linkages between renewable energy deployment and poverty alleviation. In this respect, it is noteworthy that no country has developed policies that explicitly link renewable energy deployment with poverty alleviation. Regional programmes and initiatives to support private-sector investment in RETs A number of regional initiatives have been launched since the early 1990s to promote renewable energy technologies in the Asian and Pacific region. Promotion of private investment in RETs has been a central theme for some of the more recent initiatives, while earlier programmes focused on awareness raising and capacity building. Regional cook stove programme The Asia Regional Cookstove Program (ARECOP)34 was initiated in 1991 as a network to facilitate the development of effective improved cook stoves and biomass energy programmes at the household and small industry levels. For more than a decade, ARECOP has consistently focused its activities on the traditional wood/biomass-energy-using population and the millions of people who depend upon wood and other biomass as their main source of energy for their daily livelihood. As a network, ARECOP has made a significant contribution towards establishing effective cooperation among diverse stakeholders in addressing improved cook stoves and related energy issues. The network serves as a forum for exchange of information, skills, expertise and resources among diverse sectors including government institutions, NGOs, academic and research institutions, community- based organizations, international agencies and private institutions. 98 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Table 5-6 Major renewable energy policy initiatives in selected Asian and Pacific countries Country Major policy developments Major programmes China \u2022 Subsidies for hydropower initiated in 1950s. \u2022 Subsidies extended to include biogas, fuel wood and coal-saving technologies in 70s. \u2022 Further increase of financial grants, loans and subsidies for small hydropower in 1980s. \u2022 RE made part of rural energy and rural electrification in the 1980s. \u2022 Recommendations issued for construction and management of wind farms in 1994. \u2022 The Renewable Energy law, endorsed in February 2005 included feed-in tariffs for biomass. \u2022 At present, the Chinese Government is in the processes of formulating its Medium \u2013 and Long-term Energy Development Strategy and Plan to 2020. \u2022 The only country with a separate Ministry (of Non-conventional Energy Sources) dedicated to promoting RETs. \u2022 Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), an autonomous financial institution, created in 1987.

Table 5-6 continued 101 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Throughout its existence, ARECOP activities have helped to shape the direction of improved cookstove programmes in Asia. Specifically, ARECOP has: \u2022 Actively pursued the integration of improved cook stove programmes with other complementary developmental programmes in order to enhance the spread of activities related to improved cook stoves in the absence of resources specifically dedicated to stove programmes; \u2022 Promoted the decentralization of improved stove technical and programmatic skills through a comprehensive training that has now been adopted by institutions in the region. ARECOP has also initiated the adoption of participatory methodology in the improved cook stove programme to address the issue of gender, poverty and sustainability; \u2022 Taken steps to address the issue of indoor air pollution and related health impacts and has put greater focus on the popularization of advanced and modern biomass technology applications; and \u2022 Built capacities to deal with issues at the national level and, through the establishment of Country Contact Points in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam, ARECOP has successfully facilitated the creation of nationally-based networks of cooperation dealing with improved cook stoves and biomass energy use. Development of wood energy in Asia The Regional Wood Energy Development Programme in Asia (RWEDP)35 was a project executed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and funded by the Government of the Netherlands. Its third and final phase was implemented from 1994 to 2001. Fifteen countries participated: Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. The project was implemented in recognition of the fact that Asian countries faced, and continue to face, the following situation: \u2022 An increasing need for energy services to support their economic and social development and that about 30-80 percent of their overall energy needs was met by woodfuels; \u2022 Biomass for cooking and heating dominated household energy use in the majority of the participant countries; and \u2022 Woodfuels were also used in many types of rural industry (sugar palm or cassava processing, brick and lime burning, and so on), for commercial applications (street food vending, restaurants, hospitals, military camps and the like) and at social or ceremonial events such as cremations or festivals. Phases I and II (1987 to 1994) of RWEDP contributed to a better understanding of the complex dynamics of woodfuel flows and their interplay with supplies of alternative fuels to meet the energy needs of millions of urban and rural households, rural industries, village applications and commercial sectors. Phase III aimed to promote improved wood energy systems that were more sustainable and could become competitive with alternative energy sources. Project activities were focused on strengthening policy analysis, energy strategy formulation and wood energy assessment in the following technical areas: woodfuel production, woodfuel processing and marketing and woodfuel use. In those fields, the project trained more than 2,000 regional, national and local persons including agency heads and officials, executives, technical officers, extension staff and NGO volunteers. Participants came from the energy, forestry, agriculture, rural development, science and technology and women development sectors. At the end of the project, the role of fuelwood and other biomass fuels was recognized in the policies and programmes of those development sectors. 102 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Promoting renewable energy, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas abatement Promotion of Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency and Greenhouse Gas Abatement (PREGA) is a technical assistance initiative of the ADB (ADB 2006). Cofinanced by the Dutch Cooperation Fund for Promotion of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency and implemented in 15 developing member countries in Asia and the Pacific, the project seeks to strengthen institutional capacity and technical capability of governments, consultants, academe and other stakeholders to develop and implement clean energy projects.

PREGA has specifically sought to develop a pipeline of investment projects for the Clean Development Mechanism. PREGA started in 2002. Under the first phase, PREGA was implemented in 14 developing member countries in coordination with national counterpart agencies, national implementation committees and national technical experts. A large number of workshops, capacity building and outreach events were organized. PREGA provided significant domestic capacity building to participating countries in awareness raising and motivation for promoting renewable energy, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas abatement (REGA) projects. It has helped in creating enabling policy frameworks and programmes at the country level by catalyzing policy dialogue and holding consultations among stakeholders to address institutional and regulatory barriers. Close to 50 pre-feasibility and feasibility studies of specific REGA projects have been identified and developed under PREGA. Regional research and dissemination programme on RETs In order to promote selected mature and nearly mature renewable energy technologies, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and the Asian Institute of Technology initiated a regional research and dissemination programme, \u201cRenewable Energy Technologies in Asia\u201d in six countries in 1997.37 The first (1997-98) and second (1999-2001) phases of the programme, which involved photovoltaics, solar drying, biomass briquetting and institutional stoves, addressed the country-specific requirements for those technologies. Various adaptations to standard/imported and locally-available technologies were carried out by national research institutions (NRIs) in participating countries. Local expertise was built through technology transfers and training programmes. Demonstration systems were installed to educate the public. The activities of the NRIs were coordinated by AIT. The third and final phase (2002-2004) aimed at consolidating the achievements of earlier phases, and emphasized dissemination. Technology packages were identified, developed and demonstrated on a commercial or semi-commercial basis. Studies on the barriers to promotion of the RETs were conducted and measures to overcome them were identified. In addition to capacity enhancement of NRIs, entrepreneurs, technicians and users of the selected RETs, the programme also resulted in dissemination of research results in appropriate forums through publications, workshops and seminars. The programme led to the establishment of an industry to manufacture lighting systems based on white LEDs in Nepal and the Government of Nepal added solar dryers to its RET subsidy programme. In Bangladesh, solar PV modules were exempted from import taxes and RETs are being included in the National Energy Policy. A provincial government in Viet Nam has collaborated with one of the participating institutions in the programme to promote solar battery charging stations. In Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, the programme\u2019s success has resulted in the initiation of a similar project by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Biomass energy programme in ASEAN The EC-ASEAN COGEN Programme , managed by AIT and Carl Bro International AB of Sweden, has resulted in significant private sector investment in renewable biomass-based generation in ASEAN countries during the ten years from 1994 to 2004 when this programme was active (Lacrosse and Shakya 2004). The programme supported the implementation of proven, clean and efficient biomass cogeneration projects through a combination of business development support and technology transfer. New technologies from Europe were introduced into the rice, sugar, palm oil and wood sectors of ASEAN. Some biogas plants were also implemented with support from the programme. The COGEN project has coincided with improvements in the institutional frameworks in a number of South-East Asian countries to promote the use of renewable energy in general and biomass- based renewables in particular. Small power producer programmes, such as the one in Thailand, have offered the opportunity to agroindustries to use biomass residues more efficiently and to sell excess power to the national grids after meeting their own energy requirements. Those measures 103 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences encouraged industries to replace old, inefficient and polluting energy plants with modern, efficient equipment to optimize the conversion of rice husks, sugarcane bagasse, oil palm wastes and wood residues into useful energy.

Renewable energy for the Mekong subregion The Council of Renewable Energy for the Mekong38 or CORE is a network of organizations and experts from countries in the Mekong subregion, namely Cambodia, Yunnan Province of China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand and Viet Nam, working through local, national and regional institutions in the renewable energy sector. CORE provides a framework for linking governments, the private sector, researchers and experts at all levels, within each country and throughout the region. CORE promotes international cooperation not only in the Mekong subregion but also with other countries, regional entities and international bodies. CORE initiates, supports and encourages activities to develop capabilities in the subregion in solar energy, biogas, other biomass technologies, wind, mini/microhydropower, and energy conservation. CORE is also involved in facilitating regional linkages for commercialization of technologies in the region. The School of Renewable Energy Technology39 (SERT) of Naresuan University, Phitsanulok, Thailand, provides secretariat support to CORE. With advice from CORE, the School also conducts research and development for renewable energy technologies to help the region gain self-reliance and achieve widespread applications of those technologies. SERT also supports applications of renewable energy and efficient energy technologies in industries. As an autonomous state centre, SERT is able to work flexibly to develop renewable energy technologies for the energy needs of developing countries in South-East Asia. 104 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Endnotes 25 See the discussion on targets and timetables below. 26 Available at http://cdm.unfccc.int/EB/032/eb32_repan27.pdf 27 Available at http://cdm.unfccc.int/EB/Meetings 28 Available at http://cdm.unfccc.int/EB/037/eb37_repan06.pdf 29 www.mdgcarbonfacility.org 30 Often this has occurred in times or areas where State power was in question.

Experience With Models of RET Dissemination Led By The Private Sector Renewable energy dissemination in developing countries covers a wide spectrum, from completely unregulated, fully commercial models to various forms of private-public partnerships and state-subsidized markets, to fully subsidized programmes. Success, defined in terms of sustainability and wide coverage, particularly with regard to the poor, appears to be attributable in significant part to arrangements that harness public resources, such as subsidies, and private sector competition in ways that build on the relative strengths of each without undermining the contributions of either. This chapter reviews a variety of dissemination experiences with a focus on Asia and the Pacific to identify factors that have led to relative success, as well as specific causes of failures. Full commercialization models Kenya, where the solar electricity industry is unregulated, is the global leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita (but not in the number of watts added).

The solar lighting schemes of those banks offer 3 \u2013 to 5-year loans to customers for 90 percent of the cost of the solar system at an interest rate of 12-12.5 percent, which is the priority-sector lending rate. Both of the models were based on the assumption that people living in off-grid areas are already paying large sums of money for energy (kerosene, candles, dry cell batteries and charging of lead- acid batteries at the market centre). If high-quality solar lighting could be provided, many of those people would be prepared either to purchase systems or pay a fee for lighting services. A financial model for such a system was presented in the Village Power 2000 programme of the United States Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory, where modules of 5,000 systems each were promoted as a mini-utility. Commercial services powered by renewable energy High-value public services powered by RETs (solar-powered refrigeration, solar PV or microhydropower for telecommunications, distance learning and Internet connectivity) can reach large numbers of people, including the poor, using small amounts of power. A growing cohort of commercial projects for solar-PV-powered drinking water, including both pumping and purification, has appeared in recent years, notably in India, the Maldives and the Philippines. A commercial pilot project recently launched 107 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences in the Maldives hopes to achieve sales of 1,000 litres per day with a delivered price of water to households of around 0.2-0.5 cents per litre in the long-term. In Cebu in the Philippines, filtered, chlorinated water is delivered to 10 villages using a 3 kW solar PV water pump at a price of 3 pesos for 20 litres or 15 centavos a litre, one tenth the cost of bottled water. Villagers use prepaid debit cards to purchase the water and the revenues collected are used to repay a 10-year bank loan which was obtained on commercial terms (REN21 2006). Lessons learned from full commercialization models While the fully commercial model has been successful in terms of reaching a large number of rural customers, it is faced with two challenges. First, the number of people that can afford the systems at full cost is limited hence the model almost never reaches the poorest segments. The second challenge applies primarily to the \u201cno-holds-barred, free market\u201d Kenyan model. In the Kenyan market, and in similar markets elsewhere, it is difficult to enforce consistent quality in fully commercial models. Consumers seldom have sufficient information to be able to distinguish between good and bad quality products. Many customers make decisions on the basis only of price. Eventually, word gets out about which products are reliable and which are not, but for many the information comes too late (Kammen 2006).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58735d94-c349-4abd-b40a-80c130c0a691": {"__data__": {"id_": "58735d94-c349-4abd-b40a-80c130c0a691", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54fa4df96f9f61d5855e093bba49c2a0e240e79fcb50bec23ba402cb3fefcb7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "cce61309-a472-47f1-bd15-f00f55e60e1c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2fbf8735593fb74bbaefac6d1d5e423573b2d8fed91cf8c4a343fdcd50b549c"}}, "hash": "9f9c3932f502cb8b9ee2f51f6cb4467f845ae5ea5fdedc406f04a0e6e1d037ce", "text": "Commercialization supported by civil society A second model which has gained currency falls into the general category of public-private or, in some cases, civil-society-supported private enterprise models.

The model has been applied to household cooking technologies, ICS and biogas and to SHSs and the number of high quality systems that has resulted is encouraging. Although it is unclear whether energy services are available to the poor as yet, the model appears to be able to increase the volume of sales of RETs substantially and is robust enough to work across a number of countries. The impact of the technologies on reducing poverty in the households they serve is unclear. However, significant employment is clearly generated in the resulting RET industries. Enterprise assistance and market development support for improved cook stoves Commercialization has worked well in the large-scale expansion of the market for improved cook stoves across a number of countries in Asia and the Pacific. Many of the ICS programmes in the region have focused on providing technical assistance and market development support to artisans and stove entrepreneurs. Notable among private-sector-driven cook stoves programmes are the Chinese cook stove programme, the Anagi stove in Sri Lanka and, more recently, the New Lao Stove promoted under the Cambodia Fuelwood Savings Project. China has used small rural private companies extensively in achieving its very large numbers of RET systems. The Chinese ICS programme, the largest and arguably most successful in the world, relied on rural private stove companies for its success. Private companies built the 100 million improved cook stoves (and the 16 million biogas plants) in rural China. Stove adopters pay the full cost of material and labour, while the Government helps producers through designs for stove construction, training, administration and promotion support. The Sri Lankan Anagi stove is another example of commercialization supported by civil society. The market for biomass stoves for the urban poor in Sri Lanka was expanded by the Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG) and other organizations in the 1990s through a model that encouraged artisans to get into business as mass producers of stoves and to market them through normal market channels and around two million units have been sold since 1991. Village potters have been trained to manufacture the stoves from clay according to strict standards and the stoves are widely available in the market. The Integrated Development Association (IDEA) has trained around 120 potters in 14 rural districts and they produce approximately 300,000 stoves each year. While small producers living in remote areas sell their products directly in their villages, wholesalers visit production centres to buy the stoves in bulk and then distribute the stoves to retail shops spread over a radius of about 200 kilometres. The wholesale price of the stoves is in the SL Rs 65-95 range whereas the retail price is between SL Rs 90 and SL Rs 200. The stoves save 30 percent of fuelwood costs for the user and are estimated to have a pay-back period of two months. Production of 1,000 stoves per month can provide a monthly turnover of around SL Rs 50,000 and full-time employment for 1 potter and 3 unskilled persons (Amerasekera 2005). 108 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences In Cambodia, the Cambodian Fuelwood Saving Project42 provides technical and business development training to stove entrepreneurs, who then sell the stoves (see box 3-1). CFSP has so far trained 20 stove producers, 14 of whom are currently producing ICSs. The level of investment from end-users in the ICS, at roughly US$2 above the price of the traditional stove, amounts to around US$190,000 based on the almost 95,000 ICS sold in October 2002-October 2005. For each ICS, producers invest an average of US$0.50 more than for a traditional stove, equaling a total estimated investment from suppliers of over US$47,000 in the same time period. CFSP has also created the Improved Cookstove Producers and Distributors Association of Cambodia (ICoProDAC), which facilitates sectoral development, quality assurance, and the long-term sustainability of ICS dissemination. Enterprise development has been the hallmark of the Nepal improved cook stoves programme as well. In that programme, capacity building inputs are provided by the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre, which has been instrumental in expanding the informal private sector participation in this subsector. The Centre for Rural Technology43 and other NGOs promote stoves in rural areas by training village stove builders, often women, who build improved stoves in people\u2019s homes for a fee.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40d5c707-4e9f-4ed1-b2f2-301212dd422c": {"__data__": {"id_": "40d5c707-4e9f-4ed1-b2f2-301212dd422c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce4bae36a8bdcfe443ad783440d3c7419ea3dc0e265ee2fbff10c821809ab407"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb215ad7-459a-4703-97e6-b9d9e066c47c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4734fdb02f3664017dece7463dd0b57688fb1cb7f0cc3c9ed7e3a9ef5ab89425"}}, "hash": "e85c0742444682a92907d3561342efb314fbe7bbde7344d91dae6213c025670f", "text": "The construction of the improved stoves is carried out exclusively by trained masons and in 2005 there were about 1,700 trained technicians to carry out ICS installations in Nepal .

In addition to that training, ARTI imparts other skills necessary for running a cook stove business to the self-employed workers. The skills include market surveys, costing, inventory control, quality control, preparation of project proposals for financial institutions, tax and labour laws, salesmanship and advertising. ARTI also encourages producers to set up their own businesses and operate as independent entrepreneurs, providing them with financial and other necessary support. Entrepreneurship in ICSs makes economic sense when it is promoted as a complementary activity with other traditional trades such as pottery. Using public funds to leverage quality in the Nepal household biogas market Household biogas is a more complex technology than improved cook stoves and appears to be best promoted not through individual masons but through private companies that employ masons. Companies are able to provide warranties and after-sales service, something individual masons often cannot do. The Nepal Biogas Support Programme45 has 60 companies installing biogas plants. To date, the companies have sold over 150,000 household biogas plants and are constructing between 15,000 and 20,000 plants each year. Roughly 5 percent of rural households in Nepal cook on biogas. BSP has provided technological innovation, financing, engineering and market development for household-scale biogas plants. BSP only allows one design of a biogas plant in its programme, the 2047 GGC (designed by the Gobar Gas Company), which comes in different sizes of 4, 6, 8, and 10 cubic metres, the most popular size being 6 cubic metres. All companies must build to the exact specifications of the approved design and BSP carries out spot checks on up to 15 percent of the plants under construction each year to ensure adherence to quality. Warranties are provided by the companies through a process that has now been ISO 9000 certified. As of July 2006, more than 150,000 biogas plants had been installed in Nepal and strict quality control has ensured that over 97 percent of the biogas plants were still working well after three years. BSP is able to enforce quality on the biogas digesters because it also approves subsidies that are given to participating companies. The subsidies range from NRs 5,500 to NRs 11,500 (US$75 to US$160) per plant. To maximize subsidy benefits for poor and remote households, the relative subsidy depends on the plant size and location within the country with smaller and more remote digesters receiving higher subsidies. Participating companies sign an agreement with BSP at the beginning of each year agreeing to build to a common design and to a set standard. They also agree to random checks on their plants and to pay penalties if they are found to be delinquent in following all quality standards. Every two weeks, companies are required to submit evidence for the biogas plants they have constructed to BSP and apply for the subsidy payment. One challenge of a programme based on subsidies such as BSP is sustainability. The programme depends on continued financial support being available from donors and the Government. The high performance of BSP has meant that donors and the Government of Nepal have so far provided grant support to run the programme and to provide household subsidies since 1992. It is not clear that they can continue to provide the subsidies after the current Phase IV of the programme ends in 2009. As a way to secure sustainable funding for the continuation of the programme, BSP was developed into a Clean Development Mechanism project in 2005. Two activities were registered with the CDM Executive Board, each of around 9,400 plants, to stay within the 15 MW limit under the small-scale methodology. The 18,800 plants are expected to abate 93,883 tons of carbon dioxide and to generate around US$675,000 for the programme each year. CDM registration of the remainder of the plants 109 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences that are being built under Phase IV could generate sufficient resources to continue the programme sustainably into the future. The success of BSP has prompted the Netherlands Development Organization (SNV)46, which launched the programme in Nepal, to start up similar projects in Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. An initiative along the same lines is also being contemplated for Sub-Saharan Africa.

In its essence, the commercialization model consists of the following elements: a. A national programme provides subsidy support and quality control. It encourages private sector or NGO partners to market systems under a certain warranty and quality guidelines. The national programme routes the subsidy through the supplier.47 The companies are pre-qualified to participate in the programme and sign an agreement to follow its quality control guidelines. The subsidy is designed to prime the pump and establish the market and is reduced gradually. b. The role of private enterprise is essential in the sustained expansion of markets for solar home systems. As long as a company or individual is making a profit by expanding the business, the installations will continue beyond the project period. c. The national programmes also provide consumer financing for the purchase of systems either through microfinance institutions or through the vendors themselves. In Sri Lanka, under the RERED project, financing is provided through independent microfinance organizations such as SEEDS. In Bangladesh, where the vendor is the Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL), it is provided to customers through participating NGOs in the form of vendor finance and installment payments. d. The national programme conducts consumer awareness campaigns. In Sri Lanka, to address the lack of awareness, the RERED project executes a generic promotion campaign on SHSs and village hydropower schemes, educating the public on the advantages and limitations of the systems, informing them about service and warranty arrangements, as well as available loan schemes. A variety of communication channels are used, including workshops and demonstrations in villages. The promotion targets end-users, government authorities, community-based organizations, microfinance institutions and the general public.

Its major components are grid-connected small hydropower, solar home systems and off-grid village hydropower. Project targets include provision of electricity access to 100,000 households through SHSs. The most popular business model that has emerged includes a solar company that is responsible for marketing and technical support, while a separate institution handles consumer financing (Table 6-1). The Grameen Shakti Solar Home Systems Program in Bangladesh sells SHSs on credit. It is implemented in several districts of the country and had an initial target of installing 8,000 systems in three years. Since the systems are expensive for rural people Grameen Shakti, part of the microfinance organization Grameen Bank, has introduced soft financing options for the customer. Grameen Shakti has also linked the technology to some income-generating activities as well.48 Individual SHS capacity ranges from 30Wp to 128Wp and Grameen Shakti offers several credit modes to fit ability to pay of those who want to buy the system on credit. Customers use PV systems mainly for lighting and for recreational purposes (watching television). By June 2005, Grameen Shakti had installed 42,000 SHSs with an installation capacity of 2.15 MW. Based on the Grameen Shakti experience, the World Bank and GEF launched the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development Program in Bangladesh in 2002. Under this programme, IDCOL, a state-owned entity, had planned to disseminate 50,000 SHSs and another body, the Rural Electrification Board, an additional 14,000 systems within five years. REREDP is based on a commercialization model being implemented through some 15 partner organizations, most of whom are NGOs.

However, the project encountered great demand for the systems, as a result of which the target was reached three years ahead of schedule, in August 2005; it is to be expanded to meet the high demand for SHSs in Bangladesh. In addition to expanding the SHS programme, IDCOL is entering into new ventures in renewable energy, including launching a household biogas project, based on the Nepal model, with the support of SNV. Agreements have already been signed to provide some 60,000 systems in the next five years. The Bangladesh SHS market has seen significant participation by the private sector (Table 6-2). Rahimafrooz, a leading private sector battery manufacturing company in Bangladesh, provides deep- cycle solar batteries for the majority of solar home systems sold in the country by Grameen Shakti and subsequently promoted through IDCOL. The company provides a five-year warranty on its solar batteries. This is rather unique among solar battery suppliers and has resulted in high confidence among customers about the longevity of systems. One reason the company is able to provide such a warranty without incurring large transactions costs in fulfilling it is that it has an extensive network of retailers throughout the country selling its automotive batteries. The retailers can take back any battery that fails within the warranty period. Rahimafrooz, which has now specialized in solar batteries, also exports them to Nepal and other neighbouring countries for use with SHSs.49 111 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Lessons learned in subsidy-supported commercialization The cook stove, biogas and PV commercialization experiences discussed above suggest a number of lessons learned. a. Commercialization creates supply chains and market networks. Supply chains that include workshops, wholesalers, retailers, repair capability and microfinance have been created in both the biogas and SHS examples above. b. Commercialization can be a powerful mechanism not only to install a large number of systems on the ground but also to build a private sector delivery mechanism alongside that can keep supplying new systems to meet demand from consumers. The confidence of rural customers that the systems supplied are of high quality, backed by post-installation maintenance service, is necessary to this. c. The provision of a government subsidy makes it possible to enforce quality control by creating an incentive for private sector players to follow certain standards. This is as important, if not more so, than the fact that the subsidy also makes systems more affordable to rural users. d. Commercialization does not automatically deliver services to the poor or help them get out of poverty. It matches energy supply with ability to pay. Where microfinance is available, the ranks of those that are able to purchase systems are deepened and those that can pay for systems in installments can also have access. Nevertheless, there is little evidence that existing programmes are reaching the poorest people even with microfinance. Some of the NGOs participating in the larger national programmes have launched their own projects to increase the incomes of the poor through energy provision. e. There is some evidence that the same market networks set up in the commercialization process can also be used to provide lower-cost systems that can be more affordable to the poor. An example of this is where solar companies have diversified to selling low- power, solar PV systems based on white LEDs for the lower end of the market. The initial sunk cost in establishing market networks can be available to supply the poor at small additional expenditure. Public-private involvement in community-based renewable energy systems One concern of a commercialization approach based on selling RET systems to the individual household is that the public and private investment results in few benefits to the collective community. While household-scale renewable energy systems provide much-appreciated power for lighting and small appliances, there may be other, larger-scale energy solutions which, if adopted, could have greater benefits to the community or to the subregion as a whole. Community projects can not only meet domestic energy needs but can also provide power for irrigation pumps, mills and electric motors, energizing rural livelihood activities and thus helping to reduce poverty.

Community-based systems are generally set up to be operated as rural-based commercial enterprises that meet operations and maintenance costs through tariffs collected every month. In many countries of the region, village-scale mini-grids have been serving populations in remote areas and on islands. They have typically been powered by diesel generators, occasionally with supplementary solar photovoltaics or windpower, or small hydropower. Microhydropower provides substantial power at relatively low cost to rural communities. The projects are generally large enough to provide power not only for lighting but also for milling services and for electric tools, refrigeration, and other uses that enable development of small industries. This reduces drudgery and creates employment. Microhydropower projects have the added advantage that with sufficient social preparation they tend to be inclusive, providing services to the poor as well. This is a major advantage over expensive household-based energy systems such as biogas and solar PV which generally end up being unaffordable to the poorer households in the communities. Poor households have to contribute to the construction of community microhydropower projects as do their more wealthy neighbors. One common solution is to allow low-income households to contribute labour in the construction of the projects in lieu of cash payments. Another common practice involves voluntary cash contributions from each house towards construction, where the better-off households are expected to contribute significantly more than others thus partially covering the costs to the poor. When compared with household-scale systems, an attractive feature of community projects like microhydropower is that tariffs can easily be structured to include a cross-subsidy in the form of low \u201clifeline\u201d rates that provide basic service at low cost to poorer households that use little electricity. 112 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Renewable energy community grids as an entry-point for integrated rural development in Nepal and the Philippines In practice, another positive feature of community-scale projects is that the collective endeavour of planning, building and operating the project can build trust and social capital that is ultimately the foundation for rural development dynamics that goes far beyond electricity provision. This, in turn, can provide the impetus for economic development that stretches beyond the reach of the wires of the mini-grid itself. The flip side of the coin is that successful development of the project and accompanying social capital requires additional investment \u2013 especially of time, by a skilled facilitator agency, usually an NGO, that assists members of the target community in organizing themselves and acquiring technical capacity to own and manage the village-level energy facility. The NGO typically provides assistance in project feasibility studies, assembling financing for the project and accessing available grant funds, start-up operation of the facility, marketing the produce of the community and coordinating with government authorities and other entities whose support and cooperation are crucial to the success of the project. UNDP\u2019s Rural Energy Development Programme pioneered this type of work in Nepal starting in 1996. REDP views microhydropower as an entry point for economic development and poverty alleviation. It currently supports community-based microhydropower projects in 25 of 75 districts in Nepal. The programme stresses community mobilization, bottom-up participatory planning and decentralized decision-making. It uses a holistic approach to development considering the energy projects as one of many inputs that are required. The approach includes income generation, environmental protection, gender equality and watershed protection. Productive income-generating activities are supported to make use of the energy supplied, and skills-training is provided to promote agricultural and home-based businesses. The programme has a major emphasis on building the capability and social capital in the community. The process of building the microhydropower project enhances social capital on which any number of future development activities can be built. REDP in Nepal also reflects a multi-stakeholder partnership, including both the public and community sectors. The central government counterpart agencies of the REDP, which are responsible for policy formulation, include the Ministry of Local Development, National Planning Commission, Water and Energy Commission Secretariat and the Alternative Energy Promotion Center. REDP projects are also strongly linked to district government decision making. The Rural Energy Development Section is established under the umbrella of the District Development Committee (DDC) for the implementation of district-level activities. For coordination purposes, a District Energy Committee is formed under the chairmanship of the DDC Chairman. A consultative forum of practitioners represented by the manufacturing companies, installers, owners, NGOs and others has been formed as a network that promotes best practice. The project operates through community organizations and microhydropower functional groups formed by women and men from the communities.

Important lessons from the REDP experience are: \u2022 With social mobilization and technical support, communities themselves come up with creative ways to be inclusive; \u2022 The nationwide approach adopted by REDP ensures a consistent methodology throughout the country, as well as the ability to influence national policy to support community energy projects; and \u2022 By working through district governments and local NGOs, support to community-owned microhydropower projects continues beyond the construction period and REDP has been able to influence national policy to be supportive of community-owned energy investments. The Andhi Khola Project (5.1 MW) in Nepal operated by the private Butwal Power Company50 exemplifies the role that a considerably larger project can have in regional development. The locally- developed project provides power to over 100,000 people in four districts in West Nepal. The project set up an enterprise support unit to help establish enterprises in the area to make productive use of the energy supplied. The unit helped entrepreneurs develop business plans, choose appropriate equipment and technology and also to get loans from the local bank. Electric mills, milk chilling units, noodle manufacturing factories and poultry farms were some of the enterprises that resulted from this support. 113 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Afghanistan, China, Pakistan and Sri Lanka provide other examples in the region of country- wide programmes to support community microhydropower projects. Afghanistan launched such a programme in 2002 with support to over 500 communities to install microhydropower systems below 25 kW. In Pakistan, a number of NGOs are investing in community-based minihydropower in different parts of the country. One strong example is the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme51 that has installed over 240 projects in Northern Pakistan generating close to 10,000 kW and serving over 100,000 inhabitants living in a harsh mountain environment. A significant challenge is that the community-scale projects can present \u201ccommon property\u201d problems. The system performance can be strongly affected by the collective action of users. In stand-alone systems, the electricity available is limited in quantity by the capacity of the power plant. Once users are connected to the electricity lines, however, it is difficult to restrict access to consumption of the resource. Anyone with an electricity outlet can plug in appliances. Over-consumption by some individuals pursuing their own short-term interest can degrade the resource for all. The challenges can be addressed with properly designed tariffs, metering arrangements and enforcement \u2013 an area that receives inadequate attention in many projects. In addition to the common property issues in distributing yields from village power systems, an equally important set of issues arises with respect to allocation of maintenance and repair responsibilities and/or collecting funds for those activities. The GEF Small Grants Programme52, implemented by UNDP, has provided funding for community- owned microhydropower and watershed management projects in many countries in the region, including the costs of social mobilization through the help of a local NGO. In the Philippines alone, the programme has provided support to over 20 community-based microhydropower projects. Poloc\u00f3n, a small farming community of around 100 households located in the southernmost part of the Philippines, provides an illustrative example. Here, a 15 kW microhydropower plant managed by a community cooperative has helped alleviate poverty through increased agricultural productivity and through supplementary community income. Electricity is used to grind corn and hull coffee beans for local farmers as well as residents of surrounding non-electrified communities. Outsiders also purchase battery-charging services. Tariffs for corn milling and other uses are set at a level to cover maintenance costs and the salaries for plan operators, as well as community development projects. Funds have been invested in the local school and in a bakery run by the community women\u2019s group (UNDP-GEF 2003). Less common, but promising, is the example of village microhydropower selling electricity to the national grid. This is occurring on a limited scale in Indonesia and Thailand, but needs the prior existence of regulations that require utilities to purchase power from (very) small power producers. \u201cWalking on two legs\u201d \u2013 China\u2019s extensive microhydropower mini-grid story China pioneered approaches to comprehensive integration of off-grid energy supply and rural development. By adopting a policy of \u201cwalking on two legs\u201d, China has had a State-endorsed policy since the early-1950s of supporting decentralized energy development concurrently with the growth of central grid systems. China is a world leader today in terms of having the largest installed capacity of RETs and the largest population served by RETs by far because off-grid systems have been", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55779d94-06eb-4234-ab41-4d0c30168133": {"__data__": {"id_": "55779d94-06eb-4234-ab41-4d0c30168133", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e02563b6fc8e3b457cffeb6e6d5d897ba0aa00157a3c738ca7903e571b85016"}}, "hash": "1e02563b6fc8e3b457cffeb6e6d5d897ba0aa00157a3c738ca7903e571b85016", "text": "part of a national strategy for over 50 years. Local mini-grids, often based on micro \u2013 or minihydropower, are the backbone of the power supply on which China\u2019s strategy of rural industrialization was built. Those systems were suited to the needs of the local economy and have supported the burgeoning Township and Village Enterprises. Rural energy systems were able to grow during the period of transformation in the country, when significant changes were being made in the rural economy through the introduction of market reforms. This was the time farmers were being provided the needed technical and budgetary assistance to encourage them to adopt an entrepreneurial approach to agricultural production away from collective farming systems. Agricultural reform and modernization of rural areas meant intensification and diversification of crop production, modernization of post-harvest and other crop-processing activities, development of other off-farm enterprises and establishment of rural services such as education, health and telecommunication facilities, thus creating a ready market for energy services. Counties were able to invest in new power generation to respond to significant increase in demand for modern energy services as a result of reforms in agriculture and other sub-sectors of the rural economy. As a result of the integrated approach, 98 percent of farmer households in the counties targeted by the programme are supplied with electricity. The local government in particular played a key role in integrating energy into the economic development plans of rural areas. Mini-grids would connect up with expanding regional grids and eventually with national grids. Today a third of the counties in China rely on a local small hydropower 114 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences as their main source of power. Recently China has also had a large programme of promoting household-level solar and wind systems to reach those households that are beyond the reach of local grids. Efforts were made to adopt a market-based approach in the dissemination of RETs. This was possible as income levels of the rural population had increased as a result of the intensification of agricultural production and the increase in productivity of other sectors of the rural economy. They could thus afford to pay for the RET equipment and devices, albeit with some financial assistance provided for the poorest counties by local governments. Also, RET equipment and devices were manufactured by local companies that have also received support from the government. The example provided of the role of government, particularly local government, in integrating energy into economic development in China to achieve poverty reduction while, at the same time, using the private sector to actually deliver the systems can be a lesson for other countries in Asia and the Pacific. The mass manufacture of micro \u2013 and minihydropower equipment in China, facilitated by cheap labour, has lead to equipment prices that are considerably less expensive than those in other developing country markets. This, in turn, further enables conditions in which small hydropower is competitive with other forms of commercial energy [Hanzhou Regional (Asia-Pacific) Centre for Small Hydro Power 2003]. Mini-grid experience with microhydropower in Pacific island countries Successful implementation of microhydropower is not as widespread as it could be in the Asian and Pacific region. In particular, the technology has not done very well in the Pacific island countries. The Solomon Islands country study presents an unfortunately common example of an unreliable microhydropower project which requires more effort to maintain and operate than the benefit it delivers. There are some indications that earlier experiences have informed and improved more recent installations. The experience in the Pacific islands underscores the need to launch a regional initiative to transfer best practices in community-managed microhydropower. Public-private participation in non-hydropower mini-grids \u2013 biogassifiers and solar PV Though microhydropower is the most common power source for renewable energy mini-grids, significant experience has been gained with biogassifiers and solar PV/diesel as well. In the Sagar islands of West Bengal in India, the State renewable energy development agency has implemented several community-based solar power plants to bring electric power to villages from solar electricity distributed through local mini-grids. The power is mainly used for lighting and the running of small appliances and machinery, as well as operating radios and televisions. A significant feature of the project is that during the day, when the grid is not being used to supply power, the solar electricity is used to run low-cost conventional 3 hp water pumps which supply clean drinking water from underground aquifers. The mini-grids themselves are operated by local cooperative societies formed by people using the grid.

Between 1996 and 2003, no less than 11 solar power stations were established, serving nearly 2,000 families. In climates where it is easy to grow biomass, community-based electricity generation from biomass gasification shows particular promise for large-scale expansion.53 Teaming up with large IPPs \u2013 innovative public-private partnerships A recent and novel phenomenon is the partnership between the public sector and private companies to achieve electrification of rural communities. In the Philippines, the Government has invited large private IPPs, often thermal, to contribute to its target of 100 percent Barangay electrification by 2008. The Mirant Corporation which operates as an IPP providing power to Manila and other urban centres has adopted several hundred Barangays to electrify as part of its commitment to corporate social responsibility. The choice of technologies is generally RETs, typically household solar PV or microhydropower.54 As part of a recent initiative, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI)55 and the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) have come together to provide energy to remote villages in India, through distributed generation.56 This is aimed at assisting the Government of India in its mission of \u201cElectricity for all\u201d through developing a self-sustainable business model for DG (distributed generation) projects in rural areas for the integrated growth of villages. A number of technical options are being tested, including biomass gasifiers with gas engines, solar PV and microhydropower. In addition to standard energy planning activities, the cornerstone of this approach is a focus on the involvement and commitment of local communities. In addition, several innovative measures have been put in place including: 115 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences \u2022 Ownership responsibility for revenue collection, operations and maintenance rest with the Village Energy Committee (VEC); \u2022 Integrated growth of villages with increase in income levels, employment and commercial activity; \u2022 Advanced revenue collection techniques (smart cards); \u2022 Identifying additional services to increase the incomes of the VEC and the operator; \u2022 Linking specific (existing and new) livelihoods programmes with electrification, in particular targeting families below the poverty line in order to raise their demand for, and affordability of, electricity; \u2022 Tariff rationalization for commercial and domestic consumers in order to make the services competitive to existing alternatives while improving financial viability of the project; \u2022 Project support network of village-level operators, cluster-level mechanics and region- level technicians; and \u2022 Majority or totality of female members in VECs to manage the project. The TERI-NTPC model has a tripartite structure, resting on technical, social and financial elements. This approach offers several advantages, as compared with the traditional single party, government- led electrification model. a. TERI, as the project manager, has been instrumental in pooling the range of expertise and competence required to ensure quality implementation, especially important in remote locations, with poor access and inadequate operations and maintenance support. b. TERI, in its capacity as a large international organization, has taken the lead in scaling up the initiative, through developing implementation models. c. NTPC, with its extensive electrification experience, has brought technical rigour, through quality norms for technical aspects and periodic technical audits necessary for the technical soundness of the project.

RETs have flourished where a government or national utility has announced a feed-in tariff or a standard power purchase agreement and made provisions for interconnection of customer-owned generation. The establishment of a guaranteed market for renewable energy has been crucial to the rapid expansion of private investment by renewable energy IPPs in India, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Fully subsidized arrangements Purely government-led dissemination programmes for scaling up access to RETs have largely fallen short of expectations, with a few exceptions. The RET scale-up process, especially in rural areas, is based on getting small distributed systems to large numbers of households and communities. Public sector institutions, which have strength in building large systems with central generators and extending distribution networks, are generally not well suited to expanding the market for those types of systems, and in some cases when they have tried, they have seriously undermined local private sector businesses providing RET products and services. Thailand stands out in the \u201c100 percent subsidized\u201d category for having repeatedly implemented large renewable energy rural electrification projects fully paid for by the Government with the private sector serving as contractor. The projects include over 1,000 village solar battery-charging stations, over 400 solar pumping stations and, most recently, over 200,000 solar home systems. Lack of a local repair network, lack of warranty awareness and lack of user training, as well as equipment problems, have led to significant unresolved failures in these systems. It is not clear that the \u201c100 percent subsidized\u201d characteristic of the programme is completely to blame. Many systems would be more functional had more vigilance been applied in system design and in technical training for local recipients, and had more time been devoted to learning from early mistakes. Perhaps the most fundamental challenge in the Thai case is that feedback loops from system recipients back to equipment suppliers and government decision makers are very weak. (Greacen and Green 2001; Lynch et al. 2006) It is significant that the \u201cclient\u201d who pays for the systems is a Bangkok- based government office, far removed from the day-to-day experience of remote system users. It is conceivable that a government-funded deployment of renewable energy technology could work fairly effectively in the same way that, for example, state-run railways in Thailand appear to function. What is required is some way of strengthening accountability to end-users. While commercialization and market forces can, under proper circumstances, provide this strengthening, their existence does not preclude the possibility of other options. The Thai case brings up a question yet to be addressed: what role can the private sector play in salvaging similar projects initiated by the public sector? In the Thai case, the glass is \u201chalf full\u201d in the sense that the Government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars installing SHSs in remote areas, and the solar PV modules have few failures. However, the balance of system (BOS) components, such as inverters and batteries, are in need of significant attention. What scope is there for the private sector \u2013 subsidized by the Government perhaps \u2013 to keep the systems sustainable by installing quality equipment and providing post-installation service? One particular challenge in such cases is that the asset itself often remains public property even if it is no longer functioning. This presents very significant barriers to private sector entry. Financing renewable energy technologies Financing mechanisms for RETs including those for the poor Because most renewable energy systems are capital intensive, availability of suitable financing is essential to the proliferation of private sector investment in RETs in Asia and the Pacific. In the private sector, financing generally falls into three categories: equity and debt financing on the project or business finance side, and consumer financing to increase affordability on the demand side. The Asian and Pacific region is experiencing the development of a number of emerging financing mechanisms that point the way to greater investment and increased affordability, while also indicating where further intervention will be needed in the future. Debt finance The weak capital markets usually found in developing countries can have particularly serious consequences for renewable energy projects which by their nature are highly capital-intensive. If 117 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences finance can only be had at high interest rates, with short maturities and low debt-to-equity ratios, the resulting increase in capital costs will raise the price per kWh produced using renewable energy relative to fossil-fuel-based technologies, discouraging investment in the former, at least in the short- term.

This would certainly lower cost per kWh making renewable energy projects more competitive. Debt finance for renewable energy project is examined further in Box 6-1. The bulk of the financing provided to a project is usually in the form of senior debt, which can be structured as on-balance-sheet corporate finance or off-balance-sheet project finance. Non-recourse financing, where the project is the only collateral, is seldom available in emerging markets, however. Neither are loan terms long enough to spread out the cost of capital over the life of the project. Some innovation in debt financing instruments is reportedly in progress in developing countries to address some of the barriers to financing renewable energy infrastructure projects. The World Bank, KfW (together with its private sector financing subsidiary) and other development finance institutions are putting in place a variety of instruments to improve access to long-term financing. They include currency swaps to reduce foreign exchange risk, two-step bridging mechanisms to allow project refinancing, lease- financing arrangements to reduce offtake risk and various other approaches. Some countries in Asia and the Pacific have recognized the shortage of commercial debt funds for RETs and have established specialized institutions to provide loans in response. Some of those initiatives have had significant results. The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency has approved over 1,700 loans for a range of projects in wind energy, biomass power, solar energy and small hydropower development. IREDA, which is coordinated by the Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources, had a budget of US$137 million for the year 2005, of which over 35 percent was earmarked for electrification of rural villages based on renewable energy. Since its establishment in 1987, IREDA has invested almost US$1 billion in over 2,500 MW of power from renewable energy and has a pipeline loan commitment of another US$1.5 billion. World Bank/GEF projects have started to invest in RETs through financial institutions in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) in Sri Lanka has been active in financing small hydropower, solar PV, village hydropower and biomass systems under World Bank credit programmes (ESD and RERED). DFCC provides credit to intermediary financing institutions, at present a total of nine participating credit institutions including microfinance institutions. It has a pipeline of 120 MW of small hydropower projects and a fast-growing solar PV market with over 70,000 systems installed. Similarly, IDCOL in Bangladesh is active in financing renewable energy, primarily SHSs, supported by a credit line of US$20 million from the World Bank. IDCOL operates through intermediaries such as Grameen Shakti and the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) to deliver financing to end-users of the systems. *From UNDESA 2005. Box 6-1 Debt finance for renewable energy projects* 118 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Grameen Shakti has sold and installed over 65,000 solar home-systems in rural Bangladesh and brought major benefits to users of the systems. Nearly 70 percent of households in Bangladesh are not connected to the electricity grid and depend on kerosene for lighting. This includes most rural areas and extends as far as the fringes of Dhaka. There are plans to extend the grid, but there is little prospect of substantial change in the foreseeable future. By selling SHSs, Grameen Shakti has provided lighting, communications (especially mobile phone charging) and television, and increased employment opportunities. It is the largest single installer of SHSs in Bangladesh. This has been achieved by providing microfinance with support from IDCOL drawing on World Bank/GEF funds. IDCOL provides Grameen Shakti with a subsidy as well as with concessional loans for the systems, which allow it to sell SHSs to customers on microcredit at affordable installments spread out over two or three years as well as a small down payment. This generates a cash pool, which is recycled to make further loans and which will enable the scheme to continue when the subsidy is phased out by 2008. Grameen Shakti has started a network of technology centres throughout the country to manage the installation and maintenance of SHSs locally. It emphasizes the importance of technicians who know local customs and work through local branches, and has trained 2,000 (mainly female) technicians.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "963d058e-44c9-414e-b387-fac51460503d": {"__data__": {"id_": "963d058e-44c9-414e-b387-fac51460503d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36ea66c0b42653127eafaf218511303cba9da62b81c42d88400f15441a01f3be"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb057a23-0427-4802-b1a5-51fb1c5129bd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "815d0415fb80994b26d38161027138af603bb1920585508c04a7f97e7847800a"}}, "hash": "f9bd57fe73e2d4b0aa240fda380e6e6f90a9c952a30fd792e4ed1ff46263918b", "text": "It aims to install one million systems by 2015.57 Equity finance Even in markets where the private sector has invested in power, perceptions of greater risk, lack of clear power purchase agreements and lack of financing have resulted in less than optimal levels of private investment in the renewable energy sector.

Those alternative investors that are interested cannot in general access sufficient funds to expand operations. A number of budding international social and environmental venture capital funds have emerged that provide seed capital and are moving towards providing \u201cpatient\u201d capital to help prospective energy investors and service providers. One of those organizations is E+Co, which is based in the United States. Building on earlier experience within the programmes of the Rockefeller Foundation, E+Co was established in 1994 as an independent company of entrepreneurs, investors, strategists and mediators to bring together technology, people and funding to create viable local enterprises that deliver affordable and clean energy to those in need. Operating in Latin America, Africa and Asia, E+Co provides business development services and modest loans or equity investments to fulfill this mission. The company\u2019s strategy is to demonstrate to public and private sector investors that the establishment of local clean energy enterprises represents a win-win, market-based solution to the twin problems of meeting the unmet demand for energy services and protecting the environment. Ultimately, the new enterprises and access to energy offer opportunities for education, employment, and improved livelihoods, thereby breaking the cycle of poverty.58 One example of an energy investment supported by E+Co\u2019s Bangkok office is anaerobic digestion for biogas production using the waste biomass at one of Thailand\u2019s largest cassava processors. This project was developed by the Clean Energy Development Company (Thailand) Limited (CleanThai) with technical support from Waste Solutions Limited of New Zealand. Project financing was obtained from Al-Tayyar Energy of Abu Dhabi and the Korat Waste to Energy Company was established to implement the project and operate the plant. By converting a waste stream into a resource, the factory is displacing 8 million litres of heavy fuel oil as well as generating 30,000 MWh of electricity each year. E+Co has invested US$197,500 in this enterprise with leveraged co-financing of US$3.4 million from equity investors and banks. E+Co\u2019s investments are typically structured as senior debt, subordinated debt, preferred shares, common equity or a combination. E+Co sometimes also invests in seed capital to support pre- investment activities. The maximum investment is limited to US$250,000 per project. This general model of supporting energy enterprises and entrepreneurs is catching on. E+Co has raised US$40 million from several sources since the Bonn Conference on Renewable Energies, held in June 2004, to expand this model worldwide. UNEP, the United Nations Foundation and E+Co are experimenting with approaches to financing small \u2013 and medium-scale renewable energy enterprises through the Rural Energy Enterprise Development (REED) programme in Africa, Brazil and China. The Triodos Renewable Energy for Development Fund provides seed capital, loans, and business development support for renewable energy entrepreneurs in Asia and Africa. It provides equity and mezzanine finance to local financial intermediaries that focus on providing financial services to projects and small and medium-sized enterprises in the clean energy sector. The Fund\u2019s investments are aimed at attracting local commercial investors in the clean energy sector. The Fund is managed by Triodos International Fund 119 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Management BV and counts among its funders the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the World Bank and the Hivos Foundation. The Fund has made investments in a number of leading solar energy companies including Khmer Solar in Cambodia, Mambruk Indonesia and Lotus Energy in Nepal.59 The Renewable Energy Project Support Office (REPSO) of Winrock International in India and Nepal and its network members in Indonesia and Philippines have provided seed capital for pre-investment support and cost-share investments. The programmes all recognize asymmetry in terms of high perception of risks by investors at the pre-investment stage of project development and work to reduce those risks. With inadequate information and sector experience, investors are often unwilling to invest in good quality feasibility studies and interaction with co-financiers and banks early on in the investment cycle. Winrock\u2019s REPSO Nepal programme has, for example, been able to leverage more than US$5 million in equity investment in the small hydropower sector since 1998 through technical support and conditional grants provided for carrying out feasibility studies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34678323-59e7-43ea-b489-004125c5e298": {"__data__": {"id_": "34678323-59e7-43ea-b489-004125c5e298", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2273e9f909c171220c39cf76a74d14a3b9fadbb76ad64e290603c7b0ff7a8371"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd88cbc1-aea1-466e-ab9d-af0110c2c8d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e51507c73df46cb48c8acc4e85c06547c204372ea8693038df935b4e75492d5"}}, "hash": "31a9c853bc13f430764f1e3437303476d0d70cf6d61f67cafe07975d9b1c2377", "text": "The programme has also supported the recent establishment of a dedicated Clean Energy Finance Institution in Nepal in the private sector with equity finance of US$4 million with the objective of financing small hydropower and other clean energy projects as well as providing wholesale loans to microfinance institutions.

Small, medium-sized and microenterprises play an important role in developing countries by providing technology and services to niche energy markets that are poorly served by a centralized utility and so complement such centralized services. Conventional bank financing is seldom available to renewable energy SMMEs, especially those in the early innovation stages that need seed and risk capital to develop a new product or service offering. In those contexts, new finance intermediaries are needed that can provide appropriate forms of capital and the management support that entrepreneurs need to develop and grow a new business activity. There has been increasing interest in the early stage risk/seed capital subsector, with a number of post-REN 2004 Bonn Conference commitments which, although not significant in absolute terms, are catalytic given the follow-on leverage potential this form of investment has with the mainstream energy investment community. Nevertheless, there exist in many countries, specific funds for technological innovation that can be used to develop or introduce new renewable energy products in the market. New types of mezzanine finance instruments are also now available in various regions. Typically, mezzanine finance comes in the form of quasi-equity, which can combine some form of preferred shares with subordinated debt and the option to be bought out later, either progressively or in one bullet payment (called a put option). Quasi-equity is most useful in illiquid markets, where a lack of exit options makes equity investments less attractive. Mezzanine finance is an appealing option for public sector participation. Public funds can buy down the risks for commercial investors and/ or lenders and, by helping close the debt-equity gap, buy up returns for project developers. The potential to leverage private capital is also significant. End-user finance Financing for end-users plays an important role in the scale-up of renewable energy technologies as well as in improving access for the poor to such technologies which generally require significant outlays. End-user finance at the household or community level can take the form of installment financing provided by the retailer or loans from commercial banks and microcredit organizations, as well as other arrangements such as leasing. Credit operations require specific management expertise which retailers often lack, and can also be a significant drain on costly working capital, which has resulted in banks and microcredit institutions playing the most important role in the provision of this type of credit. However, conservative banking practices have tended to raise costs to consumers and the initially limited demand for renewable energy financing has resulted in the sector not receiving the sort of attention that is given to other consumer durable purchases (UNDESA 2005). Consumer finance is a rapidly growing sector in many developing country markets. Banks are making loans in unprecedented numbers for household appliances, motorcycles, cars and homes across many countries in Asia and the Pacific, largely in urban areas to salaried employees. Mainstream banks have not, however, included RET financing in their standard list of items for consumer finance. While microfinance organizations have proliferated in rural areas, few have begun lending for solar home systems or biogas. The exceptions are microfinance loans available for solar home systems through Grameen Shakti and BRAC in Bangladesh and SEEDS in Sri Lanka. Those organizations receive lines of credit from the World Bank/GEF-funded national renewable energy projects in their 120 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences countries. More than 75 percent of the SHSs in Bangladesh supported through IDCOL are purchased through financing and more than 30 percent of the SEEDS loan portfolio is for SHSs. In most other countries without a long tradition of microfinance, however, RET systems are generally not financed. It is in those new markets that organizations such as the Triodos Bank of the Netherlands have broken ground by providing loans to microfinance institutions to on-lend to their customers for energy systems. Triodos International Fund Management manages three funds that provide finance, both debt and equity, to more than 50 microfinance institutions in approximately 25 developing countries: the Triodos-Doen Foundation, the Hivos-Triodos Fund Foundation, and the Triodos Fair Share Fund. All funds have similar objectives but different risk profiles and funding structures. As a representative on the boards of directors of several specialized microfinance banks in several developing countries, Triodos Bank contributes actively to governance by sharing its expertise in sustainable banking and specifically in microfinance. For renewable energy sectors that are already commercialized on a cash-sales basis, but where growth is constrained by a lack of end-user finance, credit enhancement programmes can help local banks build new consumer loan portfolios, either by reducing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e5a3841-efb0-41d1-bcd0-154d0f4f0220": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e5a3841-efb0-41d1-bcd0-154d0f4f0220", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e2527bbbbda8d2dbf199ad291e1b2de06bff6429d250cd3462f77d188aa5ff3"}}, "hash": "3e2527bbbbda8d2dbf199ad291e1b2de06bff6429d250cd3462f77d188aa5ff3", "text": "risks for the lending institution or by facilitating increased demand for their loans. Extending loan durations, guarantees and collateral support can all be useful support mechanisms, depending on the context. The Development Bank of Uganda provides rural microcredit with support from the Shell Foundation. In 2003, two of the largest commercial banks in India, Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank, together with their regional associate banks, started to provide thousands of loans for rural households to use renewable energy that were offered through 2,000 participating bank branches in two states.60 While microcredit has demonstrated an important role in supporting commercialization particularly of household RETs, only a few examples were found where the poor had been able to improve their access to energy through financing. Where successful, almost always the access for the poor was improved by combining financing with income generation activities. One such example is Wahan Dharak, a rural cooperative society in Maharasthra, India, engaged in rural banking, which provides solar lanterns to microenterprises at a daily fee.61 Microfinance institutions have a key role to play as on-the-ground integrators, linking provision of energy services with SMMEs. They have a natural advantage both in understanding where energy services can add value to microenterprises and in being able to accept payment for energy services from the earned income. This role of microfinance institutions needs to be targeted for scaling up as a key strategy for increasing access for the poor. Carbon finance Renewable energy projects have been given a financial boost from the emerging carbon market and the CDM as new revenues are added to their income streams. The upward trend in carbon prices will ensure greater impacts in future. Projects to reduce emissions of gases with global warming potential (such as hydrofluorocarbons from industrial processes, nitrous oxide from agriculture and methane from landfills) tended to dominate the CDM. However, the CDM is gradually shifting towards renewable energy projects, which had a 39 percent share of all projects and a 41 percent share of total carbon reductions in the CDM pipeline as of April 2008. At that date, the CDM pipeline, in terms of renewable-energy-based CERs, consisted of biomass (6 percent), hydropower (24 percent) and wind (8 percent) energy projects in that order, with smaller amounts coming from biogas (2 percent) and geothermal (1 percent) projects. Solar had a pipeline of fifteen projects but produces negligible CERs. Asian and Pacific developing countries account for 75 percent of the total CDM project pipeline with 881 projects from India alone and around 1,104 projects from China out of a total pipeline of 3188 projects in the developing countries in April 2008 (UNEP Risoe 2008) . The investments required at the early stages of project development (pre-feasibility, feasibility and initial project development) carry substantial risks which can create major barriers to the development of CDM projects for host countries. Many small renewable energy projects also have the challenge of aggregation to generate substantial Emission Reduction Units to make it worthwhile for buyers. Buyers typically purchase a minimum of 30,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. A solar home system typically generates 0.250 tons of carbon dioxide per year. Thus it would need a project with 120,000 solar home systems to make it worthwhile to develop into a CDM project. Other key barriers are the inexperience of entrepreneurs in CDM financing and the fact that many of the rules and conditions are not completely and clearly fixed at this initial stage. 121 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Dedicated institutions and funds for RET promotion and investment Some countries, states or provinces have established renewable energy funds that are used to finance investments directly, provide low-interest loans, or facilitate markets in other ways, for example through research, education, standards and investments in public facilities. The largest such funds are the so-called \u201cpublic benefit funds\u201d in 14 states in the United States. The funds, often applied to energy efficiency as well as renewable energy, are collected from a variety of sources, with the most common being a surcharge on electricity sales. The 14 funds, all initiated between 1997 and 2001, collect and spend more than US$300 million per year on renewable energy. It is expected that they will collect upwards of US$4 billion for renewable energy through 2012. India and Nepal are two examples of countries where specialized institutions dedicated to the promotion of renewables have been able to make a difference. The India Renewable Energy Development Agency provides loans and other project financing, as well as technical support for the promotion of renewables.

The Renewable Resources Development project, co-financed by the World Bank and other donors in 1993-2001, provided valuable experience in directing the Indian renewable energy programme towards the path of commercialization. Apart from encouraging investment in the sector, the initiative was instrumental in the emergence of various institutional models, which demonstrated ways to address the issue of offsetting the high front-end cost of solar PV systems. The different models have enabled financial packages to be designed that are suitable for different types of end-users, based on ability and willingness to pay for energy services. Developing partnership with local organizations such as rural cooperative societies, microfinance institutions, rural development banks, NGOs and so on has been enormously beneficial for solar PV project developers, ensuring quality sales and service, cost-effective maintenance and management, as well as collection of revenues. For consumers this has resulted in innovative mechanisms to reduce the initial cost burden. The Alternative Energy Promotion Center, an autonomous government organization under the Ministry of Environment Science and Technology, was established in 1996 in Nepal for the development and promotion of RETs. AEPC has been implementing sector support activities such as subsidy disbursement, human resources development, monitoring, as well as undertaking studies and providing policy support to the Government. The Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), under the Energy Sector Assistance Programme provides support for AEPC\u2019s organizational development and also technical support to the microhydropower, solar PV and ICS subsectors. Interviews with representatives of the private sector revealed that AEPC has been instrumental in increasing private sector participation in the renewable energy sector. According to the private sector representatives, AEPC provides them with the following advantages: \u2022 A one-stop shop for all stakeholders, including the community, entrepreneurs, suppliers and consultants, reducing uncertainty for companies, a major consideration for the private sector; \u2022 Specialized knowledge of the sector and effective intermediation between the rest of the government bureaucracy and the private sector; \u2022 Concrete guidelines and standards, which reduce gray areas regarding quality of studies and installations and prevent unscrupulous suppliers entering the sector; \u2022 Subsidy administration and tax exemption recommendations; \u2022 Confidence-building measures for the private sector by increasing awareness through its regional service centres and also the media; and \u2022 By carrying out extensive site identification, it has helped to dramatically increase the demand for microhydropower systems. There has been a significant increase in private sector participation in the microhydropower sector after AEPC came into being (table 6-4). This has been most marked in the number of consulting companies doing feasibility studies. The private sector has the capacity to install about 2 MW each year. 122 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences A number of countries have set up dedicated funds for financing renewables, such as MESITA in Malaysia and the ENCON Fund of Thailand. In the latter country, the public sector has been set the task of using government mechanisms to encourage and promote energy conservation with consumers, as well as to foster the development and utilization of renewable energy. The money for the fund is collected from premium rates imposed on petroleum products of 0.04 baht per litre and in 2003-2004 the ENCON Fund had US$300 million with annual revenue of US$23 million. To access funding from ENCON, proposed projects must be able to achieve an IRR of more than 9 percent. Project owners must be one of the following: a government agency, a state enterprise, an educational institution, a non-profit organization or a private entity joining as a project participant. The ENCON Fund was also used to subsidize (a minority of) renewable energy small power producers. In 2002, candidate renewable SPPs were invited to submit bids for the amount of subsidy that they would be willing to accept. Bids were sorted lowest-to-highest and lowest bids were accepted. Because bids were only solicited once prior to the bid evaluation in 2002, all projects after this cutoff date have not been eligible for the subsidy. SPPs received a subsidy averaging 0.17 baht per kWh sold to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) for the first five years of operation. Nine out of 41 (22 percent) SPPs currently operational were awarded subsidies (Amatayakul and Greacen 2002).

In 2004, Cambodia has also established the Rural Electrification Fund (REF), a financing mechanism designed under the World Bank/GEF to promote rural electrification projects with special attention to renewable energy technologies. Difficulties encountered by investors in accessing some of the funds are well illustrated by the Nepal experience (country case-study). Nepal has two funds dedicated to RET development: the Power Development Fund (PDF) supported by the World Bank and set up to finance private sector development of small and medium-sized hydropower projects; and the Biogas Credit Fund (BCF), which is Euro 2.4 million grant fund provided by KfW for providing wholesale funds to microfinance institutions to on-lend to farmers seeking credit for installation of biogas plants. However, both funds are not used optimally. According to the private sector, PDF has complex procurement provisions that are difficult to meet and a higher interest rate than the market rate. In the case of BCF, strict eligibility criteria, which AEPC says are essential to ensure repayment of loans, and complex procedures have been two of the major barriers to this fund being utilized to a greater extent. Public-private partnerships and the role of public and private investments There are several examples of public-private partnerships within the region. One of the most successful examples is the Indian biogas programme, in which government, civil society and the private sector come together to meet the energy needs of the rural poor. Recognizing the inadequacies of rural energy markets, the biogas programme was designed with a target-oriented, technology \u201cpush\u201d approach, the annual target being limited by the aggregate subsidy for the programme. Under the National Project on Biogas Development (NPBD), families opting for a biogas plant are provided an investment subsidy, which varies according to the socioeconomic status of the recipient, geographical location and plant size. Subsidy levels vary between 25 percent and 50 percent of the investment. The diffusion of biogas technology to rural households has followed a technology 123 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences development path where cooperation among government agencies, private firms and NGOs has been a vital factor. Initially the biogas construction was directly handled by government agencies but soon thereafter NGOs working on other rural development projects found themselves strategically placed to undertake the biogas programme. Their mass contacts, field experience, committed and skilled personnel, and their ability to integrate the advantages of biogas technology with the aims of other rural development programmes contributed to lower cost, reliable service and enhanced external benefits. Private firms responded as suppliers of construction materials and appliances. In Sri Lanka, the World Bank and the Sri Lankan Government supported the Energy Services Delivery Project between 1997 and 2002. The objective of the credit component of the project was to provide medium \u2013 and long-term financing to private sector firms, NGOs, microfinance institutions and community cooperatives for grid-connected minihydropower projects (typically <10 MW), off- grid village hydropower schemes, solar home systems and other renewable energy investments, as well as energy efficiency and demand side management investments. As a result of the success of the ESD project, the Government and the World Bank launched RERED. In keeping with the new policies of the Government and the Bank, there is an added emphasis on rural economic and social development. Conclusions on private and public involvement in RET dissemination Public resources are especially effective where they can be used to leverage quality (through quality standards, minimal warranties and the like). Public resources, either government or NGO, are often useful in integrating renewable energy into wider rural development processes such as is done by UNDP\u2019s Rural Energy Development Programme using microhydropower. The social capital generated can extend far beyond the pipes and wires of a community energy project, and serve as the basis for institutionalizing practices such as improved local democratic decision making, gender equality, and development of local managerial and technical capacity. Policies to support grid-connected renewable energy, adopted in an increasing number of developing countries, provide important opportunities for commercial renewable energy development \u2013 with the potential to stimulate increased rural employment and economic growth far more than centralized fossil-fuel plants. Fully subsidized programmes can be very effective at reaching the poor, albeit at high public expense, but they have tended to emphasize equipment installation and neglected the essentials for sustainable operation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04b6baee-85d6-4ee3-be9e-c7643fd3c042": {"__data__": {"id_": "04b6baee-85d6-4ee3-be9e-c7643fd3c042", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b8e52391d3e548e9211c2bbce0fbec9f2e35790cf364a9f55d058a328eb2ebed"}, "2": {"node_id": "f08b3a69-bb48-4fad-b10e-3e690838e0c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c3dbab10f5f80435fa57d9c9750adb1d94cead34148b37da1e0f9a7c31dfdd38"}}, "hash": "e1c5b613fb513d6ff3d801c04064f04383180d11c28dcbeb47c6fa2af7fe27e1", "text": "124 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Endnotes 40 www.selco-india.com 41 Malaprabha Grameen Bank is a rural development bank with one of the highest recovery rates in the country. 42 http://www.geres-cambodia.org/cfsp/index.html 43 http://crtnepal.org/new/ 44 http://www.arti-india.org/ 45 http://www.bspnepal.org.np/ 46 http://www.snvworld.org/en/Pages/default.aspx 47 The", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6659c354-77ac-4c65-b454-3491b4843f2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6659c354-77ac-4c65-b454-3491b4843f2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef4b47d7ef3213b5cf450ee1930edab48660863005967dec3d19742cfdbd345e"}, "3": {"node_id": "5b3249eb-2fc7-4b97-b8b2-6cc71771f90f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ec6f7ac74ad0d136bf76d5ff65c27a187af8a0bf5e9f8f23b19342eaaab155f"}}, "hash": "9297321b96fd9d2d86bf6c2a4bd6cfef59151067f1fc3d8a793c8e8b6d49ec45", "text": "purpose of the subsidy is to increase affordability for consumers. Another important function of the subsidy is to support market expansion for the supplier and establish the supply chain, something the market alone will often not do.

It is this element of consistent quality that gives the programmes their high credibility and allows for their expansion. The subsidy has to be at least large enough to cover the transaction costs of the supplier and the consumer to stay within the system. It should not be so large as to create market distortions.

Renewable Energy & Poverty Reduction Barriers to private investment in renewables Renewable energy services address human development needs on many levels. Those needs include support for energy for basic subsistence and energy access for facilitating economic empowerment and social transformation. Greater access to electricity, modern fuels and clean, efficient technologies such as improved stoves for cooking and high-efficiency electric lights can enable people to benefit from both short \u2013 and long-term advances in their quality of life. Impacts can be considered on at least two levels, including access to minimum basic energy services and ensuring that energy services contribute towards poverty reduction. The last four chapters have discussed the many ways in which commercially available renewable energy technology options can support income-generating activities and social services, both vital to decreasing the number of people in poverty and to moving towards attaining the MDGs. They also show how barriers are being overcome such that basic energy services are now increasingly available to large numbers of the rural poor through the use of renewable energy technologies. But unless their incomes increase, the poor cannot afford many of those technologies directly nor, in many cases, the energy services they could provide. For PV systems, for example, the customers are the rural non-poor with some exceptions. The same is true for purchases of pico-hydropower units such as the PowerPal, which can provide 200-1,000 watts of capacity with a small self-contained unit in a strong stream. The private sector has a clear role in expanding the market for RETs to large numbers of rural people currently without access. However, it is not generally well placed to reduce poverty through the use of energy services. This chapter discusses how the larger developmental community might build on the successes of increased availability of renewable energy technologies to help the poor climb out of poverty.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b3249eb-2fc7-4b97-b8b2-6cc71771f90f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b3249eb-2fc7-4b97-b8b2-6cc71771f90f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef4b47d7ef3213b5cf450ee1930edab48660863005967dec3d19742cfdbd345e"}, "2": {"node_id": "6659c354-77ac-4c65-b454-3491b4843f2a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9297321b96fd9d2d86bf6c2a4bd6cfef59151067f1fc3d8a793c8e8b6d49ec45"}}, "hash": "1ec6f7ac74ad0d136bf76d5ff65c27a187af8a0bf5e9f8f23b19342eaaab155f", "text": "It attempts to lay out the beginning of an international agenda for a global push to integrate the renewable energy community with the larger poverty reduction community.

This is followed by a summary of evidence collected from a literature review and from past project experience.

Evidence from case studies on the poverty reduction impacts of savings from RETs in expenditure on energy Rural households spend a much larger proportion of their incomes on energy than do urban households that are connected to power grids and to fuel services (natural gas pipelines, LPG canisters), and poorer households spend an even greater proportion of their income on energy services (figure 7-1). This is supported by data from the case studies as well as other studies. Income data collected from Bangladesh show that households below the national poverty line spend more than 20 percent of their incomes on energy, while those above the poverty line spend about 10 percent. In all of the study 127 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Figure 7-1 Household income level and annual expenditure on energy 2000 1800 1600 1400 1200 100 800 600 400 200 0 Nepal 7.8% 2.4% 20% 10.1% Bangladesh Below National Poverty Line Above National Poverty Line Average annual expenditure on energy Average annual income Source: Country case studies, volumes II and V, Policy Study on Regional Mapping of Options to Promote Private Investments in Alternative Energy Sources for the Poor countries, household energy expenditures are primarily for kerosene and dry cell batteries, with some use of automotive batteries that are periodically recharged (for a fee) and that provide electricity for lights, radios, audio cassette players and small television sets.

They do not indicate the much higher value of light from efficient electric lights compared with light from candles or kerosene lanterns, nor do they reflect the superior health and safety attributes of electric lights and other electric appliances. 3 The operating cost of replacing bulbs is quite high, as a result of which the ultimate saving is not significant. For the case studies, data on the extent of monetary savings accruing from the use of various RETs were collected and are summarized in Table 7-1. 128 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences The monetary gain from energy savings resulting from the use of RETs varies widely from one case study to another and from one technology to another. In Nepal, up to 50 percent reduction in expenditure on kerosene and dry cells has been observed after microhydropower-based electricity was introduced. If small (AA and AAA) rechargeable batteries become widely available in developing countries, the ongoing cost of purchasing non-rechargeable batteries can be bypassed. Hand- cranked LED flashlights, radios and other low-power appliances permit the user to generate electricity to recharge batteries in those appliances. For example, one minute of simple cranking of an LED flashlight permits 30 minutes of bright light and battery purchase is eliminated. The flashlights retail for under US$10 each and bulk purchases would probably make them available for a few dollars. At the other end of the spectrum are the solar home systems in Indonesia, where monthly installments paid for a system are much higher than the savings accruing from reduced kerosene usage, the commonly used fuel for lighting, leading to an overall increase in expenditures on energy after the adoption of SHSs. However, potential savings in kerosene expenditures do not drive purchases or leasing of solar home systems \u2013 it is the vastly superior quality of lighting, coupled with the elimination of fire hazards and toxic fumes from incomplete kerosene combustion that people want and are willing to pay for. Among various income groups, there are preliminary indications that the extent of savings is higher for the relatively better-off households above the national poverty line. This is primarily because households on higher incomes have substantial expenditures on dry cells", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c6750cb-ea15-4e25-9240-3e5a9ffa3984": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c6750cb-ea15-4e25-9240-3e5a9ffa3984", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Financing Options of Renewable Energy: The Asia-Pacific Experience", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/financing-options-renewable-energy-asia-pacific-experience", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63c08fa8141313f698193f51348217f6602dbae548be81fb053bac44c0a2180e"}}, "hash": "63c08fa8141313f698193f51348217f6602dbae548be81fb053bac44c0a2180e", "text": "in the absence of electricity, which the poorest do not, resulting in relatively large savings. Even though the data collected as part of the case studies are not amenable to statistical analysis because of small sample sizes, there are some indications that renewables help reduce household energy expenditures. Additional income generation through productive uses of RETs within households In the case study locations, the direct impact of renewable-energy-based household lighting on income generation has not been significant. Very few households started businesses as a direct result of improved lighting. However, the indirect benefits of superior lighting \u2013 better information and education, improved health due to absence of kerosene combustion fumes, access to radio and some television \u2013 all contribute to the ability of people to be economically productive (Cabraal et al. 2005). There are specific cases where enterprises have experienced savings as a result of switching to an RET-based energy source from diesel fuel. In Lwangghal, Nepal, there are three agroprocessing mills that run on diesel. The annual average turnover of each mill is about NRs 30,000. With electricity from the microhydropower plant, the mills are able to operate at a lower cost than with the diesel they used before. Earlier, a mill used about 35 litres of diesel per month at a cost of about NRs 1,700; after the introduction of microhydropower, this expense has fallen to a few hundred rupees per month (approximately NRs 400). There are very few households that use electricity directly in home-based microenterprises and those that do are, not surprisingly, not the poorest households according to case study data (table 7-2). For example, in the Nepal case study, the most common productive use in households using electricity from microhydropower was for sewing and extension of business hours of shops, but 80 percent (16 out of 20 households which were involved in some kind of productive application of energy) were above the poverty line. The ability of poor households to use RETs for productive uses is limited by a lack of capacity to acquire the necessary appliances, as well as other inputs such as investment capital and access to markets. Some NGOs are helping to bridge this gap by providing capital and tools to local artisans and craftspeople and marketing their products worldwide through the Internet. Other empirical evidence on the impact of renewables on poverty reduction (a) Impact of RETs on time and effort saved Around 80 percent of the expenditure on energy services by poor people is on fuel for cooking. Studies show that the majority of the developing world\u2019s poor spend 20 percent or more of their monthly income to obtain wood and charcoal. There is ample evidence that the introduction of technologies such as biogas and improved cook stoves brings about significant reductions in workload in the collection and processing of fuelwood, as well as in cooking, and saves time. The extent of time saved in fuelwood collection is in the 40-50 percent range, and can amount to as much as 4 to 8 hours per day. The health benefits of using stoves with greatly reduced particulate emissions are also substantial, as discussed earlier. Time saved in cooking seems to be the highest reported benefit from improved stoves. Cooking time is saved because of factors such as the ability to use two pots at the same time and to raise the cooking temperature quickly, as well as greater heat efficiency among other factors. The use of biogas plants has also been associated with time saved in cleaning.62 129 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Table 7-2 Evidence from case studies on RETs and productive uses of energy Case study Technology Scale of interven- tion Number of households with productive applications of RETs Sample size Households below pov- erty line Households above pov- erty line Remarks Nepal Microhydropower Two schemes of 12 kW and 15 kW power output, covering 278 households in Raipur/ Firfire; 218 households covered by a 44 kW plant 102 4 16 Sewing and weaving at night, shops open after dark.

Time is also saved by not having to fill kerosene lanterns up and move lights from room to room. Electricity also saves women\u2019s time in domestic food processing, which is traditionally done manually. However, women\u2019s work has increased in the evenings and nights with the availability of electric lights but information on microenterprises and small-scale industries operated by women and the role that energy plays in them is almost non- existent. (b) Impacts of RETs on household expenditures through fuel savings Reduced expenditures of 20-50 percent through fuelwood savings resulting from the use of improved cook stoves and biogas plants have been reported in many studies.63 In Kenya and Rwanda, monthly monetary savings brought about from reduced fuelwood consumption after the introduction of improved cook stoves was in the US$8.41 to US$15.3 range (Barnes et al. 1994). In the hills of Nepal, the decrease in daily fuelwood use in households with biogas was six kilograms and more, both in summer and winter. Other work has shown savings of 2-4 metric tons of firewood per household per year as a result of the biogas option. Electricity services reduce and can virtually eliminate expenditures for kerosene lighting, dry cell batteries for sound equipment, and car batteries for televisions. Solar home systems may be used for running lights, televisions and radios for a few hours every day, usually replacing kerosene, candles and dry cells, as well as lead-acid batteries externally charged from locally-owned small gensets. In Bangladesh, monthly expenses on kerosene in electrified households were only Tk 28.3 while they were around Tk 65 (about US$1.50 at the time) in non-electrified households (Barkat et al. 2002). A study of rural electrification in the Philippines made an attempt to quantify the monetary benefits of electrification, summarized in table 7-3 below. It estimated the total benefit of providing domestic electricity to a typical, non-electrified Filipino household at US$81\u2013US$150 per month, mainly from time saved collecting fuel and improved productivity of home businesses. Other anecdotal evidence supports the view that renewable energy increases the quality and quantity of energy services rather than decreasing costs \u2013 some households continue to use kerosene for lighting so that the electricity from SHSs can be conserved for watching television. In Inner Mongolia, a socioeconomic assessment of small household-scale wind turbines found that energy services motivated households to buy appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, rice cookers, irons and electric heaters to improve living conditions and save time, particularly for women (Modi 2005). The study found that television and radio provide language instruction and information on commodity prices and the weather, as well as new farming methods and practices. Electricity also increased income-generating activities, adding up to US$30\u2013US$150 per month to incomes.

Energy services for new economic activities \u2013 Electricity favours the development of home-based economic activities, including handicrafts and textiles, embroidery and garments, food processing and woodworking in Indonesia, clove-nut processing, wrapping local cigarettes (beedies), making joysticks (\u201cmagic\u201d candles made locally for children\u2019s birthdays) and weaving in Sri Lanka (Matly 2003). In Nepal, solar PV lighting enabled women to undertake handicraft work at night, weaving baskets, mattresses and so on (Mahat 2004b). Productive work such as weaving and sewing has also been carried out at night with the help of electric light (Barkat et al. 2002; Bryce and Soo 2004; Chakrabarti and Chakrabarti 2002; Khan 2001). In a preliminary community assessment conducted in Cambodia in October 2001, it was learned that in some villages, battery-powered lanterns are used not only for everyday lighting in the home but also outdoors for frog hunting \u2013 a significant source of income (Cecelski 2002). Solar lanterns are used by fishermen in Sumatra, Indonesia, to attract and catch fish at night. Slurry from biogas plants is known to produce high quality organic manure, which has been used for a variety of purposes ranging from vegetable gardening to crops, and fish ponds. In Kavre district in Nepal, after the installation of a microhydropower plant men recognized the possibility of income- generating activities through establishing saw mills and poultry farms, using hydropower. As the Nepal case study indicates, the private-sector-led rural electrification from the 5 MW Andhi Khola small hydropower project facilitated the creation of a large number of enterprises. However, what was instrumental in the emergence of those enterprises was the Enterprise Support Program funded by USAID, which provided technical support and training to a number of them. This illustrates the importance of co-investments (with energy) in technical assistance, training and capital equipment. Most of the enterprises are agroprocessing units, but there are also significant number of other kinds of enterprises in activities such as poultry production, saw mills, noodle production and so on. b. Quality improvements in output \u2013 An impact that is observed through the use of some renewable energy technologies is improvement in output quality. In India, over 150 cardamom growers in the north-eastern State of Sikkim have increased the value of their produce by using biomass gasifiers for drying.

In Bangladesh, grid electricity has increased the employment opportunities for women in electrified households, which translates into greater control over their incomes (Barkat et al. 2002). The same study showed that the women in electrified households as compared with those in non-electrified households are involved more in home-based activities for income generation and demonstrate better reallocation of time for remunerative employment. d. Extension of working hours \u2013 As frequently reported, RET-based lighting can help extend working and business hours. The most widely experienced benefit of lighting in terms of income generation is the extension of working hours and the ability to keep shops and businesses open until late at night (IDS 2001; Khan 2001; Madon and Gardiner 2002; and Wilkinson 2002). In Sagardweep Island in India, where a PV power plant supplies electricity to households for lighting, cultivators of betel leaf have benefited from the power supply as a significant part of their work, such as arranging leaves, watering the fields and so on, can be done at night. The supply of power has also helped commercial establishment to continue their activities at night for a longer period and to provide more services to the people. In another case in India, Winrock International teamed with Don Bosco, an in-country NGO, with support from USAID to create a revolving fund to finance PV systems on a commercial credit basis. Women in the village of Pavur had a market for large baskets that they weave but kerosene lighting was not adequate to permit weaving. SELCO and Don Bosco installed PV systems on a commercial basis. Don Bosco markets the baskets and deducts monthly installments from basket sales proceeds. It is also working with residents to develop a self-managed cooperative to handle distribution of the baskets in more distant markets. Average household income increased from US$19.50 per month to US$32.15 per month with some portion of that increase being used to pay school fees for an increase in enrollment (GEF-FAO 2002). The supply of solar power has also helped, though on a small scale, to run a video hall as well as a battery charging centre, among other activities (Chakrabatri and Chakrabarti 2002). e. Facilitating information inputs into businesses \u2013 Facilitation of information and communication technologies through renewable energy systems can allow farm and non-farm sectors to receive accurate and current market prices. In India, the e-Choupal initiative66 has succeeded in providing farmers with access to Internet-enabled computers, which helps them obtain current information on market prices and good farming practices and allows them to order agricultural inputs. This initiative has resulted in improvements to the quality of their produce and also ensures that they receive better prices for their produce. While there are many instances of RETs being used for productive purposes, there is still inadequate information on which segments of the communities are really benefiting from them. 133 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Box 7-2 Benefits of a microhydropower scheme In village Harichour, Baglung district, Nepal, an enterprising microhydropower entrepreneur has been operating a 25kW plant for over 15 years. The mill serves around 380 households during the daytime and electricity is provided to 215 households in the evenings for about five hours. The accessibility of the electrically-driven mill has made a big difference to women\u2019s lives. Previously, women had to walk about an hour to grind grain in the traditional water mill; that time has been now reduced to a five minutes. In Hira Gauchan, a user pointed out that they have more time now than they had before, as at least 4-8 kg of grain has to be ground every morning, and the time saved has allowed them to work in other productive activities. Time is equated to money and often women preferred to work and earn rather than to rest. Women also felt that the television has become an important medium for gaining access to information about political, social, cultural and economic issues. This has helped them widen their understanding, particularly because they do not travel out of the village (Rai 2000). Employment through RET industries Some decentralized RET systems provide substantial employment in their manufacture and installation. Biogas systems and improved cook stoves that use mostly local materials and local artisans and masons have the largest employment component. Employment is also generated for manufacturers of components. BSP Nepal has generated jobs for around 11,000 people.

The outputs are gradually being translated into positive changes in the capacity of all concerned stakeholders and ultimately, in the enhancement of rural livelihoods. The changes encom- pass: (i) increased income from off-farm and non-farm activities; (ii) improved health owing to a reduction in drudgery, labour and smoke inhalation, as well as improved sanitation; (iii) bet- ter education of children owing to the availability of brighter lights at night to do their homework (extension of study hours); (iv) increased awareness among the rural people about global activities via telecommunications and computers (thereby helping to reduce the digital divide); and (v) an increased capital base from savings and credit operations and the establishment of infrastructure such as microhydropower, schools, potable drinking water and microenter- prises. An ongoing study on the MDG impacts of REDP by Winrock Nepal, which covered a sample of 1,503 households in 10 different districts, shows that there has been a significant growth in household income. While average annual household income in 1996 was NRs 48,000, aver- age income in 2005 was NRs 73,000. The poverty level in the project locations decreased from 59 percent in 1996 to 54 percent in 2005. Specifically, the poorest of the poor (house- holds with annual incomes below NRs 10,000) had dropped from 15 percent to 12 percent of all households. The share of households with annual income over NRs 100,000 had increased considerably from 9 percent to 24 percent. 134 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences of-system components for the Indian and regional markets. China also has rapidly expanding solar PV manufacturing activities. Studies show that the value added to solar home systems can be quite high even in countries that do not make solar panels from manufacturing controllers and installing systems. Renewable energy is being used for productive activities in an initiative of the Himalayan Light Foundation, a non-profit, NGO working in Nepal. Under its Home Employment Lighting Program (HELP), dissemination and use of solar electricity technology is combined with income generation. HELP assists villagers set up and run income-generating activities such as weaving and thangka painting to maximize the benefits of extended evening hours made possible by renewable energy lighting systems. Villagers participating in HELP are offered a skill-training programme, the tools to set up an income-generating activity such as knitting, weaving, handmade paper products or thangka painting and a solar electricity system, which extends the working day. Marketable products are made in the home in spare time after agricultural pursuits. HLF acts as a link65 between those producers and international buyers, enabling the workers to find a market for their products. The villagers can repay the cost of the solar lighting system with handicraft items made in their home. Under one arrangement, each household that receives a solar home system has to make a payment of one bag of handicrafts each month for the system, after which additional bags fetch income for the household. HLF also works with village entrepreneurs to establish village charging stations for small batteries.

One frequently cited benefit of biofuel manufacture closely linked to rural development is job creation. In 2004, 700,000 direct jobs and about 3.5 million indirect jobs were created through the production of 350 million tonnes of sugar cane. However, there is an important caveat when pointing to biofuels as a potential large-scale employer. The most advanced and largest of the sugar producing countries such as Australia and Brazil are moving to much more labour-efficient practices, both in the production of sugar cane and in its processing. Labour-intensive sugar industries will not compete internationally, either in the production of sugar or co-products such as ethanol. The experience of Thailand shows that with the advent of rice-husk-based IPPs, the price of rice husk has tripled in rural Thailand. The considerable amount of employment generated is an important benefit. There are however several issues with respect to the employment generation impacts of biofuel projects. The most basic danger relates to the replacement of food grains and subsistence crops by biofuel crops, which can jeopardize livelihoods of the poorest farming communities. In Thailand, the benefits of higher prices for rice husk have gone only to the rice mills and not to the paddy farmers because the rice mills, which are very large, control most of the husk. Mills owned by farmer cooperatives are small and have not so far ventured into the IPP sector with the rice husk they produce. Another issue that is being raised in Brazil is that of sustainability of the employment created. In the harvesting of sugar can many jobs are created but they are very low wage and are vulnerable to displacement by mechanization. Thus, in the long-term, permanent jobs with stable incomes may not be created in large numbers. In fact, cane harvesting in Brazil has become increasingly mechanized despite a large pool of unemployed and underemployed workers. Furthermore, there have been reports that pastures and food crops have been displaced by sugar can and that subsistence farmers have been evicted in the process. Outcomes such as these should to be monitored carefully before similar programmes are implemented in other countries. 135 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Biofuel development to benefit the poor? Biofuels are very promising if delivered in the right manner; but with the ever-increasing demand for transport fuels, there are genuine concerns that biofuels may create greater competition for limited land and biodiversity, water and food. From the point of view of benefits for the poor, biofuels present a number of challenges and opportunities which have to be examined carefully. The rapid growth in the demand for and production of liquid biofuels and its impact on food security, rural development, land use and the environment, in particular, can be negative if not designed and implemented with care. The development and expansion of existing liquid biofuels policies and programmes, particularly to make the sector more effective in eradicating poverty, should be evaluated and assessed taking into consideration the following aspects: \u2022 Attention to biofuels should not be limited to sugar and starch crops for the production of ethanol and vegetable-oil plants for the production of biodiesel. A comprehensive sustainable bioenergy programme should cover all sources including sustainable production of trees and other woody biomass from forests and non-forest areas for solid biofuel production; agricultural residues for heat and power generation through direct combustion, cogeneration, biogas generation and gasification; and cellulosic sources available for second-generation biofuel technologies from the agriculture and forestry sectors. \u2022 All end uses of those bioenergy sources, such as heat and electricity, should be considered including non-transport uses of liquid biofuels. Policies and programmes for liquid biofuels are currently too focused on private urban transport use. \u2022 The linkages between bioenergy development and food prices, food security, rural economics, trade, employment, biodiversity and climate change should be clearly established. Such linkages need to be assessed at the local, national and global levels. \u2022 The active entry of small-scale farmers into bioenergy conversion stages and their upward movement in the market supply chain should be promoted. \u2022 The engagement of SMEs in seeking production models of varying scales should also be promoted so as to allow them to be more competitive, for example, by using cooperatives. The exercise in expanding and strengthening biofuels programmes in order that the poor should get a greater share of the benefits should start with an evaluation and assessment of current experiences and policies.

In most developing countries there is a need to strengthen decision-making capacities so as to tap into the opportunities presented by biofuels while avoiding potentially important negative impacts on rural livelihoods, equitable economic development and the environment. Energy as a vehicle for empowerment and contributor to social transform+ation Renewable energy technologies contribute to improvements in social capital and quality of life, which can be an instrument for poverty reduction in the long run. Electricity through renewables brings about improvements in social capital in a number of ways, including through better health from reduced exposure to indoor air pollution, improved literacy and children\u2019s education, access to television, more leisure time, convenience through use of appliances, reduction in fires and accidents, as well as confidence building and participation in community activities. Access to television and media seems to be the most appreciated benefit (Barkat et al. 2002; Everts and Schulte 1997; Mukhopadhyay 2004). Electricity also frees people from social isolation by making it possible to socialize in the evenings and adding to safety for women through streetlighting. It also permits women to be involved in community activities (ESMAP 2004; Wilkinson 2002). In Nepal, an assessment of the impact of the Gandruk hydropower plant suggested that the advent of television had a significant cultural impact in that women said that they could see that they did not have to remain second-class citizens (Barnett 2000). Villages with electricity tend to be more attractive and prosperous and electricity is known to bring about lifestyle changes in people\u2019s lives (Ramani and Heijndermans 2003). It enables households to use labour-saving devices such as electric kettles, electric drills, freezers and so on (Bryce and Soo 2004; Madon and Gardiner 2002). Using electricity is safer than using kerosene wick-lamps, candles and lanterns (Ratnayake 2000; Madon and Gardiner 2002). However, electricity presents its own dangers, and users must be informed about safe usage of electricity and electrical appliances. While the potential of RETs to reduce poverty is high, this has not yet been realized widely. Table 7-4 presents a summary of the impacts on the poor. 136 Financing Options For Renewable Energy: Country Experiences Source: REN21 2008, \u201cRenewables 2007 Global Status Report\u201d March 08. Impacts on other MDGs MDG 2 \u2013 Education A number of linkages have been drawn between the use of RETs and improved learning and educational facilities. In rural areas where conventional fuels and electricity are not affordable or available, RETs can make important contributions to education by providing electricity to schools and by creating a more child-friendly environment that improves attendance. A survey in Nicaragua illustrates the relationship between education and household electricity use (Saghir 2005b). It was found that the percentage of a family\u2019s children that attend school is highly correlated with the availability of electricity. Among rural households in Nicaragua, 72 percent of children living in a household with electricity attend school, compared to 50 percent of those living in a household without electricity. Lighting also helps schools retain teachers, especially if their accommodation has electricity. There is similar experience for rural health posts. A World Bank-GEF Teacher\u2019s Solar Lighting Project in Papua New Guinea provides a modest financing package, making the purchase of solar lighting kits affordable for teachers. The project is intended to improve delivery of education in rural Papua New Guinea through longer retention of teachers posted to remote areas. Access to educational media (overhead projectors, computers, printers, science equipment) and communications increases educational opportunities and opens up the possibility for distance learning via radio and through satellite television. Having a reliable electricity supply in schools directly influences the quality of education at all levels. In addition, the ability to keep schools open at night can greatly encourage adult education programmes. In Cambodia, an NGO (privately funded from the United States and Japan) has put PV in over 200 schools to power lights and computers.
