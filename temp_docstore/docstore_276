nationalities in Nepal began with the democracy movement of the 1950s. However, the early initiatives to form their organizations ended with the royal takeover and the ban on political parties by the king in 1961. IPs began to organize openly after 1990. They collectively referred to themselves as Janajatis and not Matwalis (alcohol consumers), the term used by the first Country Code. In 1990-1991, several indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations came together to form the Nepal Federation of Nationalities55 as a common front.56 By the early 1990s, NEFIN had begun to claim that they were \u201cadivasi\u201d or indigenous to Nepal. In 2008, NEFIN had 54 IPOs as members and 64 District Coordination Committees (DCCs).57 NEFIN had Village Coordination Committees (VCCs) in 2000 Village Development Committees (VDC).58 The objectives of NEFIN (amended in 2003) were to strengthen the indigenous peoples\u2019 movement by forming a forum to collectively voice issues related to their rights, language, culture and development. More recently it has been advocating for the implementation of ILO Convention 169 and other UN conventions on human rights and the development of IPs. 59 The government formed a new task force to review the classification of IPs in 2009. This action was in response to demands of various indigenous groups that had not been included in the official list and were seeking recognition of their identity by the government, mostly making their demands heard through public demonstrations. Leaders of IPs tend to believe that the media have often misrepresented or ignored the coverage of their issues.60 53 NPC, 2007.

They also argue that the mainstream media has been working to build public opinion in favour of a political system and power structure that will perpetuate domination by traditional caste elites.61 They also have said that journalists in Nepal are largely unaware of ILO Convention 169 and UNDRIP. Key Challenges and Opportunities for the Indigenous Peoples Inclusive participation, voice and development Challenges y Identity politics: One challenge is to establish social cohesion in a country where very different social groups have conflicting demands. At present, there is not an effective mechanism to facilitate communication and dialogue on the grievances and claims that could help to bridge the differences. y The rights of IPs: Another challenge is obtaining recognition and implementing the rights of the IPs in line with ILO Convention 169 and UNDRIP. There is a need to include the provisions of these two instruments into the new constitution to ensure greater compliance. y Restructuring the state for effective participation and development of the IPs: In the current process, there is a commitment to setting up federal units but their viability will depend on delineated territories and governance systems. Ethnic-demarcated provinces with the right to self-determination are key demands of the IPs. This has the potential to create tensions and conflict with similar demands of other social groups who want geographically defined provinces and provinces based on economic viability. y The indigenous peoples\u2019 movement: The gains made by IPs after 2006 must be institutionalized to guarantee their proportionate representation in all state institutions. Only this reform can increase their voice and participation in democratic political decision-making, governance and development. y Low representation: IPs have been under-represented in the civil service, with the exception of the Newar. This has negative implications in formulation and implementation of policies for their advancement. y Language: There is recognition and commitment to equal treatment of all languages. However, the language policy has not yet been finalized. The development and standardization of all languages are crucial for effective implementation of this policy. y Access to development opportunities: Existing programmes to support excluded groups have been victims of patronage politics. There is the need to establish transparent and accountable democratic governance systems for effective implementation. y Misrepresentation and ignorance of indigenous peoples\u2019 issues: There is very little intergroup dialogue on issues affecting IPs, especially in the mass media. IPs are underrepresented in the media profession and often misinterpreted or ignored in media coverage. Opportunities y New constitution: There are opportunities for incorporating the rights of the IPs into the new constitution. This can provide a basis for policy and legislation to ensure inclusive participation of IPs in democratic governance. y Collective voices of IPs: The formation of a caucus of representatives in the CA provides an opportunity for amplifying the demands and negotiations of IPs for policies and legal instruments promising more inclusive participation. Strengthening the all-party caucus could effectively enhance the ability of IPs to negotiate with other social groups. 61 Such feelings were widely expressed by CA members and IPO activists during FGDs organized in Kathmandu. 35 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal y Open political environment: The open democratic environment in Nepal provides opportunities for undertaking programmes aimed at raising awareness and building public opinion for supporting the demands of the IPs and other excluded groups. There are also opportunities for communicating indigenous rights with all stakeholders. y Development opportunities: Recent national development plans and policies have increasingly recognized the need for specific provisions for the advancement of the IPs and excluded groups. This provides opportunities for implementing both targeted programmes for the IPs and mainstreaming inclusion in broader development intentions. 2.2 Media and ICT Landscape in Nepal Overview of the Media Landscape Political and legal environment for the media In 1990, when Nepal established multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy (ending almost three decades of direct royal rule),62 the political change triggered new developments in the media environment. The new leadership formulated a new communication policy and enacted new laws on the print and broadcast media.

The statute barred censorship though it allowed the government to place \u201creasonable restrictions\u201d for safeguarding national sovereignty, integrity, \u201charmonious relations\u201d, sedition, defamation and so on. A new broadcasting law provided a framework for licensing independent broadcasters of television and frequency modulation (FM) radios. The legislative environment remained largely unchanged at the time of this study in 2009, although the same can not be said for other aspects of the media. Positive changes in the political and media environment allowed IPs to articulate their demands, which was vital for re-invigorating the IP movement (see the national overview section above). These changes also facilitated new private investment in the media, which began with the launch of two independent broadsheets in 1993. In 1991 and 1992 Nepal\u2019s press was \u2018free\u2019.63 A number of factors including the delays in formulating the broadcasting regulations delayed the licensing of independent radio until May 1997. Nepal\u2019s media environment changed drastically in 2005 following an attempt by the king to install direct rule. The king suspended about half a dozen constitutional articles and reintroduced censorship.64 Following three weeks of protests, in early 2006 the king agreed to restore parliament and formed a government of the political parties. The operating environment for media became dangerous after the peace process began in 2006. At least five journalists have been killed or have gone missing since April 2006 and, in most cases, those attacking the media and journalists have been close to or affiliated with political parties and/or newly formed armed groups with various political demands. Key challenges and opportunities for indigenous peoples Nepal\u2019s media has been and is still overwhelmingly controlled by members of the dominant social groups, not necessarily in terms of ownership but in terms of control of content production.65 This 62 Following experimentations with various governments following the overthrow of the Rana Oligarchy in 1951, in 1960 the king dismissed an elected government and began ruling directly. The system of direct rule \u2013 called the Panchayat \u2013 that was established later continued until April 1990. See: Bhattarai, B (2005). Censored: Nepal\u2019s Press under King Gyanendra\u2019s Regime. Studies in Nepali History and Society. Vol. 10 No 2 for a detailed discussion of the media before 1990. 63 These are the only two years that Nepal\u2019s press was so classified by Freedom House (www.freedomhouse.org). Thereafter, press freedoms were constricted owing to political instability and the Maoist insurgency (1996-2006). 64 See Bhattarai (2005). 65 There are little or no studies on ownership available. Studies that exist show that media jobs are largely held by members of the Brahmin/Chhetri groups and Newars among the IPs. 36 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal has resulted from their greater access to opportunities in education, training and jobs. Similarly, the principal language of the mass media has been Nepali, the mother tongue of the dominant groups, and also the only official language before 2007. With better language abilities, individuals from these groups have distinct advantages for securing media jobs. It is also true that the Newar enjoy fairly high representation in the media compared to other IPs. This is because the Newar live in urban areas such as Kathmandu, where they have better access to education and training facilities. Various individuals from indigenous groups own and run media, including some large Kathmandu- based radio and television stations. However, only a few of these companies have been successful commercially. According to key informants in this study, media owned by members of indigenous groups have been more open to covering their events, demands and concerns. However, even in such media, the gatekeepers of news and information usually come from the dominant groups \u2013 and many of these gatekeepers may have low understanding of the issues affecting IPs. Media owned by members from indigenous groups also tend to be accused of taking sides, which may damage their professional image and credibility. Therefore, there is a need to devise mechanisms for enhancing the capacity of journalists to understand issues affecting IPs, and there is a need to design professional content that purposefully communicates the concerns of IPs. Some IPOs produce publications in their mother tongues. However, the publications are largely read within the language groups. While helping raise awareness of readers about their rights, these publications are not very effective for communicating with the other social groups, which is needed for building broader public opinion. Nepal has little or no regulation of media, especially broadcasting. Reforming the regulatory environment could provide opportunities for making the media more diverse not only in terms of who owns and controls media outlets but", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "137d7307-b4aa-4dc3-a60a-e2bdb99180f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "137d7307-b4aa-4dc3-a60a-e2bdb99180f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9a88d3dbdce20ec8a0a59cbf73664ac75cda8836109c1189c026d1fee2c5bb7"}, "3": {"node_id": "6af57985-ca4c-4e58-b14d-f7cc5a427cf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f3b5c920d39b2e2336b4307f3133b9e037910dbf8dbe3d6e3d23da2d5d7cf67"}}, "hash": "7e5bad46099d5aedf9d3a7a81c07cbee61b1faf9a4312022fc1e80e6399b663c", "text": "also in terms of content and staffing. Making the existing newsrooms more diverse could be the first step towards giving greater voice to the IPs. Nepal has a very vibrant and energetic media with great diversity in terms of scale and form. Some kinds of media are professional, within the space allowed by commercialization; others openly advocate partisan positions; and others are seemingly independent. Most of Nepal\u2019s media are concentrated in the capital Kathmandu and other urban centres. Radio, especially FM, reaches large parts of the country but newspapers still remain restricted to accessible areas. The language used by the media \u2013 mainly Nepali \u2013 is another barrier to reaching IPs effectively. Print media The government\u2019s data on newspapers and publications are not always consistent with data from the Press Council Nepal (PCN). This is partly because not all newspapers register at PCN. Furthermore, Nepali law bars the cancellation of newspaper registrations, which means that newspapers and/or publications remain in public records forever. According to the Press Council Nepal, as of mid-July 2008 Nepal had 2,601 registered newspapers. Among them 386 were dailies, 23 bi-weeklies, 1,871 weeklies and 321 fortnightlies. However, only 754 of these newspapers were actually published, and of them, only 553 were regular. Effectively, therefore, Nepal has about 99 dailies, four bi-weeklies, 429 weeklies and 21 regular fortnightlies. Based on the number of regular newspapers, there is one publication for every 49,000 Nepalis. However, not all newspapers are fully accessible even to people who receive the copies, owing to language. Timeliness of delivery and affordability are other factors that affect access. According to the government\u2019s Department of Information, as of March 2009 Nepal had 5,258 registered newspapers and periodicals. Among them were 398 dailies, 1,957 weeklies, 376 fortnightlies, and 1,562 monthlies along with others publishing at other frequencies, including annual publications.66 Size and circulation varies widely but reliable data is unavailable. Generally, Nepal\u2019s eastern-most regions and the regions adjacent to the Bagmati zone have more publications (see Table 5) compared to other regions, with the exception of the Sagarmatha zone. The weeklies, which are infrequent and more partisan compared to broadsheet dailies, outnumber 66 Government of Nepal. Ministry of Information and Communication.

Some broadsheets also have regional publications and include some local content. Broadcasting Nepal\u2019s broadcasting sector was comprised of 323 licensed FM radio stations and 12 television channels as of July 2009. Ten of the 12 licensed television channels were broadcasting. Among the 323 FM stations, 195 claimed to be community radios, of which over 160 were broadcasting. These included stations owned and operated by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), cooperatives and local government bodies.67 The government licensed the first private television stations in early 1990 but they began broadcasting only after 2000. Nepal\u2019s broadcasting sector, especially FM radio, has the widest reach. Nepal also has three major private content production organizations that produce materials for broadcast on FM radio, often with the support of donors. Programmes produced by these companies and non-governmental organizations are broadcast on a variety of stations. The production companies produce and distribute news as well as communication content to support development and advocacy efforts.

Human rights organizations 6. Non-governmental organizations70 (Those not on the list, e.g. government, parliament, police, army, etc., were lower in the order.) A number of factors determine media access. Nepal\u2019s traditionally excluded communities \u2013 women, Dalits, IPs and religious minorities \u2013 do not have equal access to media. People from the dominant social groups still control most media content. The exclusion of the poor and marginalized and vulnerable groups in Nepali society (see the national overview section) extends to the newsrooms. According to journalists from indigenous peoples groups working in various media, their presence in the newsrooms is very low and they lack effective participation in decision-making on news content. Physical access Access to media is comparatively better in the eastern and central regions of Nepal compared to the rest of the country. As of 2008, of the total registered publications 1,260 (40.4 percent) were based in the Bagmati zone (mainly in Kathmandu, the capital). These included 159 dailies, seven bi-weeklies, 904 weeklies and 190 fortnightlies. Table 5 summarizes media presence in different parts of the country for newspapers (based on registration) and radio. Though media presence is highest in Bagmati, access is not uniform across the eight districts in the zone. Eight of Nepal\u2019s 75 districts do not have locally registered newspapers. The districts without newspapers include Dailekh, Humla, Jajarkot, Manang, Mugu, Mustang, Rasuwa and Solukhumbhu, according to PCN records in 2007-2008. Rasuwa, one of three districts where the field study was done, also did not have a FM radio as of mid-2009. Language Language is an important determinant of access to information. An overwhelming majority of Nepal\u2019s newspapers were published in Nepali (85.39 percent) in 2008, as seen in Table 4. English language periodicals accounted for 3.6 percent and the remaining were published in both Nepali and English or in other languages. According to the PCN there were 18 Newar language newspapers, 10 Hindi, five Maithili and two in Tharu languages. Most of the IP language newspapers were irregular; PCN data suggests that only seven Newar language newspapers were regular.

Nepal Television broadcasts most of its programmes in Nepali. It has some indigenous language programmes but no newscasts. Films in national languages are often not on the programme list because advertisers prefer Hindi films. However, the policy on Hindi films has also changed with the political position of the party in control of the Ministry of Information and Communication (MOIC). Hindi film broadcasts were briefly stopped in 2008, when the Maoists held the MOIC portfolio. Gorkhapatra is a Nepali language daily that is run by the state. Since 2006, it has been inserting Naya Nepal (New Nepal), a two-page supplement in different languages other than Nepali.73 Over a month, it provides space for 26 languages spoken by IPs in one supplement a day.74 The supplement carries news and opinions on contemporary issues, culture and interviews in various national languages.75 But the reach of this publication is limited. It did not reach the villages where the field research for this assessment was done. 72 Doteli is a dialect of Nepali language spoken in far western hills of Nepal. 73 The depth of coverage, frequency and reach is a subject for a follow-up study. 74 Mohan Mainali. 2008 (unpublished). He had conducted an interview with Naresh Khapangi who coordinated the publication of the supplement in November 2008. 75 Supplement in 25 languages can be accessed at http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np 40 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal Government newspapers generally reach the district headquarters and have been losing readers to private competitors. At a speech during the National Stakeholders Meeting on the C4E study, Shanker Pokhrel, Minister, MoIC, said the supplements had not raised circulation of the newspaper. The supplement therefore has a symbolic value in terms of acceptance of diversity in language but is not effective as an information and communication tool, especially in rural areas. Foreign media Nepal receives many foreign television signals, including a large number of Indian channels. Even though studies on audience preferences are unavailable, it can be assumed that Nepali TV channels are preferred for news and current affairs and the foreign stations (Indian, mainly) are popular for entertainment. Reach of satellite television is not uniform across the country. The Indian television channels are more readily available in villages along Nepal\u2019s southern borders with India. For example, the Indian channels were popular at the field C4E study site in Kailali district in mid-west Nepal. Major media organizations The Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ): The FNJ, claims a membership of over 7,000 journalists. Nepal also has several other journalist unions, which are organized along partisan lines, but the FNJ represents all journalists. The FNJ has a 27-member executive committee. One journalist from the indigenous peoples\u2019 community was elected to the executive committee in 2008. In addition, FNJ also reserved one seat each for representatives of the IPs, women, Madhesis and Dalits in its executive committee. Nepal also has several organizations offering media development and training, and university courses in journalism are also available. A large number of international media development organizations have carried out \u2013 or are implementing \u2013 media development and capacity development programmes. The Danish Development agency (DANIDA) supported journalism training and support for community radio in Nepal for over 15 years. Other donors have supported media programmes mainly within project frameworks and also for development messaging. After 2006, many donor projects have focused on state building, peace, democracy, rule of law and constitution making. Donors have not supported major media development programmes with particular attention to empowerment of the IPs and strengthening their voice and participation. However, there are at least two organizations dedicated to supporting and promoting the engagement of IPs in the media.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c45daa6b-9c83-4e25-bc0d-5006ae6dc501": {"__data__": {"id_": "c45daa6b-9c83-4e25-bc0d-5006ae6dc501", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "084aa025a11002789df061943f8286cfd3116d63ceac51dbecd2cc0a6f54c907"}, "2": {"node_id": "85f6e328-4052-471b-ad51-974e750be3e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fdb4f6d3c6b441d8ca80e7cd5be331ad225c2d3667e9d1af7dd024115bc14ebc"}}, "hash": "f71f083b003bb1dfc5b00b3922790655880f7c4e7f28d0cb58427b00d4aca5ff", "text": "Association of Nepalese Indigenous Nationalities Journalists (ANIJ): ANIJ was set up in August 1999 to serve as a professional organization to increase IPs participation in the media and to make them aware of their basic rights, heritage and cultural expressions through content production and dissemination.

The elected body in August 2009 comprised of Khim Ghale, President; Raj Kumar Dikpal, Amar Bhuju, Tilak Pun, Krishna Sarbahari Chaudhary, vice-presidents; Ganesh Chaudhary, General Secretary; Mohan Singh Lama, secretary; Jas Kumar Rai, treasurer. 41 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal ANIJ has carried out programmes to raise awareness among youth from indigenous groups about the profession of journalism and media, and offered training to support their professional development. It has also arranged journalist visits to communities of IPs to familiarize media with issues that matter to the IPs, and has supported NEFIN and other IPOs in efforts to carry their messages to the media. Indigenous Film Archive (IFA): The IFA was established in November 2006 to promote and archive films made by indigenous filmmakers and films about indigenous cultures, cultural practices, knowledge, skills and values. It has since expanded to include collection, documentation, categorization, archiving, promotion and dissemination of films on indigenous issues, traditional institutions, governance, knowledge, skills, cultural best practices, values, value systems, customary laws and wisdom. Some of IFA\u2019s development objectives are to establish indigenous filmmaking as a tool for the development of IPs and provide filmmakers a forum to showcase productionsd.77 It is also trying to establish an archive for starting exchanges with IPs around the world. The IFA has been organizing film festivals since 2007. It has also organized a training of female filmmakers from indigenous peoples\u2019 group, set up a fund to support producers and facilitated the establishment of filmmakers associations in the Gurung, Limbu, Magar, Newar and Tamang communities. Media Policy and Regulations Nepal does not have an independent mechanism for regulating broadcasting. The Press Council Nepal is a mechanism for regulating the print media. It began including an assessment of radios in its report in 2008. PCN seems to be independent in structure and operations, including industry participation, yet the government appoints its members. This can result in compromises on decisions. Nepal\u2019s Interim Constitution grants broadcasters the same freedoms extended to print but the media laws have not been amended to incorporate the necessary changes and to bring broadcasting under some regulation. An analysis of the media in the mid-1990s found strong associations of the newspapers with political parties.78 The political leanings were also evident in media monitoring done by the PCN during the CA election in April 2008. It found that all major weeklies leaned heavily toward one party or another and sometimes even suppressed or excluded news about other political parties.79 The larger broadsheet dailies had maintained editorial independence during the elections. Freedom of expression Nepal\u2019s media has been largely free in terms of legislation and policy since 1990. The constitution currently under construction, as well as its interim form, provides adequate guarantees for media freedoms and freedom of expression.80 But implementing the provisions remains problematic. 77 Based on conversation with Navin Subba, Chairperson, IFA and IFA publications.

It has been lax during the transition for lack of adequate regulatory systems as well as political will. As of the end of 2009, the government was playing four roles in the media: broadcaster, publisher, licensing authority and regulator. The Right to Information Law 2064 and the Working Journalists Act (WJA) 2064 were approved by Parliament in 2007. WJA sets standards for employing journalists and provides for a committee to recommend minimum wages. Several media groups commented on the Right to Information law in February 2008, including Article 19, Freedom Forum and the FNJ. They observed: y It is limited in scope applying for citizens rather than to everyone; y The information request procedures require applicants to submit reasons for their requests, which is not only contrary to international standards but also potentially places the burden of proof on the applicant; y It lacks an override providing for the disclosure of even exempt information where this is in the overall public interest; y Parliament and civil society groups should have greater input in appointing members of the National Information Commission (it is done by the government); y The National Information Commission should be given a wider promotional mandate to foster implementation of the law.83 Further legislative and legal reforms appeared unlikely in the short-run given the priorities associated with constitution writing and peace building. It may take several years for the laws to be updated \u2013 based on the new constitutional provisions. Therefore, there is a need to continuously advocate for media freedoms, as the new laws will also influence communication for empowerment of the IPs. Other areas for media policy reforms concern issues such as ending criminal defamation; national security (definitions, scope); states of emergency (and media controls); hate speech, greater inclusion in media and prohibition of speech intended to incite hatred, violence, etc.; review of parliamentary and judicial privileges vis-\u00e0-vis media scrutiny, establishment of public media and independent regulation.84 Following the approval of Nepal\u2019s Right to Information act, an independent National Information Commission was formed in June 2008. The three-member commission can require government agencies and even non-governmental organizations to furnish the requested information. It has already taken several decisions to require agencies to furnish information. None of its decisions made so far are related to demands for information in the languages spoken by indigenous peoples.85 81 Article 19, Freedom Forum, Federation of Nepali Journalists. (2008).

Records at the FNJ suggest various motives for the attacks, including political motivation and settling of old scores, public anger against content published or broadcast and the lack of effective and adequate measures for redress, revenge attacks and even petty crime. Attacks may also have been motivated by the desire to ensure content that is supportive of causes espoused by different groups, including those with identity-based demands. Trade unions supported by the Maoists have also resorted to industrial actions, which have often resulted in closure and disruption of media services. Publicly some Maoist leaders have made critical remarks about the large organized press and when industrial actions follow such statements, there are grounds to suspect a connection between party policy and union actions. In some instances, media companies were forced to temporarily stop publication.86 Attacks on the media escalated after mid-August 2008 and culminated in the deaths of two of journalists, one killed in late 2008 and the other in early 2009.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64e21da3-3ff6-49bd-ae0b-67e298fe2f76": {"__data__": {"id_": "64e21da3-3ff6-49bd-ae0b-67e298fe2f76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d68d40eb2252c96d16de0df90ff7d0264a85d7cbc6525d7a2feff94b83b2b4b"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f22357d-e668-43d1-ac83-c8365b82c929", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25a9e39ed2ced59204e5f9e1841b89364d809dce40d9befd22a2b59e2d71e22c"}}, "hash": "fb58319cc98a375ccfc827b6cd00487100e6d8418791f12e8e4e2e6fac6e8f51", "text": "The cases were not investigated thoroughly and no legal action was initiated against the suspects.

This has an adverse effect on the level of trust of the general public in the media, as its content is subjected to the control of various political groups. Media capacity Nepal has a fairly well-established media sector. But improving content quality remains a major challenge. The media run by the indigenous peoples\u2019 groups in their own languages have limited reach. The voice of IPs can be enhanced only through mechanisms to ensure greater representation of trained journalists from their communities in the mainstream media. Good-quality training and mentoring can assist professional journalists from indigenous populations to upgrade their skills, obtain and retain media jobs and continuously give credible voice to their issues. Indigenous Peoples in the Media Recent information on representation of IPs in the media is not available. However, a 2000 survey by Shekhar Parajuli and Bhaskar Gautam of the Samajik Bikas Tatha Anushandan Kendra (Social Development and Research Centre) in 23 cities and towns provides a snapshot. The representation may have improved slightly following greater demands for inclusion in the media. This study grouped media workers into the editorial, columnist and publisher categories for analysis. The editorial group included reporters, editors and layout/design staff. This group included 956 individuals from 73 publications of which Janajatis (IPs) comprised only 164 persons or 17.15 percent; there were 57 Newar (34.7 percent) among the IPs in the editorial group. The representation of IPs in 41 newspapers inside Kathmandu Valley was 149 (21.5 percent) of the total number of 693 in the group. The representation of Newar journalists in the districts was 62.4 percent. The other groups with some representation were Rai, Limbu and Tamang. There were eight women from indigenous peoples\u2019 groups among the 31 female journalists in the Kathmandu Valley papers. Five of the eight women were Newar. 86 See Report of the International Press Freedom and Freedom of Information Mission to Nepal February 2009 for most recent cases and Mission reports from July 2005 for earlier cases. 87 http://cpj.org/2009/02/attacks-on-the-press-in-2008-nepal.php (24 March 2009). 44 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal According to the same study, among the 298 columnists in 73 newspapers, 25 were from indigenous groups. Thirteen of these columnists were Newar. The representation of IPs as columnists was higher in the Kathmandu Valley papers (64 of 248 or 25.8 percent of the total number). Among the 64 columnists, 44 or 68.8 percent were Newar. There were 15 female columnists in these publications of which seven were IPs; among them six were Newar.88 The publishers group included the heads of distribution, marketing, directors, the managing director and the company chairman. The newspapers outside Kathmandu were not very organized and therefore the publisher had varied roles such as that of the distributor, manager and editor. The study found 25 IPs in the publishers\u2019 group. Of the 41 publications studied in Kathmandu Valley, there were only 21 IPs in the group, of which 14 were Newar.89 Clearly, underrepresentation of IPs other than the Newar in the media remains a challenge. Reasons for this include language of the publication (and the proficiency of IPs in the language) and most importantly the limited capacity of journalists from indigenous groups owing to their inadequate access to opportunities for self-improvement. A number of issues related to journalism in the Nepali language have had a negative, direct influence on communication for empowerment of the IPs. The broad issues90 include the following: y Resources: Most media companies are understaffed. A reporter works on at least two reports a day and this means he/she has time for writing straight news only. No time or resources are available for stories that require in-depth research and analysis; y Capacity: Nepal has a long history of journalism training (also a reason for donor fatigue in the case of DANIDA). However, training has largely focused on basic skills and because Nepal\u2019s social science education is poor, the grounding and tools needed for understanding issues in-depth and for reporting on them is still lacking; y Feedback and self-improvement: Even reporters wanting to do something different do not have the time and resources required to access, study and produce stories based on research.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "920e1368-87cc-4a30-b02a-09811ab56d25": {"__data__": {"id_": "920e1368-87cc-4a30-b02a-09811ab56d25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05c6d27c0e63be168c92ff8e63a2b73bd929da2760cb256115322ede746345d7"}, "2": {"node_id": "4531d8df-fc4f-4648-b157-053a46f989b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0869f027229f9eeb6c3009a735051d8017c2277b266b86cebe803ecbfd9596d6"}}, "hash": "2e75b25933f6e2d37001214d3882037289575fd6ec9afe429fc59d41acef3c0f", "text": "Their sources and readers/audiences (for feedback) are largely politicians, political analysts and lawyers.

For the present C4E study, eight daily newspapers published from Kathmandu on August 10 were analyzed. The analysis confirmed the pattern described by Parajuli (2000): there was very little coverage, it was routine and event-driven and even half- hearted. Most of the newspapers reported on a rally organized by Nepal\u2019s IPs on August 9 but many did not report what the speakers had said or interview the speakers. Other newspapers printed large pictures of IPs in traditional attire, giving it a festive angle. They did not report their key demands and did not discuss how those could be addressed. There was one exception. The Nagarik daily ran an op-ed piece in which an activist was invited to write about IPs\u2019 demands. The newspaper also had a fairly long story on illegal taxes imposed by different IPs groups seeking ethnic federations on the highways. It did not report on the rally that marked the International Day. Two English-language newspapers did not cover the rally. Another newspaper had a fairly long report on the views of a former prime minister and president of the Nepali Congress party, on federalism. The former prime minister did not support federalism based on ethnicity, language, etc. The story could have been an opportunity to bring the views of IPs into the debate \u2013 many of which were articulated by the speakers at the rally \u2013 but this was not done.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efe8f594-15e2-41c4-a816-cbb272081319": {"__data__": {"id_": "efe8f594-15e2-41c4-a816-cbb272081319", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "944a62d4b1c90658e604dddbbb15627e27935de22fa958c1ff4a7d321e376cd5"}, "2": {"node_id": "226ed32b-eab7-47e0-a06e-a61ac0158d72", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e861bcae8349cb115ffc8aef5053f23cba38aaa8520942cd7b8012800f860ccb"}}, "hash": "9fbf13057867ef7a73aecbf4258bc4f23c02fb991dfa6c87f275517d907435f3", "text": "The Gorkhaparta daily ran the federalism story on page 1; its report on the International Day for IPs was, as in many other papers, in the inside pages.

Instead, it was about a mix-up in results of a beauty contest for children of IPs. The lack of interest of newspapers in the International Day of the World\u2019s Indigenous People could have resulted from it being a routine event (one that comes around every year).

From the published articles reviewed for the International Day, it can be concluded that there was an apparent lack of discussion on how the media decide to handle such events. The Day was an important opportunity for both the civil society and the media to raise the debate about federalism in Nepal to a new, more informed level. But the coverage suggested a compartmentalization of the issue as one being of interest to only IPs and therefore it was reduced to a entertainment story (without real substance) by some newspapers. Journalists from indigenous communities working at several media organizations discussed this situation during an interaction programme in early January 2010. They said issues affecting IPs get reported because they (the journalists) are in the organizations, but it is mainly people from the communities that do the reporting. They said journalists from other groups are not interested or not adequately informed about the issues affecting IPs and the importance of these issues to their communities. In addition, the respondents to the assessment also indicated their lack of trust in the media due to misrepresentation of IPs in the media. Overview of ICT and Telecommunication Landscape Nepal has made considerable advances in the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The telephone network (fixed lines, mobiles and CDMA92 phones) is expanding but the use of broadband for Internet is restricted to urban centres, mainly in Kathmandu Valley. Nepal has also tested innovative experiments in rural communications using the Internet and other communication technologies. One effort led by Mahabir Pun won him the Ramon Magsaysay 92 Code Division Multiple Access phones that are mobile. Services are similar to the regular mobile services. 46 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal award for community leadership in 2007. He was recognized for the use of \u201cwireless computer technology in Nepal, and bringing progress to remote mountain areas by connecting his village to the global village.\u201d93 Nepal has a number of Internet news portals and bloggers. However, connectivity is still limited to a small number of urban dwellers. Access is not uniform, often limited by the ability to pay. Many organizations, including ANIJ, have an Internet presence but only a handful of sites are routinely serviced and updated (except for news organizations).94 Postal services Nepal\u2019s postal network reaches all Village Development Committees. The network is comprised of the General Post Office, regional post directorates, district post offices, Ilaka post offices and additional post offices, for a total of 3,992 offices. There are ongoing efforts to upgrade rural post offices into rural communications hubs. However, the transformation has not been effective for various reasons, including limited resources and bandwidth. The district post office in Rasuwa, one of the three-field study districts, had been designated as a telecentre. However, the only service available at the post office at the time of the survey was a photocopy machine. Telecommunications The Nepal Telecommunication Authority (NTA) is the regulator with semi-judicial authority. Six companies provide voice communication services: Nepal Telecom, United Telecom Ltd., Spice Nepal Pvt. Ltd., STM Telecom Sanchar Pvt. Ltd., Nepal Satellite Telecom Pvt. Ltd., and Smart Telecom Pvt. Ltd., as of August 2009. Nepal Telecom, previously a government monopoly, provides fixed- line or basic services as well as mobile services. Other companies provided limited mobility and mobile services. In mid-July 2009 the government said CDMA mobile95 coverage for cellular technology had been extended to all 75 districts of the country and the GSM mobile coverage was available in 72 districts.96 Mobile telephone coverage is expected to reach all 75 districts by mid-July 2010. The telecom penetration rate \u2013 both fixed-line and mobile \u2013 was 26.7 percent in December 2009.97 Nepal had 1,893 rural public call (telephone) offices in December 2009.

Digital Review of Asia Pacific 2007. \u2018.np\u2019 Nepal. pp. 230-235. 47 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal ICT Policy and Regulations High-level Commission for Information Technology: The Prime Minister heads Nepal\u2019s High- level Commission for Information Technology (HLCIT). It seeks to provide a strategic direction and assist the formulation of appropriate policy for the development of the ICT sector and to harness the technology for overcoming developmental challenges, including governance reform, and for catalyzing economic growth. The HLCIT is entrusted to oversee implementation of Nepal\u2019s IT policy and strategy (2000). Its duties include everything from policy support and introducing new technology to promoting and supporting Nepal\u2019s IT products and services. The HLCIT is Nepal\u2019s answer to seemingly overlapping functions of two ministries: science and technology and information and communications. Its effectiveness remains to be tested. The HLCIT also serves as a forum to bring all major players together in the IT sector, where growth in the provision of services has been led largely by the private sector. The HLCIT plans to use the existing cable network for Web 2.0 services to ensure wide participation of people in the ongoing debates on state building. One idea being discussed in mid-2009 was training and exposing students to ICTs and using facilities installed at schools as a rural telecentre.100 This initiative and others would reach rural areas that do not have other means of communication, with activities tailored to the language, ways of life and information needs of specific communities. Bandwidth remains a major hurdle for starting major IT-enabled services. In February 2007, only 13 Internet Service Providers (ISPs) were connected to the Nepal Internet Exchange (NPIX), which is owned by the Internet Service Providers Association of Nepal. The international bandwidth used for uplink and downlink was 37 Mbps and 90 Mbps.101 Nepal does not have a broadband policy. The NTA has prepared a policy draft, which is waiting government approval. Rural ICT Initiatives Despite bandwidth constraints, Nepal has opportunities to optimize its use for rural information and communications. Nepal\u2019s telecom consumers pay 2 percent of their gross revenue into a rural telecommunication fund that is largely unused. The Rural Telecom Development Fund is said to have grown to over NRs 1 billion (approximately US$ 14 million). This fund could be used to expand communication infrastructure and increase information access for rural populations. This would require government commitment to expand the IT infrastructure and facilitate equal bandwidth access to all groups, including IPs. Rural information/communication telecentres One HLCIT initiative with potential for empowering IPs is the Rural Information Centre, or telecentre. A telecentre is envisioned as a Web-based information portal that can provide the tools for levelling the playing field by increasing information access. The idea remains only an idea, for the most part, given lack of resources, capacity, tools, a reliable communications backbone, etc. The HLCIT website allows a search for telecentres in different districts (see http://www.telecenters. org.np/rural_telecenters_nepal.php).102 There is one telecentre in Kailali district.

Most of the links were inactive, even those listing forms relevant to rural populations such as citizenship papers, changes in names and proof of marriage. Interestingly, it also had a link to U.S. DV application forms http://www.telecenters.org.np/en/listcontents/7. The Forum page on the portal had no interactivity. The site contained some fairly recent agricultural commodity prices. It also had an announcement about an Asian Development Bank and United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asian And the Pacific initiative to set up six pilot community communication centres. The selected VDCs and districts were: Phikkal, Ilam; Phutung, Kathmandu; Kalikasthan, Rasuwa; Sundarbazar, Lamjung; Bijauri, Dang; and Bailya, Kailali. Telecentres in rural areas can be effective for increasing access and voices of villagers but their utility is linked to connectivity and the bandwidth as well as the costs. The bandwidth cost is high, and available via satellite and import mainly from India and also from China through fibre optic cable. Nepal Telecom Company (NTC) procures bandwidth in bulk from the two countries. Some ISPs have also begun procuring bandwidth via optic fibre cable from India and this is expected to reduce the Internet costs. The NTC, in which the government is a major shareholder, therefore remains a vital institution. It can determine the level of access and reach of ICT services and the use of these technologies for empowering IPs. It also has the largest backhaul network103 in the rural areas. This is not the first time efforts have been made to enhance rural communication. UNESCO supported the establishment of four Community Media Centres some years ago. Nepal also has hundreds of Community Learning Centres promoted by the education ministry. UNESCO is now considering pilot projects to \u2018build bridges\u2019 between some of these centres and/or community radios to take digital technology to the villages and encourage information sharing.104 Key Challenges and Opportunities for Indigenous Peoples in Media and ICT Communications, voice and representation Effective communication for empowering Nepal\u2019s IPs faces some of the major challenges and opportunities, as listed below. Challenges y Changing policy and legislations \u2014 Nepal is formulating new laws and building new institutions. Their structures will be clear only after the new constitution is promulgated. Nepal has had fairly broad and open media policies and laws since the early 1990s. The challenge is to ensure similar, if not more clearly defined, freedoms for the media. The legal and policy framework will influence all media and communication efforts in Nepal, including efforts aimed at empowering IPs; y Media is largely controlled by dominant groups and remains strongly influenced by political parties \u2014 Excluded groups including IPs have low representation in the media (compared to dominant groups) and this has affected their ability to influence content. Media companies have begun hiring more journalists from indigenous peoples\u2019 groups but the ability of these journalists to take on leadership positions (and be able to influence content and present issues professionally and fairly) is constrained by capacity. The views of IPs in the party- influenced media are influenced by the positions of the parties concerned rather than the views of the IPs as a group. This has an adverse effect on the level of trust of the general public and specifically IPs in the media; 103 In wireless network technology, to transmit voice and data traffic from a cell site to a switch, i.e., from a remote site to a central site.

Access to media is a major issue in the villages, particularly for excluded groups, including IPs. FM radio has now reached many districts but some do not still have radios. Even where they exist, much remains to be done to improve access, voice and participation of the IPs in content production; y Language barrier/ local language content \u2014 Government-owned media have more content in languages spoken by IPs than privately run media, with some exceptions (e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5d159ec-11cc-4308-8c1e-1abf6625515c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5d159ec-11cc-4308-8c1e-1abf6625515c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5ee8ae4e1fa37f46330447887fc268b65a80c4515b766e8ff0024f1f4cc3897"}}, "hash": "e5ee8ae4e1fa37f46330447887fc268b65a80c4515b766e8ff0024f1f4cc3897", "text": "a Tharu language radio in Bardia and the radio in Tehrathum that even teaches Limbu language). However, indigenous language content is limited to supplements in newspapers and/or programming on radio and television in outside of prime time hours. They are often music programmes. Language publications of IPOs have limited reach and serve awareness- building purposes within the language communities, at best. The challenge is to find effective measures for bringing the issues of IPs into the mainstream media; y Nepal\u2019s broadcast sector remains largely unregulated \u2014The lack of independent regulation of broadcast media is a major challenge given the potential for misuse of media by partisan interests, and also for spreading hate speech. This can affect the empowerment of people through communications. There are also ownership issues in the broadcasting sector that that have never been assessed and addressed; y Resource and capacity constraints \u2014 EExcept for a few large media organizations, most media institutions, especially those in the districts, face resource and capacity constraints. Radio stations lack adequate equipment, trained journalists and managers; y The coverage of IP issues by the mass media remains low and superficial \u2014 Low representation of indigenous peoples in the mass media has to do in part with access to media jobs, which in turn is related to the capacity of IP journalists. Raising the voice of IPs in the media remains a challenge because capacity development or promoting media ownership in their mother tongues are not projects that interest most donors; y Uncertain legal and policy environment \u2014 Nepal\u2019s evolving legal and policy environment remains a major challenge because free expression is critical for addressing to the empowerment needs of the IPs. Nepal has not yet emerged from the \u2018culture of violence\u2018 that marked the 10 years of insurgency. This has manifested in the form of attacks on the media. The inability of the society to tolerate different opinions has resulted in attacks on the media. Some of the attacks are related to capacity issues (how something is said) and the lack of mechanisms for swift legal redress (to aggrieved parties); y Relevant information and media content \u2014 Use of new media and ICTs remains low. IPOs and IPs have low access to these opportunities. Nepal\u2019s existing ICT infrastructure cannot support major initiatives for using ICTs for empowerment and awareness building of IPs. The cost (e.g. bandwidth, power-supply and equipment) remains a major hurdle preventing the use of ICTs for communication and empowerment; y Implementation of ICT as a means for development \u2014 Another challenge is the ability to tap existing opportunities for using ICTs as an active resource for Communications for Empowerment. ICTs will have low relevance to a majority of rural Nepalis, including IPs, because the services and applications in use are inaccessible and the services (information) provided on Internet sites do not match the needs of the users in remote rural areas. Opportunities y Open political and legislative environment \u2014 Nepal has had a fairly open political and legal environment since the 1990. The country is in the process of writing a new constitution and restructuring the state into federal units. The process is complex owing to the challenges of fixing boundaries and ensuring inclusive governance mechanisms. All future legal and policy matters will depend on how the new state is structured. The constitution is expected to be ready by May 2010 but the lawmaking process thereafter could take a number of years. Therefore there are opportunities to advocate for greater media freedoms and guarantees and for the establishment of an open political and legal environment. C4E interventions are premised on media freedoms, an open media and enabling policies; 50 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal y New laws for media and RTI \u2014 There are opportunities to advocate and lobby for improving the legal and policy framework governing the print and broadcast media and provisions for community media initiatives in radio, television and ICT-enabled services. The new policy and legal environment must also account for independent and transparent regulation on broadcasting to ensure both diversity of ownership and content. The UNESCO Media Development Indicators could provide a basis for assessing the needs and advocating change alongside other material that is available in Nepal, including the performance assessment indicators for community radio; y State media publish and broadcast in IPs languages \u2014 There are opportunities for further increasing access of IPs in the state-run media \u2013 including their transformation into public service media. As public media these organizations can be mandated to reflect diversity of Nepal in their structures and content.

This provides opportunities for targeted capacity building activities, which can over the long-run help to improve the quality of content and coverage; y Mass media can facilitate the public dialogue and discussion on restructuring the state among different social groups \u2014 Most of the issues facing the IPs in Nepal are related to restructuring the state and sharing of power and opportunities. The mass media can play a major role in facilitating the process. The media can provide a platform for impartial and moderate debate aimed at building public support for the demands of the IPs and also for informing ordinary citizens about their rights, which have now been accepted by several United Nations instruments; y Infrastructure for ICT and telecommunication \u2014 Nepal has a basic fibre optic backbone and there are plans to connect all districts in five years. However, ownership and cost-sharing issues have prevented effective use of existing infrastructure for rural communication using ICTs.

The existing network provides opportunities for carrying out pilot projects using media and ICT convergence for empowerment of IPs in some parts of the country; y Good experience with community radio \u2014 Nepal has been the leader in the community radio movement in South Asia and there are opportunities for tapping into this sector for enhancing communication for IPs. The community radio network provides a vehicle for reaching IPs with messages aimed at awareness building and also for trying out experimental programming for enhancing their voice and participation in content production; y Nepal\u2019s community radios are still evolving \u2014 There is opportunity for setting up a model radio using the best experiences available, and promoting the model in other parts of the country and regionally. Good programming at one station can also help to influence programming at other existing stations; y Best practices \u2014 Many of Nepal\u2019s FM stations are owned and operated by individuals or groups from IPs communities. This provides opportunity for taking up one or two stations, through a open and transparent selection process, and working with them to undertake new initiatives building on best practices available in Nepal and other countries. Marginalized groups of IPs can be encouraged and supported to replicate successful projects and ideas that emerge from this initiative. There are also opportunities for designing and implementing rural communication initiatives using ICTs for replication upon successful piloting; y Assessment of the community radio performance \u2014 Nepali radio advocates have prepared a set of indicators to assess the performance of community radios. Implementing the indicators can support the C4E initiative. However, there is also a need to do a baseline study of the radios in Nepal to identify potential partners that could enhance the C4E process; y Sharing of experiences \u2014 Sharing of best practices can enhance communication experiences. But there is no platform that brings together excluded groups and IPs for this purpose. The C4E process provides a background for thinking towards establishing a regional 51 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal centre for continuous learning and sharing of experiences in the field of Communications for Empowerment. Such a centre could double up as a training institute on media and communication skills and should be designed in a manner that would make it both sustainable and accessible to all. Such a mechanism does not exist for either South Asia or the Asia Pacific Region. 53 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal 3. Communication for Empowerment Field Study 54 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal 3. Communication for Empowerment Field Study The field research aims to complement the national overview study. The assessment of information and communication needs, challenges and opportunities reflects the perspective of IPs. The field research does not seek to provide a representative view of the entire indigenous population in Nepal. Rather, these findings provide data for verifying and complementing the national overview study. IPs were involved the research process as the targeted beneficiaries of the C4E initiative. These findings are expected to assist in devising intervention strategies and actions for addressing group and area specific information and communication needs of IPs. They could also assist in planning C4E interventions for excluded groups in Nepal. The field research data are not representative for the whole country.

In addition, the experiences and lessons from the community-level research are also expected to help in improving the methodology for national C4E studies to be conducted in other countries. The study has examined information and communications separately and not as interchangeable concepts. On one hand, access to information is a precondition for empowering IPs through understanding of issues and rights. On the other hand, communication means the ability of the people to express their voice, participate in a dialogue and influence decisions that affect their lives. The two complement each other but also embody separate meanings, which are necessary for understanding and implementing the C4E study. Field Research Methodology The national overview study was the basis for assessing data and information collected from secondary sources and interviews with key resource persons. The field study generated analysis based on primary sources including household surveys, focus group discussions and interviews with members of indigenous peoples\u2019 households and local officials. The field visits were required to assess development challenges and opportunities, particularly the use of information and communication to overcome development challenges as well as to promote voice and participation of IPs. The research locations were selected taking into account the time constraints and they do not necessarily fully represent the three IPs groups \u2013 Limbu, Tamang and Tharu \u2013 to which the majority of respondents belonged. The selection of locations was intended to achieve a broad conceptual understanding of the diversity, geographical spread and differences in development outcomes among the different groups of IPs. The locations were fairly easily accessible by vehicle and therefore, IPs at the locations generally represented a higher level of development in terms of access to modern infrastructures compared to those living in remote areas. Profile of interviewees A total of 113 persons were interviewed for the field study. The household surveys were reasonably gender-balanced; one location had a higher number of female respondents. The respondents did not represent the caste and ethnic diversity of Nepal but was representative of IPs living in the specific locations. The interviewees do not necessarily represent the larger community of indigenous nationalities in Nepal (see Table 6). 55 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal Table 6: Profile of Respondents in the Survey Districts District Gender Total households Female interviewee Male interviewee Households Percentage Households Percentage Kailali 15 37.5 25 62.5 40 Rasuwa 14 45.2 17 54.8 31 Tehrathum 25 59.5 17 40.5 42 Total 54 47.8 59 52.2 113 Location of districts The field study locations were identified during the Training Workshop on C4E Study and Assessment Methodology for Indigenous Peoples in Nepal, held in Kathmandu 15-17 June 2009.105 The locations were selected in consultation with the indigenous stakeholders at the training and the representative organizations of IPs in the selected districts. The study was conducted in three locations: y Durgauli, Kailali district in mid-western Nepal y Syaphru, Rasuwa district in the central region north of Kathmandu, and y Basantapur, Tehrathum district in the eastern region of the country. The selection of the field research district has tried to reflect Nepal\u2019s geographical divisions and also includes pockets with high IP populations. The three districts represent different eco-climatic zones: Terai (plains), mountain and hill of Nepal. Kailali district was selected because it is one of Nepal\u2019s four districts where the population of the Tharu is high, making up over 30 percent of the population.106 Rasuwa was selected because it is one district where the Tamang have the majority, more than 77 percent of the population. Likewise, Tehrathum is one of Nepal\u2019s three districts with the largest Limbu settlements. The Limbu accounted for 34.5 percent of the district\u2019s population.107 Map 3: Locations of Field Research for C4E Study Basantapur, Tehrathum district Syaphru, Rasuwa district Durgauli, Kailali district 105 See, Draft Workshop Report: Training Workshop on Communication for Empowerment Study and Assessment Methodology for Indigenous Peoples in Nepal.

The surveys were carried out at the Village Development Committee level (see questionnaire in appendix 1). The questionnaire was translated into Nepali and each one was completed in an interview with a householder. A local translator assisted in the interviews at some locations. Each interview lasted for about 45 minutes. Participating households were selected based on their availability at the time of the visit. The respondents belonged to five ethnic groups and one caste group, the Dalit. The number of Dalit respondents was negligible (see Figure 4). Figure 4: Respondents by Caste/Ethnicity in Study Area Tharu 32.7% Tamang 20.4% Magar 0.9% Limbu 37.2% Ghale 7.1% Dalit1.8% In-depth interviews Open-ended or less-structured interviews were conducted with individual householders and local officials. The householder interviews complemented the survey data as they allowed deeper examination of how the mass media covered issues related to IPs and their development challenges. Furthermore, interviews with local officials helped ascertain contextual information about development and infrastructural issues and activities at the district level. This information was relevant for understanding the household data. Focus group discussions The focus group discussions generated deeper perspectives from representative groups in each community. The participants at the focus groups were mixed in terms of gender and professions. (Data used for the analysis is presented in Appendix 3.) Findings in the Three Districts The findings are presented by district and are also compared across the locations. Information from focus group discussions and the official interviews has been combined with the survey results. A case study has been included to demonstrate how greater representation of indigenous groups in the media can provide better coverage of issues affecting IPs. 57 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal Kailali District Kailali district lies in Nepal\u2019s mid-western region. It covers an area of 3,235 square kilometres, of which about 40.3 percent is hilly and the remaining 59.7 lies in plains. In 2001, the district had a population of 616,697, about half were women. The Tharu make up about 44 percent of the population.108 Other major social groups in the district are Brahmins, Chhetri, Dalit and Magars. About 50 percent of the district\u2019s population was economically active; women comprised 31 percent of this group. Most people are engaged in agriculture. Rice, wheat, pulses, oilseeds and vegetables including potatoes are the major food crops. Sugarcane is the major cash crop. The district had 2,486 landless households.109 There were wide disparities in land ownership, with 263 landowners owning over 10 hectares of land while 2,486 shared 1.4 hectares. The 263 landowners occupy 4,765.6 hectares.110 According to a 2003 study by the National Labour Academy and Oxfam Nepal, there were 17,719 landless households in the district. A large number of the Tharu IPs worked as bonded labourers in the fields of large landholders before the system was abolished on July 17, 2001. The findings were drawn largely from Tharu respondents, plus two Dalit and one Magar respondents. There were 62.5 percent males and 37.5 percent female respondents. Almost 83 percent of them belonged to the 11-40 years age group, with 33.6 percent from the 21-30 years age group. Tharu respondents, both men and women, were illiterate; 50 percent of the Dalit respondents were illiterate. Among the Tharu, 16.2 percent had education above the higher secondary level, 16.2 percent held bachelor\u2019s degrees and 5.4 percent held master\u2019s degrees. However, only men had the master\u2019s degrees. About 47 percent of the Tharus said they are farmers, 18.2 percent said they are skilled labourers and 22.7 percent said they are teachers. Thirty six percent said they are dependent on their families/charity. The other two categories of respondents said they are farmers. Development situation Kailali district came under the 0.400 - 0.449 category in the HDI. Districts in this HDI range in Nepal rank fourth (from the top) in a six-level grouping.111 Based on the 2001 census, Kailali district had one health facility for 14,016 people and the contraceptive prevalence rate was 41.56 percent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96cd3fc0-cd2b-4473-b497-25789a57a21a": {"__data__": {"id_": "96cd3fc0-cd2b-4473-b497-25789a57a21a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a37290cb88c286ded3998efadc387d2f5f553548eada59134296be13508b25d3"}, "2": {"node_id": "b7015773-af17-44ec-b134-b9152928e8c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ccb563fd8a2cbc9576286b17d1451548919c5ae10cc4728feb4898bab97d92de"}}, "hash": "96a7aaa7ecb86ef2a44fc7ec32e9fa33a2295c181fb8bc176a4fc932a84cf750", "text": "Over 58 percent of the population did not have toilets and only 21.92 percent had modern toilets with flush.112 The literacy rate of both men and women in Kailali was 52.6 percent in 2001, which was close to the national average.

At one focus groups discussion, the participants said inequality between the Tharus and non-Tharus had caused them to set up their own club and build a separate clubhouse. They said the club was formed because the non- Tharus did not include them in their club. One of the major livelihood concerns among the Raji, a small group of IPs in Kailali, was land ownership. Their nomadic livelihoods were threatened because most public forests were either protected as national parks or had been converted into community forests. 108 Data is based on information available at the DDC, http://www.ddckailali.gov.np/pages/introduction.php (accessed on 2 December 2009) 109 http://www.ddckailali.gov.np/pages/introduction.php (Accessed on 3 December 2009) 110 Ibid. 111 NPC/UNDP, Nepal Human Development Report. 2004. 112 ICIMOD. CBS. 2003. Mapping Nepal Census Indicators & Trends. Kathmandu. 58 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal Education and healthcare were two other major development challenges identified by the villagers. Tikapur municipality had recognized the Raji as a minority group. In 2008 the District Development Committee (DDC) allocated Rs150,000 for scholarships and stationery for Raji children. The discussants said the support was not enough and wanted every ward or village where the Raji reside to be given autonomy so that they can take charge of their own development. They felt politicians ignored them because they were insignificant as a voting base. The Rajis put forward their own candidate for the CA election but the candidate was able to obtain only 270 votes and did not win. Access to information Durgauli Village Development Community lies in the mid-western plains of Nepal and has fairly good access to information and media. There are two FM radio stations at Tikapur municipality, which is close to the survey village. The FM stations had IP station managers and also employed fairly large number of Tharu journalists. There were five locally published newspapers and the district also received newspapers published in Dhangadhi, the district headquarters, and also from Kathmandu. The village also receives radio broadcasts from neighbouring districts and television programming from both Nepal and India. There was a local cable operator in Tikapur municipality. The cable services were available within the municipal boundaries. The cable operator provided free advertising time for announcements of indigenous peoples\u2019 groups. Tikapur municipality also had an Internet caf\u00e9, which was largely used by teenagers for emails and online chats/ discussions. As a source of information, newspapers were less useful compared to the broadcast media largely because of the high illiteracy in the Nepali language. Illiteracy in the Tharu language was also low. A little over 50 percent of the respondents reported ability to write and read in their mother tongue, a larger percentage of them could read and write in the national language. Villages relied on the following information sources: television, radio and traditional sources such as the Katuwal (village-crier), teachers and health workers.113 These modern and traditional forms of media coexist in Kailali and serve as useful and fairly reliable information sources.114 However, a majority of the respondents, especially men, preferred the Katuwal (village-crier) the traditional source of information. The household ownership of television and radio was high at 75 percent and 70 percent, respectively. Television is the most prevalent information channel; 27.5 percent of the respondents found it \u201cvery reliable\u201d. Only 12.5 percent of the respondents said radio was very reliable. Television and radio scored higher in the \u201csomewhat reliable\u201d category or 62.5 percent and 60 percent, respectively. A large number of people found that both television and radio had somewhat reliable information, while a smaller percentage found them very reliable. This suggests that there might be room for improving content and programme formats, and their relevance to local populations through quality local language programming. Media coverage of indigenous peoples\u2019 issues was low. Among respondents 47.4 percent said coverage of their issues was \u201cvery low\u201d in newspapers, 50 percent said it was very low on radio and 47.4 percent said it was very low on television.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc2d47ea-bee6-4915-9df1-35987462ad24": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc2d47ea-bee6-4915-9df1-35987462ad24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ca6f587fb44c0a226451c57cd4bae452b4a8ad12d3206d2ff2d7187a4900f87"}, "2": {"node_id": "73603cc6-ff22-470f-a81a-a261755c15c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93ada952bcef54fd7afb4173073f80026b0d0110ed1dfbcf6d7dcc09942b5fe2"}}, "hash": "4a536dd3ef80c0230af2846e67f6f264df5d192202519fca63363faf353c954d", "text": "Voice and communications In the rural context, some traditional sources of information can also serve as platforms for communications among IPs.

Local FM radios in Nepal have very little programming on local issues and tend to provide more space for national political content as opposed to local voices, including those of the IPs. Mobile telephony has opened up new opportunities in information and communications. Household ownership of mobile phones was high (90 percent). However, mobile phones were less useful as sources of information compared to both radio and television. This could be because mobiles phones are used mainly for personal communications. It is not used for sharing development-related information. Information and communication needs and challenges115 One focus group discussion in Kailali district was held with the Raji, a small indigenous group.116 \u201cEarlier even the media were hesitant about covering our issues, now they do and we are satisfied,\u201d a participant said. Participants in the discussion said, they would like the media to cover success stories on achievements of individual Rajis. They said they would like to have a journalist from their community and would send someone for training when and if the opportunity arose. They said they believed this would help improve their representation and coverage in the media. The discussion suggested that the media did cover issues about the Rajis but did not serve them as a platform for communication. No newspapers were available in the Raji settlements and even if they had been available the Rajis would not have been able to purchase them or to read them. The other focus group discussion had all IPs from the Tharu group. They said information in the media in Tharu language was useful, and were pleased that the media reported about them when they sent the information to the media. But they would have liked reporters to visit them in the villages. There was a non-Tharu journalist in the village but the discussion participants said the reporter was not interested in reporting about them. The villagers were also critical about some content of the FM stations. They said one programme on a local FM station sometimes crossed the limits of decency and was difficult to listen to with family members, even though it was informative. The discussants wanted to have more informative and educational programmes and less entertainment and blamed the media of bringing instant foods to the village, through advertising. The villagers said they would like to have programmes where doctors explained the benefits of eating wholesome food. Coverage of Tharu issues on radio was higher compared to other media, the villagers said. The reason for this was the presence of more Tharu as journalists in radio compared to other media. Newspapers had fewer Tharu journalists and also lower coverage of Tharu issues. The villagers wanted more local issues covered on radio. They said water in the village was contaminated with arsenic and wanted the media to tell them how the harm could be reduced. In addition, they also wanted programmes for promoting and protecting Tharu culture. Rasuwa District Rasuwa is Nepal\u2019s smallest district. It lies in the north of Kathmandu, and has 18 Village Development Communities, of which 11 are located within the Langtang National Park. The district\u2019s 2001 population was 44,731.117 The main social groups in the district are Tamang, Sherpa, Gurung, Brahmin, Chhetris, Magar and Dalits. The study was carried out at Thulo Bharkhu in Syaphru VDC. 115 Information and communication needs and challenges are interconnected because information sources, especially mass media, can also play a critical role in enhancing voice and communications through right programme formats and content. 116 A small IPs group with around 3,500 members of which around 3,000 reside in the district. 117 ICIMOD.

Map 4: Location of Rasuwa District Rasuwa district The findings were drawn from two ethnic groups: Tamang (74.2 percent) and Ghale (25.8 percent). More than 54 percent of the respondents were men and around 45 percent were women. Almost 83 percent of the respondents belonged to the 11-40 years age group and with 33.6 percent from the 21-30 years age group. Among the Tamang respondents, 17.4 percent were illiterate, 26.1 percent had completed primary level education, 17.4 percent had completed lower secondary and 30.4 percent had completed secondary education. Among the Ghale respondenct, 12.5 percent were illiterate, 62.5 percent had completed primary education and 12.5 percent had completed secondary education. About 65 percent of the Tamang respondents said they were farmers, while the remaining 35 percent were unemployed and dependent on their families. About 62.5 percent of the Ghale respondents said they were farmers, 25 percent of Ghale men said they were skilled labourers and 25 percent said they were unskilled labourers. Among Ghale women, 25 percent of respondents said they were teachers. Development situation During focus group discussions, the villagers listed healthcare as a major problem. There was no healthcare facility in the survey settlement. They had to travel to Syafrubesi, about two hours by jeep on the dirt road, to treat simple ailments. The 2001 census figures show that Rasuwa had one health institution for 2,354 people and the contraceptive prevalence rate was 40.22 percent. Most of the people (67.39 percent) did not have toilets and only 9.79 percent had modern toilets with flush.118 118 ICIMOD. CBS. 2003. Mapping Nepal Census Indicators & Trends. Kathmandu. 61 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal The village did not have a secondary school. The other barrier to education was language. Nepali and not Tamang was the language of instruction. The literacy rate for Rasuwa was 34.3 percent in 2001 (24.8 percent for women). These numbers were below the national literacy rate average, which in 2007 was 70 percent overall and for women was 43 percent119. Some 54 percent of the population had completed primary school and around 10 percent had not attended school. The district had 131 schools. The students had to travel two hours on foot everyday to attend secondary school at Dhunche, the district headquarter. In the focus group discussions, the villagers said they wanted education in their mother tongue. The government had introduced multilingual education in Rasuwa district but the villagers did not fully understand the dialect used. The villagers have also requested government assistance to establish a health post and to upgrade the village school, but they have not received any response. Villagers in Rasuwa faced a unique problem of sustainable livelihoods. \u201cWild animals destroy all our crops,\u201d the villagers said, \u201cand we have to keep watching our cultivation from the sowing of seeds to the ripening of the crop. Even after all that we get to harvest only half of the production, the wild animals take the rest.\u201d They have demanded compensation from the wildlife department or that the wild animals be killed. For villagers living in Langtang National Park, the park-people conflicts remain unresolved. The villagers feel that the park is a major obstacle to their development, because every project has to be approved by the wildlife department and there have been instances where park officials have rejected some local projects. The district receives 50 percent of the park royalties for use in development projects from the central government. Another major livelihood issue is access to natural resources.

The villagers used mobile phones but not everyone could afford these services. Some parts of the settlement did not receive mobile signals. A quarterly publication existed in Dhunche, the district headquarters, but there were no daily or weekly newspapers. In mid-2009, because bad roads had disrupted traffic, the district had not received any newspaper from Kathmandu for about two months. Rasuwa was one of the few districts in Nepal that did not have a FM radio station in 2009. The villagers of Thulo Bharkhu could receive radio broadcasts from neighbouring districts. One of the stations that the villagers listened to had news in the Tamang language. However, the dialect used did not match the local version and the villagers could not fully understand the content. The villagers also said the programmes on radio were not tailored to address their needs and concerns. The issues of women, especially indigenous women, were rarely covered. The villagers wanted radios to offer more local news and also more information on agriculture and public health in the local language. Radio played an important role in bridging the information gaps in Rasuwa. Over 19 percent of the villagers said radio was very reliable and 52 percent found it \u201csomewhat reliable.\u201d The respondents said coverage of indigenous peoples\u2019 issues was high only on radio. The reason for this could be that radio is the only medium available. 119 See UNESCO Institute for Statistics, http://stats.uis.unesco.org 62 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal Many homes in the field survey site had television sets, DVD players and video cassette players. But television signals from the national broadcaster were not received in the village. It was unclear if women have control and access to the information sources that are available in the household, compared to men. Voice and communications The mass media did not serve the villagers of Thulo Bharku as a platform for communicating their concerns. Their conflicts with the park officials remained more or less unreported and were rarely discussed in the form of letters or listener feedback in newspapers, radio and television. Illiteracy in the local language was high. Only 25 percent of the respondents in Rasuwa said their reading in the local language was \u201cgood\u201d and only 19 percent could write well in the language. Literacy in the national language was much higher compared to the use of mother tongue. The villagers of Thulo Bharkhu did not know any local journalist and had no idea about a journalist\u2019s potential role in amplifying local voices and concerns. The villagers had also not attempted to reach out to the media to seek support for highlighting their demands. Mobile phone ownership was high (97 percent) followed by radio (71 percent) and television (58 percent). VCR/DVD ownership was 65 percent. The villagers found information received on mobile phones \u201cvery useful\u201d but it was used largely for personal communications and not developmental messaging. Information and communication needs and challenges The survey site lacked access to the mass media as well as ICTs. Nepal has been a leader in the community radio movement in South Asia but Rasuwa was one of a few districts that did not have a FM station as of late 2009. Participants at the focus group discussion said they would like to have their own FM radio station because that could help them amplify local concerns. Participants in the focus group discussion said there was very little content about IPs on TV channels that could be received in Dhunche, the district headquarter. They had also noticed that both radio and television only focused on entertainment. The mass media did not cover local issues or challenges. Language was another major barrier to communication. The media did not have programmes or content in their mother tongues and therefore villagers did not pay much attention to the media. One nearby station had programmes in the Tamang language, but the local villagers did not understand it fully. This underlies the key challenges in the promotion and standardization of languages spoken by IPs, which is also a major issue for IPs at the national level. The district received broadcasts from Radio Nepal in Kathmandu and Radio Pratidwani in Makawanpur district. One respondent said, \u201cBoth radios have no programmes related to our local problems. That is why we need a local FM.\u201d She also added that only a local radio could give a voice to their problems and provide them with relevant information.

The district receives about 18 national and international satellite television channels. It can also receive broadcasts from 13 radio stations, including large national broadcasters. Radio Menchayem is the district\u2019s local radio station, which was established in January 2008 (see Box 1). This station has programming in the local language and has been very effective in informing people. It uses a 100-watt transmitter and it reaches 28 of the district\u2019s 32 VDCs and some neighbouring districts.

Over 26 percent of the respondents said information on radio \u201cvery useful\u201d and the majority (45 percent) said radio was \u201csomewhat useful\u201d. Generally, about 60 percent respondents found the information on radio \u201cvery reliable\u201d and \u201csomewhat reliable\u201d. The preference for information on radio also indicates that the programming is relevant and understandable, which could also be due to the use of local language. A few respondents said that the representation of indigenous peoples\u2019 issues on radio was \u201chigh\u201d while a larger number (48 percent) said it was moderate. The district has had newspapers since the mid-1970s but the publications have not been regular or sustainable. The earliest newspapers were handwritten and posted in public places. A weekly has been published in the district since 2003. This weekly, Naba Bihani, is published in Nepali and was the only newspaper available at the time of the study. Efforts had been made to publish Pirimyok, a Limbu language newspaper, but it stopped publication three years ago for financial reasons. Naba Bihani does not reach the village where the survey was conducted. Some villagers said they read Kantipur, a private newspaper published from Kathmandu, when they were visiting the district headquarters. However, they did not mention Gorkhapatra, the government newspaper that has supplements in languages spoken by IPs. Television does not have programming in the local Limbu language. The language programming on national television has only music videos. However, the better quality of TV entertainment programming on Indian channels has resulted in lower viewership for Nepali stations. The villagers said they occasionally watched films in the Limbu language and those that dwelt on their culture and traditions. The villagers also obtained information from informal sources such as teachers and health workers. Face-to-face interactions at the local weekly markets also served as an important source of information. In Nepal\u2019s eastern hills, women seek and obtain information through these interactions with peers while fetching water and firewood and herding cattle. Voice and communication The district is fairly well-connected in terms of telephony. There is a potential for enhancing communication among the Limbu through the use of ICTs. In mid-July 2009, Tehrathum had 771 fixed-line telephones and about 12,000 mobile phones. Nevertheless, broadband Internet connectivity is not available, which explains the low Internet use. There were four Cyber Caf\u00e9s 65 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal in the district, all located in the district headquarters. Generally, ICTs are largely used for personal communications but there are opportunities for extending their use for building awareness of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights as well as for advancing development. The Tehrathum district post office was in the process of setting up a telecentre in mid-August 2009, with telephones, computers and and Internet connection. The head of the post office said the centre could help them raise additional revenue since it had been difficult to cover costs \u201conly by distributing letters and parcels\u201d. The telecentre had not begun operating in August 2009. There were also plans to start providing Internet services from two other post offices in the district. Mobile phone ownership was high but it was not very reliable. Telephones were used only for personal communications. The local radio in Tehrathum had Limbu staff members and also programming in the local language. The station offered programmes to teach the local language and provided programming focused on local issues, including a \u2018lost and found\u2019 section where people could broadcast messages seeking help for locating missing cattle or other personal goods. The radio had also developed some partnerships with local IPOs for supporting programmes on issues affecting IPs. Though the station was generally inclusive of IPs voices, residents at the field research site said that they had not yet had an opportunity to talk \u2018on air\u2019. The presence of Limbu staff members gave some representation of local diversity at the radio station. It provided a mechanism for assuring voices and participation of IPs. The participation of local people has enhanced the coverage of local issues on radio. The station also has a communication mechanism for people to call-in and inform the station about local events and issues (see Box 1).

Also, misrepresentation was one major issue of concern regarding media coverage of IPs issues in Nepal. The challenge is create a sustainable model where community radio can work with IPOs and civil society to ensure diversity both in structure and content. The district has high media exposure whereas literacy rates are not very high. This is a challenge to the indigenous peoples\u2019 ability to access information and use it for participation and communication. The ability to understand media messages is critical for taking informed decisions on issues. For example, the villagers in Tehrathum said they could not fully understand the discussions related to constitution-making in the CA in Kathmandu. There is an opportunity for introducing media literacy programmes in the district to enhance the ability of villagers to interact with the media and actively participate in public discussions. Media literacy programmes can also assist in improving the quality of debate presented in the media. The district has access to a large number of broadcasts. But many of the programmes on these stations are insensitive or ignorant of the rights and issues of IPs. Building awareness of journalists in general can result in more informed coverage of issues related to the IPs. 66 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal Box 1: Radio Menchayem Radio Menchayem is run by a cooperative based in Kathmandu. It has a full-time staff of seven men and four women, including eight Limbus, two Newars and one individual who is not from an indigenous community. It also has 16 volunteers, including eight women. The station broadcasts for 10 hours of which two hours are allotted for programming on IPs, or 14 hours a week. Limbu language programming includes programmes in three dialects: Panchthare, Chathare and Phedape. It also has programmes in Tamang, Sherpa, Magar and Nepali languages. The station seeks programme production support from different IPOs. The Hyugu Paropkar Samaj (Newar), Kirat Yakthum Chumlung, Magar Sangh, Sherpa Sangh, and Tamang Ghedung have actively supported the station. Programmes were produced and hosted by individuals recommended by the IPOs. (There are issues about fairness and professionalism in this model of cooperation because the support could extend to influence. This is a subject for further study.) The station has covered almost all indigenous peoples\u2019 events and the IPOs are pleased with its performance. Among its programmes, Adibasi Sawal (questions about IPs), focuses on indigenous peoples\u2019 issues discussed in the CA. Another programme, Adibasi Awaj, covers issues related to ILO Convention 169. The station announces notices about missing dogs and livestock on sale and also has a \u201clost and found\u201d service of sorts. People who find money or valuables bring it to the studio, which then announces the discovery. Upon claiming the goods, the owners make a small donation to the station. The staff said the station receives about 75 letters every day. It also receives first-hand feedback from people at markets and other community gatherings. Station officials said they have had good feedback on an agriculture-related programme. The major problem faced by the station is a shortage of trained human resources and field equipment (e.g. recorders), which make it difficult to produce more effective programming for IPs. One criticism of the radio station was that it used too many foreign words in the Limbu programme. The station officials said they could not avoid using Nepali words because there were no equivalent phrases in the Limbu language, whose standardization remains a major challenge. There are also differences in the dialects used by the Limbu living in different parts of the eastern hills of Nepal. The station has been fairly sustainable venture. According to the staff, it recovered its operational costs in about 18 months after establishment. It manages to collect about Rs70,000 (US$ 930) in advertising every month, which is enough for paying salaries, after deducting other costs. The station was set up with Rs1.2 million (US$ 60,000).

Both Kailali and Tehrathum had higher access to information sources compared to Rasuwa. Nevertheless, Kailali and Tehrathum also differed in terms of physical access, which was a result of their different geographical locations. By and large, eastern Nepal has greater exposure and access to media compared to the western part of the country. Ironically, Rasuwa district lies in the central region of Nepal, which has the highest concentration of the media, yet it lags behind the two other districts. 67 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal The ability to access information in the media also varies across locations and social groups. This is an outcome of the differences in languages of the indigenous groups, low literacy in the mother tongue and non-availability of information in their local languages. Most of the information is available only in the Nepali language. Literacy in the Nepali language is also low and the levels vary across groups of IPs. Language can determine the relevance of information to specific groups because anything that is not understood by the intended audiences is not useful. At the level of the \u2018information product\u2019, programming formats determine the level of access to information. Generally, the media had very little content on local issues and even less on issues of interest to IPs. The community radio in Tehrathum was more advanced in terms of inclusive programming compared to radios in other districts. Overall, there is a general need for improving content in all three districts. This can be implemented by enhancing representation of the IPs in the media and building local capacity for producing locally relevant programmes. Despite shortcomings, radio was the preferred media in terms of reliability of information. Radio ownership was also high and this suggests that it could be the medium that can provide villagers greatest access to information and voice (see Figure 5). Mobile phone ownership was also high across the three districts. However, the mobile phones are used more for personal communications and not as a primary source of information. Figure 5: Reliability of Information Across Districts (Mean Value from 1=very good to 6=not applicable) 4 4.8 5.2 2.4 3.3 4.3 2.9 4.9 5.7 5.7 Regular Newspaper Weekly Newspaper Magazine Radio Mobile VCR/DVD Computer Internet Telephone Television Source: Field survey. Across the study locations, the villagers relied on traditional local sources to access information. These included the Katuwal or village-criers in Kailali. Other information sources include teachers, health workers and people at the markets and social gatherings. Word-of-mouth and face-to-face meetings were also identified as information sources. Community media hubs such as telecentres could be sources of information to the villagers. Nevertheless, this remains constrained by Internet connectivity and the lack of resources to establish and run the centres. The other challenge is improving the content available for dissemination through the telecentres. Voice and communication Voice and communications can be enhanced when information systems allow interactivity and exchange of different views and opinions. Programme design, content planning and production can determine the extent to which people can engage and participate in discussions in the media. In the study locations that had community radios, there were programme formats that allowed people to discuss issues. The further away people were from a radio station, as in Rasuwa, the more detached they were from media content and how that could affect their lives. 68 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal The field study suggests that an increase in the number of radio stations does not necessarily lead to more inclusive voice and communication related to IPs. Rather, many stations could potentially exacerbate tension and mistrust among different social groups, especially if these radios are co- opted by political parties or other partisan interests. Kailali had a number of radio stations but it did not seem to play a critical role in enhancing voice and communication of IPs and people did not consider it to be the most useful communication platform. In contrast, Tehrathum had only one station, but it stood out in terms of the people\u2019s references to its programming, representation of diverse social groups, and strong focus on local issues and communications. Representation of indigenous peoples in the media Not only are IPs under-represented in Nepal\u2019s media, they are not always properly and positively portrayed. During the assessment respondents from all IPs groups indicated that the lack of or negative coverage of issue related to their group was due to lack of journalists from their ethnic group in media agencies.

Nepal has some media run by IPs, which can contribute towards narrowing the gaps in information and communication, but their outreach is often limited to indigenous peoples only. There is a greater need for capacity building to prepare and place indigenous journalists in the decision-making and management positions of the mainstream media. This could be a more sustainable and effective means to ensure continued, credible. In addition, it is also important to consider the issue of misrepresentation within the fragile context of state building and strong ethno-politics in Nepal. Additional research and analysis is required to understand if the perception of negative coverage by certain journalists is due to mistrust created by ethno-politics or reflects a lack of capacity of the journalists to present objective stories in the media. Both causes would require different sets of media strategies to meaningfully address the issues. Gender Access to information and communications can play a critical role in gender equality and empowerment of women. It is important in societies such as Nepal where patriarchal norms still determine access, voice and participation of women in all spheres of life. The understanding of the gender dimension in Nepal is still constrained by the lack of desegregated data. Observation of proxy indicators across the three field study locations suggest that women, particularly in IPs groups, have much lower literacy and education compared to the national average and that of men. Therefore, they naturally face enormous challenges in accessing information and participating in informed discussions. Generally, media content production is still dominated by men. In addition, it was unclear to what extent women had control over access to information and whether they had equal opportunities to voice their views through existing communication channels. As alternative, women have been using informal channels to seek information through face-to-face communications and discussions with peers, teachers, female community health workers and other women in the markets. Development situation There are significant variations between the districts in the levels of education and literacy, which could be influenced by factors such as geographic location, language and the dynamics of social exclusion. These conditions also influence level of access to information and communications among different social groups. Access to infrastructure and basic services such as electricity was a major factor affecting the choice of the preferred communication mediums. The levels of poverty and economic opportunities in the field research locations also influenced the choice of medium.

Challenges Lower literacy rates, especially in the mother tongues of IPs, remain the most formidable challenge for increasing access to information and communication. In general, the literacy rates of IPs in all survey districts are much lower than the national average, particularly for women when compared to men. Other challenges to effective communications are limited infrastructure and 70 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal basic services such as electricity, roads and education opportunities.123 High levels of poverty limit the purchasing power of residents to buy household communication devices such as televisions, computers and mobile phones and to pay applicable charges or subscribe to regular media products. The communication challenges include under-representation of IPs in the media in terms of ownership, control and content. Opportunities Media and communication can be used for promoting the languages spoken by IPs and as an empowering mechanism at the community level. The relatively high ownership of radios in Nepal provides opportunities to use the medium for help people to gain access to information and communication. The radio station in Tehrathum has attempted to do this and there is room to upgrade the effort using lessons from community radios in other parts of the country. The use of local languages can also contribute towards preserving and promoting indigenous peoples\u2019 languages. There is also an opportunity to support the establishment of a community radio station in Rasuwa district, which currently lacks one, and develop the station as a model that existing stations could learn from in terms of programming for empowerment. Mobile phones are emerging as a medium with promise in terms of reach and affordability, especially as prices continue to fall with more players joining the market. They are also less demanding on electricity supplies. Projects using mobile phones for information and Communication for Empowerment could be piloted, and the lessons could be relevant not only for Nepal but for all countries in the region where mobile telephony is expanding. The capacity building of journalists from indigenous groups can enhance the quality of content in the media. Projects could also train non-IPs for better understanding and reporting on issues related to IPs. Improved content could inform the planning of interventions for addressing the development challenges of IPs. 123 Roads in the Hills and Mountains and even in the plains are in bad condition and can be impassable seasonally as was the case during the study period. 73 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal 4. Analysis of the Findings from the National Overview Study and Field Research 74 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal 4. Analysis of the Findings from the National Overview Study and Field Research Development Situation for Indigenous Nationalities Although official data show progress in human development and poverty outcomes of the IPs, it is clear that there is still much to achieve in terms of education, health, food security, the environment, gender equality, agriculture and livelihoods. From this study, it is evident that improved access to information and increased opportunities for communication are indispensible to the development and empowerment of IPs. Information can be a catalyst for change and empowerment. Access to information and communication opportunities are key to poverty reduction because such access can help to bridge information gaps and help to overcome disempowerment resulting from poor physical access to public services. It also could generate demand for making the delivery of public services more effective. The impact of access to information on service delivery may be most evident in the areas with the least physical access. Poor communications can exacerbate the challenges in addressing the development problems of IPs. This is because development can be effective only when messages are clearly understood within the framework of languages and cultures of the relevant social groups. Given the diversity of languages and cultures in Nepal, this places a huge burden on the development process. Communication mechanism can assist in promoting and reviving local languages. The starting point would be using oral communication channels for disseminating information in local languages. Among the available options in Nepal, local radio stations would be the most effective medium for this purpose. An emerging opportunity includes the use of the mobile phone, which is presently used for personal communications rather than for sharing information related to development. There are increasing opportunities for using mobile technologies for strategic C4E interventions. Communication and Information Needs At the national level, the constitution-making process remains at the heart of the empowerment of IPs in Nepal. In this process, the primary demands of the IPs focus on the right to self- determination and other political rights.

Nevertheless, these development issues are real and need to be addressed in conjunction with the political demands. Therefore, information and communication needs must be addressed at two levels: y Facilitating understanding of information on the process of political transformation and decision-making; and y Improving communications among indigenous groups themselves in order to have more coherent messages to strengthen their positions. In districts and villages, equal access to information and communication opportunities could help ordinary villagers to improve livelihoods by enhancing voice and participation. IPs are under-represented in Nepal\u2019s media. There is a need to improve newsroom diversity in order to bring in voices and increase participation of IPs in communication opportunities. Nepal has media run by IPs that can contribute towards narrowing the information and communication gaps. But there is a greater need for capacity building to prepare and place indigenous journalists in the decision-making and management positions of the mainstream media. This could be a more sustainable and effective means to ensure continued, credible and adequate media coverage of indigenous peoples\u2019 issues, including those related to women. Currently, Nepal officially recognizes 59 groups of IPs. There is an ongoing process to identify and categorize groups that were not included in the earlier classification. Nepal has about 54 IPOs 75 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal and a very strong representative organization. However, there is a need to enhance the ability of IPOs to interact and communicate with the rest of the Nepali society. Low media coverage and misrepresentation of issues affecting IPs make this interaction a challenge. Appropriate Communication Channels for Empowerment, Inclusion and Participation of Indigenous Peoples Radio appears to be the communication medium with the potential to address the needs of all IPs regardless of their economic and social status. Radio content, and content of all mass media for that matter, needs to be planned carefully to take into account the needs of specific groups. Television is the medium of choice in areas that are more accessible and have access to electricity. While being effective, television is also a medium where competition for getting and retaining audiences is intense. Therefore use of television for the empowerment of IPs would require strong community- supported initiatives that are pro-IPs while being professional and credible. The coverage of indigenous peoples\u2019 issues in the media in all communities surveyed varied from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cvery low\u201d. Overcoming this challenge would require efforts to make journalists in the mainstream media aware of issues and concerns of IPs. Greater understanding of the issues by the journalists can result in more and improved coverage. It is necessary to invest in enhancing the capacity of journalists from indigenous communities if they are to be supported to take up jobs in the mainstream media. Mainstream media in non-indigenous languages is likely to have larger audiences, at least until Nepal\u2019s multilingual education efforts produce a new generation of IPs literate in their mother tongues and other members of society begin learning the languages spoken by IPs. A multi-media approach to Communication for Empowerment can help to address immediate as well as longer-term needs of the IPs. Short-term projects can have a developmental role in supporting the revival of indigenous languages and cultures, and information exchange can be more effective in languages that are easily understood by a large number of people. The medium- and long-term efforts should focus on establishing regional media run by IPs in areas where their numbers are high and where people do not have (or have very low access to) existing media. Building the capacity of journalists from indigenous communities to prepare them better to take up mainstream media jobs can be another medium-term activity. The growth of mobile telephony in Nepal is an opportunity that has not received as much attention as it should have from the development community. Some companies have begun group messaging and opinion polling via mobile phones in partnerships with the broadcast media. The existing systems can serve as a platform for initiating information and communication activities for the development and empowerment of IPs. The use of mobile devices can be combined with other ICTs including the Internet once Nepal builds infrastructures to support the growth of Internet and wireless communications. Nepal has a large number of rural telecentres, community learning centres and community media centres but none of these were effective in the field survey locations. Nonetheless, these centres can serve as important nodes or points of contact in the villages. They can be developed and used more effectively in the coming years.

Pilot projects for empowering IPs to use ICTs should start now, to prepare Nepal better to take advantage of the opportunities that the convergence of media, mobile phones and Internet may offer. Communication for Empowerment should focus on establishing and supporting more community- based media initiatives and replicating best practices in indigenous communities. No single model may work for the diverse groups of IPs in Nepal, but there are common problems that have resulted from inadequate communications that can be addressed through community- based initiatives that have been successful elsewhere. 77 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal 5. C4E Recommendations and Proposals for National C4E Interventions 78 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal 5. C4E Recommendations and Proposals for National C4E Interventions Indigenous peoples account for approximately 37 percent of Nepal\u2019s population. With few exceptions, they lag behind others in terms of poverty outcomes and other development indicators. Empirical data indicates that several groups of IPs have even poorer outcomes when compared with other excluded groups. As a collective group, IPs face many development challenges, including access to basic public services and voice and participation in programmes aimed at improving their livelihoods. The national C4E process emphasizes effective communication and access to information as integral parts of democratic governance and sustainable development for poor and excluded groups, particularly the IPs. The existing gaps in access to information and communication channels have limited their voice and participation, leading to wider disparities and inequalities. This study has identified both challenges and opportunities. Opportunities to enhance Communication for Empowerment and development of IPs include Nepal\u2019s efforts to expand democratization by setting up systems that are inclusive, the largely open legal and policy frameworks for media, and the decreasing prices and greater availability of ICTs, among others. The convergence taking place in media and communications technologies may be an opporutnity not only for enhancing information exchange but also for supporting and promoting the revival of indigenous languages. Effective communication systems and channels can also provide development agencies and government with a bridge to extend democratic governance and development to the remotest corners of the country and provide IPs with space to excercise their voice and participate in decisions that affect their livelihoods. Recommendations The recommendations have been generated through analysis of the findings and inputs from the National Stakeholder Consultation in Kathmandu on 19-20 January 2010. Various stakeholders in Nepal, including government officials, policy makers, civil society and IPOs, recognize the need to include IPs and other excluded groups into the discussion in the ongoing constitution- making process and state restructuring. The recommendations place importance on developing and harnessing the media and ICT sector to improve democratic governance and accelerate development progress that is inclusive, transparent and participatory. In this regard, media has a critical role to play in providing information and reflecting different viewpoints to facilitate informed public discussion and bring the voices of IPs into mainstream national development debates and outcomes. Based on the findings from the C4E study and assessment, the proposed recommendations focus on the following priority areas: y Enhancing knowledge of IPs issues; y Building capacity of IPs journalists and media professionals; y Increasing access to information and media; y Strengthening voices and participation of IPs in the media and communication platforms; y Mainstreaming C4E, media and ICTs and the indigenous peoples\u2019 rights into existing development programmes and projects; y Promoting the role of indigenous women in media; y Exchange of experiences and lessons learned on C4E of the IPs. Enhance knowledge of IP issues Insufficient knowledge among the indigenous groups, general public and policy makers on the benefits and challenges of federalism present a major challenge in the current political debate. 79 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal There is a need to promote greater understanding of the demands and claims of the indigenous peoples\u2019 groups to avoid misrepresentation and misinterpretation that could exacerbate tensions in Nepali society. Nepal\u2019s open media and civil society provide an environment for generating and sharing knowledge on federalism and issues related to IPs. Furthermore, the country has ratified ILO Convention 169 and adopted UNDRIP, which help promote social inclusion, voice and participation of IPs. The proposed areas for C4E intervention are to: y Support production and dissemination of knowledge on IPs\u2019 issues, claims and demands for media coverage; y Raise awareness and knowledge of journalists on covering IPs\u2019 issues; y Raise awareness of youth from indigenous communities about the media and encourage them to participate in public discussions on indigenous peoples\u2019 issues in the media through media literacy initiatives; y Support interactive media formats and programmes to encourage greater", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd0d2e1c-0139-4f15-8e6d-c0d129bfe56c": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd0d2e1c-0139-4f15-8e6d-c0d129bfe56c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d94ba27fb9ef8b33f2668f5675727ff7870fd60da19ef5c1d5aa4e909b169a76"}}, "hash": "d94ba27fb9ef8b33f2668f5675727ff7870fd60da19ef5c1d5aa4e909b169a76", "text": "exchanges of views and opinions between IPOs and decision makers or opinion leaders in both mainstream and community media. Building capacity of indigenous journalists and media professionals Nepal has vibrant and diverse media outlets, including print and broadcasting. Nevertheless, low representation of journalists and media professionals from indigenous groups remain one of the key challenges. In addition, journalists from other social groups tend to have limited knowledge about issues related to IPs, resulting in poor reporting and coverage of their issues. Hence, there is a need to enhance capacity of journalists and media professionals from indigenous groups in the following areas: y Support a range of training programmes (including specializations such as investigative and in-depth reporting) for addressing the needs of different media; y Support and promote \u2018citizens journalism\u2019 including the use of New Media by individuals and IPOs; y Support orientation programmes of media professionals to enable them to better understand the realities, rights and issues affecting the IPs. Increasing access to information and media Limited access to information by IPs is a key challenge in making informed choices. At the policy and legislation level, the constitutional guarantee for the Right to Information and Freedom of Expression is an essential basis for implementation. The constitution-making process in Nepal provides an unpredented opportunity to ensure that the new constitution includes these rights. In doing so, there is a need for C4E interventions to: y Support efforts to inform all about these rights for ensuring the enjoyment of the rights by all, including IPs; y Ensure availability of information in the indigenous groups\u2019 languages; y Initiate efforts to make all public information easily available to all citizens, with special efforts to enhance the access of IPs; y Work with the High-Level Commission for IT and the National Information Commission to develop appropriate applications for facilitating information access for IPs in collaboration with IPOs. Strengthening the capacity of the IPOs and the indigenous community in establishing or improving indigenous community media could help overcome challenges to access to information. Priority areas for intervention are to: y Set up pilot indigenous peoples\u2019 media and ICT initiatives at locations that have low media exposure and high populations of IPs; 80 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal y Support existing community media initiatives to improve inclusiveness of the diverse indigenous groups, including programmes in indigenous languages; y Establish partnerships with the private sector and civil society organizations to devise sustainable models of engagement that include the relevant indigenous peoples, and are responsive to their priorities and rights. Strengthening voice and participation of IPs in the media and communication platforms Existing local communication channels, such as community radio stations, can promote voice and participation of IPs in the public discourse at the national and local levels. Indigenous peoples\u2019 issues are inadequately covered and highly politicized, despite the large number of community radio stations in Nepal. In addition, the local radio stations produce relatively little local news and programmes related to IPs. Strengthening existing local media and communication channels and platforms, including radio, to better serve the poor and marginalized, in particular the IPs, can help address these challenges. Recommended areas for intervention are to: y Conduct a strategic review of Nepal\u2019s radio sector to identity areas of intervention to ensure access, voice and participation of marginalized groups; y Develop series of strategic responses based on a community media performance assessment conducted in partnership with media and indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations; y Restructure the operations and management to ensure voices and inclusive community participation, including proportionate representation of IPs at all levels; y Build capacity, including in-house training and coaching of the community media; y Consider setting up model community radio stations for serving marginalized groups, including IPs. Mainstreaming C4E, media and ICTs into existing development programmes and projects Support to media and communications have largely been ad-hoc and preoccupied with advocacy and development messaging rather than development of the media to be a mechanism for inclusive participation. There is a need for media development activities that can help to narrow the existing the gaps in access, voice and participation for IPs and other excluded groups. Mainstreaming C4E, media and ICTs in existing development programmes and projects are equally important. Recommended areas for intervention are to: y Formulate a separate programme in support of C4E of IPs focusing on the role of media and access to information in promoting social inclusion in Nepal; y Assess the potential for establishing a regional mechanism for capacity development and exchanges among IPs groups; y Organize a consortium of donors and a national multistakeholder groups to support media and C4E initiatives;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05da1ffd-4318-4cb4-b796-990d3536f5f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "05da1ffd-4318-4cb4-b796-990d3536f5f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c50ffda9013a93374d9728b650a3ceb3bb03adc1cddf0ebfeff7881d8fff8947"}}, "hash": "c50ffda9013a93374d9728b650a3ceb3bb03adc1cddf0ebfeff7881d8fff8947", "text": "y Identify linkages with other programmes supporting social inclusion, civil society and democratic participation. Strengthening the role of indigenous women in media Indigenous women are the most marginalized and underrepresented in media among IPs. Strengthening women\u2019s movements, especially among indigenous peoples\u2019 groups, can potentially enhance the role of women in media, which could increase the number of women in journalism and management positions in media. Simultaneously, increasing sense of ownership among women of their local media can lead to greater visibility of women and impact on the media. More efforts to identify strategic responses and build capacity of indigenous women in media can be promoted by: 81 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal y Convening the national meeting among indigenous women and women from other marginalized groups to analyze the present situation and identify the reasons for low representation of indigenous women in media; y Building capacity for indigenous women in the media, including training and coaching of women journalists; y Supporting the production of media programmes focusing on indigenous women\u2019s rights and development challenges, and coverage of issues relevant to women\u2019s lives; y Promoting a gender policy for radio stations to ensure the equal participation of women. Exchange of experiences and lessons learned on C4E of IP There is a need to generate knowledge and capture lessons learned on indigenous media and C4E experiences as well as to establish a platform for knowledge exchange on C4E. Proposed areas for C4E of indigenous peoples interventions are to: y Explore potential collaborations with existing regional and national forums and organizations; y Establish a regional knowledge sharing mechanism to enhance knowledge and implementation of the C4E initiatives; y Document issues related to indigenous peoples, their cultures and livelihood outcomes, also in video, for sharing the knowledge and experiences with the larger community and society of IPs; y Set up a mechanism for archiving indigenous knowledge related to C4E. 82 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal Table 8: Priority Areas for C4E Interventions Issues/challenges Opportunities Recommendations Proposed areas for interventions 1.

The first discussion of nine NEFIN Secretariat members included four CA members. The second discussion had 15 CA members. Thirteen IPOs officials/representatives took part in the third discussion organized at the office of KYC. Each session lasted for about three hours. The major subjects for discussion were: y Media/ICT related laws, policies and practices in relation to increasing access to media/ICTs; y Situation of access of IPs to media/ICTs; y Key concerns of IPs about the prospects for development and self-determination; y Prospects for improving media access of IPs for empowerment. Summaries of each discussion was prepared and the conclusions of all discussions were compiled. The main conclusions of three discussions are as follows: 1. The mass media have contributed immensely to the entrenchment and promotion of dominant values and ideas to perpetuate traditional political domination and cultural hegemony, as they are mainly owned by dominant high caste groups. Print media are predominantly under the control of dominant group members. Media bias and stereotyping is rampant. IPs have relatively better access to broadcast media, particularly radio. Radio is used only for entertainment, not for useful information. 2. IPs have limited access to ICTs. Large populations of IPs lack skills and motivation to navigate complex information spaces and thus, the knowledge gap is widening between the digital elites mostly belonging to dominant groups and users of traditional means of communication who are mostly IPs. 3. In general the IPs, except Newar, have no access to ICTs. They have no computers and no knowledge/skills to operate computers. In IPs concentrated areas, there are no network connections to reach, select and process information from various sources. Where there are limited facilities there is no support to impart and enhance skills even for simple applications. 4. The digital divide is large because members of dominant groups have better education, incomes, and connectivity and are capable of manipulating policy for information technology. Widening disparities in new technology use is exacerbating", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95b62aee-52c6-4a4f-9a49-7a12705d1da4": {"__data__": {"id_": "95b62aee-52c6-4a4f-9a49-7a12705d1da4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3364fd554b265d972c6c05711326e42cc4a85f59cc8fff3112adc19f5e56749"}, "3": {"node_id": "49529757-0345-479e-9254-25abfff27a59", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dbc1ad6d85aa2a781c20c96b8ffcf482e26df4446510c2ec116b2dc10282e95e"}}, "hash": "6d22b39866632941dc3d180a419ad00f9f75c0208cd5c567335ab65b81967fae", "text": "existing knowledge disparities and further marginalizing the subordinated peoples. 5. Media content and images are highly influenced by Hindu cultural values and somehow try to justify that dominant groups have ruled through consent rather than coercion. Mainstream media repeatedly present ideas and values of traditionally dominant groups in ways intended to make people feel that they have been working for the benefit and welfare the subordinated groups. 6. Representation of the issues, problems and demands/claims of IPs by mainstream media are prejudiced, fragmented, negative and sometimes damaging. Indigenous claims like right to self-determination, right to self-government, autonomy, collective rights, linguistic rights, special measures/affirmative action have been often presented ambiguously and mostly negatively to shape public opinion against these demands. 7. Media coverage of indigenous issues is extremely limited and only those aspects are covered that are in the interest of dominant groups. Usually the activities of IPs that turn violent are covered. Development concerns of IPs are rarely covered. 99 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal 8. Government, major decision-making institutions and mass media ignore the rights of consultation and participation as ensured by ILO Convention 169 and the right of free, prior, informed consent of indigenous peoples as envisioned by UNDRIP while making decisions that affect them.

Mangal Menyangbo The Communication for Empowerment Project In the context of UNDP\u2019s work on Access to Information, Communication for Empowerment is an approach that puts the information and communication needs of disempowered and marginalized groups at the centre of media support. The approach is rooted in the knowledge that one of the challenges facing developing countries is the lack of inclusion and participa- tion of poor and vulnerable groups in decisions that impact on their lives. Many factors ham- per inclusion, one of these being the lack of available information on issues that shape their lives, and a lack of capacity to communicate their interests into public and policy debate. In 2006, UNDP through the Oslo Governance Centre developed a guidance note on Communication for Empowerment in close cooperation with the Communication for Social Change Consortium. The purpose of this guidance note is to turn the above insights into mainstream planning tools. These tools will in turn facilitate an understanding of the informa- tion and communication needs of the impoverished and marginalized. It is also suggested that Communication for Empowerment Needs Assessments should become a permanent fixture in the national development plans and programs of governments, civil society organisations and international development partners. In Asia, the Communication for Empowerment initiative includes Lao PDR and Nepal. It is im- plemented through the Asia Regional Governance Programme and the Regional Indigenous Peoples Programme of UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok under the regional initiative on Communication for Empowerment of Asia\u2019s Indigenous Peoples. 70 per cent of the estimated 300 million indigenous peoples in the world live in Asia, representing about 5 per cent of the total global population. As a consequence of inadequate access to information and communication channels, indigenous communities have little voice and few mechanisms to fully participate in the decision making process and media generated discussions affecting their lives. This report is part of a series of pilot Needs Assessments in five Least Developed Countries, to be followed by a global synthesis report. The global report will also contain tools for im- plementing Information and Communication Needs Assessments, and it will develop a strategy for incorporating Communication for Empowerment into national planning strategies and development projects. Both the national reports and the global synthesis report are part of a project undertaken by the UNDP Oslo Governance Centre and the Communication for Social Change Consortium, with funding provided by the UN Democracy Fund.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "198f9058-ada0-4d76-87d1-e379755f8375": {"__data__": {"id_": "198f9058-ada0-4d76-87d1-e379755f8375", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30fce080ee44684ff94fdb670e3f2be69df22fc431475de4a3de9167f9869092"}, "3": {"node_id": "acf78c8f-3f6f-4f91-ad09-81e3506b5a5d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e4c549b85274d1653d1c3643021e7f4f4ce831c45d50c8135b463aae77c2c69"}}, "hash": "2d8f00bb0d77f205c8af9bb2263890166f805811df488adfc2002e7f9f9fdd2e", "text": "Copyright \u00a92007 UNDP Pacific Centre USP Library Cataloguing-in-Publication Data Barcham, Manuhuia Corruption in Pacific Island Countries / Manuhuia Barcham. - Suva, Fiji: UNDP Pacific Centre, 2007 75p. ill. ; 23cm.

In few other regions have societal changes over the past two decades been as dramatic and pervasive as in the Pacific region, engulfing significant political, economic, social and technological transformation. However, the lack of economic growth in the face of growing populations has contributed to rising unemployment and hardship in the region. Pervasive poverty among the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) has exerted pressure on available resources, exacerbated rural-urban migration and emigration of skilled labour to other developed countries thereby threatening the viability of their economies. While there has been progress in several countries towards achieving some of the core Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), these improvements are unlikely to achieve agreed targets within the next ten years.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acf78c8f-3f6f-4f91-ad09-81e3506b5a5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "acf78c8f-3f6f-4f91-ad09-81e3506b5a5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30fce080ee44684ff94fdb670e3f2be69df22fc431475de4a3de9167f9869092"}, "2": {"node_id": "198f9058-ada0-4d76-87d1-e379755f8375", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d8f00bb0d77f205c8af9bb2263890166f805811df488adfc2002e7f9f9fdd2e"}}, "hash": "2e4c549b85274d1653d1c3643021e7f4f4ce831c45d50c8135b463aae77c2c69", "text": "It is generally perceived that the lack of significant progress in poverty reduction and improvements in public services have not corresponded to the level of assistance provided.

A recurrent issue that comes out of various surveys and consultations is the complex interrelationships between culture and traditional systems in shaping people\u2019s understanding and perception of corruption and how culture influences corrupt behaviour. The objective of this project was to conduct a study on corruption in Pacific Island Countries (PIC) with the view of highlighting the nature of corruption in the Pacific, its impact on human development, and how culture/ tradition \u2018interacts\u2019 with corruption. By world standards the PICs possess relatively good levels of human development. There is little extreme poverty in the Pacific with famines, for example, being generally unknown. However, economic growth is relatively stagnant in the region and in some areas of the Pacific there is growing social malaise. The Human Development approach is based on a multi-dimensional view of poverty and development. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for work on corruption. Definitions of corruption still tend to be monodimensional. Given that the key idea behind the human development approach is the realization that human beings ought to be entitled to lead the types of lives they wish to lead, one of the key planks upon which the capability approach is built is the right to live one\u2019s life within the norms and values of one\u2019s own culture. As such, we cannot make simple distinctions between \u2018good\u2019 modern governance systems and \u2018corrupt\u2019 traditional systems as, in the Human Development framework, culture is both a key intermediate input to social and economic development as well as a welfare-enhancing developmental outcome itself. This means that in order to approach the issue of corruption within a human development and human rights framework we need to explore the idea that corruption is, at least in part, something dependent upon context. Given these conditions the report utilised the broadly accepted definition of corruption as \u2018the misuse of entrusted power for private gain\u2019 with proviso that confusion may result where individuals and groups occupy a range of roles, and that the power with which they are vested with may come from a number of sources. iv Colonial penetration of the Pacific was not a homogenous process. The small island states of Polynesia and Micronesia were more fully colonised than the countries which comprise modern day Melanesia. This \u2018late contact\u2019 was a function of a number of factors \u2013 the most relevant to our present discussion being the rugged geography and extreme cultural heterogeneity of the region. The result of the various waves of human settlement by Papuan, Austronesian, European and Asian settlers is that the Pacific is comprised of an assortment of overlapping cultural and legislative structures. Rule by successive colonial powers means that some countries legal and administrative structures draw on a number of traditions \u2013 both introduced and local. An important point to note, and something that is directly related to both the pattern of colonisa- tion of the Pacific and the different geographic endowment of the respective countries of the Pacific region, is the differential penetration of state structures in the region. In countries like Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands there is a low degree of state penetration such that the state is unable to exercise effective control over the entirety of the country\u2019s land mass. In practice this means that the provision of state services is, in many aspects, a function of distance from the government capital. This issue is mirrored in some other parts of the Pacific \u2013 more specifically multi-island countries like Kiribati and Cook Islands \u2013 where massive ocean distances separate the various islands that constitute these countries, thereby making service provision a very time and money consuming effort. This gap has traditionally been taken up, in part at least, by non-state actors like the Churches. In terms of anti-corruption activity the weak penetration of the state can play out in a number of ways. The functions of the state may be weak or non-existent in the quality of services provided (such as health and education); weak or non-existent in the quality of regulatory/compliance functions (such as those found in the fisheries and forestry sectors); and weak or non-existent in the context of central oversight functions (such as those found in parliament, audit institutions, and ombuds- man\u2019s offices). Low state penetration means that opportunities are created for corruption to flourish as well as incentives created for corrupt behaviour. This dynamic is especially important from an anti- corruption perspective. A lack of state penetration means that an anti-corruption strategy can not just focus on enhancing the various central oversight functions of a particular country but", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20411d5c-f1c9-496c-a8e2-e92b5c08b209": {"__data__": {"id_": "20411d5c-f1c9-496c-a8e2-e92b5c08b209", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95d001fea4128990f5dea4cf26beef8513ee06fd162f9de128514ee10fd7d77f"}}, "hash": "95d001fea4128990f5dea4cf26beef8513ee06fd162f9de128514ee10fd7d77f", "text": "must also focus on service provision and regulatory/ compliance functions as well. Thus an effective anti- corruption strategy must highlight mainstreaming anti-corruption into these aspects of state function. Additionally, an effective anti-corruption strategy must also address non-state actors who are engaged in these roles (such as the churches and NGOs). Also, it should be noted that if there is limited state penetration, then traditional forms of governance may provide an avenue for playing an effective anti- corruption role. In this respect, as will be discussed in more detail later in the report, tradition and culture are not just a factor relevant to corruption, but potentially an important factor in anti- corruption efforts as well. Corruption in the Pacific, like in many other LDCs, is generally found in certain sectors. In the Pacific these sectors include: \u2022 police \u2022 customs \u2022 land and titles administration \u2022 mineral and petroleum extraction \u2022 forestry \u2022 fisheries \u2022 ports \u2022 health \u2022 education v \u2022 retirement funds \u2022 tendering \u2022 trade in the tokens of sovereignty (passports, internet domain names) \u2022 offshore banking (but not offshore trust funds) \u2022 access to public office Patterns of corruption are not uniform across the Pacific. The key difference in patterns across the Pacific is the corruption that accompanies the large-scale mineral and petroleum extraction industries that operate in Melanesia. The resource-poor countries of Micronesia and Polynesia are, almost by definition, without the problems of large-scale corruption that plague the mineral and petroleum extraction industries in Melanesia. Increasingly, however, fisheries are becoming a site for corruption, and this is a worrying development for the smaller countries of Polynesia and Micronesia. Broadening the definition of corruption in light of the need to rethink the concept in relation to the issue of human development means we need to think again about issues which earlier forms of analysis may not have identified as corrupt. One example in the Pacific is the issue of political participation and its relationship to issues of free-speech. Issues such as the crackdown on pro-democracy leaders in Tonga following rioting the nation\u2019s capital in late 2006 and the detention of opponents of the latest Fijian coup by the Fijian military raise serious questions as to how we define corruption. Is the detention of political opponents a form of corruption? The problem in the Pacific, as for the rest of the world, is that it is difficult to gauge the precise impact that corruption has on other activities. The shadowy nature of corruption, and associated activities such as bribery, means that there is no simple way to collect data on either its prevalence or magnitude. The second issue is that in the Pacific various capacity constraints mean that there are very real gaps in the data available in a number of sectors. And, where data is available its reliability is often questionable. These data problems combined mean that it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable information on either the prevalence or magnitude of corruption. At a very general level though there is general agreement that corruption has a detrimental effect on people\u2019s lives. These negative impacts operate at not only an economic level but also at a social level as well. In terms of poverty alleviation and development corruption has been shown to have various adverse effects. At an international level there appears to be growing support within the Pacific for anti-corruption efforts. A number of international instruments thus help provide a framework for Pacific Island Countries\u2019 anti-corruption efforts including the: UN Anti-Corruption Convention; UN Transnational Organized Crime Convention; ADBOECD Asia Pacific Action Plan; the OECD Anti-Bribery Con- vention; and Financial Action Task Force/Asia-Pacific group on Money Laundering. Combined, these international instruments help provide a highlevel framework upon which effective regional and domestic regulatory and accountability frameworks can be constructed. In addition, at the domestic level many Pacific countries have relatively well developed domestic legislative and policy frameworks for dealing with corruption. The problem is that these frameworks do not appear to be functioning effectively. Part of the answer can also be found in the realisation that the integrity/anti-corruption frameworks and/or programmes present in the Pacific may be inconsistent with the capacity of the organisations that have to implement them. The problem is that these forms of framework are often created without any real sense of the resources required to implement them,thus complicating the affordability of government. In addition, some of these VI frameworks are not a close cultural fit with their environment which can place an even greater drain on the capacity of the organisations in question.

An initial answer discussed in the report would be to look for examples of success in the Pacific and use those to construct models which can then be usefully transferred to other regions and jurisdictions within the Pacific. By utilising examples of structures and processes that have managed to work successfully in a low capacity context in the Pacific you achieve a number of things: help overcome issues of capacity misfit; help overcome issues of cultural misfit (both organisational and societal); and promote local ownership. There are a number of anti-corruption initiatives being carried out in the region. At the bilateral level Australia and New Zealand are particularly active in the region. The USA and the European Union are also active in anti-corruption activities in the region. At the multi-lateral level work is being done by international agencies such as the ADB, OECD, UNDP as well as regional bodies such as Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. Useful work is also being done by a number of regional peak bodies which bring together representatives of the various sectors which play a part in anti-corruption activities including the Oceania Customs Organisation (OCO), the Pacific Immigration Directors\u2019 Conference (PIDC), the South Pacific Chiefs of Police Conference (SPCPC) and the Pacific Islands Law Officers Meeting (PILOM). The Non-Government and Private sectors in the region are also active in anti- corruption activities. One of the most innovative aspects of this study was its focus on culture and corruption. One of the key findings was that as traditional societies in the Pacific possessed traditional accountability structures much could usefully be taken from these older systems in constructing effective anti-corruption programmes in the region. This \u2018taking culture seriously\u2019 approach should not be seen as merely a return to cultural relativist excuses for corrupt activities. Rather it should be seen as an opportunity to utilise the \u2018best of both worlds\u2019 in anti-corruption activity and in doing so help academics and policy -makers understand why some programmes of reform succeed where others fail. In distinguishing how these traditional cultural practices lead to corruption, we need to acknowledge that it is not the practice of say gift-giving itself that is inherently corrupt but rather that the structures of the modern state have provided a source of previously unimaginable power and wealth and so provided opportunities for some elites to exploit these opportunities in pursuit of their own interests. The point to note is that in defining how and when traditional cultural practices such as gift-giving become corrupt there are a number of issues at play, including: intent, scale and the public or private nature of the \u2018gift\u2019. Traditional cultural value systems in the Pacific will not just go away, thus work is required to explore how traditional and modern systems can be used synergistically to provide robust anti-corruption tools and frameworks. Corruption is a problem in the Pacific. It exists in a number of sectors and has a negative impact on human development in the region. While the various countries of the region possess relatively well- developed regulatory and accountability frameworks the effectiveness of these systems in preventing corruption needs to be questioned. A number of issues might be behind this lack of effectiveness. One might be a lack of \u2018fit\u2019 between introduced institutions and practices and local context. Another might be a lack of political will. The key issue though would appear to be a lack of capacity. In short, capacity shortfalls are a key lever behind issues of corruption in the Pacific. They provide not only opportunities for corruption but also inhibit the effective operation of existing anti-corruption policies and programmes. More data is required about why these frameworks and systems are not working. In increasing this capacity we should \u2018take culture seriously\u2019 and not just see it as an excuse for corrupt practices but a valuable resource to be utilised in constructing anti-corruption processes and structures that utilise the \u2018best of both worlds\u2019. VII In conclusion the report argues that less work is required in building more anti-corruption institutions, or in trying to promote drastic political reform such as the construction of strong political parties in the Pacific but rather should be focused on five key areas, these being: \u2022 Find out what is working in the Pacific, identify the critical success factors behind this success and then explore through pilot studies how these models an be successfully transplanted to other parts of the Pacific in order to facilitate learning; \u2022 More work is required exploring how \u2018traditional integrity systems\u2019 work in order to help us understand how traditional and modern systems can be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e7bd0f0-46de-4314-870e-c42092042d48": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e7bd0f0-46de-4314-870e-c42092042d48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff108beaa53cef3dd51315ec6d38f3cc4b7019118421671e090b0212d3b96873"}}, "hash": "ff108beaa53cef3dd51315ec6d38f3cc4b7019118421671e090b0212d3b96873", "text": "used synergistically to provide robust anti-corruption tools and frameworks which can then be trialled through pilot studies; \u2022 Develop programmes of civic education in the Pacific and other nation building measures which can be tied into work educating groups about the impact that corruption has on their everyday lives. \u2022 Look at how regional networks can help reduce the capacity load on individual countries\u2019 anti- corruption institutions \u2022 Work with national governments, in a regional framework, to improve data gathering within countries and so improve monitoring abilities within the region VIII I. Introduction Background The small island developing states of the Pacific face a set of particularly demanding development challenges in their limited geographical size, dependence on narrow resource bases, limited international trade opportunities, distance from major capital and goods markets, coupled with their particular vulnerability to natural and environmental disasters. In few other regions have societal changes over the past two decades been as dramatic and pervasive as in the Pacific region, engulfing significant political, economic, social and technological transformation. However, the lack of economic growth in the face of growing populations has contributed to rising unemployment and hardship in the region. Pervasive poverty among the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) has exerted pressure on available resources, exacerbated rural-urban migration and emigration of skilled labour to other developed countries thereby threatening the viability of their economies. While there has been progress in several countries towards achieving some of the core Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), these improvements are unlikely to achieve agreed targets within the next ten years. It is generally perceived that the lack of significant progress in poverty reduction and improvements in public services have not corresponded to the level of assistance provided. One of the major reasons is poor governance exacerbated by the effects of civil conflicts and political instability in some of the PICs (e.g Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tonga and Vanuatu). Corruption, due to a lack of and/or weak transparency and accountability is often cited as one of the key reasons for poor governance. The most recent survey on the national integrity systems of PIC conducted by Transparency International in 2004 found that national accountability institutions are generally ineffective in addressing corruption. A recurrent issue that comes out of various surveys and consultations is the complex interrelationships between culture and traditional systems in shaping people\u2019s under- standing and perception of corruption and how culture influences corrupt behaviour. Objectives of the Study The objective of this project was to conduct a study on corruption in Pacific Island Countries (PIC) with the view of highlighting the nature of corruption in the Pacific, its impact on human development, and how culture/tradition \u2018interacts\u2019 with corruption. The specific objectives of the study were as follows: 1. Describe the nature of corruption as it relates to public perceptions of, and citizens understanding of corruption, and the magnitude of corruption; 2. Describe previous and on-going efforts and initiatives by governments and other stakeholders (including civil society) to fight corruption; 3 Transparency International, National Integrity Systems \u2013 Pacific Islands, 2004.

Describe and analyse the link between culture or tradition and corruption and how this impacts on human development; and 4. Suggest possible entry points for advancing anti-corruption efforts in particular i.e., aspects of culture and tradition as possible entry points to be taken into account in the design and implementation of initiatives aimed at improving transparency and accountability in PICs. Methodological Discussion The research for this project was conducted utilising a mixture of primary and secondary data. More emphasis was placed on secondary data, as the key focus of this research project was both exploratory and integrative. Given the Pacific focus of the work, the research process concentrated on outputs from the region. In the research process the collections at a number of regional libraries were consulted, including the collections at: Auckland University, Massey University, Victoria University, New Zealand National Library and the library of the University of the South Pacific. In addition, general research data-bases such as the Social Science Citation Index were accessed and a number of regional data- bases, including: Index New Zealand (INNZ), Hawaii Pacific Journal Index, Newz Text Plus, and Newzindex. In the research process a number of regional newspapers were also consulted including: Samoa News, Cook Islands Herald, Cook Island News, Niuean, Samoa Observer, Tonga", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d48bfea3-d2d7-41f6-bca8-7c2a14dbf92e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d48bfea3-d2d7-41f6-bca8-7c2a14dbf92e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "466b5cfdb8380756ab0607c2d00363fd65911ad60eeac947c7f8fd5615db19df"}}, "hash": "466b5cfdb8380756ab0607c2d00363fd65911ad60eeac947c7f8fd5615db19df", "text": "Star, Matangi Tonga, Taimi Tonga, Fiji Daily Post, Fiji Sun, Fiji Times, National, Post Courier, Solomon Star and the Vanuatu Daily Post. Finally, along with the data drawn from printed material, knowledge obtained from a number of key individuals with expertise in anti-corruption efforts in the Pacific was also utilised in the construction of this report. Structure of the Report The report utilises the following structure. Section One provides an overview of the background to the report and the methodologies used in its writing. Section One also provides an overview of human development in the Pacific as well as a discussion of the relationship between human development and corruption. Section Two provides an overview of the history, politics and culture of the Pacific Island Cultures. Section Three looks at the issue of corruption in the Pacific, looking at the sectors where it is present and the forms of corruption that occur in the region before moving on to a discussion of the impacts of corruption. This section also looks at anti-corruption efforts in the Pacific with a particular focus on the efforts of bi-lateral and multilateral actors. The section ends by exploring the work being done by regional bodies and non-government organisations. Section Four looks at the interrelationship between culture and corruption in light of the human development approach. Section Five then provides a conclusion and summary of possible areas for concrete action. Overview of Development in the Pacific One of the most influential shifts in developmental thinking in the last thirty years has been the emergence of the concept of human development. Drawing on the working of influential theorists such as Amartya Sen, the human development approach became a mainstay of UNDP work with the establishment of the Human Development Report series in 1990 under the leadership of Mahbub El Haq. In his own words he argued that: \u201cthe basic purpose of development is to enlarge people's choices. In principle, these choices can be infinite and can change over time. People often value achievements that do not show up at all, or not immediately, in income or growth figures: greater access to knowledge, better nutrition and health services, more secure livelihoods, security against crime and physical violence, satisfying leisure hours, political and cultural freedoms and sense of participation in community activities. The objective of development is to create an enabling environment for people to enjoy long, healthy and creative lives.\u201d5 5 El Haq, Mahbub, nd, Human Development: what is it accessed on Wednesday 13 June 2007 at 7:11am at http://hdr.undp.org/hd/ 2 \u201cdiverse as these rights are, they share the characteristic of entailing some entitlements to help from others in defence of one\u2019s substantive freedoms. The claim to help may involve a demand for positive support and facilitation, or take only the negative form of assurance that there will be no hindrance from others. But all of these claims are aimed at securing the freedoms of the persons involved\u2014to do this or be that\u2014in one way or another. In this way, human rights are also ultimately grounded in the importance of freedoms for human lives.\u201d 6 For his most clear cut argument along these lines see Amartya Sen, (1999) Development as Freedom (Oxford: Oxford University Press). 7 UNDP, (2000) Human rights and human development (New York: Oxford University Press), p. 19. 8 UNDP, (2000) Human rights and human development (New York: Oxford University Press), p. 20.3 9 It should be noted that only the following seven Pacific Island Countries (excluding Australia and New Zealand) are included in the annual Human Development reports: Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu. The figures in the table below are taken from the forthcoming Pacific Human Development report. The point to note is that in this forthcoming publication Solomon Islands now has the lowest level o human development. Building on the general shift in development thought in the preceding twenty years, this new approach was based on the belief that while economic growth was still a valid developmental goal there were other developmental goals that were equally worthy of being pursued. This shift in thinking occurred as part of a broader movement in development thought away from focusing purely on economic growth and instead focusing in alleviating poverty. Drawing on Sen, human development can be seen as the promotion of capabilities. Capabilities include basic freedoms such as being able to meet one\u2019s bodily requirements or the enabling opportunities provided by schooling. They also include social freedoms \u201csuch as the capability to participate in the life of the community...[or] to participate in political decision-making.\u201d The notion of capabilities is intricately", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0716f66d-8c4e-4c04-a36a-c45f8a0dfc53": {"__data__": {"id_": "0716f66d-8c4e-4c04-a36a-c45f8a0dfc53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ef05246e1172b5ae41d2fa4d21537999b64ab19f1ad5cdfe0858fdbc55e00a6"}, "3": {"node_id": "26f1a8de-9c69-4588-90f2-ac5e70864c6a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8112b47306f6540fd7c2963f68ad5df5faf35eca937ebe147192f1b8b0a950f2"}}, "hash": "0878c97421d5521b27f964c38d990f3e2bbda34c8c56ec2905750ba83da41b64", "text": "connected to the idea of freedom \u2013 the freedom to pursue the type of life one wishes to pursue. This notion of freedom is itself linked to the concept of human rights. While human rights always involve a claim that one person has over others (be they another individual or a group), these rights can take a number of different forms but: The human development framework is thus connected in a number of ways to the human rights- based approach (HRBA) to development. In the human rights-based approach, corruption would be viewed as a leading to and undermining the enjoyment of human rights such the right to education, the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to water, etc. Human Development in the Pacific Each year\u2019s Human Development Report publishes the human development index (HDI), an index that looks beyond GDP to a broader definition of well-being. The HDI provides a composite measure of three dimensions of human development: \u2022 living a long and healthy life (measured by life expectancy); \u2022 being educated (measured by adult literacy and enrolment at the primary, secondary and tertiary level); and \u2022 having a decent standard of living (measured by purchasing power parity (PPP) income). In the 2006 Human Development Index the highest ranked Pacific Island country was Tonga which ranked 55 th and the lowest was Papua New Guinea which ranked 139th out of 177 . In their annual ranking process this means that one PIC, Tonga, is categorised as having High Human Development while the remainder of the PICs are all included in the Medium Human Development band. No PICs were identified in 2006 as having Low Human Development. 6 8 7 9 3 10 There are occasional instances of famine in places like the Highlands of Papua New Guinea. 11 Examples include the pro-democracy riots in Tonga in late 2006, the latest coup in Fiji in 2006 and the violence associated with the upcoming 2007 elections in Papua New Guinea. 12 Hindess, Barry, (2007) Introduction (Edited Book Manuscript \u2013 \u2018Corruption: Expanding the Focus\u2019). 13 See Francis Hutchinson, (2005) \u201cA review of donor agency approaches to anti-corruption\u201d Asia Pacific School of Economics and Government \u2013 Policy and Governance Discussion Paper No. 05-03, Canberra. A quick analysis shows that by world standards the PICs possess relatively good levels of human development (see Table 1). There is little extreme poverty in the Pacific with famines, for example, being generally unknown. However, economic growth is relatively stagnant in the region and in some areas of the Pacific there is growing social malaise. Human Development and Corruption One of the results of this shift in the re-conceptualisation of poverty and development is that the Human Development Reports utilise a broad range of indices in their measurement of development. And so, rather than development being measured in purely economic terms other indices such as child mortality, literacy and life expectancy are increasingly utilised to give a multi-dimensional view of poverty and development. While this broadening of focus was useful in many respects, in some respects this new goal may itself be problematic as what it is that constitutes poverty (apart from in its more extreme forms) and its relationship to capabilities is itself a question for debate. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for work on corruption. Definitions of corruption still tend to be mono- dimensional. In general, corruption is primarily seen as being an economic issue, both in its content (the exchange of money for favours) and in its most important effects (on economic growth, development,etc). In categorising corruption, academics and policy-makers have utilised a number of techniques with distinctions being made according to its scale, its location, or its prevalence.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26f1a8de-9c69-4588-90f2-ac5e70864c6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "26f1a8de-9c69-4588-90f2-ac5e70864c6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ef05246e1172b5ae41d2fa4d21537999b64ab19f1ad5cdfe0858fdbc55e00a6"}, "2": {"node_id": "0716f66d-8c4e-4c04-a36a-c45f8a0dfc53", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0878c97421d5521b27f964c38d990f3e2bbda34c8c56ec2905750ba83da41b64"}}, "hash": "8112b47306f6540fd7c2963f68ad5df5faf35eca937ebe147192f1b8b0a950f2", "text": "Common distinctions include those between: Cook Islands 0.77 0.95 0.65 0.822 2 0.789 1 Palau 0.73 0.92 0.68 0.861 1 0.774 2 Niue 0.75 0.91 0.57 0.774 3 0.741 3 Samoa 0.80 0.94 0.45 0.590 7 0.731 4 Tonga 0.76 0.95 0.44 0.647 6 0.718 5 Tokelau 0.75 0.92 0.37 NA NA 0.679 6 Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) 0.70 0.84 0.50 0.569 9 0.678 7 Fiji 0.69 0.85 0.46 0.667 8 Marshall Islands 0.71 0.88 0.40 0.665 9 Tuvalu 0.64 0.94 0.38 0.653 10 Nauru 0.51 0.86 0.59 0.652 11 Kiribati 0.65 0.88 0.24 0.592 12 Vanuatu 0.71 0.76 0.30 0.586 13 Papua New Guinea 0.49 0.50 0.25 0.414 14 Solomon Islands 0.60 0.63 0.00 0.410 15 Table 1: The Human Development Index for Pacific Island countries: Comparative values and rankings for 1998 and 2006 Country Education index GDP index HDI value 1998 1998 HDI Rank", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a31fc91-634c-464d-965c-e8224a79ac03": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a31fc91-634c-464d-965c-e8224a79ac03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "710783bbae47ecbb5feb3312555594464be805afdc56c980c51ad099d1bb8dad"}, "3": {"node_id": "dff22cba-cd72-4b80-a148-909fdb04b9ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "144c18b349ab150534a9f4206caa555d32e440ee786da96a4f8720704089b5f7"}}, "hash": "83ca592c55d508259007bc2b8e45d258c44e08317cf41729a7fc318cc0017e9e", "text": "HDI value 2006 2006 HD Rank Life expectancy index Sources: Life expectancy: SPC Population/Demography Programme population census data, available at: www.spc.int/demog.

Philp\u2019s definitional work is helpful to those wanting to demonstrate a linkage between corruption and human development in that it shows how these monodimensional views of corruption are becoming increasingly inappropriate in light of our broadening views of what constitutes the goal of development. For one, these forms of definition are predicated on a clear distinction between the public and private spheres. If this distinction is not clearly made then this form of definition looses its analytical edge. And so, \u201cfrom an anthropological point of view, this [form of] definition is too restrictive as it does not fully capture how people in a particular context determine what is a corrupt practice and what is not\u201d . \u2022 \u2018petty\u2019 and \u2018grand\u2019 corruption ; \u2022 \u2018bureaucratic\u2019 and \u2018political\u2019 corruption ; \u2022 \u2018state capture\u2019 and \u2018administrative corruption\u2019 , and \u2022 \u2018isolated\u2019 and \u2018systemic\u2019 corruption. All these distinctions have one thing in common in that they are all seen as involving a blurring of the distinction between the public and private spheres. While certain government acts such as the Solomon Islands Leadership Code (Further Provisions) Act (1999) contain provisions to clearly delineate the public and private responsibilities of individual leaders, the problem in the Pacific is that community perceptions of corruption by leaders rarely distinguish between the public and private realms. Realisation of the problems of this blurring then helps us understand two of the most commonly cited definitions of corruption as either the \u2018abuse of public power for private gain\u2019 or \u2018the misuse of entrusted power for private gain.\u2019 But, as Mark Philp has recently pointed out, these distinctions fail \u201cto distinguish corruption from other types of malfeasance, such as out- right theft or misappropriation. \u201d Philp argues that despite various definitional ambiguities: 14 NORAD, (2000) NORAD's Good Governance and Anti-Corruption Action Plan 2000-2001 (Oslo: NORAD), p. 8. 15 Morgan, A.L., (1998) Corruption: Causes, Consequences, and Policy Implications: A Literature Review (Washington DC, The Asia Foundation), p. 15. 16 World Bank.

The case of passport selling where the country itself may benefit from the proceeds of the corrupt transaction push the bounds of what we mean by the term private. However, we can still retain this definition when we see that only certain aspects of the government of the country in question might gain from the sale of passports. Given that the key idea behind the human development approach is the realization that human beings ought to be entitled to lead the types of lives they wish to lead, one of the key planks upon which the capability approach is built is the right to live one\u2019s life within the norms and values of one\u2019s own culture. As such, we cannot make simple distinctions between \u2018good\u2019 modern governance systems and \u2018corrupt\u2019 traditional systems as, in the Human Development framework, culture is both a key intermediate input to social and economic development as well as a welfare-enhancing developmental outcome itself. This means that in order to approach the issue of corruption with- in a human development and human rights framework we need to explore the idea that corruption is, at least in part, something dependent upon context. For, as Sissener points out, \u2018people\u2019s own asse- ssments of courses of action do not ar[i]se from a set of culturally universal, invariable norms that helps to decide if certain actions are to be classified as \u201ccorrupt\u201d or not. Rather, what is seen as corruption varies from one context to another. Given such variations, explorations of how the actors themselves evaluate social practices are required.\u201d Returning to Philp, there is much to be taken from the idea that despite all the definitional disputes there is a hard conceptual core to corruption, possibly based around the idea of public office as some- thing other than an opportunity for private or sectional gain. However, we need to take seriously the view that this core is fleshed out in any given context by local norms and judgments and practices. In doing this we are not providing a device whereby corruption is excused because of culture. Rather, we are instead merely taking the more nuanced approach that what constitutes corruption is itself, at least in part, defined differently by different cultures. As to impose external ideas of what constitutes corruption is to return to older modernisation style development ideas wherein development was seen as achieving the economic development of the West. Instead, in the more nuanced Human Development approach we must take seriously the various developmental goals that different groups see as being worthy of pursuing as well as the different conceptual frameworks that underpin those approaches. Good governance and the accompanying goal of reduced levels of corruption are both positively linked with Human Development, as the ability for human beings to lead the type of life they wish to live, which is at the core of the Human Development approach, is something which is intricately connected to the proper functioning of a country\u2019s institutions. Given these conditions we can come up with a working definition of corruption within a human development approach. We can still usefully utilise the broadly accepted definition of corruption as \u2018the misuse of entrusted power for private gain\u2019 with the realisation that confusion may result where individuals and groups occupy a range of roles, and that the power with which they are vested with may come from a number of sources. We need to realise though that these conflicting roles, be they traditional, cultural, modern or otherwise, cannot be easily divided. The occupying of various roles and responsibilities by public officials occurs in all countries. The question that needs to be asked 25 26 27 6 28 Elise Huffer and Ropate Qalo, (2004) \u201cHave we been thinking upside-dwn?: the contemporary emergence of Pacific theoretical thought\u201d The Contemporary Pacific 16, 1: 87-116. though is how, and why, do these roles come into conflict. Is it a result of lack of opportunity for achieving a benefit through appropriate channels, or conversely the creation of opportunities for achieving a benefit through inappropriate channels? Is it instead a reflection of incentives \u2013 the incentive for acting in a particular way and not in another? Or is it more simply a matter of two roles having conflicting duties?

It should be noted that the key issues here are often those of intent and scale as well as the public or private nature of the \u2018gift\u2019. The other issue of note in our discussion of corruption and its relationship to human development is the issue of ethics and values. The \u2018flip side of the coin\u2019 of anti-corruption activities is thus the promotion of personal and organisational integrity. While there is no room in this report for a sustained discussion of the role of ethics and values in anti-corruption activity it should at least be noted that this is an option in terms of the various levers available to governments, communities and individuals in order to enact change. With this in mind in the Pacific context Elise Huffer and Ropate Qalo have thus called for the development of a Pacific Political Ethics. Looking more deeply at the values which drive individuals and groups in the Pacific we may be able to discern more clearly the various motivating factors leading to individuals and groups performance of corrupt activities and so too come up with ways to promote local solutions through the empowerment of local values. This section of the report has discussed the concept of human development and human rights and presented a brief rundown of the status of human development in the Pacific. This section has also provided a discussion of the relationship between human development and corruption and the problems we may run into with too narrow a definition of corruption. It also considered some of the issues that arise when we talk about linkages between the issues of culture and corruption as in the human development approach culture is both a key intermediate input to social and economic development as well as a welfare-enhancing developmental outcome itself. Finally, the section ended with a discussion of how we can still usefully retain the definition of corruption as \u2018the misuse of entrusted power for private gain\u2019 as long as a number of provisos are made. 28 7 II. Overview of History, Politics and Culture of PICs Initial Settlement Human settlement of the Pacific first occurred 60,000 years ago as people began to migrate to what is now modern day Papua New Guinea . This first wave of migration by Papuan language speakers led to the settlement of what now constitutes the modern states and territories of Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia. Here these groups developed advanced agricultural and farming systems as well as intricate systems of commodity production and exchange. Possibly due to the rugged geography of these islands these initial migrants became extremely linguistically heterogeneous. To this day this area constitutes the region with the highest degree of linguistic and cultural heterogeneity in the world. Modern day Vanuatu with a population of just over 200,000 people has over 100 different indigenous languages as well as the three lingua franca of English, French and Bislama. These linguistic/cultural groups range in size from groups such as Engans in the highlands of Papua New Guinea who have over 180,000 speakers of Engan through to groups such as the inhabitants of Wutung in Sundaun Province in Papua New Guinea who have less than a thousand speakers of their language. Some 50,000 years later a second wave of migration into the Pacific occurred. Starting from present day Taiwan in about 5000 BCE this second wave of Austronesian-speaking migrants gradually moved down through the Philippines group along the edges of Papua New Guinea and the other areas originally settled by Papuan peoples before moving out in the Pacific Ocean proper. From here these migrants moved North and East. The islands of central Polynesia (Fiji, Tonga and Samoa) were settled by 3000 BCE with New Zealand being the last major land mass to be settled in the Pacific in about 1200 CE. Early European explorers of the Pacific grouped the people that they found into three broad linguistic/cultural areas: Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia (see Fig. 1). These broad cultural areas, while now often dismissed by Pacific scholars do hold some analytic utility for our discussion especially in terms of the broad distinction between the geographic ruggedness, cultural heterogeneity and resource-rich nature of Melanesia and the relative cultural homogeneity and small island-based geography with an accompanying lack of any large land based resource deposits which is typical of Polynesia and Micronesia. 29 See Patrick Kirch, (2000) On the Road of the Winds: An Archaeological History of the Pacific Islands Before", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c8deba8-ceda-4ee2-b9e1-2898d247009d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c8deba8-ceda-4ee2-b9e1-2898d247009d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2bce8e7f733b48e0a77e0c1562ebd5dd9bf539354a5c772fac7b4e5b3e943c4"}, "3": {"node_id": "939314ad-2840-4c1f-b326-b435edcc6992", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62303a7a9c4445a82e87afa8e5ea3bc863db3b676f5c179005eb90e669b1ece5"}}, "hash": "2dedc0e7e2a7b4f98700ea8e0653b06f49f4e91106e34321ff07a1cc978b7a06", "text": "European Contact (Berkeley: University of California Press 30 http://www.adb.org/Vanuatu/country-info.asp 31 http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=enq 32 Serge Tcherk\u00e9zoff, (2003) \u201cA long an unfortunate voyage towards the \u2018invention\u2019 of the Melanesia/Polynesia distinction 1595-1832\u201d The Journal of Pacific History 38, 2: 175-196. The countries of Melanesia are typified by the darker skin colouring of their inhabitants (hence the prefix Mela-) as well as the high degree of heterogeneity of the cultures found within this region. While some Melanesian cultures traditionally operated under hierarchical forms of social organisation, as a region it is best known for its social egalitarianism with social rank not being ascribed by birth. Melanesia includes: Fiji; New Caledonia; Papua New Guinea; Solomon Islands; and Vanuatu. Fiji is sometimes seen as being part of Polynesia. Micronesia obtained its name due to the extreme smallness of the islands found in this region of the Pacific (hence the prefix Micro-). Micronesian cultures are traditionally organised along hierarchical lines under the rule of chiefs. Micronesia includes: Federated States of Micronesia; Guam; Kiribati; Marshall Islands; Nauru; Northern Mariana Islands; and Palau. Polynesia was given its name due to the number of islands found within this region (hence the prefix Poly-). Traditionally Polynesian societies are relatively stratified and operate under hierarchical forms of leadership. Polynesia includes:American Samoa; Cook Islands; French Polynesia; Hawaii; New Zealand; Niue; Pitcairn; Samoa; Tokelau; Tonga; Tuvalu; and Wallis and Futuna. 29 31 30 32 8 33 These agricultural and manufacturing industries, while relatively well-developed in a number of these countries, are still heavily dependent on protective structures such as those found in the former Lom\u00e9 Agreements and current EU-ACP arrangements. 34 It should be noted that Japan too had colonial interests in the Pacific \u2013 specifically in a number of states in Micronesia. The geographic endowment of these respective regions means that Melanesian countries, such as Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu thus rely heavily on resources extraction (including forestry) industries to provide jobs and economic development. Polynesian and Micronesian countries in contrast rely much more heavily on service industries, such as tourism in Fiji and Samoa, or niche marketing of export goods, such as Black Pearls in Cook Islands, in the provision of jobs and economic development. The only real exceptions to this are fisheries \u2013 which provide a substantial contribution to the economy of many Pacific Island countries \u2013 and the various manufacturing and agricultural industries found in the larger island groups such as Fiji. European Settlement Like the settlement of the Pacific by the earlier Papuan and Austronesian migrants later European settlers also came in waves. The first to enter the Pacific were Spanish, Dutch and Portuguese traders and explorers in the sixteenth century. These early explorers were followed in the eighteenth century by other European groups, notably British and French whalers and settlers, although Russian and German, and later American, ships regularly traversed the Pacific. The nineteenth century witnessed the beginning of a scramble for colonies in the Pacific and by the end of the century almost all the Pacific had been divided up between European and American powers.

Colonial penetration of the Pacific was not a homogenous process. The small island states of Polynesia and Micronesia were more fully colonised than the countries which comprise modern day Melanesia. So, while all of modern day Papua New Guinea was claimed by one or other European power by the close of the nineteenth century, effective control of that country was not achieved until the mid- twentieth century. Indeed, the oldest inhabitants in the highlands of Papua New Guinea have a living memory of European contact. This \u2018late contact\u2019 was a function of a number of factors \u2013 the most relevant to our present discussion being the rugged geography and extreme cultural heterogeneity of the region. Only with the advent of flight were large sections of countries like Papua New Guinea able to be easily explored. Indeed, largescale mineral extraction in Melanesia has occurred largely in the wake of the introduction of the helicopter. This legacy of later colonial penetration and rugged geography means that service delivery to the more remote parts of Melanesia remains challenging to this day. These later waves of European settlement also attracted settlers from other regions of the globe including Asia. From almost as soon as permanent European settlement was established in many of these Pacific territories, Asian traders began to ply their trade. This influx of Asian settlers has had a long-term effect on a number of Pacific Island countries. Notably, almost half of Fiji\u2019s popu- lation is of Indian descent. These are the descendants of indentured labourers brought over from the sub-continent to work the Fiji\u2019s sugar plantations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. So too, Chinese ethnic minorities still play a major role in the private sector of many Pacific Island countries. This migration continues to the present day and large numbers of immigrants from Mainland China are now entering the Pacific. This influx of new Chinese immigrants is causing tensions in a number of Pacific Island countries as large numbers appear to be entering illegally and these \u2018new\u2019 Mandarin-speaking Chinese immigrant populations run up against the older, and often Canton-esespeaking Chinese minorities which are already established in these countries. The result of these various waves of human settlement by Papuan, Austronesian, European and Asian settlers is that the Pacific is comprised of an assortment of overlapping cultural and legislative structures. Rule by successive colonial powers means that some countries legal and administrative structures draw on a number of traditions. A specific example is the modern state of Vanuatu which was jointly ruled by both the British and French and so has a legal system which draws on both a Common law and Roman law heritage as well as the various aspects of customary society that have been incorporated in the country\u2019s modern legal and administrative systems. The wave of decolonisation that swept the globe in the wake of World War Two was late coming to the Pacific. The first Pacific Island country to become independent was Samoa in 1962. And, while 35 36 10 the majority of Pacific Island countries obtained their formal independence in the following decades, a number of Pacific territories still remain the colonial dominions of regional powers such as New Zealand and Australia. In becoming independent the majority of Pacific Island countries, like other newly independent states across Asia and Africa, adopted one of two general forms of government, these being either the Westminster or Presidential systems. Each of these systems was modified in their adoption, however, such that no real example of either a pure Westminster or Presidential system currently exists in the Pacific. In addition, during the decolonisation process a number of customary elements were often included in the newly independent countries\u2019 constitutions and/or administrative structures such as the inclusion of Upper Houses composed of traditional chiefly leaders.

Fig. 2: Pacific political jurisdictions Source: Larmour (2006: 19) 11 An important point to note, and something that is directly related to both the pattern of colonisation of the Pacific and the different geographic endowment of the respective countries of the Pacific region, is the differential penetration of state structures in the region. Countries like Samoa have a degree of state penetration similar to that in Western countries, in that the government is able to exercise effective control over the entire country. In countries like Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands there is a low degree of state penetration such that the state is unable to exercise effective control over the entirety of the country\u2019s land mass. In practice this means that the provision of state services is, in many aspects, a function of distance from the government capital. Many parts of remote highland Papua New Guinea or Western Solomon Islands receive very little in the way of service delivery from central or provincial government. This issue is mirrored in some other parts of the Pacific \u2013 more specifically multi-island countries like Kiribati and Cook Islands \u2013 where massive ocean distances separate the various islands that constitute these countries, thereby making service provision a very time and money consuming effort. This gap has traditionally been taken up, in part at least, by non- state actors like the Churches. These problems are further compounded by a lack of infrastructure, physical and human capital. In recent years these issues have become even more pressing due to problems of corruption. In terms of anti-corruption activity the weak penetration of the state can play out in a number of ways. The functions of the state may be weak or non-existent in the quality of services provided (such as health and education); weak or non-existent in the quality of regulatory/compliance functions (such as those found in the fisheries and forestry sectors); and weak or non-existent in the context of central oversight functions (such as those found in parliament, audit institutions, and ombudsman\u2019s offices). Low state penetration means that opportunities are created for corruption to flourish as well as incentives created for corrupt behaviour. This dynamic is especially important from an anti- corruption perspective. A lack of state penetration means that an anti-corruption strategy can not just focus on enhancing the various central oversight functions of a particular country but must also focus on service provision and regulatory/ compliance functions as well. Thus an effective anti- corruption strategy must highlight mainstreaming anti-corruption into these aspects of state function. Additionally, an effective anti-corruption strategy must also address non-state actors who are engaged in these roles (such as the churches and NGOs). Also, it should be noted that if there is limited state penetration, then traditional forms of governance may provide an avenue for playing an effective anti- corruption role. In this respect, as will be discussed in more detail later in the report, tradition and culture are not just a factor relevant to corruption,but potentially an important factor in anti-corruption efforts as well. This section has provided a brief overview of the history, politics and culture of the Pacific Island countries. The various waves of human settlement by Papuan, Austronesian, European and Asian settlers means that the Pacific is comprised of an assortment of overlapping cultural and legislative structures. A history of diverse patterns of colonisation of the Pacific, various levels of cultural homogeneity and the different geographic endowment of the respective countries in the region have led to a differential penetration of state structures in the region. In combination, these factors mean that despite its low total population numbers the Pacific region is one of great diversity. 38 Barcham, Manuhuia, (2005) \u201cConflict, Violence and Development in the Southwest Pacific: Taking the Indigenous Context Seriously\u201d Centre for Indigenous Governance and Development Working Paper Series No. 4/2005, Palmerston North. 39 For a discussion of how some of these issues can be overcome through participator reform processes see Manuhuia Barcham, (2007) \u201cParticipation in Practice: Participation, Consensus and Cooperation in the Achievement of Economic Reform in the Cook Islands\u201d Centre for Indigenous Governance and Development Working Paper Series No. 1/2007, Palmerston North. 40 For more on this in the Pacific context and a discussion of how some of these problems might be overcome see Manuhuia Barcham, (2006) \u201cNew Public Management and the Alternative Service Delivery Decision Framework: Matching Structure to Context\u201d Development Bulletin 70:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e1fb38b-5cd3-4f1b-9c32-303e1e6b8ea8": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e1fb38b-5cd3-4f1b-9c32-303e1e6b8ea8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebe38225d71a747ffd7c5a6c7532011deeb1d62884955d608ad4446aa69ae6a5"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa35e0f0-1ba1-4588-a98b-a8f1b8895aa7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67405798a12efc44ce548316543db8855ea8796058d0b07bafdd40cd7902ae8f"}}, "hash": "d21ce8f86143740da4d6e2f6e54dfa0e58ed257b28bd07e934e6b1e5c8b485b6", "text": "13-16. 38 39 40 12 III. Corruption in the Pacific As was noted in Section One, there are problems in utilising simple public office centred definitions of corruption if one utilises the Human Development framework. These problems are further compounded when you are dealing with a region that is as developmentally-heterogenous and as culturally diverse as the Pacific. In an attempt to overcome some of these issues and to provide a baseline of anti-corruption data in the Pacific, a survey was made of the National Integrity Systems (NIS) of 12 Pacific Island countries in 2003-2004. This section of the report extends on this initial data through a discussion of the types and forms of corruption found in the Pacific before return- ing to an analysis of the NIS data to explore to what extent this corruption is related to the lack of an effective regulatory and accountability framework. The section then looks at other non-economic forms of corruption in the region before launching into a discussion of the impacts of corruption \u2013 with this discussion focusing on the problems of data collection. The section ends with a discussion of initiatives being taken by governments of the region and other stakeholders. Challenges in defining corruption in the Pacific There are multitudinous definitional problems in dealing with corruption. These problems are found within the Pacific region itself. The Tongan NISPAC report thus found a \u2018lack of consensus\u2019 about what counts as corruption. In Vanuatu the word and concept tended to be applied to any bad behaviour in non-traditional urban contexts. In Tonga, which is a constitutional monarchy, nobles did not feel particularly accountable to commoners. And, in some places in the Pacific, contrary to Western distinctions between public and private spheres, some see public and private morality as continuous, including \u2018personal as well as professional indiscretions\u2019 . Combined these issues mean that defining exactly what constitutes corruption in the Pacific can be a conceptual minefield. However, despite all the conceptual difficulties people in the Pacific are still able to agree that corruption does occur in the region. Where exactly it is that corruption occurs and what impacts it has on broader society vary across the Pacific. In what sectors is corruption prevalent? Corruption in the Pacific, like in many other LDCs , is generally found in certain sectors. In the Pacific these sectors include: \u2022 police \u2022 customs \u2022 land and titles administration \u2022 mineral and petroleum extraction \u2022 forestry \u2022 fisheries \u2022 ports \u2022 health 41 Kerry James, (2004), \u2018Tonga\u2019 Transparency International Country Study Report (Australia: Transparency International-Australia). 42 Tess Newton Cain, (2004), \u2018Vanuatu\u2019 Transparency International Country Study Report (Australia: Transparency International-Australia). 43 Paul Roughan, (2004), \u2018Solomon Islands\u2019 Transparency International Country Study Report (Australia: Transparency International-Australia). 44 We should be careful not to conflate smallness with a lack of development. Small states like Singapore, New Zealand and Norway have been very successful and have extremely low levels of corruption. 41 42 43 44 13 45 Peter Larmour and Manuhuia Barcham, (2004) National Integrity Systems Pacific Islands: Overview Report (Australia: Transparency International- Australia) p. 6. 46 An interesting point to note is that in many countries anti-corruption activities are designed, at least in part, to reduce corruption so as to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). However, in countries like Papua New Guinea where large extractive industries make up the majority of FDI the link between FDI and corruption is more complicated. Indeed, FDI in the extractive industries might even promote corrupt activity in terms of foreign firms obtaining access to contracts and concessions. However, while this may lead to a temporary reduction in transaction costs for the foreign firms involved long term growth (and lower transaction costs over the long-term) for both foreign firms and the individual states in question would probably be better served by the operation of a transparent and non-corrupt market place. 47 Phone discussion with Tony Prescott on Thursday 7 June 2007. 48 Unless otherwise cited data for Melanesia is taken from the Melanesian NISPAC studies. 49 Unless otherwise cited data for Polynesia is taken from the Polynesian NISPAC studies. 50 Unless otherwise cited data for Micronesia is taken from the Micronesian NISPAC studies. 51 Tan, Lee, and Andrea Babon, (2006) \u201cBulldozing Progress: Large-Scale Logging, Human Rights Abuses and Corruption in Papua New Guinea\u201d Habitat Australia (October), pp. 16-17.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa35e0f0-1ba1-4588-a98b-a8f1b8895aa7": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa35e0f0-1ba1-4588-a98b-a8f1b8895aa7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebe38225d71a747ffd7c5a6c7532011deeb1d62884955d608ad4446aa69ae6a5"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e1fb38b-5cd3-4f1b-9c32-303e1e6b8ea8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d21ce8f86143740da4d6e2f6e54dfa0e58ed257b28bd07e934e6b1e5c8b485b6"}}, "hash": "67405798a12efc44ce548316543db8855ea8796058d0b07bafdd40cd7902ae8f", "text": "16-17. 52 Michael Morgan, (1998) \u201cPolitical Chronicles: Vanuatu 1995-1998\u201d The Journal of Pacific History 33 (3): 291-292. \u2022 education \u2022 retirement funds \u2022 tendering \u2022 trade in the tokens of sovereignty (passports, internet domain names) \u2022 offshore banking (but not offshore trust funds) \u2022 Access to public office", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ee4e0ae-d6bf-4b24-812f-6cbb1c8d642f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ee4e0ae-d6bf-4b24-812f-6cbb1c8d642f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64834e8491bf8bcc1676dde4a6b6a626b71e991a5ed35e89a26a2fa906d7581c"}, "3": {"node_id": "456aaf97-ac4a-4c37-8262-8d0ed1e1c5e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "173075678163155a961a8bee7de05449fc926d3b819ee3f0ce749f42ed9a7496"}}, "hash": "bacf808a60abeb8710d6680b0aac9416a8c5a974b3583b484748b98b7db377a0", "text": "Patterns of corruption are not uniform across the Pacific (see Table 2). However, that said, the key difference in patterns across the Pacific is the corruption that accompanies the large-scale mineral and petroleum extraction industries that operate in Melanesia. The resource-poor countries of Micronesia and Polynesia are, almost by definition, without the problems of large-scale corruption that plague the mineral and petroleum extraction industries in Melanesia.

As a general rule smaller countries like Niue (pop. 1,600) tend to have less corruption than larger countries like Solomon Islands (pop. 500,000) or Papua New Guinea (pop. 5,500,000). And, where corruption does exist in these smaller countries it tends to occur at a smaller scale . There are two possible reasons for this: one would be the lack of opportunity afforded for undertaking corrupt activities in smaller countries and the other would be the operation of informal networks helping keep people honest. Also, the lack of large scale mineral extraction industries means that the corruption occurring in sectors such as the trade in tokens of sovereignty or offshore banking makes a much greater impact in the smaller countries of Polynesia and Micronesia than it does in the lager countries of Melanesia. It is important to note that there are a few areas where corruption does not appear. In the Pacific there is a general lack of corruption in: \u2022 national judicial systems, and \u2022 electoral administration. These results are especially surprising given that the majority of Pacific Island countries lack a specific electoral commission office. Why this is the case is a cause for speculation. Also, unlike in many other LDCs there is very little visible petty corruption in the Pacific such as routine small payments for services rendered. This might be attributable to the absence of extreme poverty in the Pacific. In the 2004 NISPAC study only three of the country studies described this as a problem. Petty corruption also appears to be an issue in Fiji and Papua New Guinea. In December 1993 the Vanuatu National Provident Fund (VNPF) \u2013 the mandatory retirement fund for public servants \u2013 and the Vanuatu Ministry of Finance established a Housing Loan scheme using monies from the VNPF. However, after expending millions of Vatu over the first two years only 150 people had benefited from the scheme. Between 1994 and 1995 the Korman Government had directed the VNPF management to offer special conditions on these loans to government officials, and furnished lists of appointees and ministers to whom they were to be offered. On 18 December 1997 Ferrieux Patterson tabled a 100-page report exposing these operations. Disgruntled VNPF members demonstrated in the streets and on 23 December they began applying for similar loans to those offered to politicians. When those requests failed demands were made for the withdrawal of their contributions from the fund although that this was illegal under the VNPF Act.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "456aaf97-ac4a-4c37-8262-8d0ed1e1c5e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "456aaf97-ac4a-4c37-8262-8d0ed1e1c5e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64834e8491bf8bcc1676dde4a6b6a626b71e991a5ed35e89a26a2fa906d7581c"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ee4e0ae-d6bf-4b24-812f-6cbb1c8d642f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bacf808a60abeb8710d6680b0aac9416a8c5a974b3583b484748b98b7db377a0"}}, "hash": "173075678163155a961a8bee7de05449fc926d3b819ee3f0ce749f42ed9a7496", "text": "Then, on 12 January, unable to withdraw their contributions or gain low rate loans, disgruntled VNPF members and a growing crowd of unemployed youths rampaged through the nation\u2019s capital, Port Vila, causing an estimated 200 million vatu-worth of damage.

One example is the issue of political participation and its relationship to issues of free-speech. In late 2006 rioting broke out in the Tongan capital Nuku\u2019alofa. The rioting was a result of the adjournment of the country\u2019s Legislative Assembly which, despite promises to the contrary, had done nothing throughout the year to promote democracy in the country\u2019s government. The Legislative Assembly has 27 seats. Nine representatives are selected by the King, nine are reserved for nobles with the remaining nine being elected by the rest of the country\u2019s 90,000-strong population. The prodemocracy movement has long fought for a more representative legislature. In response to a continued lack of movement on this front, a crowd of prodemocracy advocates took to the streets in protest on 16 November 2006. The protest eventually turned violent as people in the crowd began tipping over cars and looting and burning buildings. The crackdown following these riots saw a number of influential leaders of the pro-democracy movement detained by the police. The Tongan government has a long history of using a heavy hand when dealing with the country\u2019s prodemocracy movement. In early 2003 the government banned the Taimi o Tonga \u2013 an independent newspaper which has a strong prodemocracy slant. This was overturned by the Tonga Supreme Court as an illegal act which was in violation of the national constitution. In broadening our conception of corruption we need to begin to ask questions such as whether or not a restricted ability to hold public office count as a form of corruption? The Samoan Fono (legislature) consists of 49 members serving 5-year terms. Of these 49 seats 47 are elected from territorial districts with the two remaining seats being chosen by non- Samoans with no chiefly affiliation. While universal suff-rage was extended in 1990 only matai (chiefs) may stand for election to the 47 Samoan seats. With a population of 176,848 (2001 est.) more than 25,000 individuals hold matai titles with about 5% of these being women.

In seizing control of the country\u2019s government, Commodore Baini- marama claimed that the military takeover was to \u2018clean up\u2019 the corrupt Qarase administration . However, despite claiming that the coup was designed, amongst other things, to bring an end to corruption in government certain actions by the military in the wake of the coup look decidedly suspicious. In the wake of this latest coup, a number of opponents of the coup were detained by the Fijian military. These detainees included professional journalists as well as members of the country\u2019s NGO sector. 57 58 59 57 http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0701/S00206.htm 58 http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=5037 59 http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0701/S00206.htm 59 http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0701/S00206.htm 16 Both of these issues raise serious questions as to how we define corruption. Is the detention of political opponents a form of corruption? Given the important focus placed on the right of free speech and freedom of information in the human development framework one would be inclined to argue that these acts are corrupt. Indeed, one could even include these acts within older public-office centred definitions as in both cases it looks as if the respective governments are overstepping the line in terms of the power entrusted them. The problem with both, however, is that no power has been entrusted to them by the broader population. Instead both hold power by very different means, through hereditary right in the Tongan case and through military force in the Fijian case. These then are further examples of how we need to be careful when we talk about corruption in the Pacific. Other issues which make us think about broadening our definitions of corruption include the impact of overseas aid.

Stagnating economic growth across the region, threatened ACP -EU trading regimes and bad flight connections across the Pacific constitute a possible recipe for trouble.

As these countries\u2019 economies grow they are increasingly looking further a field for the raw resources they require to maintain their growth. Korean, Malaysian and Chinese companies are already heavily involved in a number of industries in the Pacific including logging, fishing and oil palm. In addition, as these countries\u2019 industrial growth continues so too their search for new sources minerals, metals and petroleum products will also increase. Already Chinese companies are coming under attack for their practices in their operations in Papua New Guinea. Increased competition for access to natural resources may drive foreign companies and countries to attempt to utilise corrupt practices to gain a competitive advantage. The key question to be asked is what is the impact of this, and other forms of corruption in the Pacific? 63 For more on this see Rowan Callick, (2007) Chine, Chinese Businesses and Citizens Islands Business.

In the Pacific (as for many other LDCs) reliably measuring the impact of corruption is nearly impossible because of two issues. The first issue concerns the shadowy nature of corruption, and associated activities such as bribery, which means that there is no simple way to collect data on either its prevalence or magnitude. The second issue is that in the Pacific various capacity constraints mean that there are very real gaps in the data available in a number of sectors. And, where data is available its reliability is often questionable. These data problems combined mean that it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable information on either the prevalence or magnitude of corruption. And, without this data, it is nearly impossible to provide objective accounts of its impact. That said, there are very effective ways of measuring the impact and prevalence of corruption that are based on epidemiological methods of tracking disease.

Established as a government-owned commercial bank in 1976, in the four years following the 1987 coup the NBF tripled the numbers of its staff and increased its advances fourfold. In mid-1995 the state-owned bank was running bad debts of at close to F$90 million. Over the next three years the figure rose until it hit F$220 million, or 8% of Fiji's then GDP. In the face of public outrage and ever increasing media scrutiny the government of the day resisted demands for a public inquiry and declined to provide police and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions with resou-rces to investigate corruption in the running of the bank. Things came to an end in late 1998 when the government drew down from the country\u2019s national provident fund to make good the financial shortfall. While a number of senior bank executives were investigated in relation to the bank\u2019s collapse none were ever successfully prosecuted and all the major prosecutions mounted by the Office of the DPP were thrown out of the courts.

A number of international organisations utilise these form of perception- based indices. These organisations include: the World Bank with their Governance Indicators; the World Economic Forum with their Executive Opinion Survey; Transparency International with their Corruption Perception Index; and Freedom House with their work on political and civil liberties and freedom of the press. In addition, the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) framework provides objective data for monitoring fiscal procedures, and Global Integrity\u2019s Public Integrity Index provides relatively robust measures of the social and institutional aspects of corruption. We need to note that although these indices are based on perception they can have very real outcomes such as deterring foreign direct investment and undermining state and political legitimacy. We need to be very careful then not to draw too much from these forms of perception based indices although they do have a useful role to play in the anti-corruption toolbox. Combined these indices have helped provide evidence of not only corruption\u2019s economic cost but also its social cost and its impact on values. An important point to note with perception measures is that while more corruption is probably taking place than is ever reported we need to remember that \u201cperceptions may work both ways...[and] small societies [such as those found in the Pacific] are often vulnerable to suspicion and jealousy of neighbours, and people may imagine more corruption than there is\u201d . And so, in the Pacific, a long history of rent-seeking forms of politics in Samoa and Cook Islands has created an air of suspicion about politics and its corruption in both countries . As a result of this particular historical trajectory, the authors of the NISPAC reports for those two countries found that perceptions of corruption were much higher than empirical evidence would tend to suggest. At a very general level though there is general agreement that corruption has a detrimental effect on people\u2019s lives. These negative impacts operate at not only an economic level but also at a social level as well. In terms of poverty alleviation and development corruption has been shown to have the following adverse effects: \u2022 higher corruption leads to lower investors\u2019 confidence, which in turn lowers domestic and foreign investment thereby limiting opportunities for countries to eliminate poverty; \u2022 the politicisation and the purchasing of public positions translates into a misallocation of talent; \u2022 corruption exacerbates gender inequality as women are on average poorer than men; \u2022 corruption presents a barrier to economic and institutional engagement by the poorest \u2022 widespread corruption within government agencies interacting with the private sector clouds the business environment, hampering enterprise growth; \u2022 corruption exacerbates ethnic inequality as some groups are on average poorer than other ethnic groups; \u2022 the linkage of corruption to the unofficial economy means that the state collects lower revenues which might otherwise have been used for stimulating economic development or direct poverty", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "024e859d-1cf6-4656-ab88-8ab9c38ca2e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "024e859d-1cf6-4656-ab88-8ab9c38ca2e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af6da5872689449fbe7ca77b9547bc5eb9de84764d89da95eb59fed829caf440"}, "3": {"node_id": "7484091e-c4e6-442a-923e-0337665bc1ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b5f1ea5c40d01276c652cf8a7c9e4994972d982e3d17b098ff2a871825e7292"}}, "hash": "5f45a3219260985f55dd4abad9600c6c6aff023da6bf44fb14f4b8cf56677c38", "text": "reduction measures; 65 66 67 68 19 69 Kaufmann, Daniel, Francesca Recanatini and Sergiy Biletsky (2002) Assessing Governance: Diagnostic Tools and Applied Methods for Capacity Building and Action Learning a paper prepared for the WBI Staff Learning Course on Assessing Governance held on June 17-18, pp. 8-9.

And, when combined with other data, such as that obtained in the various national integrity system studies that have been completed in the region, this data would tend to indicate that given the relatively complete national integrity systems that exist within the countries of the Pacific region the effectiveness of these institutional systems needs to be questioned. However, in looking at the data provided by the World Bank Institutes Governance Indicators we need to be aware that some forms of corruption are not quantified through this approach (such as budgetary leakage or asset theft within the public sector) and there is always going to be a margin of error in the data available. A combination of data drawn from these various indices could provide a useful baseline data set for Pacific Islands countries themselves and bi-lateral and multi-lateral donors to work from in the construction of appropriate anti-corruption programmes and projects. Much of the data made available by these indices is at a very broad aggregate level. More in-depth, fine-detail data would be useful for helping to drill down into the consequences of corruption for particular sectors or regions. Possible proxies that researchers could use in helping to measure the impacts of corruption could include: \u2022 Benchmarking anti-corruption agencies \u2022 Benchmarking media: print and broadcast \u2022 Regular \u2018report cards\u2019 of select agencies or political districts \u2022 Opening a complaints bureau or a \u2018hotline\u2019 and tracking number of claims \u2022 Constitutions and laws \u2022 Number of times \u2018corruption\u2019 or \u2018bribe\u2019 is mentioned in the print media \u2022 Incorporation of ethics and values into school curriculum \u2022 Number of types of taxes paid by individual/businesses \u2022 Number of clearances required (eg to start a business) \u2022 Undocumented costs in education and health access \u2022 Corruption typologies \u2022 Audit reports \u2022 Ombudsman reports \u2022 Ombudsman complaints data \u2022 Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) data \u2022 Court cases and transcripts More than anything else, this section highlights the fact that one of the key areas for further action in combating corruption in the Pacific is in the area of monitoring and information provision. In terms of this lack of data, work could usefully be done in increasing the monitoring capacity of Pacific Islands\u2019 countries. The small size and high literacy rates found in many Pacific Islands mean that these measures could be very effective. 72 21 Given this spread and impact of corruption across the Pacific we next have to ask to what extent is this related to the lack of an effective regulatory and accountability framework? At an international level there appears to be growing support within the Pacific for anti-corruption efforts. A number of international instruments thus help provide a framework for Pacific Island Countries\u2019 anti-corruption efforts (see Appendix 1). The five most pertinent to the Pacific region are the: UN AntiCorruption Convention; UN Trans-national Organized Crime Convention; ADBOECD Asia Pacific Action Plan; the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention; and Financial Action Task Force/Asia-Pacific group on Money Laundering. While the OECD convention is only directly applicable to Australia and New Zealand the high levels of trade between these two countries and the countries of the Pacific means that its take up by Australian and New Zealand businesses will have an impact on anti-corruption efforts in the Pacific. Only Australia and New Zealand have so far signed up to the UN Anti-Corruption Convention but the majority of the Pacific Island countries have, through the Pacific Forum Secretariat, committed to moving towards signing and ratifying the Convention. A number of Pacific Island Countries have signed up to the UN Transnational Organized Crime Convention and the ADB-OECD Asia Pacific Action Plan and a number of other are working towards this goal. Ten countries in the Pacific region are full members of the Financial Action Task Force/Asia-Pacific group on Money Laundering while four other countries in the region possess observer status. Combined, these international instruments help provide a high-level framework upon which effective regional and domestic regulatory and accountability frameworks can be constructed. However, while the existence of these international instruments provide a useful international framework upon which concrete anti-corruption strategies can be constructed there is an obvious question of sequencing both in signing, ratifying and implementing these forms of international agreements, but more importantly in the order of which anti-corruption reforms are pursued. In addition, as there is limited capacity and limited resources in many Pacific Island countries, reforms must be prioritised and this prioritisation must also ensure that some wins can be achieved in order to gain and maintain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4039aac8-79e1-4252-9a31-c99bbb975516": {"__data__": {"id_": "4039aac8-79e1-4252-9a31-c99bbb975516", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d765373ce45f482c8a7c68171e4910eba9212db24da61cfb74bbdbc8681896a"}}, "hash": "9d765373ce45f482c8a7c68171e4910eba9212db24da61cfb74bbdbc8681896a", "text": "longer-term momentum towards reform. However, before concrete anti-corruption activities can be undertaken there must first exist a framework (preferably both domestic and international) upon which they can be based. And so, returning to the question posed above about the existence of frameworks for supporting anti-corruption activity, looking at the available evidence and using the NISPAC data as a baseline we could provisionally answer yes, many Pacific countries have relatively well-developed domestic legislative and policy frameworks for dealing with corrup- tion although more work could be usefully done looking at how these could be strengthened or reinforced. The issue, however, is not that there is a lack of a regulatory and accountability framework. Instead, the problem may lie, as was suggested above in the discussion of the WBI Governance Indicators, in the effectiveness of these frameworks. National Integrity Systems In 2003-2004 a survey was made of the National Integrity Systems of 12 Pacific Island countries. Run out of the Australian National University, the study was funded by AusAID and Transparency International-Australia. The NISPAC Study included the following countries: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. The NISPAC study did not include studies of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand as they were completed as part of other National Integrity System projects. The National Integrity System is based on the idea that corruption is a systemic phenomenon that can be addressed by reducing opportunities for corruption and increasing disincentives for corrupt behaviour. The model is based on the existence of a number of pillars including agencies such the 22 judiciary, civil society groups including the media; the private sector; and other groups including those working in the field of international cooperation, who work together to promote integrity within a country. In the NISPAC study 11 pillars were utilized. These pillars included: legislative assemblies; executive; judiciary; auditor-general; ombudsman; watchdog agencies; public services; media; civil society; private sector and the international community. Almost all of the 12 countries of the NISPAC study possessed an almost complete complement of these pillars (see Appendix 2). So too, Fiji and Papua New Guinea possessed almost all the pillars utilized in the studies that they were respectively involved in. The key notable gap was the lack of any watchdog agency in the majority of the countries. Solomon Islands was the only country that possessed this pillar in the 2004 study, with this being their chapter of Transparency International. This is somewhat misleading as Vanuatu also possessed a chapter of TI in 2004 but this was identified in as a civil society organization which is actually probably a better fit given that Transparency International is an international non-government organisation. Papua New Guinea and Fiji also had chapters of TI when their NIS studies were performed. The other notable gap was the absence of the Office of an Ombudsman in half of the countries involved in the NISPAC study. In the ensuing three years no new Ombudsman\u2019s Offices have been established in those countries although the creation of an Ombudsman\u2019s Office and an accompanying Leadership Code in Nauru has been raised in recent constitutional discussions. Other key gaps included: the absence of media as a pillar in Tonga and Niue due to problems respectively with media freedom and the extremely small size of the country; the lack of an active civil society in Nauru; and the absence of an active private sector in Tuvalu. In general then, on paper the countries of the Pacific possess relatively national integrity systems from an institutional perspective. How these pillars work together and to what extent they work in practice is another question. In the National Integrity System model the number of pillars is variable but the key aspect is the rela- tionship between and within the pillars. Vertical accountability systems within pillars point upwards to key managers within those organisations, including Ministers for government agencies, and downwards to stakeholders such as voters. There is a need, however, to also achieve horizontal accou- ntability between these pillars. Transparency International sees this horizontal accountability operating as a strategy of coalitions between groups. In a perfect case the pillars are inter-dependent, with the pillars with greater capacity helping the other pillars to uphold the country\u2019s integrity system. However, as the NISPAC study showed this is not always the case. The country with the \u2018best\u2019 National Integrity System on paper was the Solomon Islands, with a complete set of all 11 pillars. However, these pillars were largely \u2018hollow\u2019 with many agencies having little, if any, capacity to fulfill the anti-corruption activities", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4ea8908-e29e-4d40-b09f-b080b13c1c66": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4ea8908-e29e-4d40-b09f-b080b13c1c66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c82295da504a32c195196d17fd4aead8532ddf898d400a6b9bbdb0bb8c6c0678"}}, "hash": "c82295da504a32c195196d17fd4aead8532ddf898d400a6b9bbdb0bb8c6c0678", "text": "they were obliged to discharge. Questions thus need to be asked as to what extent these institutions are appropriate for their environment. This lack of internal capacity could have been improved through horizontal forms of integration with other agencies in the provision of information, advice and person hours. A similar issue is apparent in Vanuatu. 74 73 73 Nauru Constitutional Review Commission, (2007) The Nauru Constitutional Review Commission \u2018Naoero Ituga\u2019 Report (Nauru: Nauru Constitutional Review Commission). See especially Chapter 12. 74 Larmour, Peter, and Manuhuia Barcham, (2004) National Integrity Systems Pacific Islands: Overview Report (Australia: Transparency International-Australia) p. 5. 75 Larmour, Peter, and Manuhuia Barcham, (2004) National Integrity Systems Pacific Islands: Overview Report (Australia: Transparency International-Australia) p. 24. 76 Paul Roughan, (2004), \u2018Solomon Islands\u2019 Transparency International Country Study Report (Australia: Transparency International- Australia). 75 76 23 Under current legislation the Vanuatu Ombudsman\u2019s Office is empowered to investigate allegations of breaches of the country\u2019s leadership code. However, as the legislation currently stands if the person under investigation resigns their position then the Ombudsman Office\u2019s investigation must halt as they no longer hold the leadership position that they were being investigated for. More problematic is that should serious allegations have arisen in the course of that investigation which could have led to a criminal investigation by the Police there is no way in which the information obtained by the Ombudsman\u2019s Office can be given to the Police. Instead the Police must initiate their own, separate investigation. There is thus a need to ensure both vertical and horizontal integration within and across organisations and agencies involved in anti-corruption work. Combined these two aspects of vertical and horizontal accountability provide an environment of mutually reinforcing accountability. The key impediment to this integration is a general lack of capacity. Part of the answer can also be found in the realisation that the integrity/anti-corruption frame- works and/or programmes present in countries like Solomon Islands may be inconsistent with the capacity of the organisations that have to implement them. These inconsistencies then lead to the further undermining of morale within the organisation. The problem is that these forms of framework are often created without any real sense of the resources required to implement them, thus complicating the affordability of government. In addition, some of these frameworks are not a close cultural fit with their environment which can place an even greater drain on the capacity of the organisations in question. This in turn brings us back to the importance of issues of prioritising and sequencing when creating and implementing anti-corruption programmes and frameworks. Capacity deficits One of the defining features of LDCs generally, and the countries of the Pacific Islands are no exception to this, is a general lack of capacity in the public and private sector. This capacity deficit is present in differing degrees across sectors as well as geographically. Thus, as was discussed earlier, states in the Pacific tend to have greater capacity in their capital cities and surrounding districts, with this capacity diminishing as you move further away from the centre of government. This capacity deficit has two aspects: internal and external. Internal capacity refers to the ability of an organisation to operate its own internal processes effectively. This includes, for example, the ability of an agency to manage its staff through appropriate human resource policies and processes, to ensure that their staff are adequately compensated for the work that they do (which in some case means ensuring that their staff get paid regularly) as well as ensuring, amongst other things, that policies created at the organisation\u2019s head office are implemented following their original intent at regional offices. External capacity, by contrast, refers to the ability of an organisation to project its presence in the external environment. External capacity thus includes the ability of an organisation to interact and manage its relationships with others, including its ability to mobilise and build partnerships within and outside the government. For a Ministry charged with providing effective roading for a country, for example, their external capacity would include their ability (or lack of ability) to effectively build and maintain road networks across the country. For other service provision Departments/Ministries their external capacity would consist of their ability (or lack of ability) to provide the services they are charged with providing. In terms of opportunities for corrupt activity this lack of capacity may play out in an organisation\u2019s inability, for example, to properly monitor financial transactions thus providing opportunities for misdirection of funds. This idea of low organisational internal and external capacity also plays out in other ways.

The Melanesian Ombudsman model developed in Papua New Guinea where in addition to the usual focus on issues of maladministration, the PNG Ombudsman Commission has the additional role of policing the PNG Leadership Code. One of the key results is that despite the criticism of what is seen as a weak and faulty leadership code, the PNG Ombudsman Commission (as well as the other independent authorities and judiciary) is seen as one of the \u201credeeming features of Papua New Guinea\u2019s constitutional system\u201d, and \u201chas prevented the decline of the executive and Parliament into total irresponsibility and unaccountability\u201d. Working together the Office of the PNG Ombu-dsman helped implement a number of reforms in Vanuatu which saw the successful extension of the role of the Vanuatu Ombudsman\u2019s Office to the policing of that country\u2019s leadership code.

A low level of external capacity may thus effectively hamstring an NGO\u2019s ability to effectively act as an anti-corruption watchdog. In short, capacity shortfalls, in both an internal and external aspect, are a key lever behind issues of corruption in the Pacific. They provide not only opportunities for corruption but also inhibit the effective operation of anti-corruption policies and programmes. The problem then is how to overcome these capacity shortfalls. An initial answer would be to look for examples of success in the Pacific and use those to construct models which can then be usefully transferred to other regions and jurisdictions within the Pacific. By utilising examples of structures and processes that have managed to work successfully in a low capacity context in the Pacific you achieve a number of things: \u2022 help overcome issues of capacity misfit; \u2022 help overcome issues of cultural misfit (both organisational and societal); and \u2022 promote local ownership. An important point to make in terms of promoting maximum stakeholder buy-in to any anti- corruption policy or programme is the idea of ownership. Ownership of an idea or process by a community, be it a policy community such as a group of Departments working in a particular sector or social community such as a village or country, helps promote implementation . And, one such way to help bring about local ownership is to build on local successes. By local I mean using structures and processes which have emerged in the general region \u2013 which in the context of this report means the Pacific broadly construed. By building on local success stories you thus help promote local ownership thereby increases your chances of successful uptake and implementation. Building on local success stories in order to use them as the basis for the construction of new anti- corruption structures and processes in different jurisdictions within the Pacific is an example of South-South policy transfer. South\u2013South policy transfer mechanisms provide an opportunity to avoid the problems of low capacity and cultural misfit that plague North\u2013South forms of transfer. 77 25 The establishment of the Vanuatu Ombudsman Office is an example of the many positive aspects of South\u2013South forms of policy transfer. South\u2013South forms of policy transfer seem to provide an answer to the problems of disparities between state capacity and cultural context that often bedevil North\u2013South policy transfer with successful structures and processes developed in similar countries being able to act as the template for successful transfer. A key point to note though is that we need to be clear before we implement any wholesale adoption of South-South forms of transfer in the region about why it is that the structure or process worked in its original form. Was it a question of appropriate structure or was it instead a matter of political will, effective capacity, appropriate resources, sound leadership, effective donor support, engagement from stakeholders, or indeed a combination of these factors? Without first identifying what the critical success factors were behind the operation of the original structure or process we run the risk of promoting costly institutional transfer for the sake of institutional transfer. In building on local successes we thus need to ensure that adequate time is spent", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dc360e6-7f9b-40f3-a141-e974245c9445": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dc360e6-7f9b-40f3-a141-e974245c9445", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "021af6291e772f1676cf462ce7a90ae680617328043703b47587402ed6b68bcd"}}, "hash": "021af6291e772f1676cf462ce7a90ae680617328043703b47587402ed6b68bcd", "text": "exploring how and why those original structures worked. One other important point to note is that by building on local successes we also begin to move away from a deficit model of governance which focuses almost exclusively on what is wrong with a governance system rather than building on what is successful. Building on local success stories thus helps garner both community support and political will \u2013 both necessary aspects of any successful anti-corruption programme. Successful anti-corruption initiatives involve multi-faceted interventions both internal and external to organisations. Nonetheless, countries can have good regulatory systems, structures and laws but if there is lack of leadership and the will to uphold the law then everything can fall apart. Values and personal integrity are important dimensions of leadership in fighting corruption as strong leadership can provide the political will which is often required for successful anti-corruption programmes. The issue of personal values to one side the question that needs to be asked is how can political will to fight corruption be developed? External pressure is one possibility. Aid conditionality is one way of achieving this but the externally imposed aid conditions based on narrow objectives and driven by political and strategic interest of donors can work in negative way. Aid conditionality has thus, in some instances, created perverse incentive structures which could actually be detrimental to anti- corruption efforts. Experience with many structural adjustment programs in many developing countries indicate that externally imposed aid conditionality without or with weak national ownership do not work. Political will is thus also shaped or influenced by pressures from a well-informed citizenry. In addition, political will is reinforced by broad-based ownership. Programmes which are built on broad-based ownership have greater chances of success than those that are supported by narrow political and economic interests. However, in order to ensure that any new institutions or new functions of older institutions created to help in anti-corruption efforts do not just add another layer of bureaucratic burden on states already struggling with a capacity deficit, we need to ensure that there is no unnecessary doubling up of functions. This will only occur through a stocktake of existing anti-corruption laws and institutions in specific countries and within the region as a whole. While this report itself is a move towards that direction, a more concerted effort to explore what already exists and provide some analysis as to why or why not they are successful would help before money is spent constructing programmes of reform. Understanding what already exists and why it works or does not work will help ensure that any programmes of reforms adopted are appropriately targeted, thus saving time and money in the long run. 26 A number of Pacific Island countries have initiated reforms to fight corruption since the 2004 NISPAC reports were completed. One of the most widespread has been the creation of Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) in a variety of Pacific Island countries including Cook Islands, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. And, in probably the most high profile anti-corruption move in the region, the interim Fijian government established the \u2018Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC) \u2019 in early 2007. An independent organisation, the Commissioner of the FICAC will be directly accountable only to the President of Fiji. The new body has new and significantly enhanced legal powers of surveillance in order to be able to successfully investigate, arrest, detain and prosecute offenders of corruption. FICAC has, in its short history, already made a very vocal start to its work with high profile raids on a number of Ministries and the detention and charging of a high ranking Police Officer for corruption. In addition to these local efforts a number of bi-lateral and multi-lateral donors are actively providing support to Pacific Islands Countries in the fight against corruption. The next section of the report looks at these. Anti-Corruption Initiatives in the Region There are a number of anti-corruption initiatives being carried out in the region. (For more information on these specific initiatives see Appendix 3) Bilateral Donors There are a number of bi-lateral actors in the Pacific which promote anti-corruption activities as part of their work in the region. The two key bi-lateral donors in the region are Australia and New Zealand. The Australian government\u2019s commitment to fighting corruption in the region was underlined in the Australian Government\u2019s White Paper on Aid to the Pacific. In March 2007 the Australian government released a new policy booklet entitled Tackling Corruption for Growth and Development which outlines the Australian government\u2019s focus on anti-corruption activities in the region.

The Australian government sees anti-corruption activities as playing a vital role in their future longterm engagement with the region. While the New Zealand government does not have a specific anti-corruption policy there are aspects of anti-corruption work contained within their good governance programmes. New Zealand\u2019s anti-corruption work in the Pacific includes supporting the Pacific Judicial Development Programme (PJDP), a programme designed support participating Pacific judiciaries to strengthen the rule of law and governance through the provision of training to magistrates and court officials across the region as well as through the provision of direct funding to Transparency International-New Zealand who have been engaged in anti-corruption work in the Pacific. The European Union is undertaking some work in this area in the Pacific. Many of their governance profiles of their partner countries in the region have included specific anti-corruption activities. At a more direct level the European Union is also providing funding to Transparency International-Vanuatu to enable them to update their 2004 NISPAC country study. The US State Department has been doing some work in the Pacific with the UNODC in the creation of a Pacific Anti-Money Laundering Programme (PALP). 78 See www.fincen.gov/int_egmont.html 79 \u201cFiji Anti-Corruption Unit Receives 400 Cases\u201d Fiji Times Tuesday 27 March 2007. \u201cRasiga to appear in court\u201d accessed on Friday 15 June 2007 at 2:09pm at http://www.fijilive.com/news/show/news/2007/05/10/Fijilive09.html 80 Australian Government, (2006) Australian aid: promoting growth and stability (Canberra: Australian Government). 78 79 80 27 81 The APG members in the region are Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Samoa and Vanuatu.

Multilateral Actors There are a number of multi-lateral actors and groups which operate in the Pacific which either have anti-corruption strategies as part of their work streams or are themselves focused on anti- corruption activities as part of their core business. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) Asia/Pacific Group has ten members in the region while four other countries in the region possess observer status. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the OECD have combined to create an Asia-Pacific Anti-Corruption initiative. Seven countries from within the Pacific region have signed the Action Plan, these are Australia; Cook Islands; Fiji; Palau; Papua New Guinea; Samoa; and Vanuatu. Under the Pacific Plan the Pacific Forum Secretariat has begun to more explicitly address the issue of corruption. As an immediate policy priority the Pacific Plan has called for the strengthening of anti-corruption institutions in the region. The proposal includes the establishment of: \u2022 a regional ombudsman; \u2022 a regional audit service; \u2022 regional capacity to assist the collection of customs revenue; and \u2022 a regional anti-corruption agency. In pursuit of this, the Pacific Forum Secretariat is looking to commission a study looking at the pros and cons of a regional anti-corruption agency and these other proposed institutional support mech- anisms at the regional level. The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) provides an example of a joint regional effort to fight corruption. One of the key bodies created by RAMSI to combat corruption in Solomon Islands is the Participating Police Force (PPF) Corruption Targeting Team (CTT). With 14 police investigators drawn from both the SIPF and RAMSI\u2019s regional Participating Police Force, investigations by the CTT have already led to charges being laid against two senior government officials, two senior statutory officer-holders, three former provincial premiers, five former national ministers and two former prime ministers.

One of the largest of these organisations is the Oceania Customs Organisation (OCO) which consists of twenty-three customs administrations within the Pacific. At their regional meetings, discussions focus on the promotion of harmonised and simplified customs procedures, the introduction of new methods and a forum for a general exchange of information. In respect to the issue of money laundering, the OCO has developed a working relationship with the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering Secretariat. Other regional peak bodies of importance to anti-corruption efforts include the Pacific Immigration Directors' Conference (PIDC) , the South Pacific Chiefs of Police Conference (SPCPC) and the Pacific Islands Law Officers Meeting (PILOM). Initial meetings have been held towards the creation of a regional network of ombudsmen support services among Pacific Island, Australian and New Zealand ombudsmen. Work by the ADB is also helping strengthen the audit functions of the members of the South Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (SPASAI). Non-Government Organisations and the Private Sector Transparency International (TI), the international anti-corruption NGO, has a number of chapters in the Pacific region. In 2004, together with AusAID, Transparency International-Australia ran a 12- country study of National Integrity Systems in the Pacific (NISPAC). As individual chapters they have been quite vocal in their anti-corruption advocacy work. The Papua New Guinea chapter, for example, has been pivotal in the establishment and running of a Community Coalition Against Corruption (CCAC). The churches have been vocal in their condemnation of corruption in the region. In the late 1990s the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Papua New Guinea made a number of claims about the levels of corruption in the national government and called for change. So too in the Solomon Islands a number of prominent church leaders have been outspoken in their opposition to what they see as corrupt practices in government. 85 The twenty-three member countries are American Samoa, Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, FSM, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Norfolk Island, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Wallis and Futuna. 86 For more information see www.ocosec.org 87 The PIDC is the official regional forum for Official Pacific Immigration Agencies of the Pacific Region. The principal objective of the PIDC is to promote consultation and co-operation among immigration agencies within the region. The Conference also provides for the exchange of ideas, the dissemination of information and the provision of technical assistance between its members. For more information see: http://www.pidcsec.org/ 88 The current members of SPCPC are American Samoa, New Zealand, Australia, Niue, Cook Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Palau, French Polynesia, Samoa, Guam, Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Tonga, Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Nauru, Vanuatu, New Caledonia. 89 For more information see www.pcpc.org 90 PILOM is the annual meeting of the Attorneys-General, Heads of Justice Departments, SolicitorsGeneral, Crown Counsel and Directors of Public Prosecutions of the Pacific Island Forum member states provides a forum for sharing information on major legal issues and developments relevant to government law officers in Pacific Island Forum countries. 91 For more on the work of SPASAI see www.sapsai.org 93 The NISPAC Study included the following countries: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

In Palau the radio reporter Alfonso Diaz had three cars firebombed while a newspaper editor in Solomon Islands has been physically intimidated by thugs associated with publishers have been deported from Vanuatu and Palau. In some Pacific Island countries formal and informal controls on the media are strong such as in Tonga where the government has amended the constitution to allow it to ban newspapers. In addition to the work being carried out by Transparency International which focuses exclusively on anti-corruption activities, there are several other NGOs doing work in this area in the Pacific as well. The Pacific Centre for Public Integrity (PCPI) based in Fiji is a relative newcomer, working regionally with a specific anti-corruption mandate. A variety of other NGOs include anti-corruption activities within their work on democracy and human rights, women\u2019s rights, good governance and/or community development. In Fiji, the Citizens\u2019 Constitutional Forum (CCF), has been doing work in this area since the late 1990s, including community education and advocacy on the need for legislation to implement freedom of information and code of conduct provisions of the Constitution, and advocating greater follow-up on apparent cases of corruption identified by the Auditor-General. In the Pacific the Private Sector has supported anti-corruption efforts in a number of ways including support of organisations such as Transparency International as well as more direct lobbying of government. In Solomon Islands in early 2007, for example, the local chamber of commerce and industry has raised questions about the performance of the lands department. Questioning the legality of certain land dealings and ownership transfers the chamber of commerce has called on the government to commit itself to attacking corruption, inside and outside the government and public service. This part of the report has discussed two key aspects of corruption in the Pacific. After touching briefly on definitional issues the first section explored where corruption is found before looking in more depth at some of the problems encountered in trying to measure the impacts of corruption. The second part of this section then looked at the anti-corruption efforts of donors and others in the region \u2013 looking first at bi-lateral donors before discussing the work of multi-lateral donors, regional peak bodies and non-government organisations. 96 Donald Shuster, (2004), \u2018Palau\u2019 Transparency International Country Study Report (Blackburn: Transparency International-Australia), p. 17 and Peter Larmour and Manuhuia Barcham, (2004) National Integrity Systems Pacific Islands: Overview Report (Australia: Transparency InternationalAustralia) p. 14. 97 Peter Larmour and Manuhuia Barcham, (2004) National Integrity Systems Pacific Islands: Overview Report (Australia: Transparency International-Australia) p. 14. 98 http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=31072 96 97 98 30 IV. Role of Culture and Tradition There is a long running discourse in both the academic and policy literature on the \u2018incompatibility\u2019 of traditional and modern governance systems. This is especially so in the Pacific where, in some countries, modern state structures have only really been in existence for less than 50 years. A large part of this discourse of incompatibility between governance systems is devoted to exploring the linkages between culture and corruption. In this section of the report, the links between culture and corruption are discussed through a brief examination first of the general literature on the topic before looking more closely at what some authors have said about the link between these two concepts in the Pacific. From there, a more in-depth analysis is made of the issue of gift-giving looking at how a distinction can be made between traditional practices and corruption. The section then ends by discussing what else can be done in terms of exploring in more detail the relationship between culture and corruption. In terms of identifying the role of culture in corruption we need to first define what we mean by culture. A generally accepted definition of culture is that it is the shared system of values, beliefs, customs that the members of a group utilise in their interactions with one another and others. However, following Samuel Huntington, in utilising this definition of culture we need to be careful that we do not, by defining it too broadly as a 'way of life', end up explaining nothing. In a survey of 33 countries the researchers found some correlation between membership of a hierarchical religion, such as Catholicism or Islam, and corruption. Protestantism also seemed to be negatively correlated with corruption. Following Putnam, the key aspect here would appear to the type of links between members of society. Strong hierarchical forms of relationships led to the formation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5cd073fb-9af8-4f35-87c6-81e68dacf3f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "5cd073fb-9af8-4f35-87c6-81e68dacf3f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c23bc5110787eff199cf68fab05ea5fd95e650fe0475fd88998586a1388bc01"}, "3": {"node_id": "0a12c0d9-445e-44c7-8de5-472f86dc83c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f0859aa08ab34cfda749c6512bc111b24a54f4f85a80d5244f2507f070e3aa3"}}, "hash": "081b736a29b10b604f20228a6818b9e3df946f0c52339e05e58b27511617aed4", "text": "of particularist forms of bonds between members of society which effectively exclude others who are not part of the group and leads to the formation of intermediaries who convey information between members of the hierarchy. This use of intermediaries, with its associated lack of a free and transparent flow of information, provides an opportunity for corruption to occur. This hierarchical form of relationship which, as noted above, is found in certain religious traditions is also found in many affective social organisations such as clans and tribes around the world, including the Pacific. Conversely, weak horizontal forms of social relationship, such as those characterising Christian Protestant religions, with an associated lack of intermediaries controlling the flow of information help to prevent corruption by allowing a free and transparent access to information. In a more in-depth case study, Alena Ledeneva analysed the system in the former Soviet Union of low level exchanges of favours (blat) by which people worked around bureaucratic difficulties, and mobilised relatives and acquaintances to \u2018get by\u2019. So too in looking at the issue of culture and corruption Elizabeth Harrison has related corruption to the exercise of official discretion by field officers in Africa, while Akhil Gupta has looked sympathetically at the role of cultural middlemen in the interactions of clients and bureaucrats in India. 99 Huntington, Samuel P., (2000) \u201cIntroduction\u201d in Lawrence E.

This is a very similar view to that found in Robert Putnam\u2019s influential book (1993) Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy (Princeton: Princeton University Press). 101 Alena Ledeneva, (1998) Russia's Economy of Favours: Blat, Networking and Informal Exchange (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press). 102 Elizabeth Harrison, (2004) \u201cThe \u2018Cancer of Corruption' in Africa\u2019\u201d, in Italo Pardo (ed), Corruption: Between Morality and Law (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing). 103 Akhil Gupta, (2005) \u201cNarrating the State of Corruption\u201d in Cris Shore and Dieter Haller (eds), Corruption: Anthropological Perspectives (London: Pluto Press). 99 100 101 102 103 31 Some aspects of Melanesian society, particularly non-Austronesian aspects, are characterised by a certain form of social leadership structure described by some as a Melanesian-type big-man system. In these forms of traditional system segmented lineage groups are held together by faction-leaders who compete for power in the social structure of horizontally arranged and principally equal groupings. Leadership in a \u2018big-man\u2019 system is not ascribed but rather gained through action and competition with other ambitious men. The position of this form of leader is always challenged by other different bigmen, and aspirant big-men, that compete with one another in an on-going process of material and political transactions. Traditionally big-men were always struggling to balance the opposing pulls of securing his own renown through distributing resources to other big-man groups whilst also redistributing resources to the people of his own group in order to maintain their support. This cultural artifact has been transferred over to modern politics. In Melanesia public office has thus become an attractive opportunity for personal and group gain. Election to national parliament offers local people avenues for becoming more influential big men and gaining greater access to state resources for redistribution. In Melanesia government ministers have used their official powers to appropriate entire national policies or divert public resources to their own personal agendas due in part to a belief that the accumulation of wealth is an essential element of political status.

Indeed there may be many positives to be found in traditional cultures in combating corruption.

This research would be part of what she and Ropate Qalo have elsewhere called the development of a Pacific Political Ethics. In a similar vein, in their analysis of Samoa\u2019s National Integrity System, the authors of that country\u2019s NISPAC study called for greater analysis of that country\u2019s \u2018traditional integrity system\u2019. They argued that: Traditional societies in the Pacific possessed accountability structures which were well known by members of these communities. Sanctions for corrupt activity included weaker processes such as social pressure and pubic embarrassment through to stronger forms of deterrent including violence and possible capital punishment. Colonial rule saw these older systems partially displaced by introduced structures. And, in the modern world older forms of deterrence such as violence would be frowned \u201cin order to understand better the whole area of gift giving and conflict of interest rules in a society like Samoa which is not only relatively small but with such a strong family-orientated and reciprocal culture, it would be worthwhile in the long term to conduct an in-depth study of Samoa\u2019s \u2018traditional\u2019 integrity system in order for both donors and Samoans to understand better the similarities and differences between the national integrity systems and the \u2018traditional integrity system\u2019. Such understanding would hopefully lead to a better appreciation of the national integrity system. The off-the-cuff conclusion is that elements of the two systems could never be mixed as it would ultimately create opportunities for corrupt activities to take place. Perhaps there is some way in which elements of one system would enhance the effectiveness of the other.\u201d 104 105 106 32 Building on this approach, in a recent paper Peter Larmour has discussed how we need more work exploring the relationship between culture and corruption in the Pacific. But rather than treating the differences between understandings of corruption as a preamble or impediment he argues for the need for more work on \u201chow and why some activity that is regarded as corrupt by one group may not be regarded as such by another; how academic understandings can differ from those of policy makers, and public opinion; how the law may differ from public opinion; and how such differences may impact on anti-corruption activity. \u201d However, this \u2018taking culture seriously\u2019 approach should not be seen as merely a return to cultural relativist excuses for corrupt activities. Rather it should be seen, in light of the discussion by the authors of the Samoan NISPAC study, as an opportunity to utilise the \u2018best of both worlds\u2019 in anti- corruption activity and in doing so help academics and policy-makers understand why some programmes of reform succeed where others fail. Gift-giving as an example In discussions of culture and corruption one of the most-often cited problems is that of gift-giving. Susan Rose-Ackerman, for example, notes that one important reason why the identification of corruption is often a matter of dispute is that conduct may be understood in different ways in different cultures as \u201cone persons bribe is another person\u2019s gift\u201d . Ackerman goes on to argue that in cases where the giving and receiving of gifts which she sees as corruption appears to be culturally sanctioned, she observes, it shows that the culture in question is a legacy of the past that \u201cno longer fits modern conditions\u201d . Ackerman\u2019s claim is, given the fact that culture is both a key intermediate input to social and economic development as well as a welfare-enhancing developmental outcome itself in the Human Development Framework, problematic to say the least. 107 Larmour, Peter, (2006) \u201cCulture and Corruption in the Pacific Islands: Some conceptual issues and findings from studies of National Integrity Systems\u201d Asia Pacific School of Economics and Government \u2013 Policy and Governance Discussion Paper No. 06-05, Canberra, p. 3. 108 Rose, Ackerman, Susan, (1999) Corruption and government: causes, consequences and reform (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), p. 5. 109 Rose, Ackerman, Susan, (1999) Corruption and government: causes, consequences and reform (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), p. 5. upon by most in the international community.

In their ruling the three presiding justices held, that, contrary to the Electoral Act 1963 (s.96), Su\u2019a was guilty of bribery and so declared his election void. In their judgment the justices reasoned that while \u201cthe preamble to the [Samoan] Constitution states the combination of Christian principles and historic custom and tradition as the foundation of the Independent State of Samoa (\u00a714)\u201d nonetheless \u201cthe law prevails over custom in the event of a conflict (\u00a7119).\u201d Despite a discussion of the role of intent in deciding whether or not an act was corrupt (\u00a723) the justices agued in this particular case that, despite the exemption in s.97A of the gift-giving customs of o\u2019o or momoli from the offences of bribery illegal or corrupt practice during a prescribed period, the effect of s.99A was to impose an absolute prohibition on the acts of giving or exchange of food, money or other valuable at a ceremony or activity, except at funeral, during a prescribed period described as the \"period of election\" (\u00a7122-123). Furthermore they held that under s.99A \u201cit is not required that such acts of giving or exchange be accompanied by a corrupt intent in order to constitute an illegal practice (\u00a7123).\u201d In this particular case we see an example where introduced law has trumped custom in terms of deciding the corrupt nature or not of particular customary acts as no recourse can be made to the issue of intent when the law specifically states when customary giftgiving is allowed and when it is prohibited.

Gift-giving has been and continues to be a key part of many Pacific Island cultures. This traditional practice played a very real social function. In many societies gift-giving placed the donor and recipient in an ongoing exchange relationship. This relationship was important as, using modern jargon, these successive exchanges increased trust between the two members of the relationship which in turn led to the building of social capital which thereby reduced transaction costs between them. These reduced transaction costs thus helped maintain social solidarity both within groups and between groups. In distinguishing how these practices lead to corruption, we need to acknowledge that it is not the practice of gift-giving itself that is inherently corrupt but rather that the structures of the modern state have provided a source of previously unimaginable power and wealth and so provided opportunities for some elites to exploit these opportunities in pursuit of their own interests. The point to note is that in defining how and when traditional cultural practices such as gift-giving become corrupt there are a number of issues at play, including: intent, scale and the public or private nature of the \u2018gift\u2019. And so, as an example, if an elected representative visits a village in their constituency and receives cigarettes and alcohol as a gift which they at some later point reciprocate with gifts of pigs this then is not corruption. If, however, the representative receives tens of thousands of dollars from the village and reciprocates with the initiation of a public works programme in that village then that clearly is a case of corruption. The key points of difference between traditional gift-giving (which continues on throughout the Pacific to the present day) and corrupt practices disguised by corrupt officials as gift-giving is thus the intent behind the giving of the \u2018gift\u2019, the scale of gift given and the public or private nature of the \u2018gift\u2019. The problem, however, still lies in defining where the distinction should be made. When is it that a gift becomes a bribe? This is a relatively clear cut problem to pursue although its answer will always be context dependent. There is a large corpus of anthropological data available to help national governments provide official limits on gift-giving, thereby helping remove the \u2018culture excuse\u2019 from corrupt official\u2019s lexicons. A point to note here in terms of intent is that traditional leaders often accumulated wealth not for private consumption per se but rather to redistribute to members of their community. This redis- tribution helped the community in terms of the redistribution of food and other valuable commodities", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f02c4916-0e6c-400a-b2bd-5f86dcc475f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "f02c4916-0e6c-400a-b2bd-5f86dcc475f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4bbd1dcc7773eeaae41c5c0fda7b1ba26b2de1aae887ae03b3306057f09e8cd7"}}, "hash": "4bbd1dcc7773eeaae41c5c0fda7b1ba26b2de1aae887ae03b3306057f09e8cd7", "text": "as well as increased the status of the leader amongst their people. Modern-day traditional leaders accumulating wealth for private gain in a corrupt manner with no plan for redistribution should thus be seen as corrupt in customary terms as well as in modern terms. 110 See for example Robert J. Foster, (1995) Social reproduction and history in Melanesia : mortuary ritual, gift exchange, and custom in the Tanga Islands (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press). 111 Barcham, Manuhuia, (2005) \u201cConflict, Violence and Development in the Southwest Pacific: Taking the Indigenous Context Seriously\u201d Centre for Indigenous Governance and Development Working Paper Series No. 4/2005, Palmerston North. 112 An interesting aside is that changes in the mode of supporting traditional leaders have led to ambiguity about what is considered as corruption. Traditional leaders continue to perform many functions at the local level including conflict resolution and the like. However, old systems of informal support to chiefs for the provision of these services such as gardening, provision of food to chiefs and upkeep of the house have often been replaced by gifts of equivalent values in cash. In some circles receiving cash like this is seen as corrupt and so this form of giving has been discontinued with the ramification being that no-one is fulfilling these traditional functions. Comment made at the roundtable meeting convened by the UNDP on June 21, 2007, Suva, Fiji. 113 Comment made at the roundtable meeting convened by the UNDP on June 21, 2007, Suva, Fiji. 110 111 112 113 34 There is an associated problem that needs to also be considered though when we discuss the intersection of modern state practices with customary systems. In traditional times leaders were expected to provide for their people. To not do so, would be to corrupt the leadership institution that they held, be it an acquired or an inherited role. These traditional roles may, however, conflict with other roles they may hold as public officials. In this respect, modern political representatives who represent constituencies where they maintain strong affective ties (and this is especially true for areas where elected officials also hold traditional leadership roles) are in a double bind. Many of their constituents may not see a clear distinction between the role that they hold as a traditional leader (be it an inherited or an acquired role) and that they hold as an elected representative in a modern democratic state. This is especially so in the Pacific where, as noted above, various factors have meant that the power of the state does not extend uniformly across the geographic territory of the country. For many Pacific Islanders, the state is a remote, monolithic force which has very little impact on their day-to-day lives. Apart from when they may band together around a television to watch one of their national sport\u2019s teams take on the team of another country the idea of the nation-state has very little purchase for many Pacific Islanders. Instead their most immediate and pressing identity is that of a member of clan X or tribe Y. Combined these factors mean that many Pacific Islanders expect their elected leaders to provide material support for them. Indeed, to provide support to another group (which could feasibly be a traditional enemy of the government representative\u2019s group) at the expense of providing for your own group could, in some instances, be seen as a form of corruption. That is, a corruption of the traditional role that they fill, and that they have been entrusted to hold by the community . This example helps us begin to understand how a more in-depth analysis of traditional systems would help us not only understand why certain activities occur, but also why they are seen as corrupt by some but not by others. In 1996 a case was brought in the High Court of Kiribati where Teatao Teannaki, a former President of the country, claimed that Teburoro Tito, the country\u2019s current president, had unfairly rigged the presidential elections through bribery. The point of contention was the issue of te mweaka, that is, a traditional form of gift-giving. Teatao Teannaki claimed that Teburoro Tito had corruptly influenced people to vote for him by giving them gifts, drinks, passage and offering free tobacco as te mweaka. In his judgment, Chief Justice Lussick found that as far as he could ascertain, when mweaka is presented to a maneaba (public meeting house) for the purposes of the ceremony the maneaba is seen as being composed of three elements: the building itself, the people in it, and the spirits, or non living. The mweaka, in the form of tobacco, is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe44df4e-303d-49c6-9222-1fe24727814c": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe44df4e-303d-49c6-9222-1fe24727814c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8513ebd369f6dad19baef9394f4ef332b0744c3d811c3db240ac2308e07a4831"}}, "hash": "8513ebd369f6dad19baef9394f4ef332b0744c3d811c3db240ac2308e07a4831", "text": "presented in the manea-ba (one part) for the blessings of the spirits (a second part) and is later consumed by the people (a third part).

The presentation is to all three aspects the maneaba, the people present and the spirits, and the paramount purpose is to obtain the blessing of the maneaba, not to enrich the people present, even though it is realized that the tobacco will be shared among them.

So, for example, the good governance literature in general assumes that popular opinion is opposed to corruption, and is available as a resource to be used in anti-corruption programmes. But as Peter Larmour has recently pointed out while \u201cthere is popular grumbling about \u2018corruption\u2019, and anger against elites can be easily mobilised...popular opinion often seems in two minds \u2013 against corruption, but in favour of politicians who provide local or personal events or of timber companies who promise development\u201d. Many of the NISPAC reports thus described a reluctance on people\u2019s behalf when it came to act when corruption had taken place. However, this issue was not one of relativism or of different understandings what constitutes corruption but rather that people were either fearful of intimidation, reluctant to rock the boat by public criticism or were merely particularly forgiving \u2013 particularly of kin. Cultural factors, in this respect, were thus not causing corruption to happen per se but rather were allowing it to continue unchallenged. Given the factors presented above, there appear to be two clear paths forward in terms of harnessing the relationship between culture and corruption for anti-corruption efforts. The first is that there is a need for programmes of civic education in the Pacific and other nation-building measures. The state is an abstraction for many people in the Pacific. If misunderstandings between traditional and modern ideas are to be removed then more work is required to inform people of what they should and should not expect in terms of the state and its representatives. Useful work can also be done educating groups about the impact that corruption has on their everyday lives. Successful examples of this type of approach have been utilised in the Pacific by groups such as the Solomon Islands Development Trust. This type of approach is useful in that linking anti-corruption discourse to concrete issues such as access to vaccines and free education as opposed to abstract concepts like \u2018justice\u2019 and \u2018integrity\u2019 can help increase its uptake. The second is that more research is required exploring how \u2018traditional integrity systems\u2019 work. Given the need to take culture seriously in light of both the Pacific Plan and the Human Development framework simple programmes of reform which promote the modernisation of people\u2019s views and values simply will not do. The traditional cultural value systems will not just go away, thus work is required to explore how traditional and modern systems can be used synergistically to provide robust anti-corruption tools and frameworks. We should be aware that so far the discussion in this section of the report has been based on a dichotomy between traditional and modern practices whereas the reality is more complicated than that. Instead of a strict dichotomy between ideal-types the reality is that most Pacific Island countries and communities sit somewhere along a continuum where various elements of \u2018modern\u2019 introduced systems sit, often uneasily, along older customary forms. This is the case, for example, in periurban settlements where more traditional forms of custom have been displaced in the move to the city but introduced systems have not fully taken over. In these types of regions a form of hybrid system has emerged which has aspects of both ideal-types. These non-traditional systems sometimes operate through very different structures and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53151ad4-163b-4266-8ff6-1cd1b8051004": {"__data__": {"id_": "53151ad4-163b-4266-8ff6-1cd1b8051004", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7072258591ef51103a4585815adf47864efcc613499d7b1a3dbeb593393cfb4"}}, "hash": "f7072258591ef51103a4585815adf47864efcc613499d7b1a3dbeb593393cfb4", "text": "processes that those found in \u2018traditional\u2019 communities and so it is a mistake to try and understand the communities through a \u2018traditional\u2019 lens. This is not to say that these communities do not possess their own community structures and systems \u2013 they do. It is rather that the agencies wanting to work through these structures need to realise that they should not assume that they will work along \u2018traditional\u2019 lines. Cultures are dynamic and ever-changing and so we should be wary of those who wish to talk about culture as if it was a static phenomenon \u2013 with present day circumstances seen as being merely a degraded from of earlier \u2018traditional\u2019 culture. The many cultures of the Pacific are alive and well and draw from a number of traditions, both customary and introduced. This then brings us back to one of the key points of this report which is that in constructing anti-corruption programmes we need to be aware of the importance of context. 115 36 V. Conclusion/Recommendations Corruption is a problem in the Pacific. It exists in a number of sectors and has a negative impact on human development in the region. While the various countries of the region possess relatively well- developed regulatory and accountability frameworks the effectiveness of these systems in preventing corruption needs to be questioned. A number of issues might behind this lack of effectiveness. One might be a lack of \u2018fit\u2019 between introduced institutions and practices and local context. Another might be a lack of political will. The key issue though would appear to be a lack of capacity. In short, capacity shortfalls, in both an internal and external aspect, are a key lever behind issues of corruption in the Pacific. They provide not only opportunities for corruption but also inhibit the effective operation of anti-corruption policies and programmes. More data is required about why these frameworks and systems are not working. There are a number of measures that could be usefully utilised in promoting anti-corruption efforts in the Pacific that have been successfully utilised in other parts of the world. These include: \u2022 Increased Political Will \u2022 Political Parties \u2022 An Independent Commission Against Corruption \u2022 National Strategies \u2022 Codes of Practice \u2022 Demand-side Approaches \u2022 Coalition strategies \u2022 Accountability and Transparency \u2022 Report cards \u2022 Use of IT \u2022 Better measurement \u2022 Hotlines \u2022 Inter-agency task forces for investigating prosecuting corruption \u2022 National policy committee \u2022 Civil remedies regimes \u2022 Anti-corruption Legal Advisory Centres (ALACs) \u2022 Sectoral strategies \u2022 Traditional elders (eg. Great Council of Chiefs) \u2022 Civic education \u2022 Civil society coalitions \u2022 One-stop shops that bring local services closer to people Some of these measures are already under-way in the Pacific and/or have a long history as suggested points of entry in promoting anti-corruption efforts. However, given the findings of this report and the findings of earlier research, including the 2004 NISPAC study, I would argue that less work is required in building more anti-corruption institutions, or in trying to promote drastic political reform such as the construction of strong political parties in the Pacific. Instead I would argue that work should be focused on 5 key areas. 116 116 Larmour, Peter, and Manuhuia Barcham, (2004) National Integrity Systems Pacific Islands: Overview Report (Australia: Transparency International-Australia), pp. 14-18. 117 The belief that strong political parties would help promote stability, and in doing so reduce opportunities for corruption amongst other things, has a long history in the Pacific but no real traction has ever developed within the Pacific Island Countries\u2019 political systems in support of this idea. I would argue that nearly 50 years of empirical evidence would tend to suggest that strong political party systems will not emerge at any near future date in the Pacific and so it would be better for academic and policy debate in the Pacific to move on to more fertile and useful grounds for possible avenues of reform. 117 37 \u2022 Find out what is working in the Pacific, identify the critical success factors behind this success and then explore through pilot studies how these models can be successfully transplanted to other parts of the Pacific in order to facilitate learning; \u2022 More work is required exploring how \u2018traditional integrity systems\u2019 work in order to help us understand how traditional and modern systems can be used synergistically to provide robust anti-corruption tools and frameworks which can then be trialled through pilot studies; \u2022 Develop programmes of civic education in the Pacific and other nation-building measures which can be tied into work educating groups about the impact that corruption has on their everyday", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f19d78df-a8c3-4c94-9fe8-39f381080682": {"__data__": {"id_": "f19d78df-a8c3-4c94-9fe8-39f381080682", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c3a29e21e89d60089e79472153185154330ea3f6a2c4dc47f9843e24a4f7eddf"}}, "hash": "c3a29e21e89d60089e79472153185154330ea3f6a2c4dc47f9843e24a4f7eddf", "text": "lives. \u2022 Look at how regional networks can help reduce the capacity load on individual countries\u2019 anti- corruption institutions \u2022 Work with national governments, in a regional framework, to improve data gathering within countries and so improve monitoring abilities within the region Find out what is working in the Pacific, identify the critical success factors behind this success and then explore through pilot studies how these models can be success-fully transplanted to other parts of the Pacific in order to facilitate learning. Building on local success stories in order to use them as the basis for the construction of new anti- corruption structures and processes in different jurisdictions within the Pacific may provide opportunities to avoid the problems of low capacity and cultural misfit that plague current reform efforts in the Pacific. The successful transfer of the \u2018Melanesian Ombudsman Model\u2019 to Vanuatu from Papua New Guinea demonstrates some of the advantages of South\u2013South forms of policy transfer. South\u2013South forms of policy transfer seem to provide an answer to the problems of disparities between state capacity and cultural context that often bedevil North\u2013South policy transfer with successful structures and processes developed in similar countries being able to act as the template for successful transfer. More work is required exploring how \u2018traditional integrity systems\u2019 work in order to help us understand how traditional and modern systems can be used synergistically to provide robust anti-corruption tools and frameworks which can then be trialled through pilot studies. In order to understand better the whole area of culture and corruption in the Pacific it would be worthwhile to conduct in-depth studies of various Pacific Island cultures\u2019 \u2018traditional\u2019 integrity system. This research would help lead to a better appreciation of why there are mismatches between traditional and introduced systems and how elements of one system can enhance the effectiveness of the other. By utilising the \u2018best of both worlds\u2019 in anti-corruption activity this work should help academics and policy-makers understand why some programmes of reform succeed where others fail and so help them construct more robust and appropriate programmes of reform and action.

Look at how regional networks can help reduce the capacity load on individual countries\u2019 anti-corruption institutions Regional organisations (such as the Pacific Forum Secretariat) and regional peak bodies (such as the Oceania Customs Organisation) provide a useful way to reduce the capacity load on individual states. There are other advantages to this process as well. So, for example, the use of judges drawn from other jurisdictions to sit on various countries\u2019 High Courts not only provides a way to overcome shortfalls in human capital capacity within a country it also helps provide increased levels of impartiality by providing staff who are not embedded within networks of affective ties. Work with national governments, in a regional framework, to improve data gathering within countries and so improve monitoring abilities within the region The World Bank has suggested the use of broad-based monitoring processes including not only national statistical agencies but also other government agencies, members of the private sector and civil society groups as this multi-pronged approach facilitates the achievement of: \u2022 a greater local capacity to evaluate governance allows countries thereby allowing better prioritisation, monitoring, and development of both appropriate governance indicators and policy reforms; \u2022 encourages a more integrated and collaborative debate between government and civil society stakeholders over the policy making process; and \u2022 promotes a wider sense of ownership of the data and analysis, guaranteeing a true integration of the results into the policymaking process and greater longterm monitoring capacity. In a sense, this form of stocktake process has already begun in the Pacific.

In addition, the World Bank Institute\u2019s ongoing longitudinal study of governance indicators also provides another set of data which can be usefully woven together in any corruption monitoring process. Work with an organisation like CIET could also help. Combined these processes would provide an invaluable in-depth longitudinal country diagnostic at the country level. The information obtained from this monitoring can then be usefully woven into anti-corruption programmes. 118 118 The associated problem of course is that the lack of local connections of the incoming person could be disadvantageous in some positions eg Police Commissioners. 119 Kaufmann, Daniel, Francesca Recanatini and Sergiy Biletsky (2002) Assessing Governance: Diagnostic Tools and Applied Methods for Capacity Building and Action Learning a paper prepared for the WBI Staff Learning Course on Assessing Governance held on June 17-18, p. 17. 120 We should note that while it may always be nearly impossible to gain reliable data on corrupt activity itself we would be able to more clearly identify where corruption is occurring through clearer monitoring of financial systems, for example, so that we could see where leakage is occurring if better information was available. Indeed, better monitoring could actually act as a deterrent to corrupt activity as it may increase the chances o detection. 119 120 39 References ADB and OECD, (2001) Anti-Corruption Action Plan for the Asia and the Pacific \u2013 Tokyo, 30 November 2001.

Updated to June 2007. Compact with US Compact with US 46 Appendix 3: Anti-Corruption Initiatives in the Pacific Bi-Lateral Donors There are a number of bi-lateral actors in the Pacific which promote anti-corruption activities as part of their work in the region. Australia Australia has a firm commitment towards the promotion of anti-corruption activities in the region. At a generic level, anti-corruption reforms have long been implicitly contained in Australian development assistance in the region such as the Australia, Papua New Guinea Enhanced Cooperation Programme (ECP) initiative which began in late 2003 includes assistance in the areas of public sector reform, law and order, justice, economic management, border control and transport security. In this programme, police personnel and specialists from a variety of law and justice agencies as well as a number of Australian officials from other Federal Government Agencies such Treasury were seconded through to Papua New Guinea to work in finance, economic, planning and spending agencies. Political arguments over issues such as immunity to prosecution and where line management lay meant that this programme was shortlived. Similarly, The Australian governments work in the Regional Assistance Mission Solomon Islands (RAMSI) has contained implicit anti-corruption elements. The Australian government\u2019s commitment to fighting corruption in the region was further underlined in the Australian Government\u2019s White Paper on Aid to the Pacific. One of the key outputs of the White Paper was the need for the Australian government to develop a strategy to counter corruption in the region. The White Paper thus outlined a need for Australia to commit to mainstreaming anti- corruption efforts within all Australian aid activities as well as committing to support regional and global anti-corruption initiatives. As a response to this, in March 2007 the Australian government released a new policy booklet entitled Tackling Corruption for Growth and Development which outlines the three elements that they will focus on in its anti-corruption activities. These three elements are: \u2022 building constituencies for anti-corruption reform; \u2022 reducing opportunities for corruption; and \u2022 changing incentives for corrupt behaviour. In an attempt to provide a degree of coherency to their approach, the new policy calls for the Australian government to utilise a whole-of-government approach linking up the various overseas programmes being run by the following Australian government agencies: AusAID; Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Treasury; Department of Finance and Administration, Department of the Attorney-General and the Australian Federal Police.

The process itself is being managed through an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) involving the agencies named above and chaired by AusAID. Current work in the anti-corruption field being carried out by Australian government agencies in the Pacific include work by the Attorney-General\u2019s Department who are working with regional countries to strengthen legislative frameworks, help build capacity in anti-money laundering processes and help in recovering the proceeds of crime. As part of this initiative the Attorney-General\u2019s Department has created an Anti-Money laundering assistance team (AMLAT) . The Treasury and the Department of Finance and Administration are helping to strengthen financial management systems in partner countries while AusAID is helping with public sector reform, community engagement, and improved governance in service delivery. AusAID also provides core funding support to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in support of UNCAC and to the APGML to support their activities as well as support to the ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative. In addition, the Australian Federal Police is currently engaged in initiatives to improve capacity in the Asia\u2013 Pacific region to investigate fraud and corruption as well as more general work on building local capacity in the region in all aspects of policing work including transnational crime investigation. As part of this process, the Australian government has committed itself to the development of whole- of-government country aid strategies. These documents will act as the key joint planning documents for Australia\u2019s assistance to partner countries. Unlike earlier country aid strategy documents they will be updated to include countryspecific anti-corruption plans which will take into account existing anti-corruption policies, donor and local initiatives already under way as well as the country\u2019s overall needs and priorities. These more specific projects and programmes will thus link up with other ongoing assistance provided by the Australian government such as work in the law and justice sector more generally, as well as more general work on public sector restructuring including work on building capacity in financial management systems. In the 2007/2008 budget the Australian government pledged A$16.7 million towards anti-corruption activities in developing countries over the coming fiscal year. Taken in conjunction with Prime Minister John Howard\u2019s pledge to increase the amount of money spent on overseas development assistance to A$4 billion by 2010 (with this increase being strongly linked to improved governance and reduced corruption in the region) there appears to be strong evidence that the Australian government sees anti-corrution activities as playing a vital role in their future long-term engagement with the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f0794da-76d6-42b7-a8d4-848061c3f27b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f0794da-76d6-42b7-a8d4-848061c3f27b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa76c90e9c1e6524b5db57ae77cec94798c09796fa9ab87f52cdbcf8b32b284b"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ea7d1df-e0ef-4c28-86e9-11cf897fc953", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e76cd32b00414b42944f0a4890b1c39e1e006fe1e4363a18b33f459d97d7825"}}, "hash": "8423b224958819a5d5f3164928eae16d3cf58b0ad9879342a998804c3f22938b", "text": "126 127 128 129 48 New Zealand While NZAID or the New Zealand government does not have a specific anti-corruption policy there are aspects of anti-corruption work contained within their good governance programmes.

Over the last year they have contributed to the consul-tation process around ant-corruption by the World Bank, DAC and the ADB. European Union The European Union is undertaking some work in this area in the Pacific. As part of their regular mainstream development assistance work they construct governance profiles with their partner countries which act as strategic planning documents for five-year periods of European Union funding. These governance profiles have included specific anti-corruption activities with a number of their Pacific partners in their commitments towards promoting good governance within their respective countries. While not all governance profiles contain explicit commitments to anti-corruption activities they nonetheless in general contain commitments to elements of good governance such as increased transparency and accountability. If partner countries achieve the commitments they have agreed to in drawing up these governance profiles then they are entitled to receive extra funding above what had been initially agreed to with the European Union. At a more local level in 2006 the EU Pacific Delegation funded a Fijian judge to attend a series of EU meetings on corruption and present a paper at a EURO-JUST conference in Vienna. In addition, the European Union is also providing funding to Transparency International-Vanuatu to enable them to update their 2004 NISPAC country study. The European Union Pacific Delegation have done some work in conjunction with the EU Taxation and Customs Union Direc-torate-General (DG TAXUD) looking at tax havens in the Pacific. Other Bi-Lateral Donors The US State Department has been doing some work in the Pacific with the UNODC in the creation of a Pacific Anti-Money Laundering Programme (PALP). Launched in September 2006 at the Pacific Islands Forum in Fiji, PALP is a regional technical assistance and training programme designed to assist Forum countries in establishing and/or enhancing their anti-money laundering (AML) and counter terrorism financing (CTF) regimes to comply with international standards of the Finan- cial Action Task Force (FATF), relevant UN Conventions and Security Council Resolutions. 130 130 Accessed on Wednesday 4 July 2007 at 4:47 pm http://forumsec.org/pages.cfm/security/palp/?printerfriendly=true 49 131 The APG members in the region are Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Samoa and Vanuatu. The countries with observer status within the Pacific region are Kiribati, Nauru, Papua New Guinea and Tonga. Multi-Lateral Actors There are a number of multi-lateral actors and groups which operate in the Pacific which either have anti-corruption strategies as part of their work streams or are themselves focused on anti-corruption activities as part of their core business. Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF)/ Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) was founded in 1989 by the G-7 as the first co-operative policy response to money laundering. An Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering was then established in February 1997 as a direct result of FATF efforts. The APG is fully autonomous from the FATF. Membership in the APG is purely voluntary and it is entirely cooperative in nature. Ten countries in the Pacific region are full members of the Group while four other countries in the region possess observer status. 131 50 Australia Australia has a developed anti-money laundering system and is one of the founding members of the APG and is also a member of the FATF.

Table 3: Pacific Island Country Members and Observers of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering Members 51 ADB/OECD Asia-Pacific Anti-Corruption Initiative The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the OECD have combined to create an Asia-Pacific Anti- Corruption initiative. Seven countries from within the Pacific region have signed the Action Plan, these are Australia; Cook Islands; Fiji; Palau; Papua New Guinea; Samoa; and Vanuatu. This initiative is useful in the help it is able to provide individual member countries with the construction of National Action plans to help them fight corruption. A regional steering group serves as a forum for the exchange of experiences and is designed to enhance the capacity of those states that have difficulty in implementing their desired reform objectives. However, some members of Pacific regional organisations have expressed concern that the ADB/OECD Asia-Pacific Anti-Corruption Initiative is beginning to become increasingly lost in detail and as a result is losing its effectiveness as a platform for multi-country action. Pacific Forum Secretariat Until recently anti-corruption activity has not featured explicitly in the work of the Pacific Forum Secretariat. Instead a number of workstreams on associated matters have acted as a form of proxy anti-corruption work. In financial matters the Forum undertakes a biennial stocktake of the eight principles of accountability that the Forum Economic Ministers agreed to in 1997 . They have supported the recent establishment of a Pacific Transnational Crime Coordination Centre in Fiji, with the assistance of the Australian Federal Police, as well as the establishment of Transnational Crime Units and Combined Law Agency Groups (or CLAGs) in a number of Forum Island countries including Samoa, Kiribati and Fiji.

Then, in 2004, the Leaders communiqu\u00e9 expressed their will, as leaders of their respective countries, to consider signing and ratifying the UN Convention Against Corruption. In terms of achieving this goal the Secretariat was in discussion with UNDP, UNODC, USP, TI and the Government of Papua New Guinea with the aim of convening a number of subregional workshops on the ratification and implementation of this Treaty . In the last year the Forum\u2019s focus has changed slightly. Rather than focusing on the ratification of the UN Convention the Forum is taking a staggered approach. The Forum is thus working with member countries in the creation of a National Action plan (following the ADB/ OECD initiative). The expectation is that the creation of these National Action plans will allow them to follow the steps necessary for ratification of the UN Convention against Corruption. 132 For more information on this see http://www1.oecd.org/daf/ASIAcom/ 133 For more on this see Francis Hutchinson, (2005) \u201cA review of donor agency approaches to anti-corruption\u201d Asia Pacific School of Economics and Government \u2013 Policy and Governance Discussion Paper No. 05-03, Canberra: 8-10. 134 This stocktake draws in part on the IMF Code of Principles and Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency.

In signing this convention New Zealand made the provision that their ratification did not extend to Tokelau as New Zealand is committed to the development of self-government in Tokelau and so Tokelau could only be included under their act of ratification after appropriate consultation with that territory. 137 Notes on Pacific Islands Forum Work on Anti-Corruption presented at ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific 9th Steering Group Meeting, Bangkok, 27-29 November 2006, p. 2. 132 133 134 135 136 137 52 138 For more on the Pacific Plan see www.pacificplan.org 139 See Section 12.1 of the Pacific Plan. 140 Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, (2005) The Pacific Plan: For Strengthening Regional Cooperation and Integration (Suva: Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat). 141 Notes on Pacific Islands Forum Work on Anti-Corruption presented at ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific 9th Steering Group Meeting, Bangkok, 27-29 November 2006, pp. 34. The passage of the Pacific Plan \u2013 an agreement between Pacific Islands\u2019 countries which seeks to move members towards a higher level of regionalism in a number of areas under the key goals: economic growth, sustainable development, good governance and security, has led to a more direct focus on anti-corruption activities by the Forum. The Pacific Plan has thus specified as an immediate policy priority the strengthening of anti-corruption institutions in the region . The proposal includes the establishment of: \u2022 a regional ombudsman; \u2022 a regional audit service; \u2022 regional capacity to assist the collection of customs revenue; and \u2022 a regional anti-corruption agency. In pursuit of this, the Pacific Forum Secretariat is looking to commission a study looking at the pros and cons of a regional anti-corruption agency and these other proposed institutional support mechanisms at the regional level. In addition to this specific work on the issue of corruption, other workstreams in the Pacific Plan also impact on anti-corruption activities.

Regional Assistance Mission Solomon Islands (RAMSI) The regional assistance mission to Solomon Islands provides an example of a jointregional effort to fight corruption. One of the key bodies created by RAMSI to combat corruption in Solomon Islands is the Participating Police Force (PPF) Corruption Targeting Team (CTT). With 14 police investigators drawn from both the SIPF and RAMSI\u2019s regional Participating Police Force, investigations by the CTT have already led to charges being laid against two senior government officials, two senior statutory officer-holders, three former provincial premiers, five former national ministers and two former prime ministers. In addition, a Financial Intelligence Unit has been established by Solomon Islands government with support from RAMSI\u2019s Economic Governance Program and Anti-Money Laundering Assistance Team (AMLAT). The unit operates as an autonomous department under the auspices of the Central Bank and it is beginning to play a role in the prevention and detection of money laundering, the gathering of intelligence on the suspicious movements of money through the country\u2019s banks and other financial institutions, as well as suspect cash dealings. Other work being done through the Economic Governance Program includes working with the Inland Revenue Department to establish transparent and accountable processes including the relaunch of a code of conduct specifically for Inland Revenue staff last year. RAMSI Economic Governance program is also providing assistance in a range of areas including strengthening financial management through building the capacity of the Department of Finance and Treasury (DoFT) to undertake responsible financial management and to provide advice and assistance to other government departments. The economic governance pillar is supporting the Economic Reform Unit (ERU) of the DoFT to develop and implement economic reforms and targets the economic regulatory environment. In addition to these activities, RAMSI is capacity building in the Customs and Excise Division of DoFT, the Inland Revenue Division of DoFT, supporting the Solomon Islands National Statistics Office, and assisting various parts of the Central Bank of Solomon Islands. Within the RAMSI Law and Justice pillar, work is continuing to strengthen a range of justice sector agencies and institutions including the Courts and the Director of Public Prosecutions and considerable work is ongoing in strengthening the Solomon Islands Police Service. The RAMSI Machinery of Government (MoG) pillar continues to undertake a range of relevant activities including strengthening the primary government accountability institutions of Ombudsman\u2019s Office, Office of the Auditor-General and Leadership Code Commission. The MoG program is also supporting the parliament through UNDP including strengthening the parliamentary committee process, strengthening government transparency via supporting the government\u2019s use of ICT, enhancing the \\broader mechanisms and processes of public service administration through strengthening the Public Service Commission, supporting the Solomon Islands media, and developing new important programs in key areas of civic education, women-ingovernment and electoral support.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba7df0d4-a449-4cb6-8774-42ebf90580a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba7df0d4-a449-4cb6-8774-42ebf90580a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fdbe34621cfcfc3d1be0b76c2074c4952e52c78abf73589e370c27eaa5e99f4e"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5df147b-6b7f-418c-8517-a17b65a8ed0f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69279e18fcf250f5d9e0134ed6663119fc543e0146d35bc8cd3ee37716f24eb5"}}, "hash": "d6c45db923f297a911279fa3910a483d870b51feebfcf43ebf8805e32ffb24a0", "text": "Through their Machinery of Government programme RAMSI are also working with the Auditor General\u2019s Office 142 143 144 54 145 The twenty-three member countries are American Samoa, Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, FSM, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Norfolk Island, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Wallis and Futuna. 146 For more information see www.ocosec.org 147 The PIDC is the official regional forum for Official Pacific Immigration Agencies of the Pacific Region.

In this Declaration a series of administrative remits to assist and speed up inter-agency co-operation were adopted and regional financial institutions were urged to co-operate as fully as possible with law enforcement in an effort to deter money laundering and other serious financial crime. to increase its monitoring capacity. The accompanying increase in capacity has seen the Office of the Auditor General table 10 special audits in parliament in the last year alone. The last audit to be tabled by that office before now was in 1987. There are still problems, and the lack of an Ombudsman is a clear example of the issues that still need to be sorted out in Solomon Islands. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) through its Country Offices and the UNDP Pacific Centre is supporting initiatives to improve transparency and accountability. Working through the various Parliamentary Support Projects, UNDP is helping develop the capacity of Parliamentary Public Accounts Committees to enable them to effectively exercise their oversight functions. Other initiatives implemented through the Pacific Centre include support to the development of Information Disclo-sure Policy, promotion of Freedom of Information and the establishment of the Regional Ombudsman in partnership with the PIFS and Commonwealth Ombudsman of Australia. Regional Peak Bodies Within the Pacific, a number of peak bodies operate which bring together representatives of the various sectors which play a part in anti-corruption activities. One of the largest of these organisations is the Oceania Customs Organisation (OCO) which consists of twenty-three customs administrations within the Pacific. Previously known as the Customs Heads of Administration Regional Meeting (CHARM), OCO brings together the Heads of the Pacific\u2019s various Customs administrations for an annual meeting. At these meetings, discussions focus on the promotion of harmonised and simplified customs procedures, the introduction of new methods and a forum for a general exchange of information . OCO is actively working with other agencies and regional organisations in developing coherent regional approaches to particular issues of concern. And so, in respect to the issue of money laundering, the OCO has deve-loped a working relationship with the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering Secretariat. Other regional peak bodies of importance to anti-corruption efforts include the Pacific Immigration Directors' Conference (PIDC) , the South Pacific Chiefs of Police Conference (SPCPC) and the Pacific Islands Law Officers Meeting (PILOM). These specialist law enforcement organisations in the region regularly liaise and interact with one another . Representatives from these various agencies regularly attend each others annual meetings as observers. This degree of cooperation extends to the creation of joint documents such as the presentation of a joint paper by OCO, SPCPC and PIDC to the 2002 Pacific Islands Forum Regional Security Committee meeting. 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 55 152 For more on the work of SPASAI see www.sapsai.org 153 The national chapters are found in: Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. 154 The NISPAC Study included the following countries: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afc983ff-ea54-466b-a701-6aaceb8c5219": {"__data__": {"id_": "afc983ff-ea54-466b-a701-6aaceb8c5219", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5e311ecd6d86b3a15940abdabde02ae1131b075e90377072b7fca15f710e87d"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f16c3c7-0bd6-47bb-bc0a-5f9cca132133", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc115d523069da354de66c1b3674b787fae8848fb9c2b751229523c7e29a3fb7"}}, "hash": "f499857ca8701b61519caa94dab7ac51c87db8307b3274d43689bc617cc0b8c7", "text": "The NISPAC study did not include studies of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand as they were completed as part of other National Integrity System projects.

Initiatives are currently underway to create one new regional network and strengthen another. Initial meetings have been held towards the creation of a regional network of ombudsmen support services among Pacific Island, Australian and New Zealand ombudsmen. Work by the ADB is also helping strengthen the audit functions of the members of the South Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (SPASAI). These forms of organisation are useful as they can help to reduce the capacity load on individual states through information sharing and the like. And, in some cases, they can reduce capacity load in other ways. One example would be where customs officials might take processes and structures from discussions at their regional meeting and adopt them into their work practices without needing to wait for legislative changes. Non-Government Organisations and the Private Sector Transparency International Transparency International (TI), the international anti-corruption NGO, has a number of chapters in the Pacific region. Representatives from these chapters meet once a year at an annual regional meeting. TI has been quite active in promoting anti-corruption activities in the region. As discussed above, together with AusAID, Transparency International-Australia ran a 12-country study of National Integrity Systems in the Pacific (NISPAC) . As individual chapters they have been quite vocal in their anti-corruption advocacy work. The Papua New Guinea chapter, for example, has been pivotal in the establishment and running of a Community Coalition Against Corruption (CCAC). Started in 2002, the CCAC is jointly coordinated by the Media Council of PNG and TI PNG. A loose network of community leaders who come from the public, private, and civil sectors the CCAC acts as an anti- corruption advocate around particular issues. In the last few years, the CCAS came together to oppose two private Member's Bills that they believed would be detrimental to Papua New Guinea\u2019s anti- corruption efforts. The CCAC are currently working with the PNG Electoral Commission to ensure that the 2007 national elections are fair, effective and democratic. At a regional level too they have played a particularly vocal role in the field of anti-corruption. In their Kooralbyn Declaration signed on 24 August 2003 the various Pacific Chapters of TI called on all Forum countries to become parties to and implement the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime. They also urged the countries of the region to endorse the Anti-Corruption Action 152 153 154 56 155 http://archives.pireport.org/archive/1999/april/04-08-03.html 156 http://archives.pireport.org/archive/2005/february/02-01-com.htm 157 Donald Shuster, (2004), \u2018Palau\u2019 Transparency International Country Study Report (Blackburn: Transparency International-Australia), p. 17 and Peter Larmour and Manuhuia Barcham, (2004) National Integrity Systems Pacific Islands: Overview Report (Australia: Transparency InternationalAustralia) p. 14. 158 Peter Larmour and Manuhuia Barcham, (2004) National Integrity Systems Pacific Islands: Overview Report (Australia: Transparency International-Australia) p. 14. 159 Taafaki, Tauaasa, (2004), \u2018Tuvalu\u2019 Transparency International Country Study Report (Blackburn: Transparency International-Australia), p. 42. 160 Roughan, Paul, (2004), \u2018Solomon Islands\u2019 Transparency International Country Study Report (Blackburn: Transparency International- Australia), p. 27.

Finally, and as one would expect of an NGO, they urged regional donors to support civil society in anti-corruption efforts at both a national and regional level. Transparency International is also currently looking at refurbishing the NIS model to include a greater emphasis on measurable indicators. AusAID is also supporting the Asia-Pacific Dept of the TI Secretariat in Berlin to strengthen the national chapters of TI across the region, and regularly provides small-scale funding to TI national chapters in the Pacific to support their activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83bcb1f7-4d23-415d-b034-fa9ac87c77a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "83bcb1f7-4d23-415d-b034-fa9ac87c77a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce84e3fc02ec35c0fb19aabeae82086b1f759e289713110b39b35362a4798965"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e05fad3-2619-465d-82c6-ad07b203908b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7069bb4be5f94ab1be704b0ba90d6d22187a3f3bb7d63854c9a342392b1b19d1"}}, "hash": "29d260142169838d9b5b140c7a4828157a6501568c066155808b9e27b763260d", "text": "Finally, as noted above, at a local level Transparency International-Vanuatu has obtained funding from the European Union to update their 2004 NISPAC country study.

We must be aware as noted above that certain members of churches have sometimes participated in corrupt activity such as the example of the Tuvaluan minister dismissed from the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d80e1df5-d7b1-4d84-a978-276b515408b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "d80e1df5-d7b1-4d84-a978-276b515408b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Corruption in Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/corruption-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "233f711400de14469251c50e583655fc42f41efcc25c15dd33c6895872800472"}}, "hash": "233f711400de14469251c50e583655fc42f41efcc25c15dd33c6895872800472", "text": "Ekalesia Kelisiano a Tuvalu (EKT) church for the misappropriation of funds. Media There is a long history of media reporting against corruption in the Pacific although it has often led to threats against the media. In Palau the radio reporter Alphonso Diaz had three cars firebombed while a newspaper editor in Solomon Islands has been physically intimidated by thugs associated with publishers have been deported from Vanuatu and Palau. In some Pacific Island countries formal and informal controls on the media are strong such as in Tonga where the government has amended the consti-tution to allow it to ban newspapers. In the Tuvalu NISPAC study the report described how the media were \u2018ruthlessly and heavily censored\u2019. And, in some countries like the Solomon Islands, the local press have effectively self-censored themselves. Despite this the press in the region have generally reported corrupt activity when they can, despite threats of personal intimidation. Other NGOs In addition to the work being carried out by Transparency International which focuses exclusively on anti-corruption activities, there are several other NGOs doing work in this area in the Pacific as well. The Pacific Centre for Public Integrity (PCPI) based in Fiji is a relative newcomer, working regionally with a specific anti-corruption mandate. A variety of other NGOs include anti-corruption activities within their work on democracy and human rights, women\u2019s rights, good governance and/or community development. In Fiji, the Citizens\u2019 Constitutional Forum (CCF), has been doing work in this area since the late 1990s, including community education and advocacy on the need for legislation to implement freedom of information and code of conduct provisions of the Constitution, and advocating greater follow-up on apparent cases of corruption identified by the Auditor-General. In 2005, the CCF published the report of a workshop it co-hosted in 2004 with the Journalism Programme at USP entitled A Freedom of Information Law for Fiji. 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 57 Private sector In the Pacific the Private Sector has supported anti-corruption efforts in a number of ways including support of organisations such as Transparency International as well as more direct lobbying of government. This lobbying has often occurred through peak bodies such as local chambers of commerce. In Solomon Islands in early 2007, for example, the local chamber of commerce and industry has raised questions about the performance of the lands department. Questioning the legality of certain land dealings and ownership transfers the chamber of commerce has called on the government to commit itself to attacking corruption, inside and outside the government and public service. 161 161 http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=31072 58 UNDP Pacific Centre 2nd Floor, YWCA Building Ratu Sukuna Park, Suva Fiji Islands Tel: +679 330 0399 Fax: +679 330 1976 URL: http://regionalcentrepacific.undp.org.fj", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f0ffead-930b-4bfd-ad8b-28e1c54a094b": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f0ffead-930b-4bfd-ad8b-28e1c54a094b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/cracking-hdi-human-development-indexing-exercise-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Cracking the HDI: Human Development Indexing Exercise 2005", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/cracking-hdi-human-development-indexing-exercise-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba1f506e7f2dfc5564b72f626f84294cabb15e93abe80b01d952da1251775df6"}, "3": {"node_id": "afcde070-ab7a-4af8-8e63-077f66ae0542", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/cracking-hdi-human-development-indexing-exercise-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "268a7001ebcc8918e8dee8994e5ded525f549291b929a62b5bb0ace0ac103555"}}, "hash": "2590b14d652fcd1ba5d0ec9da113d7291dee3e8689dd6dadd50c5857fa1df016", "text": "Cracking the HDI Human Development Indexing Exercise APRI Asia Paci\ufb01 c Regional HDR Initiative UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo i APRI Asia Paci\ufb01 c Regional HDR Initiative UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo September 2005 Cracking the HDI Human Development Indexing Exercise ii Cracking the HDI: Human Development Indexing Exercise Contents Preface iii Acknowledgements iv Section One : Measuring Human Development 1 I.

It demonstrates that indexing is a simple idea and the actual steps can be mastered by anyone with basic high school mathematics. The docu- ment is in three sections. Section one is about measuring human development, and in particu- lar, covers the idea of indexing, its strengths and limitations, principles of calculating an index and actual steps in the calculations. It shows how the HDI is used to represent, very simply, three dimensions of the aggregate human condition of a particular geographic area. Section two contains an exercise based on data for three imaginary countries \u2013 Masalabad, Guinea Town and Messifeng. The exercise requires the calculation of the HDI for each and \ufb01nally comparing the three values to draw conclusions on ranking to help compare the three imaginary countries. The repetition in calculations \u2013 repeating the steps three times for the three countries is expected to help in \ufb01rmer understanding and learning. Section three provides the solutions.

Measuring human development involves us- ing speci\ufb01cally selected variables or indicators and aggregating them to create summary in- dices. The HDI has become a \ufb02agship summa- ry measure to represent human development achievements of a particular geographic area3, for a year. It captures three dimensions \u2013 a) a long and healthy life b) knowledge c) a decent standard of living. A good question to ask is why go beyond the GDP in measuring progress of nations? The limitation of income as an exclusive measure of development becomes evident as we rec- Section One Measuring Human Development 2. Other commonly used indices are the Gender Development Index (GDI), the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) and the Human Poverty Index (HPI). 3. Usually a country, but also for sub national units and country clusters or groupings. 2 Cracking the HDI: Human Development Indexing Exercise ognize that many choices do not depend on income. For example, even a rich landlord in a rural area may not have access to reliable electricity or underground sanitation; a female may be considered old enough to marry at 15 years of age in certain communities depriving her of education and other freedoms. Moreo- ver, income is subject to diminishing marginal utility and an exclusive focus on per capita in- come does not take into account how income is distributed or utilised. III. Strengths and Limitations of the HDI T he strength of composite indices, like the HDI is that being a single number it is sim- ple to present. It can be used as a powerful advocacy tool to catch the attention of policy makers, media and NGOs which can expand the debate to focus on human outcomes. An- other strength is that a composite index can o\ufb00er a multi dimensional view of social and economic phenomena by capturing a broader information set. For example, the HDI attempts to capture the health, education and income related achievements in one single \ufb01gure. Indices also help monitor progress, facilitate comparisons across time and geographical ar- eas and help in setting measurable targets. Composite indices however do have their limi- tations. Any index is only a summary - much more limited than the broader concept it sets out to measure. The HDI for example, is far more limited than the concept of human de- velopment, just as the GNP is far more limited than the concept of economic prosperity of a nation. The HDI cannot provide a complete picture of human development as many criti- cal aspects of the human condition cannot be quanti\ufb01ed. Even for aspects which can be quanti\ufb01ed, it is sometimes di\ufb03cult to obtain consistent and reliable data across time and space. Nevertheless, the HDI has proved to be a use- ful shorthand way to map the human condi- tion, not unlike the GDP which represents the economic condition. IV. Principles in Indexing I ndexing is neither di\ufb03cult nor a mystery \u2013 anybody with high school mathematics can do it once he knows the logic behind it. This exercise is meant to take the reader through the logic and sequential steps involved in the calculations. Once the logic is clear, it can even trigger o\ufb00 ideas to modify and customize the index for other applications. Typically, indexing is a simple process of ag- gregating individual variables or indicators to obtain one summary measure. Since individ- ual indicators are expressed in di\ufb00erent units of measurement, they cannot be combined together unless they are made scale free. This is the \ufb01rst step. In some cases all selected indi- cators do not move in the same direction (e.g. mortality rates cannot be combined with lit- eracy rates because higher mortality is consid- ered bad whereas higher literacy is desirable). All indicators have to be made unidirectional Measuring Human Development 3 \u2013 say by taking reciprocal values for some. Following this, the scale free values are given desired weights (a subjective decision) before completing the aggregation.

Obtain actual data for the rel- evant indicators This may be the most time consuming part. As seen above, the HDI captures three dimen- sions \u2013 a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living. Indicators for each of the dimensions can be seen in Ta- ble 1. Step 2. Convert dimension indicator(s) into unit free values to facilitate ag- gregation through construction of di- mension indices The indicators used are measured in di\ufb00erent units. For example, life expectancy at birth is in number of years, the literacy rate and enrol- ment are in percentages, and GDP per capita is in US Dollars. They cannot be added as they are. For aggregation they have to \ufb01rst be made comparable. In order to do this we \ufb01rst calcu- late separate, scale free sub indices for each dimension. This can be done in di\ufb00erent ways. The HDI uses the method called \u2018division by own range\u2019, the range being the di\ufb00erence be- tween the maximum and minimum values of the respective indicators4. The maximum and minimum values are called the goalposts of the indicators. Identify goalposts for each indicator. This means the maximum and minimum value for each indicator. Theoretically life expectancy, literacy and enrolment as well as incomes can be zero at a minimum. But to be more mean- ingful, minimums are taken to be lowest val- ues observed historically by going back 30 years. Regarding the maximum values, theo- retically income could be in\ufb01nite \u2013 leading to a division by in\ufb01nity. For life expectancy it is not immediately clear what the maximum should be. Of course for literacy and enrolment 100 percent makes sense as the maxima. For the HDI maximum values are those that can be en- visioned in the next thirty years. For example, when looking at GDP, economic growth rates can indicate that maximum income that rich- est countries are likely to achieve by 2020 is $ 40,000 (in 1990 $ PPP). 4. One could also divide by the mean values of the dimension indicators. 4 Cracking the HDI: Human Development Indexing Exercise Calculate dimension indices. These are cal- culated using the formula: Dimension Index = actual value \u2013 minimum value maximum value \u2013 minimum value Each di\ufb00erence in indicator value from its min- imum is divided by its range (Max - Min), using \ufb01xed values or goal posts in order to get unit free numbers. They also have the nice prop- erty of varying between 0 and 1. Dimension 1: Long and healthy life The indicator used to measure this dimension is the life expectancy at birth. This is de\ufb01ned as the number of years a newborn would live if prevailing patterns of age-speci\ufb01c mortality rates at the time of birth were to stay the same throughout the individual\u2019s life. Dimension 2: Knowledge Knowledge is measured by two component indicators \u2013 adult literacy rate and combined gross enrolment ratio. Adult literacy rate is de- \ufb01ned as the percentage of people ages 15 and above who can, with understanding, both read and write a short, simple statement related to their everyday life. Combined gross enrolment ratio is the number of students enrolled in pri- mary, secondary and tertiary levels of educa- tion, regardless of age, as a percentage of the population of o\ufb03cial school age for the three levels. Calculating the Knowledge dimension index involves two steps. First, to determine each component index by simply calculating the index for the each of the two component in- dicators. The second step involves calculating aggregating the individual component indices into the Education Index by giving appropri- ate weights. In this case adult literacy is con- sidered more important and given a higher weight of two-thirds and enrolment a weight of one-third.5 Thus, combining the adult liter- acy index (with two-thirds weight) and com- bined gross enrolment index (with one third Table 1: Three dimensions of the HDI, indicators and corresponding goalposts Dimension Indicator Maximum value Minimum value A long and healthy life Life expectancy at birth 85 25 Knowledge Adult literacy rate (%) Combined gross enrolment ratio (%) 100 100 0 0 A decent standard of living GDP per capita (PPP $US) 40,000 100 5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4643e5fa-ac6f-4c42-94a3-386d59f895ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "4643e5fa-ac6f-4c42-94a3-386d59f895ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/cracking-hdi-human-development-indexing-exercise-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Cracking the HDI: Human Development Indexing Exercise 2005", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/cracking-hdi-human-development-indexing-exercise-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be6eda78f36a2116b4cf3ff5450381d5db7b27f65985180e82b277e0a6858c45"}, "2": {"node_id": "62737604-05ab-43a7-b992-d06141f7353f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/cracking-hdi-human-development-indexing-exercise-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3b77bad5a3386986ed06c0aa66354ec911952391c830e158af29e478e12a4ec"}}, "hash": "ce4c1ee4e38e3aa6f32647709f078c36d001968a7f71658545c907a7e4375025", "text": "One can, of course, choose other weights.

In order to maintain global comparisons the measurement is made in US$ with purchasing power parity (PPP) \u2013 i.e., a measure that equal- ises the purchasing power of di\ufb00erent curren- cies by converting all to a common currency. The GDP per capita index is calculated using the same dimension index formula. However there is one di\ufb00erence here. The logarithm of income is used in the formula instead of the actual income \ufb01gure. The reason for this is that income needs to be discounted since unlimit- ed income is not required to achieve a respect- able level of human development. Moreover, income is subject to diminishing marginal util- ity. Until 1999, income above a cut-o\ufb00 point (world average per capita income) used to be drastically discounted. From 1999, however, a more gradual discounting is done throughout by using the logarithm of income. Step 3. Final aggregation of the scale free dimension indices to obtain the HDI Finally the HDI is calculated by calculating the simple average of the three dimension indi- ces i.e. adding the three indices and diving by three. VI. In Sum T he methodology explained in this exer- cise is the standard one used in the glo- bal HDRs. However, each country may come up with their customized indices using the simple principles of indexing explained here - i.e. identi\ufb01cation of appropriate indicators, identi\ufb01cation of corresponding goalposts or average values, calculation of dimension indi- ces to make the indicators unit free and \ufb01nally combining them, either by assigning equal or di\ufb00erent weights. The global HDI assigns equal weights to each dimension and hence it is a simple average of the three dimension indices. Cracking the HDI: Human Development Indexing Exercise 6 Section Two Human Development Indexing Exercise I. Instructions The exercise consists of (i) calculating the HDI for three imaginary countries (Masalabad, Guinea Town and Messifeng); (ii) ranking the countries according to the HDI value obtained; and (iii) based on the HDI index, indicating whether these countries would be among the high, medium, low human development countries. To facilitate your calculations, indicators for demography, income, education, health and environment are provided for each country at the end of this exercise. Moreover, the maxi- mum and minimum value for certain common indicators are given in Table 1 below. To make the exercise even simpler, here \u2018s the log of some numbers. You will need to refer to this table for the calculation of the HDI Table 1.

Note I u Background to the Note This note is based on lessons learned from documenting experiences and programmes that incorporated human right-based approaches (HRBAs) in several Asia-Pacific countries from the year 2004 to the present time. The initial observations of such experiences and programmes resulted in the documentation and publication of fourteen case studies in countries as diverse as Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Viet Nam, the Philippines and Fiji under the aegis of the Asia-Pacific UN Inter-Agency Lessson Learned Project (LLP) on the HRBA to Development.1 After completion of documentation of the case studies, there was a need to decipher what lessons could be learned for future developmental programming. There was also a need to comprehend what \u201cthe value- added\u201d would be in practically implementing a programme which incorporates HRBAs at all phases of project implementation \u2013 from planning to delivery of outputs to documentation \u2013 and which would involve all stakeholders at all stages. Thus, in 2006, the LLP partnered with civil society groups, UN agencies, quasi public sector organizations like National Human Rights Commissions (NHRCs) and select line Ministries in various countries to undertake such an exercise. Six pilot projects were initiated in mid-2006 in Afghanistan, Laos, Viet Nam, Fiji, Mongolia and Thailand. The projects focus on various sectors like the media, mining groups, the informal justice sector, and ethnic minorities.2 These pilots are ongoing, and quite a few lessons have already been gleaned from testing the applicability and value of implementing programmes that use HRBAs (since documentation of the pilot project activities from the planning to implementation to results/outcomes are a vital aspect of the pilot projects\u2019 activities). Such documentation allows for a constant analysis of the approaches used; it also provides invaluable programming lessons for all stakeholders involved. For the communities, such documentation provides an opportunity to undertake evidence-based advocacy with the State and service providers and provides a framework wherein they can further their dialogue with diverse stakeholders. For development agencies, this documentation feeds into the process of sustainable change and capacity development on rights-based programming through a deeper practical understanding of the relationship between human rights and development and the means/ know how to operationalize that relationship on the ground.

However, challenges arise since pure mobilization efforts appear to invite resistance from duty bearers and sets up confrontationist relationships between rights holders and duty bearers. So, the opening of dialogue and negotiation spaces must sequentially follow mobilization.

In this way, the farmers were able to interface at various levels about the problems faced by them.13 Public audits and community media dialogues via radio have been supported by CSOs in the Philippines to enable citizens to dialogue with local officials to ensure accountable governance.14 In all these cases, the forums have provided vital space for duty bearers and rights holders to interface, discuss, dialogue and, ultimately, influence policy change. Similarly, mobilization tends to raise expectations among rights holders and, therefore, makes them vulnerable unless backed up by concomitant ability to provide for incentives, to influence the delivery of services, or to influence the enabling policy context. AAN and Nijera Kori15 as well as Taungya16 (the other case study documented from Bangladesh on the use of rights-based strategies by an NGO to mobilize indigenous peoples (IP) groups to manage their forest domains) list the sustenance of mobilization efforts related to the above as dominant challenges. So, a challenging area for further research and intellectual pursuit is the reconciliation between the need for mobilization fervour and managing expectations. An understanding of this is key to successful HRBA programming. ii) The application of legal approaches \u2013 positives and negatives: At the same time, purely legal approaches that rely on accessing and petitioning a country\u2019s justice system and that use international human rights principles and standards as a basis for the attendant delivery of justice as a matter of entitlement for its citizens \u2013 though it has resulted in some positive outcomes \u2013 often poses challenges as far as \u201caccess\u201d is concerned.

Thus, the informal, community-based mediation, negotiation and reconciliation methods that have marked Indonesian adat20 systems have historically played a central role in meting out justice to many citizens.21 Clearly then, a paradigm of peoples\u2019 justice needs to be constructed. This is a large area of future programming because it is immensely nuanced. Such as the fact that traditional justice systems do have their merits (like dispensing speedy justice or in ending tribal wars in Afghanistan), but often militate against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) \u201cnon negotiables\u201d. These mechanisms therefore cannot always provide the most balanced approach to dispute resolution, wherein citizens can claim access to justice to reconcile disputes as a matter of right. Indeed, for many, traditional norms serve to bolster local biases and prejudices without adequate checks and balances. Women in particular, under such systems, frequently fail to secure the fair and impartial consideration required for lasting dispute resolution. The ongoing participatory assessments in Afghanistan that are being conducted under the LLP pilot project to decipher the hurdles citizens face in accessing formal justice systems clearly highlight that a major challenge is the unquestioned power that the jirgas22 have in settling disputes. Such disputes often involve honor killings and exchange of women and young girls as resolution mechanisms. Hence, it is not only a case of designing new peoples\u2019 justice mechanisms, but also of launching effective advocacy and reform to usher in necessary modifications in the manner in which the justice systems operate. iii) The intersect between social mobilization and legal approaches \u2013 an effective strategy for claiming rights: The third emerging theme is the nexus of mobilization and legal redress, which relies on the usage of a combination of tools that are employed under both the social mobilization and legal approaches; for instance, combining social audits and public hearings along with filing public interest litigations (PILs). In the cases documented on securing the right to information and the right to food in India as well as on the experiences of Indian WLHAs in advocating for anti-discrimination policies23, it is evident that mobilization yields, or can yield, the best results where there are appropriate 17 Case study on \u201cUsing Rights-Based Programming Principles to Build Capacities to Claim Rights: The Regional Rights Resource Team UNDP Project in the Pacific Island Countries\u201d, by P.

Firstly, merely possessing rights (as codified by international conventions and treaties, and reinforced by countries\u2019 constitutions and legal frameworks) have not led to these groups realizing these rights. Secondly, it is often difficult to access these rights without using an entitlement-oriented approach. It is against this background that the nexus of mobilization and redress can be juxtaposed \u2013 that there is a body of evidence (as corroborated via the case studies and the ongoing pilots) that reaffirms that such a nexus or intersect is often the only means available for people to communicate with the State and service providers and enforce their needs/claims/rights. Such approaches highlight the shift from the language of mere policy to the language of rights (which are hence enforceable). Policy implementation history \u2013 as far as the realization of rights are concerned, when not complemented by legislation \u2013 have often been punctuated with failures as there is no consequence on the State or other duty bearers (service providers like public sector delivery officials, for instance) in the case of non-fulfillment of the policy provisions. However, if these are enforced via legislation, the duty bearer is accountable for their implementation. Courts and legal judgments also evoke significant interest in the media. In India, for instance, it has been seen that all successful PILs have triggered powerful responses in the media and have helped evolve, sensitize and mobilize public opinion and ultimately, the concerned decision-makers \u2013 often the judges or the policy-makers/ legislators/politicians \u2013 on the particular issue. Conversely, many of the cases documented and the pilots implemented (like, in the case of Mongolia) have developed strategic partnerships with the media to publicize and highlight their campaigns, especially those concerning courts and litigation. The fact that such social and judicial activism has been the greatest mobilizer of the public \u2013 including duty bearer opinion - is often underscored. Therefore, the efficacy of conceiving rights as a matter of entitlement, particularly in areas that require urgent concentration and action, should be highlighted and should be a fundamental focus in HRBA programming. 24 Ibid.

It is interesting to note in this context that conventional developmental tools that solicit participation of communities have been used to optimal impact to secure rights in as much as those that can be termed \u201crights-based\u201d tools which are being employed to directly influence policy and target unequal power relations.

In almost all the case studies documented and in some of the LLP pilots currently being implemented in Afghanistan, Mongolia and Thailand, there is evidence of the use of/or the combination of the use of these techniques or building blocks. i) Advocacy and lobbying: Advocacy and lobbying \u2013 whether it be for social mobilization purposes to create spaces for the poor or for awareness and pressure-building to impact upon policies \u2013 is one of the most important building blocks used. Almost all the cases documented as well as the current pilots being implemented bear testimony to the usage of such a tool.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6facf877-58b7-4a86-8e63-a22c207c1ba8": {"__data__": {"id_": "6facf877-58b7-4a86-8e63-a22c207c1ba8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/documenting-emerging-lessons-learned-human-rights-based-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Documenting Emerging Lessons Learned for Human Rights-Based Programming", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/documenting-emerging-lessons-learned-human-rights-based-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b132e6101c220e4c99fe1c34529b68397fea5a98418d7d715aa792d5c3b0e12"}, "2": {"node_id": "3968db0a-c586-4985-a027-dc64ef6c0395", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/documenting-emerging-lessons-learned-human-rights-based-programming", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d6f75a627a26011cb59f68fbf6e4c0efc0b86d490e0aa7737dc85313849f18e"}}, "hash": "91c1db7d0352095f3c7d306f452de98d86ebf2e7febe48aff3e90c256c0dcc58", "text": "Advocacy in the form of protests, 7 The Role of Building Blocks: Techniques Used for Securing Realization of Rights campaigns, blockades and gheraos26 has been widely used for impinging on duty bearers to undertake proper application of the existing laws and for undertaking joint initiatives with multi-stakeholders for resolving local problems.

In the LLP cases documented, however, it was found that such techniques were also employed to secure rights. For instance, in the case study on claiming the right to education for poor, interior rural communities in Cambodia, UNSECO Phnom Penh helped develop the capacities of local community members in the villages to undertake such surveys. Realizing that these people did not possess the capacity to undertake surveys, UNSECO prepared the questionnaire, taking care to ensure that the survey reflected issues that were representative of the communities. Thereafter, capacity development in the form of survey training was conducted for literacy facilitators, village supervisors and commune supervisors, who prepared plans for primary data collection. These people were also trained to write up the results of the village surveys.28 Such surveys are also being undertaken in the community learning centre (CLC) sites in northern Thailand under the LLP pilot project. These surveys are designed to ascertain the status of implementation of the current policies that are the subject of intervention \u2013 they better assist the project implementers to design strategic areas for focused interventions. Likewise, village mapping techniques have been utilized in Laos by the residents of Houay Hid village in Luang Prabang province. Undertaken in collaboration with district water and sanitation officials, such mapping enabled the Centre for Environmental Health and Water Supply (NAM SAAT) officials and UNICEF Laos to obtain village data relating to religious profiles, ethnic minority composition profiles, history of migratory patterns of the villagers and so on. Data generated thus proves invaluable in designing appropriate community-focused and community-led interventions.29 iii) Citizens\u2019 polls/citizens\u2019 report cards: Participatory surveys and opinions highlighting citizens\u2019 concerns can help in mapping out such concerns in a story form and can help influence policy-level issues. In the Philippines, the Centre for Community Journalism (CCJD) \u2013 the media organization whose strategies were the subject of study \u2013 and one of its partners, the Radyo Veritas Legazpi Program (PBN-DZGB) Broadcasting Network in Bicol province, polled citizens in one bangaray30 that expressed concerns about a cement plant which was to be set up in that area. Such polls led to a series of discussions that ultimately led to the citizens (in participation with the local government officials) developing a series of guidelines under which the plant could operate in that municipality.31 iv) Focus group discussions/community dialogues: Meso (middle)-level duty bearers like NGOs and media groups use community dialogue that allows them to mix with communities and carry out conversations with them without being too probing and intrusive. In Kidapawan City in the Philippines, radio reporters started engaging local citizens in conversations to address issues about which they really care. They developed a daily programme called Pulso Ng Bayan (Pulse of the Town) based on these insights.32 In Laos, community dialogues provided the key entry points wherein communities could put forward their demand to NAM SAAT officials for the supply and the subsequent owning, using and maintenance of water and sanitation services.33 26 Spontaneous protests in which a large number of people besiege an institution to gain redress against a perceived injustice.

It has taken RRRT and its partners many years of advocacy and dialogue to get the judiciary to agree to participate in such a process. This landmark event enabled members of the judiciary to listen to concerns of the community in areas relating to gender, poverty, disability, children, minorities and governance and their perceptions of justice. The evaluation of the event revealed that the judiciary was extremely receptive to this process because it enabled them to obtain a first-hand account of the manner in which citizens perceived the justice system. Although it is too early to tell whether the dialogue will translate into any significant changes at the policy and grassroots level, the process, in itself, enabled groups to gain access to influential decision-makers.34 Combining FGDs with community dialogue allows for more targeted discussions on issues with stakeholders in the communities. The Visayas Examiner (TVE), a newspaper based in Iloilo City in the Western Visayas region in the Philippines, used FGDs to develop stories that eventually led to advocacy and campaigning for targeted issues. Through these FGDs, communities that considered themselves indigenous started organizing themselves with support from the local CSOs against the construction of a dam that was being planned by a multinational corporation. The dam, if constructed, would have displaced these people from their lands because the areas upriver would have then been used as watershed areas. Thus, in opposition, none of these communities signed the affidavit that would actually have given them land in other areas in order to move from their current land.35 The Mongolia LLP pilot project partners have used FGDs and dialogues to design a public debate on the implications of the new mining legislation for the communities concerned. The results of such debates will be used as evidence-based advocacy materials while filing a PIL in the national court against exploitative practices employed by many mining companies. v) Participatory assessments: Locally-appropriate PAs using various strategies is another block that has been utilized. The most common form of PAs that are used are the participatory poverty assessments (PPAs). These are being undertaken by various developmental agencies and CSOs to plan and implement developmental projects with the primary focus of enlisting the views and opinions of various stakeholders \u2013 and to give the communities opportunities to participate \u2013 in decisions that affect their lives. In the Nepal REFLECT process, while PPA tools like social and resource maps and preference ranking have been used in the political literacy process, the process \u2013 while promoting political literacy and developing a situational analysis \u2013 has gone a step further and used seasonal calendars, song writing, myth and story-telling to enlist community participation. The use of such locally-appropriate PA tools helps to structure the analysis in a systematic way (see Box 3).36 34 Ibid. Refer to footnote no. 17. 35 Ibid. Refer to footnote no. 14. 36 Ibid.

Local dalits raised issues relating to education, landlessness, local governance, and citizenship \u2013 lack of documentation of citizenship places obstacles in these people accessing the legal systems and public services \u2013 as areas of concern. The process and outcome of the situational analysis strongly supported the formation of a social movement/organization to represent the dalits.37 In Afghanistan, the ongoing LLP pilot is using participatory assessments to decipher the obstacles that hinder people\u2019s access to formal justice systems. Such assessments will help UNDP Afghanistan to develop and design a larger \u201cAccess to Justice Programme\u201d in which peoples\u2019 perceptions and needs are reflected in programming. With the objective of gathering evidences, which will be collated and then presented as a complement to the PIL that will be filed in the Mongolian national court on banning exploitative mining practices, the ongoing LLP pilot is undertaking such assessments in various sites to gather evidence-based perceptions of mining communities that are being impacted by such practices. vi) Participatory budgeting: An important building block used is the tool of participatory budgeting.

This process develops community capacity to view changes and outcomes analytically and to internalize the impact of such outcomes. The \u201creal\u201d qualitative change perceived by the poor and excluded rights holders is the main objective of this process. Many of the process activities that the communities undertake as a part of the REFLECT strategies have this ongoing monitoring process inbuilt. The following activities/tools (or a mix of these) were adopted in the REFLECT PRRP process: a) Social mapping by the community members b) Mapping of resources, programme benefits, etc. c) Community meetings \u2013 of both male and female rights holders d) Learners\u2019achievement test in non-formal education/other alternative schools e) Visit by government officials to sites of physical assets/programmes created by the project f) Discussions with community members who have been imparted training in RELFECT methodologies g) Discussions with the community members who have been left out by the project h) Discussions with the government teacher/any employee who could be easily contacted in the village during the exercise Going beyond traditional participatory M&E, such monitoring has also spilled over to ensure accountability of duty bearers on claims made. In the case of monitoring the Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS) \u2013 a nationwide government-sanctioned school food voucher programme \u2013 a regular system of monitoring the provision of a daily meal in the government-run schools has been developed and is being used in quite a few Indian states. In the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, one member organization that is part of the campaign to secure the right to food is trying to ensure regular monitoring of meals in a large number of schools by using a simple questionnaire. Such a system entails a visit to the local primary school without prior announcement, and enquiring about the mid-day meal from the teachers. The monitoring is done at the time the mid-day meal is served, and the process is observed to ensure whether the food served has passed through several quality-control measures. All these questions are included in the simple questionnaire that the monitor fills out during the visit.40 viii) Public hearings: Public hearings have been used as a building block in various countries to mobilize communities around specific issues; to create awareness amongst local communities about the various services that the State at different levels should provide; to document and highlight specific instances of denial of such services; to present testimonies that detail the instances of denial to public officials and expert panelists; to emphasize the structural deficiencies in facilities underlying such cases; and finally, to present the larger structural deficiencies related to the system, based on surveys and analysis of key issues (see Box 5). 40 Ibid.

Such hearings, held nationwide, have proved invaluable in submitting PILs and in successfully lobbying the Indian Supreme Court to pass judgments on the right to information and the right to food.42 Public Hearings facilitated by UNIFEM South Asia and the National Commission of Women (NCW) \u2013 attended by decision-makers, government representatives from the Departments of Health, Education and Social Welfare; public and private medical professionals; and, NGOs \u2013 have been held in the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. For the first time ever, in the context of HIV/AIDS, public hearings in India were held to bring together stakeholders in a constructive manner. WLHAs deposed at these hearings and spoke of the stigma and discrimination in health and educational settings, denial of property, and discrimination by various members of society.43 ix) Public interest litigations: The legal tool of PILs have been used to optimal impact in India in making the government accountable on internationally agreed-upon human rights standards and in setting a global legal precedent as far as the right to food is concerned. Against the backdrop of the Indian state not fulfilling its basic obligations to its citizens in relation to realization of the right to food, an informal coalition of Indian CSOs and individuals committed to the realization of this right came together and started the \u201cRight to Food Campaign\u201d in 2001.44 The Campaign is an outgrowth of the Supreme Court hearing on the right to food, held in response to a writ petition filed in April 2001 by the People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), a human rights NGO, in the north-western Indian state of Rajasthan. This case is technically and popularly known as \u201cPUCL Vs. Union of India and others (Writ Petition [Civil] No. 196 of 2001).\u201d Briefly, the petition demands that the country\u2019s gigantic food stocks should be used without delay to protect people from hunger and starvation. Initially, the case was brought against the Government of India, the government-run Food Corporation of India (FCI), and six state governments, in the specific context of inadequate drought relief. Subsequently, the case was extended to address the larger issue of chronic hunger, with all states and union territories (UTs) as respondents. Interim PILs submitted from time to time by PUCL advocate the introduction of nation-wide (combined with social security) arrangements for those who are unable to work and have further enlarged and consolidated these demands. In the process, it has succeeded, to a large extent, in making the right to food justiciable by lobbying to get the Employment Guarantee Act (EGA) and other related food-security programmes passed and in lobbying the Supreme Court \u2013 the highest legal authority in the country \u2013 in holding the state governments accountable if this right is not met. The methods used have also helped poor, vulnerable and marginalized groups realize other rights, like the right to education, the right to a livelihood and the right to information. x) Social audits: Social audits are increasingly used worldwide to make duty bearers and organizations accountable for the objectives and activities that they are supposed to perform. Strategies surveyed under the case studies found that such audits were used to solicit not only accountability of duty bearers, but also organizational \u2013 for instance, an NGO\u2019s \u2013 accountability mechanisms towards stakeholders (the communities it works with). In India, the Mazdoor Kisan Shakthi Sangathan (MKSS) used social audits to draw attention to the underpayment of daily wage earners and farmers on government-run projects, and more generally, to expose corruption in the state of Rajasthan. Conducted by local villagers, these audits were used as hard documentary evidence in jan sunwais to hold public officials to account on government-run development projects. They were successful in drawing public and media attention 41 Ibid. Refer to footnote no. 9. 42 Ibid. Refer to footnotes nos. 3 and 4, respectively 43 Ibid. Refer to footnote no. 5. 44 Ibid.

The initial key issue to address is that of the constraints on developing capacities. Based on the purview of the cases documented and the pilots being implemented, these can be captured as follows: g Incentives and sustaining motivation: Sustaining the motivation levels of the communities poses constraints in developing capacities. The nature of poverty within communities means that most residents are earning subsistence incomes where a single day\u2019s loss of income translates into a day without food. Both case studies from Bangladesh demonstrate such constraints. In the Nijera Kori case study, it was found that in situations where landless groups have been struggling for many years without much success and where many have had to face arrest and even imprisonment, it is not surprising that individuals leave and groups become demoralized. The fact is that operationalizing a HRBA \u2013 without using any service delivery/incentive components in a strategy \u2013 while at the same time, encouraging poor and vulnerable groups to break with past relationships of dependency on patrons and to stand up for themselves (often at some personal and economic cost) can have contradictory implications for those who join its groups and who stay within them. On the one hand, it can lead to a process of self-selection in that it is unlikely to have a great deal of appeal for the better-off sections of society. On the other hand, the absence of immediate economic gains may discourage the longer-term participation of the very poor, particularly if group membership jeopardizes precarious day-to-day survival strategies that depend on maintaining the patronage of powerful sections of village societies.47 g Heterogeneous nature of groups: The heterogeneous nature of community groups, coupled with often fractious sub-group loyalties among rights holders and relationships of power within cohorts (including elite capture of mobilization goals) are a major challenge in developing and sustaining capacities. Evidence of this has been documented, for example, in the case studies from Fiji, Cambodia, Nepal, and Bangladesh.48 Moreover, elite capture of local power structures can pose a challenge to the resistance put forward by community members. The extent to which the local configuration of power is dominated by, say, a few powerful landlords or tribal chiefs, membership of kinship groups, divisions based on gender and so on can seriously undermine capacities to mobilize on a sustained basis. g Limitations in working with meso-level duty bearers: Major limitations also exist within meso-level duty bearers \u2013 NGOs, other CSOs, international NGOs (INGOs), the UN, and donor agencies \u2013 that work with communities and the primary duty bearers in developing capacities to claim rights and to discharge obligations respectively. The existence of too many NGOs in one operational area (both geographical and issue-based) can place a constraint on the selection process of the most \u201csuitable\u201d ones and on developing their capacities. NGOs \u2013 with conflicting and incoherent ideologies, interests, internal hierarchies and the competition for donor funds \u2013 are also seen as pushing \u201cdonor-driven\u201d agendas or as performing \u201cwatchdog\u201d functions in some countries. Such in-country sensitivities and internal 47 Ibid. Refer to footnote no. 8. 48 Ibid.

It has only been in the case of the Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS) in India that duty bearers set up people-friendly policies that hinged on stakeholder participation and accountability mechanisms to deliver education to children belonging to IP communities living in remote locations.49 In most other cases documented, duty bearers often responded only after public pressure or after efforts were made to adequately sensitize or engage them in stakeholder dialogues and programming initiatives. This has been evident in the case of UNICEF Laos, wherein it focused its efforts to work with the NAM SAAT officials to develop their capacities to design, implement and manage sustainable community water systems in collaboration with the communities).50 Targeting low receptivity and sensitization levels without being overtly overbearing or patronizing is therefore a major capacity development constraint. The response to all of the above is thus the use of focused capacity development strategies that targets various levels to effectively use the building blocks. This will be dealt with as follows: i) The first level of the strategy could address specific community sub-group capacity needs: e.g. Java farmers requiring capacities to participate in budget allocation dialogues; Mongolian civil society capacities developed to sensitize the formal justice system to be responsive or even pro-active; Afghan and Cambodian village community members capacities being enhanced to participate in local-level surveys; Uttar Pradesh miners requiring capacities to form unions; the capacities of dalits in Nepal being developed to fight oppressive social practices and to participate in social audits; Thailand CLC members requiring capacities to actively participate in drafting local-level budgets; HIV-positive Indian WLHAs capacities being developed to advocate for gender-specific policies; the Indian poors\u2019 capacities enhanced to participate in jan sunwais; IP communities\u2019 capacities in the Philippines being built to organize after participating in FGDs and so on. ii) The second level of the strategy, which is a specific area of focus within the capacity development response, is the role of the catalytic nurturer or the meso-level duty bearer, such as the locally based CSO or NGO. These agencies are organically linked within the community, hold longer-term stakes and can be effective repositories of high levels of capacity, sensitivity and outreach ability. They are also important programming channels for other meso-level duty bearers like INGOs, the UN and donors. There is evidence of berthing and nurturing new ideas and in building effective coalitions and networks that can sustain mobilization at various levels. The evidence is based on the role of NGOs and other meso-level duty bearers as documented in the right to information and food cases, the Sankalp case, as well as the HIV/AIDS case from India; the Nijera Kori case from Bangladesh; the Philippines case; or, in the case study from Fiji.51 These roles need to be strengthened and supported. iii) Finally, at the last level, as the Fijian and Indonesian case studies on access to justice52 and the pilot in Afghanistan demonstrate, while there is no moving away from the nation of a receptive and supportive system of state institutions, there is, at the same time, a need to take into consideration the role of informal institutions in affecting outcomes that lead to the realization of rights. This dual form of capacity development indicates the need to remain engaged in advocacy and sensitization aimed at both formal and informal state structures and functionaries. Such dual capacity development measures could thus involve, for instance, not only working with the Afghan and Indonesian formal justice court systems to effectively and efficiently dispense justice; it would also entail working with the traditional jirgas and the adat justice systems to enable them to deliver justice that, while rooted in traditional Islamic customs and norms, are gender-friendly. Similarly, it would mean developing the capacities of Fijian local village chiefs so that they become sensitized in order to design and implement local- 49 Ibid. Refer to footnote no. 6. 50 Ibid.

Box 6: Using the Media to Effect Change Realizing the positive role that community radio can play as a tool in undertaking advocacy, the UNESCO Phonm Penh-initiated project \u2013 \u201cConflict Prevention and Resolution through Education: Education for Peace and Development\u201d \u2013 used an indigenous radio channel, Radio Kampot, as an advocacy tool to publicize the activities and related outcomes under the project. Hearing their own achievements broadcasted via the radio served to encourage the local communities and the public officials in the two communes to participate more pro-actively in the programme activities. It also made public officials at the central level aware of the project activities and outcomes, and of how accessing the right to education and training under a \u201cculture of peace\u201d (and other such associated activities) can help previously rights-unaware communities proactively participate in developmental processes. In conclusion, it can be seen that while the merits of using the approaches as analyzed in this note are many and have led to the securing of a process wherein rights in a given sector are being realized at varying levels, it is crucial to not undermine the challenges involved in implementing such approaches. At the same time, the use of the building blocks and associated capacity development strategies that target various levels of stakeholders are vital and need to be recognized. It is thus imperative to analyze in more details the key role capacity development can play in the rights realization process, as well as how such capacity development strategies could be integrated into all phases of programming under an HRBA framework. This could be a topic for further inquiry. 53 Ibid. Refer to footnote no. 14. 54 Ibid.

The Network is closely connected with the regional Asia Pacific Human Development Reports initiative. It is a forum where stakeholders in the region can identify and suggest relevant themes for the reports, as well as participate in guiding the direction of a report once a theme has been selected. Launched in 2005 as a part of the regional consultations on the theme for the Asia Pacific HDR (APHDR) Trade on Human Terms, the Network was re-invigorated, following the UNDP Management Board\u2019s decision to focus on corruption as the next APHDR. Stakeholders were engaged in a critical discussion on sub-themes, solutions, best practices, measures and indicators in light of the postulated two\u2013way link between corruption and human development. Several new members were added to the Network, regional specialists as well as those with particular interest in anti-corruption work. The ensuing discussion was lively, intense and covered a range of issues. It generated a wide, deep and rich body of material some of which was subsequently incorporated in the technical background papers and the APHDR, Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives. Given that the AP- HDNet has tangibly demonstrated its usefulness, the Human Development Report Unit will continue to rely on it for discussion and feedback, as well as for advocacy purposes. The main lessons learned - logistical and technical - from the discussion for Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives were: o It is useful to have an initial draft of introduction / questions to guide the discussion for the different themes. However, these have to be revised in line with the evolving discussion and research findings. o It is also expedient to have a few contributions ready in addition to some commitments for contribution before each discussion topic is launched. This not only ensures availability of quality contributions to spark off the discussion but it also helps to step up the discussions when there is a slow down. o In our experience, it is more efficient to prepare messages in Outlook Express. We spent much more time than expected on the technical aspects of LYRIS. We would like to acknowledge with many thanks all contributors who gave their time, knowledge and experience so generously. Without them this exercise would not have been so rich and fruitful. We are also very grateful to James Chalmers who facilitated the discussion and contributed in preparing the synthesis. Our thanks are due to Vinita Piyaratna and Manisha Mishra for editing the consolidated discussion.

Tackling Corruption Transforming Lives, is the latest Report in a series of regional APHDRs. Themes of previous Reports are: 2006: Trade on Human Terms: Transforming Trade for Human Development in Asia and the Pacific (Winner of the 2007 Human Development Award for Excellence and Innovation) 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals 2003: HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia The APHDR is considered a regional public good primarily because it serves as an important policy advocacy resource as well as a valuable instrument for stakeholders, enabling them to influence policies across countries in the region. The country utility of the Report stems from the intensive process of consultation with a wide range of stakeholders in theme selection. This process narrows down the focus of the Report, through research, discussion and feedback using the AP-HD Network, developing the main messages, report preparation, launch and advocacy. Any theme for an APHDR must be topical and pass at least one of the three regional tests, which are: o It must be of concern to several countries in the region. o It must have sensitivities that are better addressed at a regional level. o It must have clear cross-border dimensions. Thus, by the very nature of its mandate, the HDRU works with a wide range of stakeholders who guide the direction of Asia Pacific Human Development Reports. In order to define the scope of the APHDR, identify priorities and decide \u2018what should be in\u2019 and \u2018what should be out\u2019, the HDRU organizes Sub-Regional Stakeholders Consultations in the region and undertakes discussions on the Asia Pacific Human Development Network. Stakeholders include governments, civil society organizations, media, experts, academia, research institutions, UNDP country offices, United Nations Agencies as well as a range of other interested parties. v Table of Contents The Asia Pacific Human Development Network _____________________________________ iii Asia Pacific Human Development Reports _________________________________________ iv I.

The results of the discussion enriched the Report and gave it a sharper focus on the poor. The discussion is, of course, a part of a broader process of consultation, which already included three sub-regional stakeholders consultations in Asia and the Pacific [1]. The discussion was moderated by an external expert, supported by the HDRU Team as and when necessary. The launch message indicated that the discussion would involve four sub-themes (political economy, social services, natural resources, benchmarking) and would conclude with an exchange of views and ideas over the benchmarking of formal anti-corruption agencies and the media.

Social services were split into two sub sectors (health and education, and water, sanitation and electricity); benchmarking was abandoned; and two new sub-themes - special development situations and corruption in the police - were added. The discussion also included a final round on \u2018localisms\u2019 and idiomatic expressions of corruption, which, owing to space restrictions, has not been included here. The HDRU Team decided to restrict the survey on benchmarking to the UNDP country offices in the region and developed a questionnaire towards achieving this purpose. At the close of the discussion, members were asked to respond to a survey on their preferences for the direction and format of the next phase of the AP-HDNet discussion. While the discussion of each sub-theme was focused and targeted, members were asked to keep the following issues in mind: o The postulated two\u2013way link between corruption and human development. o The extent to which human development (freedoms, voice, choices, empowerment, access to information, social services, livelihoods etc.) contributes towards curbing corruption. o Potentially effective policy solutions and anti-corruption measures. o Ideas on innovative and creative solutions to mitigate the effect of corruption, on the poor and disadvantaged groups. I. Transforming Corruption Through Human Development: Synthesis of the E-Discussion Synthesis of the E-Discussion 4 Asia Pacific Human Development Network 1.2 Political Economy The discussion was wide-ranging, focussing on a wide range of issues such as justice, values, voice, democracy, civil society participation, media independence, importance of debate, consensus within a community, communication and the human capability to understand the universal value of intolerance towards corruption. One of the key emerging issues is that trust is critical for the holistic development of civil society. Another is the view that people have little confidence in the likelihood of political leaders assuming the social courage associated with shaping public integrity. Even so, the discussion yielded an important message: the search for a single \u2018root cause\u2019 of corruption is basically of no consequence. In and of themselves, neither poverty, illiteracy, weak civil society, nor exploitive institutions are singularly responsible for corruption. They combine to play a major role in the fight against corruption, but each of these factors are derivative, rather than the first principles of what causes (or remedies) corruption. However, the discussion instead boosted the value of an approach that traces the origins of corruption to the social sites of material production. It is those spheres in which societies produce wealth that need to be targeted by anti-corruption strategies. In other words, demand for corruption originates in sites of production, not in exchange transactions, which neoclassical theory focuses on. More specifically, the discussion endorsed the probability that corruption is, in the first place, connected to shortages, under-spending, under-valorisation of public goods and the people who both provide and are entitled to them. For instance, these issues are clearly manifest in scarcities such as M & E mechanisms, which increase the taker\u2019s incentives. Hence, it can be surmised that demand originates early in the process of societal production processes \u2013 certainly prior to exchange or market transactions, where ostensibly \u2018persons come together to maximize their respective best interests\u2019. With regard to the definition of corruption, there was agreement that the conventional definition fails to capture the impact that corruption has on public-decision-making and thus on democratic processes. There was further consensus that this oversight can be addressed by identifying the full range of key players involved in corruption: givers, takers, objectors, and bystanders, with the primary focus on demarcating which side an actor is on, and who initiates and who follows the lead. Such an approach encompasses persons in the private sector who supply the opportunities and reasons for public servants to commit corrupt acts (a shortcoming in the conventional debate). It also includes, again atypically, a range of professional actors who facilitate or legalise corruption. And while criticising passive bystanders who tolerate corruption, very importantly the discussion also emphasises the role of victims who invariably are the poorer sections of society. 5 In summary, this discussion explored the perspective of an actor\u2019s motivation, emphasising the role of incentives in corruption and how incentives link with expectations. Underlying this proposition is the idea that official expectations (trust and rights associated with provision of public goods) ironically tend to operate alongside as well as at odds with unofficial expectations - in essence personal gain that extends to family and allies. From this angle, tolerance of corruption can be described by how greater incentives exist for personal gain than for providing public good. This is a perspective that endorses tolerance for human frailty and human ambivalence.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd61919e-6d15-4953-8ad0-13ff570acd2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd61919e-6d15-4953-8ad0-13ff570acd2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "358cfa53cb8296efb8f6a6ecb0e373dd397daf80763366758b89b0bae1f8a8f5"}}, "hash": "358cfa53cb8296efb8f6a6ecb0e373dd397daf80763366758b89b0bae1f8a8f5", "text": "It emphasises that corruption is generated by factors such as regulations and norms of office. These differ according to contexts (incentives, disincentives, strength of institutions, civil society, distribution of wealth and consequent degree of peace, independence of the media and judiciary, and access to information and peoples\u2019 grasp of it). The upshot is the view that the goal cannot be zero tolerance of corruption, but rather intolerance of turning a blind eye to it. This approach is closer to the political economy approach advocated by some contributors as it focuses on uncovering motivation within relationships at the level of production. What explains corruption? The key finding of the discussion is that the explanations differ according to a range of power factors, which again are traceable to sites of production, and attributable largely to factors of shortage in poor countries. In fact, to understand the element of motivation better, the discussion moved on to reflect on integrity defined as \u2018the use of entrusted power for public good\u2019. The primary motive underlying this shift in focus was to gain a better understanding of the forces that shape integrity, in a bid to identify factors that could be integrated into anti-corruption strategies. In particular, this included questions about the role of duty and how it is influenced by moral, emotional, or imaginative intelligence. For example, what roles do reputation and leadership play as drivers of integrity? It was noted that in Kant and Nussbaum\u2019s studies, there is no requirement according to which acts of integrity are solely motivated by duty. More simply, the motive of public responsibility is sufficient to bring about integrity. Indeed, if an act is solely motivated by duty, then it is possible that a specific action could maximize the social good but still not be right, and therefore ought not to be done, especially if it violates the vital aim to develop capability in all persons. If duty is an insufficient cause, then what other factors shape integrity? It was noted that Kant and Nussbaum seem to endorse actions shaped by the social emotions (like courage), as against actions that stem purely from an abstract perspective of \u2018duty\u2019. This is because motivation, like courage, embodies personal commitment, which goes beyond the line of duty. However, since Synthesis of the E-Discussion 6 Asia Pacific Human Development Network emotion is fallible, in the same way that objectivity is, it needs to be combined with a sense of duty to ensure a more comprehensive form of motivation. This part of the discussion served to deliver a better understanding on decision-making associated with public trust and rights. Additionally, in turn, it underlined the fact that decisions are informed by capability, which, although inherent, needs to be fostered by public investment. Thus, the \u2018integrity\u2019 part of the discussion assisted the discussants in grasping the importance of public investment in social goods as an integral factor in developing decision related capability. It was further agreed that such initiatives must be broad-based and include all sections of society, given that corrupt acts, in particular, affect those with less opportunity to develop capabilities associated with \u2018legitimate and appropriate behaviour\u2019. Who is in a position to judge what is termed as \u2018legitimate and appropriate\u2019 behaviour and what social norms and values is such a judgement based on? The implication here is that defining \u2018corrupt\u2019 behaviour or integrity necessarily involves a sociological component. This raises the question as to what specific kind of \u2018sociology\u2019 is required. Given the group\u2019s focus on the poor, discussants touched on the need for a sociology that zeros in, rather than abstracts away from, the political economy of decision-making, or on the sites of economic relationships where incentives originate. Additionally, it requires a sociology, which is able to explain or at least factor in the origins of meanings, values, and social emotions that different actors in different places see in such incentives. In sum, understanding what is corrupt and what is not goes beyond identifying a particular abstract norm that characterizes a specific situation. In order to know which norm to apply and how to interpret it in a particular instance, requires knowing a great deal more about social emotions and how these are codified or culturally represented in different communities. This, the discussion agreed, further underscored the need to adopt a \u2018contextualised political economy approach\u2019. An approach of this kind, for example, could blend an analysis of corruption incentives with examples of integrity that express different codes of political courage and other social emotions.

It is important to note that this \u2018contextualised political economy approach\u2019 does not universalize the definition of corruption. On the other hand, this approach avoids the concept of any universal definition applicable to all countries at all times. Instead it emphasises the 7 importance of different values, norms, and customs of particular cultures and institutions that contribute towards arriving at a definition. Just as importantly, it avoids limiting corruption to the public sector. The discussion raised other important issues. It touched upon the dimensions of managing corruption, or more specifically, on reducing public tolerance or \u2018closing our eyes\u2019 to corruption. In other words, it refused to pinpoint on society as the chief culprit. Rather, it advocated exploiting the capabilities of individuals to become aware that their interests lie in no longer condoning corruption as the foundation of mainstreaming anti-corruption measures. In response to analysing different forms of corruption (who or what initiates the problem), the discussion explored targeted types of management. For instance, discussants touched on questions of which kinds of anti-corruption institutes are the most effective and under what circumstances and particular political environment. Does this require: a single institute with powers to prevent prosecute and investigate?; single institutes with mostly preventive mandates?; multiple units and mandates interspersed in different government departments and institutions? Beyond policies and procedures, what are the characteristics of the various anti-corruption frameworks that attest to ability to withstand market forces? Other key questions that surfaced during the discussion included: o Are there strong social forces driving integrity (vulnerability-reduction), and what are the key factors that could strengthen these social forces? o With regard to the public condoning of corruption, and distrust of leadership, what are the local challenges that will possibly arise in mobilising a new generation of political leaders? What organisational structures hamper women\u2019s ability to fight corruption once they achieve significant power? o Mainstreaming anti-corruption means individuals taking responsibility for behavioural change. Thus, how vital is the role of decision-making and participation? What specific ways does empowerment, access to information, education, etc. contribute to transformation of corruption? How can decision-making or participation be measured? o Diversity with regard to norms does not preclude the need to identify the extent to which values can be embodied in a human development approach to anti-corruption. Although western presumptions tend to under-cut universal experience of corruption, what are the thresholds around specific norms, values, and expectations that could be included in the conceptualization of a human development approach to anti-corruption? Synthesis of the E-Discussion 8 Asia Pacific Human Development Network 1.3 Health and Education The leading drivers of administrative corruption in health and education are political and economic factors in all their various cultural expressions. There was a consensus among the participants in the network that under-investment by governments was one of the principal drivers of corruption. One critical consequence of under investment is that wages are too low to enable officials to make a decent living, and this in turn not only increases the likelihood of demand for unofficial payments but also affects the reliability of services. In the final analysis, it is the poor who remain the most vulnerable. They may, for example, make unofficial payments but their children still receive a poor quality of education or in some cases payments are made and no service is provided (ghost schools are common). One of the principal hazards in the health sector (an outcome of supply-demand dynamics) is fake and unsafe medicines. Another major problem that continues to plague poor communities is the prevalence of predators in areas of semi-urban and rural health services, in the form of \u2018quacks\u2019 or fraudulently qualified providers. In addition, properly-qualified doctors in the public system often illegally moonlight in private practices. Under-the-counter payments are also common, sometimes just to get care. One survey in South East (SE) Asia showed more than a third of \u2018artesunate\u2019 anti-malarial drugs contained none of this active ingredient. The survey estimated that Indonesia\u2019s pharmaceutical market contains 25 per cent fake drugs, in India, the relevant number was 20 per cent of the market, and in the Philippines, nearly a third of drug outlets were estimated at carrying fake drugs. To counter this, legislative efforts are being initiated to make counterfeiting drugs a crime against human security. Another contributor decried the lack of anti-corruption measures in India\u2019s public health service. He urged much greater systemic vigilance to ensure due diligence by the clinicians, as in the absence of this, it remains impossible \u2018to differentiate between a malarial death from disease burden/delay in initiation of treatment/drug", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b5c56fa-2761-47df-8893-fc6f22cef10b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b5c56fa-2761-47df-8893-fc6f22cef10b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "38cf29befbd6ddb49442761143f982fce5b29c4e6c4301348b09685de5850ef3"}}, "hash": "38cf29befbd6ddb49442761143f982fce5b29c4e6c4301348b09685de5850ef3", "text": "resistance/poor drug quality/poor compliance\u2019 etc. Another contributor warned that a major challenge in the Federated States of Micronesia is that it is being used as a clearinghouse for imported drugs. Contributors increasingly agreed that a \u2018contextualized political economy approach\u2019 is a powerful tool to help explicate the varieties of corruption in health and education. An important benefit of this was seen to be that political economy traces its starting point not to exchange dealings, which is the case with established theory, but to workplace relations where production actually happens, since this is the site where the impact of inadequate wage levels are felt and thus is important for anti-corruption measures. From this standpoint, decision-making in spheres where exchange transactions take place become important: are the \u2018informal\u2019 exchanges that are invariably required between doctors and patients or teachers and parents, rational 9 in character, as theory would have us believe? Can these really be viewed simply as dealings between persons maximizing their respective interests? The views expressed suggested this is unlikely; and this raised the further question that much more needs to be discussed about the complex kind of logic or coherence that is evident when social goods are in short supply. The subsequent implication is that the context of decision-making needs to be understood as a process that is strongly shaped by the prevailing mode of production. Specifically, it was highlighted that the impact of corruption on people\u2019s access to social services in Polynesian and Melanesian States can be traced to a distorted form of gift-giving. In turn, this is rooted in the contemporary interface that characterises the extraction of tributes that persists as a residue of customary systems, and the market system that now operates in tandem with but predominates over the customary modality. Important distinctions were noted between market forces and gift-giving. While customary rulers established themselves on the basis of successful claims on the labour (gifts, loans) in the tributary or gift-giving system; they did not take direct control over the tools of production, which a market economy does. This difference introduced by markets puts new pressures on the regime resourcing the machinery of production. Hence, although in states like Tonga, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, there are at least three main modes of production that operate simultaneously (tributary, market, and household), market forces are particularly distorting because what leaders take as tributes or gifts are used by them in markets, and this in turn raises the amounts that need to be paid in the tribute system. It is this particular dynamism that is the source of corruption associated with gift transactions, not the gift in itself. Insights from a contributor provided some explanation for anti-corruption strategies in the Pacific countries. It basically revolved around how Melanesians perceive gift-giving. This has its foundations in how Melanesians see the way in which the world works. They work with a logic that things are alike in all ways if they are alike in any. This logic typically seems odd to Western minds. But it needs to be grasped that Melanesians do not split nature, culture, recognition of facts, construction of interventions, natural facts or social interpretations. This means that when discussing topics of private property, commodities, and market exchange, the Melanesian instinct is to combine rather than split persons-things or subjects-objects. The salient point is that although a gift economy no longer operates in isolation from market forces (indeed it is shaped in magnitude and quality by the end use of gifts in markets), in Melanesian gift production systems, all commodities and public goods and social services, symbolize or express human relationships. They represent persons or facets of individuals. The upshot, for capacity- building purposes, is that production is underpinned by a collective social identity \u2013 which encompasses givers, receivers, facilitators, etc. Along with public goods, goods primarily reflect Synthesis of the E-Discussion 10 Asia Pacific Human Development Network human identities and relationships. Thus, a \u2018big man\u2019 has given a bit of himself when handing- out special \u2018preferences\u2019 in education access or health access to a relative or clansperson. The cultural perception is that his \u2018mana\u2019 or spirit accompanies the gift, and more importantly good spirit is circulated by the transaction. A key implication for transforming this, in the context of how it has become distorted by market forces, is that research needs to assess the quality of the impact on collective life by the distorted \u2018spirit of the gift\u2019. A further implication is that as long as the \u2018big man\u2019 system of hereditary leadership persists, fighting corruption in these communities requires the complicity of, or championing by,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7e2cb1e-0bb7-44de-a24d-91d23726e75a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7e2cb1e-0bb7-44de-a24d-91d23726e75a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18cb9f92df16135f10912b193a51f8ffd1f613cf425534ecad73861029289a7f"}}, "hash": "18cb9f92df16135f10912b193a51f8ffd1f613cf425534ecad73861029289a7f", "text": "\u2018big men\u2019, along with awareness-raising to actually disclose the true nature (the circulating spirit) of the distorted (corrupt) transaction. More specifically, it was highlighted that Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), together with independent teacher unions, could play a crucial role in the monitoring and evaluation of the education sector. In China, it was pointed out, that illegal profiting related to the commoditization of education presents serious challenges to ancient traditions expressed by the \u2018veneration of knowledge\u2019. Commercialisation of education blocks many poor students from formal schooling. Moreover, the evidence that urban-rural inequality is growing is supported by findings such as \u2018the more prestigious the institutions are, the lower the percentage of rural students\u2019. 1.4 Water, Sanitation and Electricity The discussion acknowledged that corruption in Water, Sanitation and Electricity (WSE) is complex and widespread. They also agreed that an anti-corruption strategy must be equally multifaceted, if it is to be credible. Indeed, the discussion placed a strong emphasis on ways to blend public awareness and collective action about rights and prices to contest unequal power relationships. Contributors explained how inequalities are exacerbated by the ruinous effect of corruption on access; indeed, there is a shared perception that the problem of access could explode into much broader inequalities unless solutions can be found for the prevailing supply and demand imbalance and stagnant monopoly situations. In fact, the discussion underscored the need for an \u2018equal force\u2019 to counter such situations. As a backdrop to this, it was noted that, for many well-heeled persons, corruption is a leverage situation that they are happy to preserve. Nevertheless, this should not prevent citizens from tackling corruption, by insisting on more space for public participation and third-party monitoring through the media, and civil society organisations, as well as through decentralisation, enforcement of the rule of law, and transparent decision-making processes. The discussion highlighted that India in particular needs more civil society actors dedicated to helping people without \u2018text literacy\u2019 to understand government schemes and resources. This would make them less vulnerable to being cheated by public servants. It was emphasised that 11 poor people can indeed play an active role in checking corruption, if they understand the issues at stake. However at present, the existence of several laws and checks and balances, tends to hinder poor peoples\u2019 fight against bullies who randomly hike the price of bribes whenever government schemes increase public entitlements. Contributors underscored the need for support by development actors as an essential element of strengthening citizen capability to resist. This support includes insisting on more space for public participation, third party monitoring through the media and civil society organisations, decentralisation, enforcement of the rule of law, and transparent decision-making processes. None of these forces can work in isolation, but combined together they could result in more citizen capability and human freedoms. With respect to how these perceptions actually play out (as highlighted by postings from members of the Network), a contributor highlighted a case of good local practice in Pakistan that has helped to reduce the considerable risks of elite-capture of decentralization processes that occur in the context of privatization and result in the creation of monopolies of big international companies. Another contributor shared a cross-country statistical assessment on the WSE sector that revealed the following: o Community access to sanitation is lower at higher levels of corruption (and vice versa). o Improved access is causally related to government effectiveness. o Investment to expand supply is inadequate without associated actions. The implication is that issues such as lack of awareness of rights and prices, collective action problems, asymmetric information need to be urgently addressed. Without this combination of actions, unequal power relationships and inequalities appear to thrive. In the final analysis, the linkage between access and corruption could surge from a problem of corruption to even greater inequality. In the Federated States of Micronesia, it was pointed out how personal enrichment and private resource use and other forms of out-of-sight favouritism are the chief reasons for the stagnation of public WSE monopolies. Privatisation was commonly seen as a contributing factor to corruption in this sector, with the World Bank sometimes cited as a controlling influence in changing the long-held perception that water is a common property resource. A contesting view was that efficient use of water could be promoted by taxing the corporations who exploit it for commercial purposes. This would help in widening access to water, unlike privatisation which would constrain access.

This refers to the issue of \u2018illegal\u2019 connections, which often generates opportunities for corrupt practices. Given its impact on service delivery, the rich are clearly in a better position to pay and get illegal connections, while the poor are disadvantaged in trying to follow suit. However, there are effective remedies. In Cambodia, for example this involved control through a blend of inspections, penalties and education. This resulted not only in improving efficiency but also facilitated an increase in salaries, which was seen as instrumental in curbing employees\u2019 own corrupt tendencies. The case study is available online at http://www. rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Lecture/LectureEkSon.htm. 1.5 Special Development Situations The backdrop to this discussion is the awareness that corruption occurs at all stages in special development situations projects: selection, design, procurement, implementation, financial management, and final evaluation. The discussion panel was asked to consider what would be the impact on corruption if the approach at the initial phase (project selection) was dedicated to people-centred development? Could this effectively mitigate risks in subsequent stages? The key point is that the project selection process is particularly vulnerable to persuasion. As a consequence of judgment errors made here, primarily because such situations require a speedy response, selected projects often end up diverting resources away from the social sectors in favour of defence and major infrastructure projects. In defence and infrastructure projects, the opportunities for financial kickbacks and political patronage are particularly high. This is due to opportunities to limit competition through inadequate bidding processes, and permitting collusion with private firms. This results in the escalation of risks of corruption in subsequent phases of procuring goods and services and other activity phases further downstream. A contributor distilled these risks in the notion of \u2018the means corrupting the end\u2019. This refers to the ultimate risk of exacerbating the existing problems of institutions being suddenly torn apart through expediency, which inclines donors to turn a blind eye, simply keep chaos at bay and try to save lives. A second view focused on \u2018cronyism\u2019 that was seen to characterise processes of recruitment to public bodies engaged for special development situations. It was highlighted that such situations erode public trust and undermine systemic integrity and independence. All this can eventually be attributed to incompetence caused by influence that rich people can buy. Would it be enough to publish more information on recruitment policies? What special methods are needed to enhance the prospect that politically motivated complaints could be handled on a local basis, where cronyism finds it harder to hide? 13 A somewhat contrasting view, however, maintained that we should avoid seeing disaster situations as inherently risky in terms of corruption. In fact, the opportunity to rebuild after disaster situations could actually present opportunities for transforming corrupt situations. This is because of the distinctive environment of social emotions that surround post-disaster scenarios. The view expressed was that this quality of emotionally charged environment could be exploited. As a footnote, another contribution involving Banda Aceh, gave evidence of successful results that were visible, partly due to the effective exploitation of the post-conflict emotional intelligence that tends to prevail. Overall, the relatively small number of postings reflected the difficulty of this particular topic for many agency persons. The topic is a sensitive one primarily because situations like the Indian Ocean Tsunami are acutely painful environments to work through; difficult because handling massive amounts of cash (including personal donations) transfers enormous responsibility, heightened when the work is in countries that have a reputation for corruption; difficult because there is acute time pressure on spending the money, requiring too-quick decisions about who to recruit and procure from, with limited data and local knowledge (under intense media spotlight); difficult because the transfer of goods is invariably in volatile security environments; and difficult because of competition between different agencies in contesting shares in an intense donation market. What actions can be taken to develop policies and mobilise funds to promote agencies and staff who decide to tackle corruption? Additionally, what measures need to be taken to ensure the groundwork and risk assessments are effective and not too hasty? Although transparency, consistent application of rules and publicity will help, these administrative processes in isolation will not win the fight. Local communities\u2019 involvement is essential for transparency and for rules and publicity to work. Only when combined with systematic community engagement (particularly that of recipients), administrative actions will be effective in tackling the diversion of resources.

Another equally important measure involves communicating easily understood information to communities about the projects; about what relief they can expect, and what compensation they are entitled to. These measures cannot guarantee that the military will not levy taxes on vehicles trucking in supplies, or that officials will not inflate how many people need aid in their districts. Nor will it deter people from reselling the goods in the market, or prevent expatriates from diverting assets or taking kickbacks. However, if the interim goal is to get agencies talking about this problem, and to support those who do something, then we could expect the beginnings of a different culture or set of expectations when the next $11 billion or so flows into an emergency situation. Corruption is inevitable only Synthesis of the E-Discussion 14 Asia Pacific Human Development Network if people deny it is happening. Accepting that it occurs, and providing support to agencies or people who take the first steps against it will enable environments far less conducive to corruption; and this could save more lives. 1.6 Natural Resources The key findings on natural resources are important. Members have grappled with issues related to land management, which is perceived as the most corrupt \u2018sector\u2019 in Asian economies. Contributors discussed the issue of the resource curse, making the case that corruption is not an issue of abundance. Rather, it is about weak public management and under-valuation of natural resources. In the timber industry, for example, this generates opportunities for rent capture at both local and state levels in a \u2018legalised\u2019 form of corruption. This involves a major shift in the permit allocation process. Previously, the management of timber permits was controlled by expert state institutions. However, now the allocation process is increasingly shaped by politicians, resulting in the erosion of customary land rights and, more importantly contributing to climate change. Contributors offered an explanation as to why monopolies in the private sector point to \u2018legitimacy\u2019. This is primarily because corporations probably drafted the law in the first place, with an eye to opening up avenues to make \u2018legal payments\u2019 through such clauses as \u2018geologist training\u2019 (subsequently tapped by a local elite to pay the overseas school fees of their family). Add to this contract secrecy, and the monitoring challenges take on extreme proportions. Contributors highlighted the consequences for the poorest citizens, which primarily are focused on insecurity about access to their land. This generates a vicious circle marked by administrative loopholes that enable others (the military, and business persons in cohorts with local officials) to grab land and to grant illegal approval for activities such as construction. These situations exploit the absence of \u2018an integrated formal system of property rights\u2019 (that underpin market economies), and as a consequence puts local food security at great risk. A suggestion was made that a better way to categorize key differences in how corruption manifests across sub-regions, could be based on the different stages that mark different countries sectoral engagement, within the following areas: environmental/natural resource management, governance, policy and regulatory development, utilization of environmental resources, permit and certification processes, and environmental enforcement (inspections and policing). A further point was introduced concerning legitimacy. This involves the social fact that people respond to the legitimacy of a government\u2019s authority on the basis of how it deals with natural 15 resource issues. These observations draw out a thread running through the entire discussion, differentiating it from the approach favoured by established economic theory to anti-corruption. This centres on the notion that governance is both about being governed and how it feels to be governed. It was explained that the basis of modern systems of representational government is rooted in a social agreement about what rules to follow. Importantly, governance has its basis in trust, not power, as the election process demonstrates. The exercise of authority is always a negotiation measurable in people\u2019s perception as to whether a government is operating under democratic principles and is being subject to their will. It is this context that civil society organizations have increasingly been contesting public decision\u2013making processes and the whole broader issue of power relations between those who govern and those who are governed. It was pointed out that recently, one method employed by international NGOs is by creating non\u2013state governance systems based on \u2018certification\u2019. The aim is to develop and implement environmentally sound and socially responsible management practices. Turning away from traditional state-based authority (rejecting its legitimacy), these civil society systems and their advocates gather the various actors in the supply chain (i.e. producers, and those who generate the flow of resources", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff41e6bf-9f90-451a-88da-4dd76337dadd": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff41e6bf-9f90-451a-88da-4dd76337dadd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba62de87acd51818b806b879f45049ca6cc584676332433c8368e639cd82b9fb"}}, "hash": "ba62de87acd51818b806b879f45049ca6cc584676332433c8368e639cd82b9fb", "text": "into and out of the combined operations constituting the respective livelihoods of the actors), with the purpose of creating a different set of incentives, and promoting the a new legitimacy, on the basis of which citizens ask companies and governments to operate. Simply stated, this process, in essence, redefines the conditions under which people in democratic states grant authority. Thus, although the monitoring challenges facing civil society organisations are difficult, CSOs have taken a pro active stance in developing and implementing environmentally and socially responsible management practices. In sum, contributors endorsed the need for public decision-making based on principles of self-governing individuals and collective management of natural resources. The political economy approach has played a central role in contributors\u2019 explanations that corruption is a major cause of resource sector inefficiencies. They have tracked its origins to such interactions as private sector actors competing for favours from public officials, who come with their own set of incentives and constraints. Contributors unanimously agreed that the term \u2018competing\u2019 is a misnomer, primarily because a level playing field rarely exists. Governments find it easier to conserve power by simply distributing resource privileges to their allies. This generation of a secure revenue stream means that instead of developing sturdy strategies with action plans, governments are not motivated to frame strong and effective strategies. As a consequence, resource abundance impacts very negatively on public decision-making. Synthesis of the E-Discussion 16 Asia Pacific Human Development Network The extent of this, as the initial phase of this discussion has led us to expect, depends on the political system: authoritarian regimes have a significantly higher negative impact on growth than democratic regimes. Contributors emphasised that Asia Pacific countries face the prospect of vastly increased income from minerals, oil and gas in coming years. However, reservations were expressed as to whether the revenues will be channelled towards advancing human freedoms and capabilities or be used for repression. Contributors strongly advocated supporting community actors in an endeavour to transform tolerance, by insisting companies publish what they pay, since companies are unlikely to do it voluntarily. Part of a strategy to combat corruption in this sector, it was noted, could be support for the environmental protection movement with the aim of enhancing public awareness of its connections with human livelihoods. The key idea is, to make development more people-centred by basing it on principles of self-governing individuals and mutual aid. It is believed that such a strategy of mutual protection would be less open to exploitation by middlemen. Complementarities in this logic were noted with Nussbaum\u2019s vision of democracy with its foundation of self-aware, self-governing citizens with a compassionate imagination \u2018capable of respecting the humanity of all our fellow human beings\u2026.. who can think for themselves rather than simply deferring to authority, who can reason together about their choices\u2019 (Nussbaum 2004); and with Amartya Sen\u2019s image of agency focused on community initiatives that \u2018redress the crippling effects of an exclusive dependence upon the state agency\u2019 (Muralidharan 1999). Further, and attesting to the value of harnessing collective wisdom, cases were noted of villagers in India who collectively manage resources including forests and wells, and of Bougainvilleans who mutually protect themselves and their natural surroundings by dedicating a day in the week to managing their ecosystems as a whole community. There was also a valuable discussion on the shift in permit processes. Increasingly, the administration of timber permits, which was formerly managed by expert state institutions, is being shaped by politicians. In Papua New Guinea, more than half the rainforest areas are designated to be logged. In 2006, a study of 14 logging projects in Papua New Guinea published by the Forest Trends group (2006) revealed that all projects were operating in a form of legalised corruption. This includes transfer pricing based on complicity between companies and the political elite. Transfer pricing is currently \u2018remedied\u2019 by monitoring log export volumes. However, at the other end where processed timber is received \u2013 in Europe, and the US \u2013 there is no monitoring. Even at the point of logging, monitoring is ineffective, given that the principal logging group provides the government monitor(s) with a car and \u2018privileges\u2019 that include a school that his children attend. The standard view endorsed by the panel was that a more effective remedy would be to extend support to local landowners by empowering them to 17 better understand and defend their rights to access the forests through which they earn their livelihoods. In order to generate policies that counter corporate corruption and \u2018state capture\u2019 a different definition of corruption was recommended.

This shift in perspective, it was noted, is necessary to move on from the image of a corrupt state as one whose officials intrude on the efficiency of entrepreneurs. The reality is that a corrupt state results from the nexus of wealth and power acting to deter democratic representation. This definition gives rise to distinct policy ideas, with clear aims. The first aim is to restrict the power and purpose of multinational companies in the capture of policy-making, and the second aim is to empower citizens in the exercise of greater control over decision making. 1.7 Police The feedback on the police generated some interesting and valuable ideas. The discussion opened with the view that the tradition of granting a single group such imposing powers of arrest and detention is certain to generate \u2018unreliable\u2019 choices. Hence, an independent agency is needed to watch over the police. A separate view expressed was that any anti-corruption strategy must go beyond prevention - donors need to be more pro active in investigation, prosecution and adjudication. This evoked a perhaps more balanced viewpoint that observed that some police officers sometimes choose to act with integrity. Accordingly, is it possible to design incentives that could stimulate \u2018choices to act in upright ways\u2019? Additionally, will combining citizen voices and grassroots pressure facilitate a shift in political will? It is important to explore the specific variables that influence choice-making. What level of literacy is needed for people to recognise they have chosen \u2018rationally\u2019, and more importantly, discern that how one uses practical reason matters, and how one uses political power is critically important. Further, what constraints do poverty and other vulnerabilities have on access to this kind of education? These questions raised a much discussed topic - that there is no singular root cause for corruption. This was reminiscent of earlier conversations that concluded that corruption involves multiple actors. These can be categorised as givers and takers, those who resist, endure or are incognizant (yet lose some entitled social good), as well as those who facilitate a corrupt practice. The discussion highlighted a case in Jammu and Kashmir , where it was pointed out Synthesis of the E-Discussion 18 Asia Pacific Human Development Network that the demand-side cannot be simply explained by a public official\u2019s aspirations for power in an underpaid situation. Rather, there are multiple actors who co-drive the demand in a backdrop of the community that the police services. It was learned that the corruption co-producers in the demand for land, besides the police, included \u201cgreedy revenue officials and vested interest groups in the context of economic growth and massive migration to cities\u201d. On the supply side, the network comprises of \u2018revenue officials, politicians, criminals and businessmen\u2019. Regarding \u2018grand theft auto\u2019, demand is co-driven by insurance agents and employees of Road Transport Offices facilitated by the lack of a computerized data bank on vehicle registrations. What facilitates this corruption is a supply network of hired drivers, professional lifters, receivers, automobile shops, and political patrons. It\u2019s a story that helps to explain the complex gamut of social drivers that create demand, and insists on recognition the problem belongs to the community and it is not simply \u2018over there\u2019 in some ostensibly-isolated public official\u2019s office. One implication is that \u2018police\u2019 are a heterogeneous collection of human beings with motivations that are both multi-faceted and ambiguous. It was suggested this could be an excellent starting point for a strategy. Could incentives successfully be engineered around this human quality of ambiguity, specifically by targeting upright behaviour that is exhibited by some police persons? Could pressure from below in the form of a blend of citizen voices and grassroots pressure help to develop and sustain political will to transform police corruption? Regarding measures that would facilitate better decision-making, one view emphasized the value of rational choice theory. Additionally, the importance of contextualising this theory, as Nussbaum has done, in terms of how citizens use reason and power, was also emphasised. Basically, it is insufficient to restrict this to a mere explanation of how people make decisions. What is necessary is a theory that explains how people use practical reason, and entrusted power, in ways that are good for society. This in turn raises questions that the dominant decision theory tends to neglect- which is how much education on alternate choices do we need access to before we can say we have \u2018rationally\u2019 chosen? And, can it", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0798a882-3874-41b6-9a5b-6803c66951c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "0798a882-3874-41b6-9a5b-6803c66951c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e60ccbb8a33b8ccd10f3184f9b366a9312a421d42617924b09bceb0e8007115f"}, "3": {"node_id": "edd36b20-7da6-49a5-b8f3-81b04ebe9524", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c86a18480a6328b9af00352c9fca37d4787889b32a10d3089a574e6c894a387d"}}, "hash": "ee9dce4b1c7fd16a6f7918aac089366725a84e0a15997a74ab344290de411e86", "text": "be said that we have freely decided on a course of action if poverty or other vulnerabilities constrain our decisions? Drawing on these themes, the next step was a discussion on the end goal of anti-corruption. It was recommended that the notion of \u2018lowered thresholds of tolerating corruption\u2019 needs to be refined. It is far more preferable to devise a rather simple and straightforward expression of \u2018tolerance\u2019 that encompasses its multiple dimensions, which are: o Thresholds of what is normatively acceptable or censured. o The \u2018level/degree of permission or veto.\u2019 o The \u2018impact on freedom of certain corrupt acts\u2019. 19 The importance of a multi-faceted understanding of \u2018tolerance\u2019 is related to making the concept operational, by measuring each aspect differently. For example: o \u2018Thresholds\u2019 involves measuring the critical, flexible assessment of certain acts. o \u2018Permission\u2019 entails testing what practices are banned or accepted. o The \u2018impact on freedom\u2019 requires measuring impacts on rights and duties. o \u2018Demands of tolerance\u2019 is gauged by how individuals respond (e.g. escaping from information by using stereotypes, or by pledging support to an oppressive ideology, or a religion where many individuals derive their ethos). In the final instance, \u2018tolerance\u2019 is useful to an anti-corruption strategy primarily because it meets the need for \u2018universality\u2019 and is also not dogmatic in its approach. Additionally, it encompasses essential human ambiguities that surround the search by individuals for meaningful or authentic social practices. There were differing views over how choice-making and meaningful practices have been impacted by the \u2018reversal\u2019 of corruption in Singapore. It was pointed out that Singapore\u2019s case does not represent \u2018best practice\u2019, given that \u2018integrity\u2019 is being sustained by fear and oppression, whereas, tolerance is required as a core ingredient of liberty and human capabilities. Additional questions were raised as to whether it was solely police reform or broader strategic incentives that managed to tap into the social historical flow of ethical values, that transformed Singapore\u2019s corruption. Additionally, the question was raised, does the perceived effectiveness of those strategies, if measured by citizens\u2019 opinions of low corruption, equate to there being more authentic moral and ethical standards than in other countries where corruption is perceived to be widespread? One contributor pointed out that Bangladesh is one Government which is doing something about its responsibility to provide equal access by acceding to demand by the poor to reform the Police Service as a priority, and as a first step towards sector wide legal process reform. In more general terms, how do the poor collectively perceive access to justice? Information was shared about a study that revealed the poor feel that justice is directly linked to wealth (Correa Sotil 1999). The poor overwhelmingly feel that legal system actors discriminate and are corrupt in ways that escalate inequality of access for vulnerable populations. Almost two- thirds thought police treated the well-dressed well and the poor badly; 63.5 per cent felt judges behaved differently with the rich and the poor; more than half thought that, when police detained people, the intent was to charge them money; almost 90 per cent felt there is Synthesis of the E-Discussion 20 Asia Pacific Human Development Network one justice for the rich and another for the poor; almost 90 per cent thought lawyers were too expensive; and 90 per cent felt the quality of a lawyer\u2019s assistance is linked to how much money is paid. Such findings raise critical questions as to whether governments have stepped away from responsibility to promote demand by poor people for reform. In a bid to explain these perceptions of the poor, as well as provide an important context for decision theory, it was suggested that any approach that investigates police corruption merely in the limited context of being a service-provider neglects the critical question of \u2018to serve and protect whom\u2019? The damage done to ordinary lives by this aspect of their role, which is to give protection to political elites, depends on the situation in which police operate. This can sometimes be a well-functioning low-corruption situation, while at the other end of the spectrum it can be a very corrupt environment with scarce resources and high levels of violence. This generated a notable observation that a regime that experiences a growing threat of violence is increasingly likely to transfer power to the military.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "edd36b20-7da6-49a5-b8f3-81b04ebe9524": {"__data__": {"id_": "edd36b20-7da6-49a5-b8f3-81b04ebe9524", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e60ccbb8a33b8ccd10f3184f9b366a9312a421d42617924b09bceb0e8007115f"}, "2": {"node_id": "0798a882-3874-41b6-9a5b-6803c66951c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee9dce4b1c7fd16a6f7918aac089366725a84e0a15997a74ab344290de411e86"}}, "hash": "c86a18480a6328b9af00352c9fca37d4787889b32a10d3089a574e6c894a387d", "text": "In this scenario, the role of police reverts to merely being a simple provider of information, but since this situation involves little demand for information, this causes police to migrate to serving the corrupt domain of \u2018unofficial elites\u2019.

However, this could only happen occur in a legal system that is not controlled by corruption, which then becomes the only forum where powerful political interests cannot hush voices, as they do in the market where poor people have insufficient power. This is why economic development approaches do not provide the answers to poverty alleviation. And this is why this discussion has taken a political economy approach to anti-corruption, which is very interested in questions of human rights, equality of access, and the further development of rational choice-making.

Our primary purpose is to consult with you in order to define the direction of the Asia Pacific Human Development Report (APHDR) on corruption \u2013 the second in an annual series of APHDRs. This forum is part of a broad process of international consultation for the corruption APHDR which has included three sub-regional stakeholders consultations in Asia and the Pacific. The principal objective of this round of discussion on the APHDR is to engage you in a critical discussion of selected themes for the Report, which will be on corruption: o To solicit your views on the postulated two-way link between corruption and human development. In particular the theoretical arguments and empirical evidence that support this hypothesis. Additionally, the extent to which human development (freedom, voice, choices, empowerment, access to information, social services, livelihoods, etc.) contribute to curbing corruption. o To receive your views on effective policy solutions, anti-corruption measures, success and failures stories/case studies, including country examples, and lessons learned.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "369c3955-9e3f-4193-9de6-b7a72cede80b": {"__data__": {"id_": "369c3955-9e3f-4193-9de6-b7a72cede80b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5edb86bfff983e634a410a39946f084a12db0e6a86d1dafb1a8e9f2f877ef144"}, "2": {"node_id": "24e90007-8bfd-4855-b612-63d68aa51a03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8abdb8bb4050c14775bec76e5c56708da2ea4cc5a6b6c43659c750a9d467ebbe"}}, "hash": "5185ddf8748d263fa7852a86e022ead7fa2d85285ff0378c41d86ab82233de6b", "text": "In order to consolidate existing knowledge and information in the area of corruption in the region, this e-forum is partnering with the \u2018Integrity in Action\u2019 Community of Practice which was launched in January 2007.

A growing body of literature suggests that corruption (very often included under the broader heading of good governance and institutional quality) affects poverty. However, some authors have challenged this view arguing that a country\u2019s level of social capital determines economic growth and that political institutions and corruption are matters that get worked out later on (see, for example, Glaeser et al. 2004). The implications of these two views are fairly diverse. The first view that poverty is \u2018solved\u2019 through certain political institutions, recommends a concerted effort to \u2018get the institutions right\u2019. Priority actions from this viewpoint include a push for elections, the strengthening of government oversight agencies, and the protection of property rights as a basic right. The second view emphasises actions aimed at elevating health and education standards, along with many of the features highlighted in the MDGs. Most of this discussion implicitly adopts the concept of corruption as an economic phenomenon, where corrupt acts are motivated by economic gains, in which a state/government actor is involved. Most of the analyses in this area rely on data provided by Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) and the World Bank\u2019s Control of Corruption Index (CCI). It is the reliance on this data that casts a shadow on the vast body of literature on corruption and economic growth. Let me give an example. In my country of origin, Argentina, a corruption scandal has recently erupted in which a Swedish company apparently paid a generous sum of money to government officials to receive a contract. There is fairly solid evidence to show 31 that the same company was also involved in similar corrupt actions in Chile and Peru. Yet, as a newspaper account remarked, these acts will surface in the next Transparency International\u2019s CPI as evidence of corruption in Argentina, Chile and Peru, and not in Sweden.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "539744c8-c3f1-45ad-a716-097102eab5c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "539744c8-c3f1-45ad-a716-097102eab5c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed82ba8d950ebd4e855e78c3ec1b693f4f302d1a8bf6fd868f9072ac539ba98c"}, "2": {"node_id": "960ad92f-c0f3-42c6-960a-ff37a84d1532", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81a4deb0cb3fb55dc17fa34b8a29489e8780bb2ff9415067f35a4937a667fb76"}}, "hash": "c9eb57d9bb22fe9b1a9ecade3d3f7f14e929defbead4e01b0ba54f205d9563a0", "text": "Thus, the main problem is that much of the data sets used in research on corruption, tends to underestimate the level of corruption in wealthy countries.

Access to information and a free press are central to the ability of a society to uncover, mobilize against, and deter acts of corruption (Brunetti and Weder 2003). More broadly, though research surveys have shown that although different societies exhibit the same level of tolerance toward corruption, there is a variance in terms of their capacity to act against corruption. Thus, it seems prudent, especially in poorer societies, to combine any legal strategy that is pursued (for example, the strengthening of the judiciary) with actions that aim to increase the capabilities of people. In this sense, it is important to stress the need to adopt an integrated approach. Indeed, rather than see political institutions as determining economic growth or social capital as leading eventually to certain political institutions, it probably makes more sense to focus on the way these different aspects of reality interact on a day to day basis. Ajit Mishra, University of Bath wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Ajit is responding to Gerardo Munck who argued that the discourse on corruption and poverty needs to move away from preoccupation with \u2018political institutions determining economic growth\u2019 and become focused on everyday lives. People need to be mobilized, Gerardo wrote, with capabilities informed by access to information, strengthened laws and judiciary. Gerardo Munck has made some interesting observations. There is no denying that access to information and free press are an integral part of anti-corruption drive. The big question is how effective they are. Studies like Brunetti and Weder 2003 are no different from the cross-country studies on corruption using mostly perception based measures (corruption as well as press freedom) with potential biases. Secondly, both corruption and freedom of press are highly correlated with several other variables which may explain the level of corruption. Of course, it is possible that the corrupt officials/ politicians fear media the most. After all, Montesinos in Peru paid television channel owners 100 times in bribes what was paid to others like judges (McMillan and Zoido 2004). Additionally, there Political Economy 32 Asia Pacific Human Development Network is always the possibility, that the press itself is vulnerable to being manipulated. It is gratifying to see that some of the countries with high levels of perceived corruption have introduced measures to improve access to information. Limited evidence (Reinikka and Svensson 2005) suggests that, at least in the case of public service delivery, information campaigns amongst the end users can lead to better monitoring of local officials and reduction in leakage of funds. This might be an isolated instance of success, but it is in the right direction and we need to look at such participatory and grass-root monitoring more carefully. In many cases, citizens or affected parties do not lack information but rather lack the capability to take affirmative action. This is particularly applicable to the poorer sections of the society. In the medium or short term, activist groups or non-governmental organizations can lend their voice to these groups but a long term strategy has to target empowerment of these people. Greater emphasis on literacy, education, political representation (and of course income generation for the poor) holds the key. Similarly, media can generate and disseminate information but supplementary institutions are needed, so that subsequent action to fight corruption can take place. The ultimate fight against corruption has to come from empowered citizens. Traditional measures of strengthening of institutions such as the judiciary, media and enforcement agencies are necessary. However care must be exercised to ensure that that these institutions do not become the sole custodians of fight against corruption, as it could lead to a situation where one of these institutions becomes powerful and interfering. This would undermine the principles of governance like proportionality and separation of powers (Mishra and Anant 2006). A good example of this could be found in situations where dictators or coup leaders claim to be overthrowing corrupt regimes\u2019. C. Raj Kumar, City University of Hong Kong, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Raj Kumar writes on the question of access to justice. He notes that Asia Pacific is the only region in the world without a regional framework against corruption. Raj emphasises that citizens have a right to corruption-free governance, and hence social and economic policy targets need to incorporate a constitutional justice dimension. This could empower the judiciary to integrate rights into legal judgments about corruption, which in turn would enhance social awareness, and empower citizens.

Both their arguments reflect on the need for citizens\u2019 empowerment to fight corruption and underscore the relevance of transparency and accountability in governance. For this to happen, it is important 33 to recognise that corruption violates human rights, undermines the rule of law, distorts the development process, and disempowers the state. The way forward is to increase the say of civil society in governance issues. The good governance agenda of countries ought to include both the protection and promotion of human rights as well as the enforcement of the rule of law. Both these functions will not be fully accomplished if corruption is rampant in government. It is important that national human rights institutions (NHRIs) provide a framework to take up cases of corrupt acts of individuals and institutions that result in human rights violations. One of the important developments due to the institutionalisation of human rights in Asia through the setting up of the NHRIs in a number of countries is that they have come to occupy a certain democratic space within the domestic political discourse. This is notwithstanding the fact that the Asia Pacific region is the only region in the world that does not have regional human rights machinery. However, the existence of NHRIs does not necessarily mean human rights violations do not occur or that their incidence is reduced. What it means is that there are institutional mechanisms available for victims to seek justice. Having recognised that corruption affects human rights and the rule of law, it is important for the NHRIs to develop the right to corruption-free governance through a number of rights-based strategies. Rights-based approaches to development and governance are those strategies that rest on the conceptual foundation that social and economic goals do not remain policy objectives, but get transformed into rights that are vested with the citizenry, thereby increasing incentives for public vigilance. A conceptual basis is essential for the NHRIs to formulate various effective anticorruption measures. Their role in protecting human rights by evolving rights- based approaches to development will help in eliminating corruption and promoting integrity and good governance in the following specific ways: 1) Corruption-free constitutional governance: The recognition of the right to corruption-free governance by the NHRIs has the potential to bring the problem of corruption to the centre of the political discourse. This will ensure that the state and all its instruments act in accordance with the Constitution and other legislation and do not engage in any form of corrupt actions that will violate the rights of the citizenry. This would require governance to be based upon the underlying ideals, goals, objectives, aspirations, and values of the Constitution and other laws. All individuals and institutions within the government would be expected to take the necessary steps to fulfil this right. 2) Empowering the judiciary and other institutions: The recognition of the right to corruption-free governance will quickly empower the judiciary to bring forward the integration of the anti- corruption discourse and the human rights discourse. Both these discourses focus on increasing Political Economy 34 Asia Pacific Human Development Network the legitimacy of the state and ensuring accountability of the administration. The judiciary is best suited to continue this role as it has attempted in the past to create greater transparency and infuse institutional autonomy and independence in investigative agencies engaged in anti-corruption work. With the development of such a human right by the NHRIs, the judiciary is in a far better position to develop jurisprudence relating to good governance. 3) Galvanising social consciousness: The development of the human right to corruption-free governance will help in galvanising social consciousness on issues relating to bribery and other forms of corruption. It is necessary for the NHRIs to garner the support of the citizens, as it is their apathy and indifference to abuse of power that has resulted in corruption becoming institutionalised in many countries. Political morality cannot be achieved without the development of individual morality. This particular right can help in garnering greater support for corruption-free governance and also result in the citizens valuing integrity and rectitude as important criteria for electing their representatives. Simultaenously, citizens will feel a greater sense of urgency in reporting on corrupt activity. The NHRIs must ensure that their investigations make due note that corruption is the root cause of potential violations of human rights. In this regard, the NHRIs may have to work in cooperation with anti-corruption agencies. In the same vein, anti-corruption measures should not violate human rights and threaten civil liberties.

The purpose of the NHRIs new initiatives should be to ensure protection of human rights and promotion of corruption-free administration as a sine non qua for good governance. Andrew H. Wedeman, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: It is vital the discussion is clear about what corruption means in the particular contexts we are assessing. To confine corruption to one broad definition is not acceptable primarily because the definition of corruption varies between different cultures. Andrew Wedeman writes on the difference between improper behaviour, malfeasance and corruption in China. (Also see Andrew\u2019s article \u2018The intensification of corruption in China\u2019). One of the major problems in analyzing corruption in China is that there are multiple forms of official malfeasance, not all of which ought to be defined as corruption, as well as multiple agencies involved in the regime\u2019s effort to control corruption. Chinese law, for example, makes a distinction between economic crime and violations of discipline. The former includes graft 35 (embezzlement of state property and funds), bribery, misappropriation of public funds (the use of state funds for illicit purposes), copyright fraud, and tax evasion. While the first three correspond to the more widely used legal definitions of corruption neither copyright fraud nor tax evasion are necessarily crimes involving the misuse of public authority. Disciplinary crimes, on the other hand, include criminal negligence, dereliction of duty, violations of civil rights, illegal imprisonment, and a range of other offences committed by public officials. Although these are certainly examples of the misuse of authority, they do not necessarily involve the seeking of private gain or advantage. Insubordination, lying, exercising excessive bureaucratic procedures, and errors in policy making are also considered disciplinary offences according to regulations issued by the state Ministry of Supervision. Party regulations, on the other hand, stipulate punishment for corruption (graft, embezzlement, bribery, etc.), along with a wide range of infractions for political offences and indiscipline. The party rules also define a broad category of what is often termed \u2018degenerate\u2019 behaviour, including womanizing, drunkenness, feasting at public expense (often to the point of gluttony), and gambling, which are properly defined as corruption but are popularly considered evidence of the moral failings of state officials and party cadres. In fact, for many Chinese the haughtiness and high handedness that characterizes many officials\u2019 attitudes toward the public is considered a form of corruption. Thus when ordinary Chinese complain that \u2018all\u2019 officials are corrupt they are referring not simply to the misuse of public authority for private gain, but rather to a broadly held perception that officials misuse their authority. In general usage, therefore, \u2018corruption\u2019 tends to become an all encompassing term for official misbehaviour. Although such a broad definition may be politically salient, its amorphous nature means that it is often hard to distinguish between the misuse of public authority and arrogance of power. Spongy definitions also complicate efforts to analyze trends in corruption because, on the one hand, different people cite different figures as evidence of their particular interpretation and, on the other hand, they allow for morally based judgments that are tied to broader political issues. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Chinese \u2018State\u2019 still extends into the economy in ways that mean \u2018businessmen\u2019 are often either state officials or party members. As a result, in many cases, offences that are defined as corrupt in China, because of who is involved, would be considered ordinary crime elsewhere. For example, stripping of assets from state- Political Economy 36 Asia Pacific Human Development Network owned corporations by managers is considered corruption in China because the managers are state officials and they are stealing public assets. In the US, however, if a corporate president runs off to Brazil with the company\u2019s cash that is considered criminal embezzlement and theft. Similarly, if a businessman offers an official a bribe, if he is a party member he can punished by the Discipline Inspection Commission for corruption, even though he may not have been a public official.

Officials are often in a position to use their authority to manipulate these transfers and to obtain sizeable pay offs. Private interests, including real estate developers, are also often quite willing to \u2018grease the wheels\u2019 by kicking back a portion of the windfall profits they can obtain when undervalued state property is reborn as valuable private property. Similar conditions hold as the state transforms its productive and commercial assets into either public corporations or privately held companies. Once again managers are often in a position to reap considerable illicit benefits from such transfers, often assuming control themselves at grossly undervalued prices. The transition from the planned to the market economy, in short, means that there are considerable one-time, \u2018windfall\u2019 profits to be made and right now we are seeing a lot of these profits flowing into the pockets of state officials. In short, a variety of factors particular to the Chinese case tend to \u2018inflate\u2019 the level of corruption. Not only are virtually all forms of misbehaviour by state officials and party cadres apt to be deemed corrupt, the interpenetration of the state and economy means that the pool of those who are positioned to engage in corruption is larger than would be true in a fully marketised economy. Finally, the Chinese economy remains imperfectly marketised and there are numerous opportunities for officials to misuse their authority for private gain.

However, ultimately it is the same society that nurtures the leaders and the followers: reverence of \u2018get-rich-quick\u2019 readily turns into accepting corrupt leadership. Yet, their manipulation of others is combated by literacy and independent judiciaries. The previous commentators on the subject of \u2018Political Economy\u2019 of corruption quite rightly, have touched on the structural and institutional mechanisms to combat the menace of corruption. There appears to be a consensus that corruption is a multi pronged phenomenon both in its manifestation and impact. Corruption in itself goes beyond bribery, money-laundering or general financial misfeasance by state officials/accountable officers. Worrisome issues of discrimination, tribalism, nepotism, exclusion, and racism by state and non-state actors, provides another dimension to corruption. Additionally, corruption retards development as it chronically reduces or wipes out the resources that otherwise, could have been channelled to deliver on healthcare, water, sanitation, education, micro-finance, food security etc. In the same vein, enriching a few at the expense of the powerless and voiceless majority constitutes a gross denial of human rights, in particular socio-economic rights. Most constitutions in the Asia Pacific region, such as in Papua New Guinea (PNG), have a \u2018leadership code\u2019 as an anti-corruption mechanism against specified high level leaders and government officials. The enforcement of the \u2018leadership code\u2019 falls within the mandate of NHRIs body such as the Ombudsman Commission (PNG) and most times litigation goes on endlessly and in the end, very few corrupt officials are prosecuted or convicted. Therefore, strengthening the judiciary, the media, civil society, NHRIs, faith communities and ratifying/domesticating the regional and international anticorruption frameworks are essential mechanisms and strategies in the war against corruption. However equally important is the issue of effective commitment in tackling and dismantling corruption (also known as zero- tolerance for corruption) by the state as well as local authorities. The quality of leadership in any given polity is by and large determined by the quality of its following. The corrupt leaders, at whatever level, are still products of the same society and this raises questions about the moral/ethical values of that society in general. Are the nouveau riche eulogized and revered in that system without regard to source of income? It is by seeking answers to such questions that will pave the way to finding and developing holistic anti-corruption strategies that target both the leaders as well as the masses.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in Nigeria has been commended by both local and international bodies including World Bank, for its efforts in recovering the loot by corrupt Nigerian leaders in several banks in Europe and America, amounting to about $5b and also prosecuting and obtaining conviction of thousands of such leaders. However, in establishing such quasi-judicial bodies to tackle corruption, issues of respect of human rights and operating within the confines of the rule of law, should be nonnegotiable. Fayyaz Baqir, UNDP Pakistan, wrote: Facilitators\u2019 note: Fayyaz Baqir gives concrete examples from South Asia of who the \u2018takers\u2019 and \u2018givers\u2019 are. He also provides an explanation as to why this occurs by drawing on underlying historical, social and economic factors. Corruption in South Asia has intimate links with various segments of political economy. In the informal sector, corruption can be traced to a taxation system devised for a barter economy that has no recognition of rights to own assets like land or run businesses. As a consequence, police have historically developed the habit of informally collecting rent monies from vulnerable groups and individuals, which they use and justify, as a means to supplement extremely low salaries. Although this is officially viewed as corruption, unofficially it is sanctioned as a means to offset a very narrow income base. Elsewhere in the informal sector, NGOs have shown tendencies to exploit ineffective accountability mechanisms. In the development sector, worryingly, a culture has crept in of getting government officials to agree to \u2018develop capacity\u2019 in return for endorsing \u2018inflated\u2019 budgets, for high cost \u2018pilot\u2019 projects that can never by scaled up due to unrealistic costing, or for \u2018looking the other way\u2019 when government officials misuse development funds. 39 Another recent development concerns \u2018economic assistance provided for the defence of Free World\u2019, being used as a lucrative source of rent collection. In the public sector (e.g. in education departments) salaried sections of the middle class have somewhat recently begun to use government jobs as a contact point for private business. Some successful anti-corruption strategies, in particular those that deter rent collecting, have been strategic partnerships between development agencies and the media, judiciary and CSOs. These strategies aim to enhance access to information, strengthen transparency, increase the independence of the judiciary, and improving the organisation of citizen\u2019s movements. These processes have been documented, analyzed and debated by many leading social scientists in Pakistan where a body of literature has highlighted these issues over the past two decades.

No, there should be a rights based explanation as well, such as the right to education-skills-knowledge-employment, right to rule of law, good governance, etc. Citizens have the right to political and civil liberties but that must not be exercised at the cost of the suffering of other citizens. Do good human development conditions (freedoms, voice, choices, empowerment, access to information, social services, livelihoods, etc.) contribute to the reduction of corruption? Good governance must be practiced; accountability, judicial freedom, enforcement of laws, gendered approaches towards human development are necessary conditions towards reduction of corruption.

Anti-corruption measures need also to be free from corruption, and should not at all be influenced by party politics. Under such circumstances, should these anti-corruption measures be taken off the table? Ramachandran AL Ramasamy, National Information Technology Council, Malaysia, wrote: Facilitators Note: Writing from Malaysia, Ramachandran AL Ramasamy agrees with Gerardo Munck that givers and receivers must both be held accountable. This, he argues, can be done more effectively, by using e-media rather than press and print \u2013 which political leaders often own and control in many developing countries. New media is less prone to manipulation and hence has the, powerful potential to assess public officials\u2019 performance. E-forums, for example, could help enhance citizens\u2019 empowerment in particular those who have access to such networks. Simultaneously, however, individuals need institutional defences against the dangers of \u2018whistle-blowing\u2019. Gerardo Munck made a pertinent point that the giver (Swedish Company) is not held accountable, while the receiving countries (Latin American countries) are branded as corrupt nations. The reality that rich countries will engage in corrupt practices (because they can) is simple logic; they have the means, the mode as well as the financial motivation to engage in corrupt practices in order to gain favourable treatment on huge contracts. Public officials, too, have the motivation to be takers, and not just those from poor nations but from rich countries also. In other words, in any suspected corrupt practice both giver and takers must be held accountable; and both must be given minus points for such practices. Regarding the linkage between corruption and sustainable economic growth, good politics (visionary leadership and good institutional practices) can go a long way towards addressing poverty in a systematic and organized way. This was the case in Malaysia over the past three decades. However, as Malaysian society becomes more materialistic, more incidences of corruption seem to be surfacing. If this trend continues, the socio-economic growth of Malaysia will be badly affected; and this is something the country\u2019s leaders have been emphasising in public forums. 41 With regard to the role of the media, it is widely acknowledged that the traditional media is heavily controlled by political powers in many developing countries and hence there is little to be gained by looking to traditional media to play an aggressive role in combating corruption. It is high time that the potential of new media, especially what is being driven by Internet, web- based portal and mobile modes, is explored to combat corrupt practices. Indeed, international organizations like the UN should explore ways and means of developing online and real-time media to \u2018capture\u2019 and publicise corrupt and malpractices around the globe. As Ajit emphasised (see Ajit Mishra\u2019s contribution), citizens need to be empowered; but appropriate mechanisms also need to be in place to protect the citizens who participate in curbing corrupt practices. Public and community participation using contemporary modes is crucial in combating corrupt practices. Specifically, moderator driven, web-based mechanisms need to be established to monitor and evaluate the socio, economic and political performance of elected representatives of society. Citizens, in particular the educated and networked ones, have the capability to participate in such reporting and monitoring forums. Indeed, government officials who indulge in corrupt and ill-practices are very wary of such mechanisms.

The problem I find in much of the literature on corruption is that both the empirical and theoretical literature are often contradictory. Does raising wages reduce corruption: yes, no, under certain conditions? Does decentralisation reduce corruption: yes, no, it depends? There are many examples reported of reduced corruption through increased transparency and Political Economy 42 Asia Pacific Human Development Network multi stakeholder engagement in bureaucratic or service delivery processes (see Ajit Mishra\u2019s contribution), but I have just read an interesting article from Indonesia which shows that strengthening oversight institutions had a much stronger effect on reducing corruption than increased grass-roots participation (Olken 2007). So at this stage I wonder if we need to think of appropriate frameworks for analyzing corruption and its solutions, as well as proposing specific approaches (e.g. HRBA \u2013 see Raj Kumar\u2019s contribution) or successful cases. There are a number of possibilities. Different academic disciplines appear to offer different insights: political science, economics, sociology, anthropology, or organisational behaviour... Given the reluctance (more or less!) of external development partners to meddle in the politics of aid recipient countries, I find the political dimension of corruption most underestimated, particularly in the World Bank. James Wolfensohn famously explained that corruption was not political, presumably in order to get some lee-way from its members to try and tackle it. Building on the discussion on context, a kind of typology of states (fragile, poorest, poor but natural-resource rich, transition, middle-income, developed) might also be useful. There is some interesting literature available on the \u2018resource-curse\u2019, and several countries in this region who face the challenge of managing significant natural resources for the benefit of its people in a weak governance context (Cambodia, Indonesia, and East Timor would make interesting case studies). Similarly, in countries undergoing political and/or economic transitions (China and Vietnam) corruption has recently become a very high profile issue. It is also important to reflect on dimensions of governance. Given that most external development organisations (UNDP, World Bank, OECD/DAC, DFID, etc) describe corruption as a symptom of weak governance, and there is a fair degree of convergence on what the dimensions of good governance are, then it would seem logical to address corruption through a governance framework. One final thought. My own reading of the literature leads me to agree with previous contributors. In the long term it is multi stakeholder, participatory processes that secure good governance and thereby reduces corruption. Thinking of this in terms of supply and demand, in the long term it is the demand coming from a variety of empowered stakeholders in political, economic and civil society that will be the driver of a better supply of bureaucratic and basic service delivery, rule of law, credible politicians, responsible private sector, etc. DFID\u2019s policy paper on governance that has just been released (DFID 2007) has a very strong section on democratic politics. 43 The dilemma here is that it is much more sensitive for external development partners to support the strengthening of demand for better governance (I am writing from an INGO in Vietnam) compared with supporting the supply of more accountable, responsive, predictable, efficient and effective services (through PAR, public financial management reform, local planning reform, education/health service management, etc.).

Source: Adapted from Tran 2007. The composition of political systems in the Asia Pacific is quite distinct from the rest of the world (Figure 2). The Asia Pacific has comparatively very few countries with a presidential or semi-presidential. Only 27 per cent of the countries in the region adopt this political system while the majority (55 per cent) of the rest of the world has it. The majority (58 per cent) of the Asia Pacific countries adopts the parliamentary system \u2013 this choice provides some resilience for the region against corruption, as discussed later in this section. The Asia Pacific has only 2 among 15 absolute monarchies. They are Bhutan and Tonga. However, the Asia Pacific accounts for 3 among 7 one-party systems in the world. They are Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. This also has implications for corruption vulnerability. Figure1.

Let us now see how corruption across with different political systems. Figure 3 presents Tranparency International\u2019s (TI) Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) for 5 main political systems (lower bars mean higher corruption). The first thing to note from this figure is that the Asia Pacific countries perform worse than countries in other regions with the same political system (except for monarchies - CPI data available only for one monarchy in the Asia Pacific, which is Bhutan). Parliamentary states in the Asia Pacific perform much worse than similar systems elsewhere (3.8 versus 6.0). However, they fare better than presidential and semi-presidential systems both Figure 2. Composition of Political Systems Political Economy 46 Asia Pacific Human Development Network inside and out side the region. Somewhat surprisingly, the presidential and semi-presidential systems in the Asia Pacific do not perform significantly better than one-party systems [1] (2.5 and 2.7 versus 2.4). Even more surprisingly, monarchies perform second, only after parliamentary systems (does anyone have a comment here?). From the human development lens, it is important to know the effect of different political systems on various aspects of ordinary people\u2019s life, particularly that of the poor. The TI Global Corruption Barometer is a survey that investigates this area. Figure 4 describes how Asia Pacific people rate the corruption in 7 important aspects of their everyday life. The question asked is: \u201cTo what extent do you perceive the following categories in this country to be affected by corruption? Please answer on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 meaning not at all corrupt, 5 meaning extremely corrupt).\u201d In Figure 4, higher bars mean higher corruption. The sectors are sorted from left to right by its level of corruption. The police is perceived as most corrupt sector, followed by the judiciary system and tax office [2]. The least corrupt sectors are utilities and registry/permit services, Figure 3. Composition of Political Systems Source: Adapted from Tran 2007. 47 although the levels of corruption in these sectors are still very high. Education and medical services rank in the middle of the scale. Once again, parliamentary systems seem to serve the ordinary people better on each of the seven studied sectors. Between the remaining two types, presidential systems are still better than semi-presidential ones. I hope that I have convinced you that in our region parliamentarism performs better than presidentialism. But for us the big question still remains unanswered: why? China vs. India\u2019s approach to fighting corruption: An insight through the human development\u2019s lens? India is a functioning democracy. China is a one-party state. Both are struggling with rampant corruption. Does it imply that both models are not working? Let us put the human development lens on and examine. Let us look at one important aspect of human development: democracy. Figure 5 shows the relationship between democracy and corruption control for 160 countries in the world (each Figure 4.

Some Asia Pacific countries are highlighted. As we can see, when democracy is under some threshold, there is no relationship between democracy and corruption. Beyond the threshold, this relationship becomes strongly positive. India performs very well in term of democracy and has moved beyond the threshold. It seems that India will quickly catch up with Taiwan and South Korea on the corruption control dimension. China is doing poorly: it needs to do a lot to reach the democracy threshold before it can hope to effectively control corruption. Let us now look at another important aspect of human development: education. In figure 6 we can see the same pattern: there is insignificant relationship between education and corruption under a threshold; and a strong relationship beyond it. However, China and India now swap their positions. China is right near the threshold but India falls back far away. Figure 5. Corruption and Democracy Source: Economist Intelligence Unit 2007; Transparency International 2007. 49 In India, democracy cannot be an effective measure against corruption because a large proportion of the population is illiterate. In China, mass education cannot be mobilized to fight corruption because there is limited democracy. Look at figure 5 one more time, among the countries with the same level of democracy, China is already the best in terms of controlling corruption (in figure 5 China is statistically termed an outliner). This means the Chinese government is already doing all it possibly can to constrain corruption, given the current level of democracy. To advance further in the fight against corruption, China inevitably needs strengthen its democracy. India needs to do a similar thing. Figure 6 shows that few countries can successfully control corruption without the support of an educated population. For India, the investment in education is the investment in fighting corruption. Through the human development lens, we can see the biases in China and India\u2019s approaches to dealing with corruption, and the ways to correct them. This lens may help our own countries too. Figure 6. Corruption and School Enrollment Political Economy Source: Transparency International 2007; UNESCO. n.d. 50 Asia Pacific Human Development Network Notes [1] It is often expected that authoritarian rulers in non-democratic countries, with concentrated power in their hands, are more likely to abuse their power and become corrupt. Why presidential and semi- presidential systems do not perform significantly better than one-party systems in the Asia Pacific? [2] This underlines the important lesson that the anti-corruption organization should not be placed within the police (emphasized by Professor Jon Quah, National University of Singapore). Countries that place their national anticorruption organization within the police do not appear to be serious about fighting corruption. Charmaine Rodrigues, UNDP Pacific Centre, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Charmaine Rodrigues responds to Steve Onwuasoanya\u2019s piece on the access to justice in Pacific Island nations, noting that right to information initiatives are proving to be a tool for powerful self-governance in the fight against corruption. Challenges include reluctance to question authority vested in traditional chiefdoms, and remote villagers having little access to information stored in centralized places. To follow up on one of the issues Steve raised, in the context of a human rights-based approach (HRBA), the \u2018right to information\u2019 (RTI) is a key anti-corruption tool that is only recently gaining proper recognition by donors and development practitioners. At the outset I should declare my interest in this topic - prior to joining UNDP I worked in a Commonwealth NGO where I was Coordinator of their RTI Programme (see Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative n.d. for links to resources and case studies). RTI is increasingly being used in developing countries as an anti-corruption tool, as well as a means of empowering people to participate more effectively in their own governance and development. There are considerable resources on this topic from Asia, and India in particular. Indian activists have run some incredibly successful campaigns at the state and district level exposing corruption in local development spending (e.g. evidence of wells not being built, wages to poor workers not being paid, etc), access to services (e.g. food rations being siphoned away from the public distribution system and sold in the black market), government and donor tenders (e.g. poor procurement for Delhi water privatization) and police appointments (e.g. political intervention/cronyism in appointments/transfers of officers). The Indian media have been encouragingly active in support of the campaigns of NGOs and individuals who have crusaded against government corruption using RTI. For example, in Delhi, the Times of India paired with the NGO Parivartan to run the \u2018Tell Them You Know\u2019", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2ad8bc1-3533-466f-9025-981530058446": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2ad8bc1-3533-466f-9025-981530058446", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3db828b1dd4d5dd60efb6538bb9212627035cb225635d58e5660ddddb4fdb5c0"}}, "hash": "3db828b1dd4d5dd60efb6538bb9212627035cb225635d58e5660ddddb4fdb5c0", "text": "campaign. 51 In the Pacific, we have been working to promote RTI as a development and anti-corruption tool. No Pacific Islands country has yet passed a Freedom of Information (FOI) law though PNG has a specific constitutional protection. One of the challenges regarding FOI in the Pacific context is a culture of respect for chiefs and elders which makes the public reluctant to question people in authority. The weak CSO capacity to initially spearhead an RTI campaign, to demonstrate to the public how useful the exercise of their right to information, can be is an additional drawback. One of the strategies for dealing with this issue is to promote greater proactive disclosure from governments. If governments release more information as a matter of practice, they will by default promote greater transparency and hopefully greater public accountability. However I suspect strategies would need to be developed to support CSOs and the media to use and proactively disclose information to hold governments accountable more directly. The other challenge is the rural-capital divide that makes it difficult in practical terms to disseminate information to constituents beyond the centre of power. This broader theme of the \u2018tyranny of distance\u2019 in the context of corruption and accountability is an important one in the Pacific. This is because many anti-corruption efforts are spearheaded by institutions located in capital cities that make it difficult for ordinary villagers to access or even sometimes to be aware of. Proactive disclosure in conjunction with ICT tools may partially help towards addressing these problems. Uganda and Tanzania offer useful examples of information on health and education spending being disseminated right down to the grassroots level and being used by parents to hold service providers accountable for their expenditures. A World Bank Study in Uganda in relation to their education showed that leakage was reduced from 80 per cent to 20 per cent by using an information strategy (World Bank 2001). However, examples of such initiatives in the, that I know of, region are few. Mark Philp, University of Oxford, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Mark Philp\u2019s innovative definition of corruption focuses on political dimensions. According to Mark, the traditional definition, i.e. \u2018the misuse of entrusted power for private gain\u2019, is inadequate, because not only does it fail to capture the distinctive relationships involved in corruption but it also specifies too narrowly the effects of corruption on public decision making. To highlight this, Mark emphasises that the definition of \u2018corruption\u2019 needs to include a message on the nature of functional relationships that underly public decision making. The different roles that people play are parts of a coordinating system that transfers legal principles, values and norms, together with rights and responsibilities. Mark\u2019s definition makes this visible, enabling a view of how corruption corrodes an intricate system of parts, which makes public decision-making increasingly dysfunctional. Political Economy 52 Asia Pacific Human Development Network His definition captures the quality of systemic damage done by corruption to the legal imperatives, social norms, and cultural spirit of relationships that make and administer public decisions. Mark\u2019s focus on the political sphere is very suggestive of broader application. Wherever there is corruption \u2013 whether in education, public health, infrastructure, NGOs, or the private sector, it threatens democracy and freedoms because it profoundly distorts the process of public decision-making. The definition used widely in corruption studies and by anti-corruption agencies, such as Transparency International is \u2018the misuse of entrusted power for private gain\u2019. But this fails to distinguish corruption from other types of malfeasance, such as outright theft or misappropriation. Further difficulties with definition arise from conventions in the anti-corruption community where corruption tends to be used loosely in relation to politics, although there is occasional use in relation to economic institutions. \u2018Political corruption\u2019 is, in some areas, thought of as identifying high level corruption among political leaders and elected officials, as against \u2018administrative corruption\u2019, which concerns those in more junior offices who are, for the most part, engaged in smaller scale corruption, such as \u2018grease payments\u2019, and informal taxes on official decisions. Such distinctions are wholly stipulative. What is missing from (the usual) definition of corruption is the idea that there is something in the nature of the relationships between those involved that serves systematically to subvert the rules, norms, and spirit of the political process. Clearly, outright theft hardly serves the political process; but we tend to reserve \u2018corruption\u2019 to identify occasions in which the process itself becomes distorted. Indeed, one way of understanding why a petty official caught with his hand in the till is generally thought of as a thief rather than corrupt, is that his", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23db2eb0-8565-42dc-8d7b-30a5569eee9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "23db2eb0-8565-42dc-8d7b-30a5569eee9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8c505c9906b4e41dd6bcbd8ee776c0f4735a7add29809be71ccbee9df320215"}}, "hash": "d8c505c9906b4e41dd6bcbd8ee776c0f4735a7add29809be71ccbee9df320215", "text": "or her actions do not distort the political process; whereas a political leader who systematically uses his office to siphon funds into his foreign bank accounts is thought of as corrupt, and as corrupt because the political process becomes distorted. Capturing these subtle distinctions is not always easy, but we need to make some effort to do so, while recognising that the definition is likely to sketch both a set of core cases and a wider penumbra of cases that do not meet all the conditions but are nonetheless recognised as corrupt. An alternative core definition for identifying corruption in politics is as follows. Corruption in politics occurs where a public official (A), acting for personal gain, violates the norms of public 53 office and harms the interests of the public (B) to benefit a third party (C) who rewards A for access to goods or services which C would not otherwise obtain. The key components of this definition are: 1) A concept of public office equipped with rules and norms for the conduct of that office. This encompasses the view that the office is defined partly in terms of a broader public interest that it serves and that this may run against the personal interests of the office-holder or against interests that are not strictly personal but are excluded as illegitimate. 2) A view that corruption involves the distortion of the exercise of public office so that it meets private, partisan or sectional rather than public interests - so that some gain who should not and some lose who should not. 3) The idea that three actors are normally involved or affected by corrupt activity: the occupant of the public office (A), the intended beneficiary of that office (B); and the actual beneficiary of the particular exercise of that office (C). This tri-party relation does not always hold (kleptocracy, for example) but it is important in allowing us to distinguish theft or fraud from corruption, and because it helps capture the sense that corruption distorts the exercise of power. Note that the definition does not assume that A\u2019s behaviour must break the law to be corrupt, since corrupt transactions can be institutionalised in the laws of the state or economy. This has been recognised in recent work by the World Bank on \u2018state capture\u2019, - that is, where corrupt relations subvert the political process and introduce laws that entrench, extend and render legitimate corrupt gains. Even this definition retains the concept of an action being \u2018illicit\u2019 \u2013 that is, that corruption violates the rules, norms, or public expectations of the public office to make unsanctioned or forbidden gains \u2013 and the grounds for and content of these rules must to some degree be local in character. Hence, in part, the difficulty (notwithstanding its importance) in having a common understanding of what counts as acceptable and legitimate, and the difficulty in comparatively studying or measuring corruption. Not all corruption is a corruption of politics (for example, we can talk of economic corruption) but all corruption has the same conceptual structure: a recognition of certain formal responsibilities, which imply constraints on permissible interests; the violation of rules and norms concerning the exercise of the role of office; the harming of one set of interests identified by the rules and Political Economy 54 Asia Pacific Human Development Network norms as legitimate, to serve others deemed impermissible and the benefiting of those not formally entitled to benefit. Corruption is, then, a complex concept. It has a hard conceptual core based around the idea of public office as something other than an opportunity for private or sectional gain, but that core is fleshed out in any given context by local norms and judgments and practices. It becomes more difficult to apply the concept when there is limited consensus on what values, norms and rules should be applied to define the concept. When there are competing norms, then the standards by which we judge a corrupt act becomes either increasingly partisan (favouring one perspective over others) or increasingly abstract \u2013 (based on what we think the standards ought to be). Thus without generating a consensus on those standards it is not clear as to how to motivate recognition by those involved that they are engaged in wrong-doing: doubly difficult because it is not clear that it is strictly wrong \u2013 because local rules and standards cannot be wholly ignored.

Having a democratic government carved by the United States, with a large portion of the population undereducated and without sufficient knowledge about the working of such government and their rights, makes the political environment susceptible to corruption by top level government leaders. Similar to other developing countries that receive aid from donor countries, funds flow into the country through the hands of the political leaders who have full authority over the disbursement of such funds. By taking advantage of the lack of knowledge and understanding among their constituencies, leaders fall to corruption trap which essentially undermines their responsibility toward their people. There is no anti-corruption law to address the rising trend in corrupt behaviour by government leaders at the different levels of governments in FSM. There is also evidence of corruption in religious and traditional organizations that have gone unheeded.

Civil society organizations should be recognised and empowered by government to play their role as a watch-dog over government leaders and their activities, and to report to independent ombudsman or prosecutor to take legal action against political wrongdoers. The strong traditional system existing in some of the states of FSM makes it difficult to deal with high profile figures in society, who have gained leadership positions through tradition, religion, or government. Good governance must be supported by all sectors in society, including traditional society, religious organizations, civil society organizations, and the government through proper legislation such as anti-corruption laws and an effective court system. There is also a need for a public awareness programme aimed at improving and elevating the citizens\u2019 understanding about their rights and government so that they are more aware and can make better informed decisions. After all, it is the protection and promotion of their human rights that gives rise to the establishment of the political entities requiring good governance in the interest of the populace. Charmaine Rodrigues, UNDP Pacific Centre, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Charmaine Rodrigues responds to Ramachandran AL Ramasamy\u2019s piece on participation in the context of political ownership of \u2018old\u2019 media (and thus the value of new e-media towards citizen empowerment). Charmaine says in small island states in the Pacific, there has actually been good success with traditional media, in particular radio. This is attributable to two key reasons: first, people are brought into the \u2018accountability loop\u2019 by strengthening the investigative and logistical capacities of community organisations, and second, policy messages about anti- corruption are made understandable so citizens can do something with the information. Mr. Ramasamy\u2019s contribution regarding the media was very interesting. However, it is notable that in the Pacific, ICT and development initiatives are still in their very nascent stages, and thus ideas that rely on the internet and web-based solutions are often considered problematic in this region. The coverage of internet - and even of basic telecommunications - in the region is quite inadequate. Additionally given the very limited access to computers (other than in the capital city), and low literacy levels, web-based solutions tend to be relatively ineffective in the Pacific. Political Economy 56 Asia Pacific Human Development Network Nevertheless, I would make two points in response: 1) In order to harness ICT development tools in the Pacific to combat corruption, innovative partnerships need to be developed between all sectors of society. For example, if the government proactively discloses more information on websites, then community service organisations, churches and other organisations with local networks could be supported and encouraged to access this information, simplify it for their constituents and assist with its dissemination in rural areas. In terms of tackling corruption the key steps are: 1) ensuring that the information is comprehensible to ordinary people so that they can actually do something with it, and 2) making sure ordinary people are brought into the information/participation/ accountability loop. 2) In the Pacific, the traditional media cannot be overlooked as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4fc032c-9cdb-44c6-8a77-82328511c819": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4fc032c-9cdb-44c6-8a77-82328511c819", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25fa42c311dc80640607778a8a8b1bee78e0a594ae81d46c37831ad1c1b22742"}}, "hash": "25fa42c311dc80640607778a8a8b1bee78e0a594ae81d46c37831ad1c1b22742", "text": "potential anti-corruption champions. There have been a number of programmes that have been implemented in the region to build up and support media organisations to develop their investigative journalism skills, and more such work could be useful. In particular, using the radio as a means of disseminating information and promoting anti-corruption drives is important, primarily because radio has proven to be the most effective medium in combating the \u2018tyranny of distance\u2019 in the region. Given the limited reach of local television and that newspapers suffer from coverage and literacy problems, radio emerges as the most effective medium that can be harnessed to send simple messages across vast distances at a relatively low cost. Usaia Ratuvili, Fiji Human Rights Commission, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Usaia Ratuvili focuses on whether there is anything distinctive about corruption in Fiji. Referring to reciprocal gift giving, Usaia says it cannot be justified because it destroys equality, prevents access for those who cannot afford gifts and fosters a welfare mentality. Usaia\u2019s observation is that corruption affects policy implementation, and distorts allocation of scarce resources in Fiji. Corruption in the context of Fiji is something very topical as it was the rationale used by the military for their direct intervention into the politics of the Fiji Islands on 5 December 2006. Their stated motive for the removal of the former regime was to \u2018clean up\u2019 corruption and to dismantle the institutional infrastructure that was conducive to corruption. These included entrenched centres of privilege limited to a few individuals and families, unequal access to opportunities for advancement, reservation of opportunities and government assistance along ethnic and racial lines. But what exactly does corruption mean in the Fijian context? Is there anything peculiarly \u2018Fijian\u2019 about corruption in our context? What distinguishes corruption as defined in Fiji\u2019s laws from 57 other developing small island nations around the world? Corruption involving public officials is an offence attracting a sentence of seven years. Other offences include extortion by a public official (3 years); public officers receiving property to show favour (6 months); false claim by officials; abuse of office etc. Juxtaposed with this legal framework is the cultural aspect of reciprocal gift giving and often the question is posed, whether the offering and acceptance of gifts can be justified on the grounds that it is a cultural practice when often the person receiving the gift is someone in an official position who has the ability to bestow or withdraw benefits from the gift giver. Corruption strikes at the notion of equality since the very fact of offering an inducement to a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 for a service that was legitimately due anyway, results in unequal access because people who cannot afford to offer such inducements are at a disadvantage. This becomes more magnified in small island economies such as Fiji and its Pacific Island neighbours, with their small economies and limited budgets. The insidious influence of corruption affects the implementation of policies, skews the allocation of scarce resources and nurtures a handout mentality that does not encourage ability but relies on bribery and inducement for advancement. Corruption can therefore be a barrier to economic and social development and can even contribute to the breach of human rights. Roy Laifungbam, Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Centre for Policy and Human Rights in India\u2019s North East, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Roy Laifungbam uses a pan-Asian lens to observe that there are no gaps between \u2018disciplines\u2019 like economics and culture. This has only served to embed and sanctify corruption in a profoundly monolithic way in Asia, where given the importance of religion in society, corruption is taught as acceptable in high places. Roy wonders about the \u2018political economy\u2019 approach. He suggests governance as entry point. Special focus needs to be on the continuities (binding social, economics, politics, and culture). This contrasts with earlier contributions emphasising discontinuities; e.g. the distinctive relationships associated with corruption, (Mark Philp), the unlikeness of acts grouped under corruption in China (Andrew Wedeman), etc. In Asia and the Pacific, I feel that an approach to the issue of corruption and its nexus with poverty needs to revisit our very notions of the unifying concepts we seek to bring into an analysis that makes sense, theoretically and practically. While we can with considerable ease bring the modernistic discourses of human rights, rule of law, social and environmental justice, gender and so forth into such a debate, we often tend to overlook the ageless Asian traditions and belief systems that \u2018govern\u2019 most Asians in their personal lives.

In much of Asia, a region difficult to define as it is, for it is more an age-old philosophical and western construct than a geo-physical one, the role of religion and traditional belief systems (that pre-date the modern religions such as Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism including Zoroastrian and a myriad other indigenous beliefs) have intertwined with social and cultural ones such as the Varna system (the basis of caste in South Asia), the Buraku system of Japan and many slavery-like social and cultural systems. The Asian is in essence, a complex being influenced by many winds that determines her/his behaviour on a daily basis. It is difficult, even a hazard, to delineate the economic from the social and cultural scenario in Asia, because the two (if we can call them that) are one actually. The theory and practice of \u2018charity\u2019 in Asia are hyper-refined. Charity, in Asian culture and its economy, is a financial and moral deal. Through this deal, poverty is acceptable and to be poor is also a virtue. To be poor, and to live in poverty, is often a highly desired state to be in over the ages, and this deep belief persists in Asia today. In India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand for example, influential wealthy and not so wealthy families alike make a big show of certain passage of life rituals that idolise and deify poverty, fair-play, charity, sacrifice, the giving and receiving of alms and the denunciation of the \u2018worldly ways\u2019. These rituals justify the corrupt lives that they have and continue to live. It exonerates them from the role they play in the perpetuation and support of deeply corrupt governance, governments, bureaucracies, and business. What I mean to say is that in Asia, corruption is a way of life that has become gradually institutionalised over the ages through religious and quasi-religious praxis, moral teachings that have corruption inlays, stories and epics that illustrate the corruption acceptable in high places and among the privileged. But what is also interesting is that the illustrations convey a dualistic message, posed as a moral dilemma to the individual, to individual growth and finally to individual fulfilment. Transforming the Asian morality (if we can identify a single one!) and individual morality in the context of corruption and poverty is challenging, to say the least. Especially as we remember that in the electoral politics of Asian democracies, it is the poor that are the vote banks, while the educated decision makers and movers often do not find the need to exercise this right. In the domain of religious and moral freedoms, anti-corruption measures impose restrictions that can be perceived as intolerable and undesirable. When, in Asia, it is precisely in this domain that corruption is tended and nurtured. 59 Therefore, in my view, we need to understand and define corruption in terms that we can grapple within the governance framework we have outlined for ourselves. The political economy of corruption is a limited framework in the Asian context, but it can be useful if we define its parameters appropriately within governance to make it a useful tool to address the nexus between corrupt governance and perpetuation, or even the creation of poverty. Fayyaz Baqir, UNDP Pakistan, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Fayyaz Baqir urges focus on corruption as social practice, beyond governance. Practice is \u2018the common thread\u2019 across cultures that provides the needed point of entry. This, he suggests, makes the priority less about \u2018what to define as a corrupt practice\u2019 and more about agreeing on the importance of capability/ freedom to act accountably and to demand accountability in others. In my view while it is important to know the cultural context and operational definitions of corruption in order to distinguish it from other forms of abuse of authority, we can still find certain common threads relating to corrupt practices. One of the most important \u2018enabling\u2019 factors for corruption is use of discretionary power by people in authority. It happens even in those situations where person in power legally does not have discretionary power but exercises it due to the lack of organized citizenry. This leads to the second factor which is fragmented, disorganized, uninformed and \u2018untrained\u2019 citizen power which can check corruption.

I am not talking of people but practices here. If we want to root out corruption then we have many success stories. I can identify many citizen sponsored cases in South Asia that need to be documented and shared with others to learn from. New practices always start as fragmented battles and are not as neat as logical framework analyses. However with patience and continuous support they can be expanded and HRD should promote learning by sharing learning. Political Economy 60 Asia Pacific Human Development Network Ajit Mishra, University of Bath, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: This posting contains two contributions from Ajit Mishra. The first asks if the \u2018law of demand\u2019 ensures a never-ending queue of bribe takers. Or, will the renewal of integrity centred on economic and participatory empowerment of citizens transform demand? Ajit Mishra builds on Ramachandran\u2019s discussion about the degree of responsibility that should be assigned to bribe givers, arguing it is better to concentrate on takers because the \u2018law of demand\u2019 establishes a never- ending queue of taker. Additionally givers are often poorer people paying extortion bribes. I agree with Ramachandran\u2019s point on the use of e-media in fighting corruption. Information flow is faster and it is less susceptible to manipulation. Recent experience (i.e tehelka.com in India) suggests that it can go a long way in raising awareness. On the other hand, since information is likely to be \u2018softer\u2019, its strength can be its weakness too. I am less comfortable with the degree of responsibility assigned to bribe givers. I am not saying that it is wrong to hold bribe givers accountable, but I do not think it should be made central to the design of anti-corruption strategies for a number of reasons. 1) Let me take Gerardo\u2019s example of a certain Swedish company offering a bribe in Latin America-and yet Sweden is perceived as one of the low-corruption countries. Similar scandals have involved Swedish companies in India as well. In fact the bribe payers\u2019 index (BPI) for 2006 gives Sweden a score of 7.62, and Sweden ranks only behind Switzerland as relatively \u2018clean\u2019. BPI looks at the propensity of companies from leading exporting nations to bribe abroad, and a score of 10 implies zero propensity. If we accept this index as a rough guide, Swedish companies also pay bribes regularly, although less frequently than companies from many other countries. But this scenario is compatible with Sweden receiving its score on the corruption perception index. Inside Sweden, the Swedish Anti-bribery Institute issues pamphlets that explain the law concerning bribery in plain language. A common media headline around Christmas reads: \u2018Think about the presents you give to your customer - it could be a crime\u2019. I am aware of a case where a proclaimed gift (token of gratitude) of an opera ticket costing 50 Euros was successfully prosecuted as a case of bribery. Sweden keeps its own house clean and hence receives a low score. 2) We have had international anti-bribery laws for a while now, but most of the developed countries have not been able to apply their domestic standards to the overseas operations of their companies. This is not confined only to OECD countries: many of the leading Asian 61 countries rank fairly low according to the BPI. India and China are supposedly the worst offenders. It therefore appears that the implementation of anti-bribery laws at the international level is never going to work. First there is the issue of global competition: for example if a Swedish company does not pay, an Indian company might pay and win the contract. Second, it will be difficult to prove that these companies were facilitators and not victims. After all, the same company might do dirty business in one country but remain clean in another. 3) Even domestically, it may not possible to hold bribe givers accountable in many situations. In many instances, the poor and middle class end up paying extortion bribes and clearly they cannot be held responsible. We are more justified in making bribe-giving an offence in a collusive rather than an extortion situation.

A quick note regarding Bill Tod\u2019s point regarding the effectiveness of a top-down approach and participatory monitoring. Unfortunately, there is no general result showing which one works better. In the context of corruption, top-down monitoring may not work because the monitors could be corruptible. Similarly, grass-roots monitoring may not work because of the free-rider problem and possibility of local capture. Hence we should be open about the use of any particular instrument and let the choice be dictated by the specifics of the case. Olken\u2019s Indonesian experiment (referred to by Bill Tod in his contribution) is interesting but we need to note couple of things about this experiment. First, these are participatory projects by villagers themselves (no outside contractors used); hence there is an element of decentralisation already present. Second, as the author himself points out, the government audit (which is supposed to have reduced corruption) is mostly procedural with little chance of leading to any prosecution. At the end of the day, 20 percent of expenditures were still unaccounted for in these villages despite increased monitoring. Political Economy 62 Asia Pacific Human Development Network Li Jing, UNDP China, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Li Jing responds to various observations on China, first noting that e-media is too technically-reliant to be a good empowerment tool in countries where it is easily countered by an official click of the \u2018off\u2019 button. Instead, Jing urges a strategic analysis of the institutional causes of corruption \u2018in all their local varieties or contexts\u2019 and designing programmes that focus on under-developed democratic institutions with the aim of making public decision-making more accountable It is quite enlightening to read through the contributions of the group members, who have provided such comprehensive and diverse perspectives. Here I would like to respond to a few of the points made earlier in this community. First, I would like to challenge the preference to e-media as an effective tool to fight against corruption (see Ramachandran AL Ramasamy\u2019s contribution). I would argue that e-media or the so-called real-time media may only serve as a technical solution rather than an institutional solution to corruption. If we really stand for a rights-based approach to human development, it is essential to explore the institutional causes of corruption in its variety of forms, such as lack of democratic institutions that hold the government officials accountable to the public. In addition, technical solutions can be easily countered by technical measures. For instance, in the past, it took the people in power, many years to nurture or capture the traditional media, such as newspapers and radio, for their own advantage. However today, it may take only one \u2018click\u2019 for those in power to block the e-media. A good example may be that there is virtually no information in Chinese websites on the recent large-scale demonstration that took place in a coastal city in China on an environmental issue. Unfortunately, the reality is that without genuine democracy, those in power have more resources and are therefore more capable of taking advantage of the latest technology to serve their own purposes. The latter observation also applies to other anti-corruption approaches, means and tools that have been discussed, such as RTI, citizen empowerment and transparency (see Charmaine Rodrigues\u2019s contributions and others). These means assume (but fail to note) that they contain a prerequisite which is that a certain level of democracy is in place, with its whole set of institutional arrangements (such as general elections, judicial independence, released control over the press, and so on). Ngoc Anh Tran\u2019s comparative study between India and China provides an interesting 63 perspective, and generates a simple and rather straightforward conclusion which is that corruption is negatively) correlated to the degree of democracy.

Wedeman, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Andrew Wedeman discusses Mark Philp\u2019s contribution on characterising corruption. Andrew suggests the \u2018embezzlement\u2019 (autogenic) type of corruption needs to be included in \u2018corruption\u2019 despite not involving interaction with a second party (which is where Mark put special focus) because it invokes the realm of public-decision-making. The backdrop here is that if public decision-making processes are distorted by corruption this impacts on the poor, and threatens liberties and democracy more broadly. Andrew\u2019s contribution raises the issue whether these values are equally damaged by theft of large amounts of money, given how this impinges indirectly on public decisions. A footnote on Andrew\u2019s reference to \u2018transactive\u2019 corruption: this is where two parties collude for mutual gain, without coercion, for reduced price on an entitled service, e.g. private sector practice of bribing public official for preferential contract treatment; or citizen bribing for cheaper licence or tax exemption. It strikes me that Mark Philp\u2019s definition is essentially confined to what is termed as \u2018transactive corruption\u2019. It does not however, appear to address cases where officials and politicians use their authority to loot the treasury. In a sense Mark is correct that embezzlement (or what has been called \u2018auto corruption\u2019 because it does not involve an exchange of power for favours) is simply a form of theft. But it seems to me that when the president of a country siphons money from the central bank into his private offshore account that is deemed as corrupt. Political Economy 64 Asia Pacific Human Development Network Mark Philp, University of Oxford, wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Mark Philp, responding to Andrew Wedeman, elaborates on his \u2018systematic distortion\u2019 view of corruption. Mark sees the characterising core of corruption as: 1) a particular type of behaviour (associated with misuse of public trust/rights); and 2) its systematic distortion of democratic processes. Strengths of this view are that it: o Improves focus on core values (human development) while avoiding a quixotic search for definition. o Comprises givers and takers. o Also encompasses persons entitled but \u2018ripped off\u2019 by corrupt distribution (typically the poor). o Focuses on the \u2018character\u2019 of social practice not just consequences (simple economic costs). o Implies that effects of certain behaviour are remedied by increased capabilities and freedoms \u2013 not cured by prescribing duties. Some limitations, as Mark notes are: o The three conditions of corruption (see original piece) are not enough to say \u2018this is a case of corruption\u2019 (e.g. treason). o Differing thresholds apply in different state contexts, which internal political processes need to interpret and set. I think there are four partly separate issues: 1) Do we want to count embezzlement as corruption? In my original comment I suggested that our intuitive responses vary across cases. We think of some forms of embezzlement as just thieving, while those that trouble us more are tended to be classified as corruption (e.g. kleptocracy). My sense is that the latter group is associated in particular with high political office and high levels of embezzlement, and consequently with high levels of trust. I also suggested that what makes us want to regard this as more than just theft is that the activity subverts a model of responsibility and political functioning sufficiently seriously, for us to think that a systematic distortion of the political process has occurred. My view is that this is what is really central to the idea of corruption and the essence of this is not captured by the simple idea of \u2018misuse of power for private gain\u2019. Even if that statement is compatible with the idea of systematic distortion, it does not clearly point to the idea of systematic distortion, and it leaves out a range of cases where the distortion does not involve private gain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9c6d314-f384-419f-9fa7-7415fed781b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9c6d314-f384-419f-9fa7-7415fed781b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b21d2bb5fd23c33648be294ec1758128e23cb6636a50cc96f814dcc11e8dbea8"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ded6029-975e-4a49-aae2-a0b7428d3e92", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6186eefb60821b4da0839abaa3d17070bb4604816928262a06a7c7e12aa9c2bd"}}, "hash": "fe083400a8dc208447fdcb503e6652aa499cecdde823cf7625f7513ebdea4330", "text": "2) Is the definition that I proposed just a definition of a specific sub-set of cases of corruption, and do we risk ending up with definitions of a range of distinct cases, without some underlying link thread that makes coherent sense of them all? 65 My view (developed elsewhere in the pieces I cited, but emphasised further here) is that the definition I advanced does capture the core sense of corruption as a systematic distortion of a political process and of positions of trust that benefits some people", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78ab29f0-b25c-427d-b02f-1fc9c3938493": {"__data__": {"id_": "78ab29f0-b25c-427d-b02f-1fc9c3938493", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Transforming Corruption through Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-transforming-corruption-through-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eec257309b2e7ca947741d8fef4aa361cd8d5c33985b300c74ba57af0f229cb4"}}, "hash": "eec257309b2e7ca947741d8fef4aa361cd8d5c33985b300c74ba57af0f229cb4", "text": "who should not really gain in the process while resulting in losses for people who should not really lose in the process. This loose description can be tightened into a hard core of cases that meet the definition I proposed; but simultaneously this definition recognises that there will be a penumbra of cases which do not fit the definition fully but that are marked by the type of systematic abuse that we are trying to capture when we talk about corruption. So the grand embezzlement case appears as if it lacks one part of the transaction dimension but it is corruption when it is systematic and when, as a result, it ends up distorting the political and allocative processes of the state. In that sense it bears sufficient family resemblance to the core I have defined to be admitted. In contrast, my objection to the TI definition is that it takes this case as definitive and fails to capture the more systematic distortion that underlies corrupt activity. To give an example of how even the core fails, consider the case of someone who is rewarded by a foreign government for passing on military secrets, but he passes them on anyway because of ideological conviction. This seems to meet all the core criteria for corruption, but the case is usually labelled \u2018treason\u2019, partly on the grounds that the seriousness of this offence trumps the more minor (relatively) charge of corruption, and partly on the grounds that the ideological motivations of those involved may complicate the ascription of individual, sectional or partisan gain. This example shows that not only are the three conditions I identified for corruption not jointly necessary for corruption (grand embezzlement fails to meet one), but nor are they sufficient (since something can meet the three conditions and still not be classified as corrupt, as in treason). This is unfortunate but inevitable (and is covered by the definition\u2019s use of \u2018normally\u2019 in the third condition), given that the ascription of corruption involves both descriptive and normative judgments, and because there are disagreements about the exact borders between what involves a systematic distortion of the political process and what does not. This is a concept, where it is possible to agree on core cases (and I take these to be transactive and involving systematic distortion of the political process), but penumbra cases often need to be argued on a case-by-case basis. This complicates explanation, but part of the point of making sure they are classified appropriately is that we believe that they share certain fundamental features that might be susceptible to systematic explanation. Political Economy 66 Asia Pacific Human Development Network 3) How does this \u2018systematic distortion\u2019 view of corruption deal with the concerns about the relativism of the norms and values that form each culture\u2019s identification of corruption? This can be expressed most clearly as follows: the concept of corruption tracks a distinctive type of behaviour associated with the abuse of public office and involving systematic distortion in its exercise. That is the core for the concept that we are trying to understand, and whose incidence and effects we are trying to explain. Some cultures may use the term corruption very differently, but then I do not believe they have this concept, and it would be necessary to explore what concept they were working with. Yet the concept is very widespread, because its root sense of decay and degeneration from a natural standard are also widespread, and the use of corruption to refer to natural entities like fruit encourages the extension to less clearly natural entities like public office. But even if people share that core sense they still need to clearly enunciate the rules and norms by which they identify what is acceptable or unacceptable in public office and need to ensure that this dimension of the culturally relevant is sustained. In some cases, however, this will mean that a local way of constructing the nature and rules of public office could be such that we will want to say that they fail to see that the rules they are applying cannot possibly secure the outcomes they associate with the nature of public office - that their local account is at odds with the concept they are implicitly attempting to track. But that just means that we think there is an objective core to the definition of corruption, and that the role of cultural norms is to info
