About 1 900 (1 650 to 2 150, 90 per cent range) Gt CO2 were emitted by 2011, leaving about 1 000 Gt CO2 to be consistent with the 2\u00b0C objective. Importantly, some non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases such as methane and tropospheric ozone have a much shorter residence time in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide, and are therefore sometimes called short-lived climate pollutants/forcers. Because of their shorter time in the atmosphere, the annual emissions of these substances have a bigger impact on temperature than their cumulative emissions (Solomon et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2012). 10 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 2 What emission levels will comply with temperature limits? Over a longer period of time the carbon dioxide emissions budget cannot be exhausted if the goal is to stay within a particular temperature limit. It can be temporarily exhausted but then the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere must be compensated by net negative carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 emissions that are actively removed from the atmosphere and sequestered. Note, the feasibility of achieving global negative emissions is uncertain and associated with a host of other risks (Fuss et al., 2014).

Note that while Example C requires net negative global emissions to stay within the budget, scenarios in the other examples might also make use of negative emissions to a lesser extent if it helps facilitate the required emissions reductions. The examples are explained in the text. The right hand panel shows annual carbon dioxide emissions (black line) over time from Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. (2013). The coloured areas under the curves show the cumulative carbon dioxide emissions from 2010 onwards. The purple- coloured area denotes cumulative carbon dioxide emissions with a likely (66 per cent) chance of limiting warming to below 2 \u00b0C, including uncertainty. In this report, these cumulative emissions are called the carbon dioxide emissions budget. The grey- coloured area denotes the cumulative carbon dioxide emissions projected under business-as-usual scenarios which assume no climate policies (likewise including uncertainty). The grey area, cumulative emissions under business-as-usual, is clearly larger than the blue area, the carbon dioxide emissions budget for staying within 2 \u00b0C. Cumulative emissions are taken from the WGIII assessment of the IPCC AR5 (Clarke et al., 2014). significantly during the first half of this century, but with important variations. In Example B, action is taken early to reduce emissions, which means that emissions are lower in the first period as compared to Example A. Since the carbon dioxide emissions budget is not used up as quickly in Example B, it has higher emissions in the second half of the century than Example A. Meanwhile, in Example C, action is delayed at the beginning of the period and initial emissions are higher than in Examples A or B. To stay within the carbon dioxide emissions budget, Example C requires sharp emission reductions immediately afterwards and net negative emissions in the second half of this century. 11 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Chapter 2 What emission levels will comply with temperature limits? ____________________ 13 Hosted at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and available at: https://secure.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/ene/AR5DB/ 14 These are cost optimal scenarios in that they take advantage of the lowest cost mitigation options available. These and other trade-offs related to staying within the emissions budget are discussed in Section 2.3.4. 2 .3 .3 Carbon dioxide emissions budgets, greenhouse gas emissions and temperature limits We have seen above that it is necessary to stay within a specific carbon dioxide emissions budget to keep warming below 2 \u00b0C or some other global warming limit. How then can these budgets be spread out over time? To answer this question, the following sections examine scenarios from integrated assessment models. These models take into account changes in the energy system and other important societal processes, and therefore help identify economically and technologically feasible emission reduction rates and emission pathways. The scenarios are taken from the IPCC WGIII AR5 scenario database13 (Box 2.2). As mentioned above, science has convincingly established the proportional relationship between global temperature increases and cumulative carbon dioxide emissions. Hence we first focus on carbon dioxide emissions and then report findings on carbon dioxide plus non-carbon dioxide emissions. The discussion of carbon dioxide emission budgets is structured according to two dimensions. The first divides scenarios according to the year in which concerted emission reductions14 begin \u2013 either 2010 or 2020: - Least-cost 2010 scenarios: the scenarios in this subset are of the same kind analysed in previous gap reports. These are scenarios with a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit and that follow a least-cost emissions pathway with stringent reductions after 2010. A least-cost emission pathway is one that takes advantage of lowest cost options for emission reductions and minimizes total costs of reduction up to 2100. - Least-cost 2020 scenarios: this subset of scenarios also has a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit. But they depart from the least-cost 2010 scenarios by assuming that emission reductions are only modest up to 2020, that pledges are fully implemented in 2020, and that a least-cost emissions pathway with rapid reductions is only followed after 2020. These are often called delayed action or later action scenarios because they begin their least-cost pathway in 2020 rather than 2010. (Modest here means that the speed of emission reductions up to 2020 is significantly slower than in the least-cost 2010 scenarios, and emissions actually increase until 2020). It is important to note that the current pathway of global emissions is so far more consistent with the least-cost 2020 scenarios than the least-cost 2010 scenarios.

Second, the least- cost 2020 scenarios seem to be more in accord with current projections of emissions for 2020. Global emissions in 2020 are projected to be 52\u201354 Gt CO2e under various pledge cases (Chapter 3). Least- cost 2020 scenarios are close to this range with 50\u201353 Gt CO2e in 2020, while least- cost 2010 scenarios are much lower with a range of 41-47 Gt CO2e in 2020. The second dimension by which the discussion is structured divides scenarios according to whether or not they rely on net negative carbon dioxide emissions from the energy and industrial sectors in order to stay within the emissions budget. As noted earlier, net negative global emissions are required in some scenarios to compensate for having temporarily exceeded the emissions budget or to facilitate a peak and decline in global 12 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 2 What emission levels will comply with temperature limits? Box 2 .2: Data and methodology Findings in this report are based on an analysis of emission scenarios available in the IPCC AR5 Working Group III scenario database, hosted at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis and available at: https:// secure.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/ene/AR5DB/. We use the original data for carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel and industry, total carbon dioxide emissions, and total global greenhouse gas emissions, defined in this report as the gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol. Non-carbon dioxide gases are reported in units of billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (Gt CO2e/yr), and are computed from the 100-year global warming potentials as specified by UNFCCC (2002). Not included in the analysis is the recently added greenhouse gas, nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Contributions to global temperature increase of the air pollutants sulphur dioxide, black carbon, organic carbon and tropospheric ozone with its precursors are included in the same way as in the IPCC AR5 WGIII assessment. Many air-pollutant species have a common source, and some cool the atmosphere while others warm it. Hence, the cooling or warming effect of reducing these pollutants will depend on the precise mixture that is being reduced. While the Copenhagen Accord pledges do not target these species, integrated assessment models provide trends of air-pollutant emissions consistent with the overall changes in the energy system. In the scenarios analysed in this chapter, air pollutants thus are assumed to change in accordance with changes in carbon dioxide emissions. Data for determining the probability of scenarios staying within 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C limits were taken from the IPCC AR5 scenario database. These data were computed with the probabilistic carbon-cycle and climate model MAGICC (Meinshausen et al., 2011a; Meinshausen et al., 2011b) in a setup that closely simulates the global temperature response to greenhouse gas emissions of the most complex climate models (Rogelj et al., 2012). This setup is in line with the most recent Working Group I assessment (Jones et al., 2013) and takes into account recent conjectures about a lower climate sensitivity (Rogelj et al., 2014). While this approach provides a single consistent framework for the assessment of temperature outcomes, the probabilities reported here depend on this particular framework and do not take into account uncertainty about the model structure. Temperature increase is computed relative to the 1850\u20131900 period, which is referred to as pre-industrial levels. For the analyses in this chapter, we focus on scenarios that limit warming to below 2 \u00b0C by the end of the 21st century; and scenarios that limit warming below 1.5 \u00b0C by the end of the 21st century. Note that scenarios that stay within the 2 \u00b0C limit up to 2100, but also have increasing temperatures during that year, might still exceed 2 \u00b0C in the next century. This analysis further uses methodologies described in the literature (Rogelj et al., 2011). warming.

Scenarios are grouped based on their energy and industry-related emissions only, because the main technological uncertainties surrounding negative emissions (related to BECCS) are reflected most in these sectors. 13 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Chapter 2 What emission levels will comply with temperature limits? 1. Carbon neutrality is reached around 2065 (range: 2055\u20132070) under the subset of least- cost 2020 scenarios, which \u2013 as noted above \u2013 may be more consistent with the current pathway of emissions up to 2020 than other scenario subsets. Here carbon neutrality means that carbon dioxide emissions16 from society are net zero on the global scale. Net zero implies that any remaining carbon dioxide emissions are simultaneously compensated by the same amount of carbon dioxide uptake (negative emissions) so that the net input of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere due to human activities is zero. 2. Almost all scenarios in the IPCC AR5 scenario database with a likely chance of limiting warming to below 2 \u00b0C reach carbon neutrality at some point in the second half of this century (Figure 2.4, panels a\u2013d). ____________________ 16 Carbon dioxide emissions refers to the sum of carbon dioxide emissions from energy, industry, and land use/land cover change. 3. If emissions up to 2020 would be lower than in the least-cost 2020 scenarios, the carbon dioxide emissions budget would be used up less quickly, and the timing of carbon neutrality could be postponed by about 5\u201315 years. Hence, increasing ambition over the next few years would postpone by several years the difficult challenge of reaching net zero emissions. 4. In the scenario database from the IPCC, all least- cost 2020 scenarios assume that net negative carbon dioxide emissions are needed at some point during this century to stay within the 2 \u00b0C limit. These scenarios further assume that carbon dioxide removal technologies such as bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) will be implemented. The uncertainty around these technologies is discussed in Box 2.3. The scenarios also indicate that the higher the emissions in the near term, the Box 2 .3: Negative emissions Negative carbon dioxide emissions, the active removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, can be achieved by several means. These include afforestation or reforestation, carbon dioxide storage in combination with direct-air-capture, and BECCS (Tavoni and Socolow, 2013). BECCS is a measure that is applied often in model- based studies because of its attractive costs and high potential. However, the viability of large-scale BECCS deployment depends on overcoming some critical barriers. Fuss et al. (2014) identified four: 1: physical and resource constraints (such as water availability), including the sustainability of large-scale deployment relative to other land- and biomass-related needs such as food security and biodiversity conservation, and the presence of safe, long term storage capacity for the captured carbon dioxide; 2: the response of natural land and ocean carbon sinks to negative emissions; 3: the costs and financing of an untested technology; and 4: socio-institutional barriers, such as public acceptance of large-scale carbon capture and storage and large- scale bioenergy production (UNEP, 2012; van Vuuren et al., 2013 ), and the related deployment policies. Furthermore, the real-world availability of bioenergy is limited by many factors which are not fully represented in models (Creutzig et al., 2012) and current estimates from integrated assessment models of total mitigation potential vary greatly, sometimes by a factor of three (Tavoni and Socolow, 2013). Importantly, integrated assessment models also show that stringent climate targets can be achieved without BECCS (Riahi et al., 2012), or with just enough BECCS such that carbon dioxide emissions from energy and industry are net zero. 14 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 2 What emission levels will comply with temperature limits? larger the negative emissions required later in the century to stay within the carbon dioxide emissions budget (Table 2.1). 5. Scenarios with higher emissions in the near term, least-cost 2020 scenarios, exhaust the carbon dioxide emissions budget more quickly than scenarios with lower emissions in the first few years of the scenario period (least-cost 2010 scenarios).

More than half of the scenarios in the IPCC AR5 scenario database that limit warming to below 2 \u00b0C with a likely chance reach net zero global total greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of this century. 2. All scenarios in the subset of least-cost 2020 scenarios, which, as noted above, may be more consistent with the current pathway of emissions up to 2020, reach net zero total greenhouse gas emissions some time between 2080 and 2100, or have nearly net zero total greenhouse gas emissions in 210019. 3. The timing of net zero global total emissions does not change much for the least cost 2010 scenarios. In that case the timing of net zero emissions would only be pushed back by about 10 years. 4. Least-cost 2010 scenarios show a median emissions level of 44 Gt CO2e per year in 2020 (range: 41\u201347). 5. Least-cost 2020 scenarios show a median emissions level of 52 Gt CO2e per year in 2020 (range: 50\u201353). While this figure is much higher than in scenarios that begin stringent emission reductions in 2010 \u2013 least-cost 2010 scenarios \u2013 it is still exceeded by the expected level of emissions under almost all the pledge cases (Chapter 3). 6. Looking further into the future, global emissions decline in all scenario groupings considered. In the least-cost 2020 scenarios, median global emissions of total greenhouse gases for 2025, 2030 and 2050 are 47, 42, and 22 Gt CO2e per year respectively (Table 2.2). ____________________ 18 Total greenhouse gas emissions is used here to mean the global emissions of the Kyoto gases as listed in Footnote 5. 19 Four scenarios in this subset show total greenhouse gas emissions in 2100 which are below 0.25 Gt CO2e per year, but still above zero. 20 For example, van Vliet et al. (2012); Rogelj et al. (2013a,b); Riahi et al. (2013); Luderer et al., (2013a,b); Kriegler et al. (2014a) and the IPCC AR5 WGIII report (Clarke et al., 2014). Constraints for limiting warming to below 1 .5 \u00b0C Working Group III of the IPCC AR5 indicated that only a small number of studies have identified feasible total greenhouse gas emission pathways that are consistent with staying below a 1.5 \u00b0C limit up to 2100 with at least a 50 per cent chance. This small group of studies agree that staying within 1.5 \u00b0C requires: 1: immediate and strong mitigation action; 2: the rapid upscaling of the full portfolio of mitigation technologies; and 3: development along a low-energy demand trajectory (IPCC, 2014). Within these studies, only a small number of scenarios meet the 1.5 oC target with at least a 50 per cent chance, and have least-cost pathways beginning in 2010. Emission levels in one set of these scenarios are 37\u201341 Gt CO2e in 2020, 27\u201331 Gt CO2e in 2030, and 13\u201317 Gt CO2e in 2050 (Rogelj et al., 2013b). Emissions levels in another set are 39\u201343 Gt CO2e in 2020, 27\u201335 in 2030, and 6\u201310 Gt CO2e in 2050 (Luderer et al., 2013b). An even smaller number of scenarios meet the 1.5 oC target with at least a 50 per cent chance and have least-cost emissions pathways beginning in 2020 \u2013 and therefore, have higher emissions up to 2020. 2 .3 .4 Implications of later action As noted above, recent trends in global emissions imply that the world is not following a least-cost pathway of early mitigation action for limiting global temperature increase to either 1.5 \u00b0C or 2 \u00b0C (Friedlingstein et al., 2014). An obvious advantage of delaying mitigation action is that costs are not incurred today. On the other hand, many recent studies20, including the IPCC AR5, have shown that delaying mitigation actions will intensify 18 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 2 What emission levels will comply with temperature limits? the challenges to limit global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C or 2 \u00b0C21.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76205aaa-77ac-4eff-bb45-72945f30fc44": {"__data__": {"id_": "76205aaa-77ac-4eff-bb45-72945f30fc44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "464ec243f1b50afa4feb6667dd2188eb837fc0ef89dd1dc40ec7463fe4a875a1"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a01f614-7099-4ad6-aa01-a42aa3ff9088", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3efab04db596fd83e6aa4d285a986a80df41876b95276a7b703b79aa2aff11fc"}}, "hash": "09a94f1b7fdcd2d36de0189064887c595cf3eca1a8f72af331d3ebc4a293d111", "text": "the challenges to limit global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C or 2 \u00b0C21. In general, IPCC AR5 found (with high confidence) that postponing further mitigation efforts to 2030 beyond current country pledges would substantially hinder the transition to lower long-term emissions levels and highlights that this postponement would narrow the range of options for staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit with a likely chance. The IPCC highlighted that many models were unable to produce scenarios that keep warming to below 2 \u00b0C with about 50 per cent chance, when starting from emissions in 2030 that are greater than 55 Gt CO2e.

For example, scenarios that delay stringent action until 2020 (least-cost 2020 scenarios) reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by around 4.6 per cent per year22 after 2020 as compared to scenarios with earlier action (least-cost 2010 scenarios) which fall by 3.1\u20133.3 per cent per year during the same period (Table 2.1). Furthermore, the IPCC showed that scenarios with stringent mitigation delayed until 2030 required twice as rapid a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions after 2030 as compared to those that had begun stringent reductions in 2010 \u2013 for the case of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit (IPCC, 2014). In addition, the AMPERE study found that scenarios with modest emission reductions until 2030 used up about 70 per cent of the carbon dioxide emissions budget consistent with the 2 \u00b0C limit by that date (Bertram et al., 2013; Riahi et al., 2013). Furthermore, it was noted that immediate and stringent emission reductions are essential in scenarios that stay below the 1.5 \u00b0C limit by 2100 (Luderer et al., 2013b; Rogelj et al., 2013a; IPCC, 2014). Delay in mitigation causes lock-in of carbon intensive infrastructure Scenarios with limited near term action have fewer options for reducing emissions if concerted action is delayed until after 2020 or 2030. This is because of carbon lock-in \u2013 the continued construction of high-emissions fossil-fuel infrastructure unconstrained by climate policies (Bertram et al., 2013; Luderer et al., 2013a; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Johnson et al., 2014). Unless comprehensive and ambitious climate policies are put into place, the world will continue to expand its carbon- and energy-intensive infrastructure, and will not sufficiently incentivize the development and scale- up of climate-friendly technologies. As an example, the capacity of coal-fired power plants grows by 50 per cent by 2030, relative to current levels, under some later action scenarios in the AMPERE study (Bertram et al., 2013). Other studies have shown that a large fraction of carbon-intensive infrastructure, particularly coal power plants, will need to be shut down prematurely if the 2 \u00b0C target is to be achieved (Johnson et al., 2014) \u2013 an example of stranded assets. Delaying stringent reductions until 2030 will result in such stranded assets in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars (Bertram et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2014). For example, a recent study (Johnson et al., 2014) estimates that, over the period 2011\u22122050, global investments associated with stranded coal-fired power plant capacity could more than triple (from US$ 165 to US$ 550 billion) if stringent mitigation is not achieved by 2030 (and the 2 \u00b0C target is met through later, drastic mitigation efforts). This happens because weak restrictions on emissions over the next few years are assumed to encourage/allow the expansion of conventional coal-fired power plants. As a result, a larger number of coal-fired power plants might be faced with stringent emission restrictions later and be forced to close before the end of their usual life. ____________________ 21 These paragraphs update the discussion of this topic in UNEP (2013) . 22 Emission reduction rates are typically computed as compound annual growth rates. However, such an approach cannot deal with emissions becoming negative at some point during the assessed time period. 19 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Chapter 2 What emission levels will comply with temperature limits? The same lock-in effect applies to lost opportunities for energy efficiency (Chapter 4). The Global Energy Assessment (GEA23; Riahi et al., 2012) shows the critical importance of energy efficiency measures for limiting warming to below 2 \u00b0C, and similar findings are valid for returning warming to below 1.5 \u00b0C (Luderer et al., 2013b; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Rogelj et al., 2013b). Later- action scenarios tend to further lock-in power plants, buildings and other infrastructure with low levels of energy efficiency. This makes the transition to a high-energy-efficiency future more difficult, and puts a greater burden on alternative emission reduction measures. Delay in mitigation can slow the transformation of the energy system Recent research has shown that the share of zero- and low-carbon energy sources24 in the world\u2019s energy economy has to substantially increase in order to stay within atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases consistent with the 2 \u00b0C limit.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc90f21f-04d3-4309-9c54-50223a946a1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc90f21f-04d3-4309-9c54-50223a946a1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea735687f888f24897d7eed046d4f66b3d32b5a3d8415949f8270c6697c54cb6"}, "2": {"node_id": "3540e76f-9c95-4d80-b3fa-55ff2b75ffe9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7c4e922c4767237c3b829c963fb6709700bec66d0b38917d5e8040bd644a7f8"}}, "hash": "885b26adc90b6698967f896f798319744974b90a428ce3aba56cc11bfc9b870e", "text": "One estimate is that a 3\u20134-fold increase is needed between 2010 and 2050 (Riahi et al., 2013; IPCC, 2014).

On the other hand, scenarios delaying action until later need to achieve this objective at a much faster pace. For example, scenarios with delays up to 2030, need to scale up the low-carbon share of the energy economy at twice the pace of least- cost scenarios beginning in 2010 (Riahi et al., 2013; IPCC, 2014). Moreover, the lack of near term climate policies is also assumed to hinder the scaling up of low-emission, green-energy technologies (Eom et al., 2013), and hinder technological learning and development as well. Early policy signals are needed to plan for later action Even if near term mitigation actions are delayed, it is important to begin sending strong and reliable policy signals to industry, municipalities and other sectors of society that stringent emissions reductions will be necessary over the medium term \u2013 for example, laws or regulations that call for specific emission reductions or ceilings at some future date. Without clear signals, industry will lock-in carbon- and energy-intensive infrastructure as explained above. Delay in mitigation leads to higher overall costs and economic challenges Scenarios with later action have lower mitigation costs in the near term and this implies a lower burden on current economic growth but larger overall mitigation costs. These scenarios also have larger economic challenges during the transition towards a comprehensive climate policy regime, including substantial impacts on global economic growth and energy prices (Clarke et al., 2009; Jakob et al., 2012; OECD, 2012; Kriegler et al., 2014a; Luderer et al., 2013a; Luderer et al., 2013b; Riahi et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Rogelj et al., 2013b; Clarke et al., 2014). The longer the delay, the higher costs become. The IPCC indicates that delaying stringent reductions to 2030 would increase mitigation costs during the period 2030\u20132050 by around 40 per cent compared to scenarios without delays (Clarke et al., 2014). The cost penalty of later action depends on: 1: when comprehensive mitigation actions finally begin; 2: the magnitude of emission reductions up to that point; and 3: the future availability of technologies. Furthermore, delaying emission reductions in the near term shifts the burden of mitigation costs ____________________ 23 The full report is available at: http://www.globalenergyassessment.org/ 24 Renewables, nuclear energy, fossil fuel energy with carbon capture and storage, or biofuels with carbon capture and storage. 20 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 2 What emission levels will comply with temperature limits? to later generations (OECD, 2012; Luderer et al., 2013b; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Clarke et al., 2014). Finally, later-action scenarios also have higher economic costs, exclusive of mitigation costs, during the transition from modest early action to later more comprehensive action (Kriegler et al., 2014a; Luderer et al., 2013a; Luderer et al., 2013b). These transitional costs increase strongly with further delay. Delay in mitigation reduces societal choices The more emission reductions are delayed, the greater society\u2019s dependence on future unproven technologies25, reducing its options and choices for the future (Luderer et al., 2013b; Riahi et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013a). Many later-action scenarios assume that the full portfolio of mitigation options represented in the models is available, including unproven negative emissions technologies such as BECCS (Box 2.3). However, costs will increase if it turns out that anticipated technologies are not available, because of technology failure or because society chooses not to deploy them (Kriegler et al., 2014b; Luderer et al., 2013b; Rogelj et al., 2013b; Clarke et al., 2014). Delay in mitigation leads to higher climate risks Scenarios with later action increase the risks of climate impacts in the following ways: First, the risk of temporarily exceeding climate limits is higher because of higher initial emission levels (Clarke et al., 2009; den Elzen et al., 2010; van Vliet et al., 2012; Kriegler et al., 2013; Luderer et al., 2013a; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Schaeffer et al., 2013). Overshooting temperature limits, or prolonging the overshoot period, implies a greater risk of large-scale and possibly irreversible changes in the climate system \u2013 see Lenton et al. (2008) for examples of such changes.

Second, the pace of temperature increase in the near to medium term is higher (den Elzen et al., 2010; van Vliet et al., 2012; Schaeffer et al., 2013) and this can imply more rapid climate impacts and require quicker adaptation. For example, based on results from 11 integrated assessment models, Schaeffer et al.

Third, postponing stringent mitigation increases the risk of exhausting carbon dioxide emission budgets. The risk comes from the fact that the steep reductions required to compensate for higher near-term emissions may not materialise. This may happen because of unanticipated technology failures (Riahi et al., 2013; Clarke et al., 2014) or the unwillingness of future policymakers to take on the required high costs of mitigation. Fourth, when action is delayed, various options to achieve stringent levels of climate protection are increasingly lost (Luderer et al., 2013b; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Rogelj et al., 2013b). One sign of this is that a declining number of models are able to identify feasible emission pathways that stay within a 1.5 \u00b0C or 2 \u00b0C limit with increasing delays (IPCC, 2014). Delay in mitigation forgoes co-benefits The IPCC AR5 WGIII report (IPCC, 2014) identified a large number of co-benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation, such as reduced costs for achieving air quality and energy security objectives, improved human health, reduced crop yield losses, and lower adverse impacts on ecosystems. Delaying mitigation action also implies that these co-benefits will be forgone while emissions remain high. ____________________ 25 As an example of technological dependency, it was found that only two out of nine models in the AMPERE study could reach a long-term 450 parts per million (ppm) carbon dioxide concentration target (and therefore could comply with the 2 \u00b0C target) without scaling up carbon capture and storage (Riahi et al., 2013). A similar dependency is found for other mitigation technologies (ibid, Rogelj et al., 2013b). 21 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Chapter 3 Emissions pledges and the emissions gap ____________________ 1 At the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Doha, in 2012, a group of developed countries (Australia, Belarus, the EU and its Member States, Kazakhstan, Monaco, Norway, Switzerland and Ukraine) also made reduction commitments for the 2013\u20132020 period under the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC, 2012b). 2 China and India have expressed their mitigation goals in terms of emission reductions per unit of GDP; Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and South Korea, in terms of deviations below their respective business-as-usual emission scenarios; Antigua and Barbuda, Marshall Islands and the Republic of Moldova, in terms of absolute greenhouse gas emission reductions; and Costa Rica and the Maldives, in terms of a carbon neutrality goal (UNFCCC, 2013). Most of the non-economy- wide NAMAs have not been quantified, and it is difficult to estimate their impact with much certainty. In order to approximate their impact, the following steps were taken. First, non-Annex I countries that have developed or are developing non-economy-wide NAMAs were identified on the basis of the UNEP and Ecofys NAMA databases. Second, these countries\u2019 baseline 2020 emissions were estimated on the basis of an assumed 27 per cent growth from 2010, for a total of 2 553 Mt CO2e (including LULUCF). Third, an average percentage reduction on economy-wide emissions was calculated at \u201319 per cent, based on the NAMAs of Chile, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Kenya, and Mongolia, the only countries to have quantified all their NAMAs. Finally, this reduction was applied to the economy-wide emissions of the countries with non-economy-wide NAMAs. If all NAMAs were completely additional to baseline emissions, this would generate a total impact of -482 Mt CO2e. However, as there is no basis to assume a high level of additionality, this impact is not included in the cases described in this chapter. National greenhouse gas reduction pledges provide an important indication of the collective global ambition to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Under the UNFCCC, 42 developed country parties (Annex I) have submitted quantified economy-wide emission reduction pledges for 20201. Likewise, more than 55 developing country parties (non- Annex I) have submitted nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs), of which 16 are framed in terms of expected economy-wide greenhouse gas emission reductions2. Together, the developed country parties plus the 16 developing countries with pledges account for about 75 per cent of global emissions as of 2010 (UNEP, 2013).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6fcaf87-eadb-4a8d-ae02-c4e4cce5d111": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6fcaf87-eadb-4a8d-ae02-c4e4cce5d111", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88553423becd4a88c21ca5290a7993c12c93121807ef65e3365231ce062e53ee"}, "2": {"node_id": "53f60f83-2c13-4ee6-99a5-a4757a5a76eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1817054bf359115c7f48f02111b69e419b9a32e2bbed8cfd74b1607e616ad25"}}, "hash": "920daaa98340f197c5e15ffba7cb8ed9ca6e8fb02d99b42c30b923d985a4010d", "text": "Since 2010, UNEP\u2019s \u2018emissions gap\u2019 reports have examined whether these pledges and commitments are enough to stay within the 2 \u00b0C target, or whether a gap exists between temperature limits and the level of ambition.

Finally, the chapter evaluates the progress of major economies in achieving their 2020 pledges. 3 .1 How big will the emissions gap be in 2020 and 2030? 3 .1 .1 The role of emission reduction pledges Since the 2013 update of UNEP\u2019s Emissions Gap Report, three Parties have revised or clarified their pledges. First, Japan has revised its pledge due to the Fukushima disaster and the consequent uncertainty regarding the future role of nuclear power. Japan\u2019s tentative new 2020 target is to reduce emissions 3.8 per cent from 2005 levels (UNFCCC, 2014a). This equates to an increase of about 3.1 per cent from 1990 levels, as compared to the previous conditional target of reducing emissions by 25 per cent from 1990 levels. In addition, the Russian Federation has indicated it will limit its emissions to 75 per cent of 1990 levels; its initial pledge had promised a 15\u201325 per cent chApter 3: Emissions pledges and the emissions gap Lead authors: Michel den Elzen (PBL Netherlands) and Taryn Fransen (World Resources Institute) Contributing authors: Jusen Asuka (Tohoku University), Thomas Damassa (World Resources Institute), Hanna Fekete (NewClimate Institute), J\u00f8rgen Fenhann (UNEP DTU Partnership), Andries Hof (PBL Netherlands), Kejun Jiang (Energy Research Institute), Kelly Levin (World Resources Institute), Ritu Mathur (The Energy and Resources Institute), Mark Roelfsema (PBL Netherlands), Roberto Schaeffer (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). 22 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 3 Emissions pledges and the emissions gap reduction from 1990 levels (Biennial Report, UNFCCC, 2014a). Finally, the USA has clarified that its pledge to reduce emissions 17 per cent from 2005 levels is unconditional (UNFCCC, 2014b). Box 3 .1: Factors affecting the greenhouse gas impact of the pledges The collective impact of the pledges on global greenhouse gas emissions will depend on: 1: accounting rules for credits or debits from land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), surplus emission units, and double counting and additionality of offsets; and 2: whether parties adopt the more ambitious (conditional) or less ambitious (unconditional) variant of their pledges. Accounting rules Accounting rules govern a number of issues that affect global emissions. These rules dictate whether and how LULUCF and surplus emission credits can be applied towards pledges, the extent to which offsets applied towards pledges actually represent additional greenhouse gas reductions, and whether offsets can be double- counted towards pledges by both buyers and sellers. Relative to a strict application of accounting rules, a lenient application of these rules increases global emissions by 0.7 Gt CO2e under unconditional pledges and by 1.6 Gt CO2e under conditional pledges. This effect is slightly smaller than was estimated in 2013 (0.9 Gt CO2e and 1.9 Gt CO2e, respectively); we assume less non-additionality of offsets this year relative to last year due to improved governance of offset programmes. LULUCF: under the Kyoto Protocol, whether Annex I parties may receive credits or debits from LULUCF activities depends on a set of complex accounting rules that contribute to the achievement of their pledges. However, except for the case of New Zealand, it is unclear if countries not part of the Protocol\u2019s second commitment period will adhere to its LULUCF rules (UNFCCC, 2012a). If all Annex I countries followed the rules, the credits from afforestation/reforestation, deforestation and forest management activities would be 0.35 Gt CO2e per year, based on the Parties\u2019 latest submissions3 (Grassi et al., 2012; Grassi, 2013). In other words, lenient LULUCF rules would push global emissions 0.35 Gt CO2e higher in 2020 relative to strict LULUCF rules4. Use of surplus emissions units: accounting rules also govern the use of surplus emission units from the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s first commitment periods to meet 2020 pledges. These units include assigned amount units, emission reduction units (ERUs) from Joint Implementation, and certified emission reductions (CERs) from the Clean Development Mechanism. Relative to strict accounting rules, which would prohibit the use of such surplus units to meet 2020 pledges, lenient rules on surplus units would increase global 2020 emissions by 0.25 Gt CO2e in the case of unconditional pledges and by 0.75 Gt CO2e for conditional pledges.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b44ab4e8-22d7-4f6a-b7c9-084acc29ab4c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b44ab4e8-22d7-4f6a-b7c9-084acc29ab4c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7db4071ef304a726dcb170d57c9ee6d1a0b5163412fa55d04fb34555c68b1a1"}, "2": {"node_id": "99dd7e5d-6f7b-4b1e-8daa-652acc589f29", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcce2a1c1fd4588b11240cbea6b3f783e61c56d75842e02db8ed80736943fa07"}}, "hash": "53468f7c647af95846ce68b5d1a016f4617647dd7a898e15a7feef49719ff0fa", "text": "These figures are the same as in the 2013 update of UNEP\u2019s Emissions Gap Report.

This effect is slightly lower than estimated in the 2013 update (UNEP, 2013), because: 1: Japan\u2019s lower target leads to a lower demand for offsets; and 2: measures to ensure the additionality of offsets have led to a reduced estimate of the impact of non- additionality in the lenient rules case. Specifically, improvements concerning the additionality of offsets include a more rigorous regulatory review, increased standardization for assessing baseline emissions and better oversight of third-party auditors. It is generally accepted that such improvements have addressed earlier concerns that offset credits did not represent actual or additional reductions7. Furthermore, any estimates of over-crediting must be weighed against countervailing factors that result in under-crediting, such as the use of conservative default factors and time- limited crediting periods. The impact of this risk is likely to be negligible overall compared to 0.15 Gt CO2e in UNEP 2013 Emission Gap Report. Conditionality of emission reduction pledges Some countries have made all or part of their pledge conditional on factors such as national legislation, action from other countries or the provision of finance or technical support from other countries. Other countries did not attach conditions to their pledges. As in previous updates of UNEP\u2019s Emissions Gap Report, these types of pledges are described here as conditional and unconditional pledges, respectively. Where countries have made only a conditional pledge, their pledge in the unconditional case is assumed in this analysis to be a zero reduction relative to the business-as-usual case. 3 .1 .2 Scenarios of global emissions in 2020 Assumptions of pledge cases We present five projections of 2020 global emission levels, based on varying assumptions about accounting rules and pledge conditionality. The cases are as follows: \u2022\ufffd Unconditional\ufffdpledges,\ufffdlenient\ufffdrules: all parties implement their unconditional pledges. (Business-as-usual is assumed for those parties that have only conditional pledges.) The use of LULUCF credits, offset double counting and surplus emission units is allowed. \u2022\ufffd Unconditional\ufffdpledges,\ufffdstrict\ufffdrules: all parties implement their unconditional pledges. (Business-as-usual is assumed for those parties that have only conditional pledges.) The use of LULUCF credits, offset double counting, and surplus emission units is not allowed. \u2022\ufffd Conditional\ufffdpledges,\ufffdlenient\ufffdrules:\ufffdall parties implement their conditional pledges. The use of LULUCF credits, offset double counting, and surplus emission units is allowed. \u2022\ufffd Conditional\ufffd pledges,\ufffd strict\ufffd rules: all parties implement their conditional pledges. The use of LULUCF credits, offset double counting, and surplus emission units is not allowed. ____________________ 5 Consistent with the analysis in the 2013 update of the report, for the pledge cases it is assumed that international emission offsets could account for 33 per cent of the difference between business-as-usual and pledged emission levels by 2020 for all Annex I countries, except for Canada and the USA, where no offset use is assumed. This is an arbitrary, conservative estimate, as many parties have yet to specify any limits to the use of transferable units. 6 This estimate is based on the offset mechanisms currently in most widespread use. If bilateral approaches to offsets proliferate, without adequately addressing double counting, the impact of double counting could become more pronounced. 7 For example, a recent report by the Australian Climate Change Authority (2014) found that the \u201cCDM has detailed rules and governance arrangements to ensure credited emissions reductions are genuine. Its operation has improved over time, and its Executive Board has made a concerted effort to identify and address environmental concerns\u201d. 24 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 3 Emissions pledges and the emissions gap \u2022\ufffd Current\ufffd pledges,\ufffd current\ufffd rules: all parties implement the pledges they are currently pursuing8.

More information on the current trajectory case as it applies to the G20 countries is given in Section 3.2. Scenario results Figure 3.1 shows global emissions in 2020 for the pledge cases, the current trajectory case, business-as-usual and historical emissions. For the unconditional pledges, lenient rules case, the estimate for 2020 emissions is 54 Gt CO2e (range 53\u201355 Gt CO2e) and for the conditional pledges, strict rules case, 52 Gt CO2e (range 50\u201353 Gt CO2e). Under current pledges, current rules, the resulting projected emission level is 53 Gt CO2e (range 51\u201354 Gt CO2e). For reference, the business-as-usual level in 2020 is 59 Gt CO2e (range 56\u201360 Gt CO2e). The current trajectory case has global emissions of 55 Gt CO2e (rounded from 54.5 Gt CO2e) in 2020, which is above the upper end of the range of pledge cases of 54 Gt CO2e (median and rounded estimate). Compared to UNEP\u2019s Emissions Gap Report 2013, 2020 emissions under the conditional cases have not changed significantly. The conditional pledge, strict rules case has increased by about 0.2 Gt CO2e due to Japan\u2019s new tentative, less ambitious pledge. Under the conditional pledge, lenient rules case, these higher emissions are partly compensated by a lower impact of double counting relative to last year. The estimate of the unconditional pledge, strict rule case is 1 Gt CO2e lower than in 2013 due to the clarification that the USA pledge is unconditional. The unconditional pledge, lenient rules case is 1.2 Gt CO2e lower, due to both the revision of the USA pledge and the lower impact of accounting rules. The impact of Japan\u2019s new pledge is limited for the unconditional pledge cases, as it is close to Japan\u2019s business-as- usual estimate that was used for the unconditional case in 2013. ____________________ 8 Each country is categorized as implementing its conditional or unconditional pledge according to official documents and public statements.

Extrapolating from the high end (54 Gt CO2e) gives 57 Gt CO2e and 59 Gt CO2e, respectively, for 2025 and 2030. 3 .1 .4 The emissions gap The 2020 gap Over the past four years, UNEP\u2019s \u2018emissions gap\u2019 reports have tracked the difference between emission levels in 2020 consistent with staying within 2 \u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b0C limits, and those levels expected in 2020 under the pledges. Here, we update this 2020 gap. Technically speaking, the gap estimate is becoming highly uncertain because it is based on least-cost scenarios that assume concerted action as of 2010; these scenarios have become decreasingly useful because emissions in recent years have been consistently higher than in these scenarios. Recently, greater emphasis in the scientific literature has been given to delayed emission pathways consistent with the 2 \u00b0C limit which follow a least cost emissions pathway beginning in 2020 rather than 2010 (Least-cost 2020 scenarios in Chapter 2). However, for continuity with previous reports we present an update here of the 2020 gap using the same methodology as in previous years. It was noted in Section 2.3.3 that the level of global emissions in 2020 consistent with the 2 \u00b0C limit is 44 Gt CO2e, as in previous reports11. As to expected levels of emissions, we saw in Section 3.1.2 that the range of median emissions under the four pledge cases was 52\u201354 Gt CO2e for 2020. Hence the emissions gap in 2020 is 8\u201310 Gt CO2e (that is, 52 minus 44 and 54 minus 44). This is about the same magnitude as estimated in the 2013 Emissions Gap Report (8\u201312 Gt CO2e). It is very important to note that every year between 2014 and 2020 presents another opportunity to act to reduce emissions and narrow this gap \u2013 with important implications for the effort required by 2025 and 2030, as discussed below. Furthermore, the lower the emissions over this period, the smaller the risks caused by delaying emission reductions, as articulated in Chapter 2. The 2025 and 2030 gaps An important issue in the run-up to a new climate agreement in Paris is the question of what level of emission reductions will be needed after 2020 to comply with the 2 \u00b0C limit. To address this question, we now estimate the emissions gap in the post- 2020 period, specifically in 2025 and 2030. The gap is defined in the same way as for 2020. In Section 2.3.3 we saw that the levels of global emissions consistent with a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit are 47 Gt CO2e in 2025, and 42 Gt CO2e in 2030. In contrast to the estimate of the 2020 gap, these estimates were based on least- cost emission pathways beginning in 2020 rather than 2010. With regards to expected emissions in 2030, in Section 3.1.2 we saw that the range of median emissions under the pledge cases were 54\u201357 Gt CO2e for 2025.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5e87598-a9ef-44a1-ad56-17b914000e56": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5e87598-a9ef-44a1-ad56-17b914000e56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b5edb9bd9727d48a5663bea8c6a47ac26377ba2a0c468520b4f0a4b365a87c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca0f2214-8684-4e1e-8bc6-bb69935be927", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "815c9413a7470534b294d1c849bf2d326392e79460fba8fa137fce09284c5261"}}, "hash": "774ea5d1138a01a47b74ef1f24ce02e4979ac8c97de356a4e824e626e2564cdc", "text": "For 2030 the range was 56\u201359 Gt CO2e.

This section examines this case in more detail, comparing the current emissions trajectories in the G20 countries12, considering the EU as a single party, with the trajectories associated with the achievement of these countries\u2019 2020 pledges13. This section should be read with three important caveats in mind. First, not all pledges demand the same level of effort to implement \u2013 it is not necessarily the case that a country currently on track to achieve its pledge is doing more than a country not yet on track14. Second, these projections are subject to the uncertainty associated with macroeconomic trends, such as ____________________ 12 The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK, the USA, and the EU. 13 In 2011, these parties account for 74 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions including LULUCF, or 77 per cent excluding LULUCF (CAIT, 2014). 14 See Appendix 2.D of the 2013 update of UNEP\u2019s Emissions Gap Report for further discussion of this issue. 2010 2020 2025 2030 0 40 35 30 45 50 55 60 65 70 Median gap: 7\u201310 year year Annual global total greenhouse gas emissions (Gt CO2e) 2025 2030 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 * Copenhagen Pledges in these scenarios were assumed to result in a range of 52 (50\u201353) Gt CO2e total greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.

These cases are described in Box 3.2. ____________________ 15 For China, GDP is assumed to reach 61.6 trillion yuan in 2020, consistent with China\u2019s National Communication. For India, GDP is assumed to reach 120.41 trillion rupees (\u201906\u2013\u201807 rupee value) in 2020, consistent with the average of the scenarios presented in Planning Commission (2014). 16 The Australian official estimate is taken from DoE (2013), which, in contrast to the Biennial Report, presents a scenario without a carbon pricing mechanism, which reflects the current policy situation. The Mexican official estimate is based on Government of Mexico (2012), adjusted based on updated figures from the National Climate Change Strategy (2013). Box 3 .2: Assumptions of analysis of progress towards pledges For each UNFCCC party, Table 3.1 compares 2020 emissions under three cases: 1: Pledge case (official data): this case identifies the maximum amount of greenhouse gas emissions that each country or party could emit in 2020 and still meet its pledge \u2013 not considering the use of offsets.

These parties all have adopted new policies since putting forward their pledges in 2009. However, some observers have called into question the ambition of some of these pledges relative to historic trends: Russia\u2019s 2013 pledge to limit 2020 emissions to 75 per cent of 1990 levels is roughly in line with existing trends and scenarios (Kokorin and Korppoo 2014). Similarly, India\u2019s pledge is higher than some estimates of business-as-usual trends (Pew Center on Global Climate Change, 2011; Climate Action Tracker, 2013). Brazil\u2019s pledge assumed a baseline in which LULUCF emissions would grow at the rates they did for 1995\u20132005, when in reality these emissions had already dropped significantly by the time the pledge was put forward in 2009 (SEEG, 2014). China\u2019s and India\u2019s pledges are framed in terms of greenhouse gas intensity reductions from 2005 levels, and several sources indicate that both countries are currently on track to achieve them. For China, the IEA Current Policies Scenario shows a 43 per cent reduction, and the Climate Action Tracker shows a 42 per cent reduction, compared to a pledged reduction of 40\u201345 per cent.

Japan announced an adjustment to its pledge in November 2013 from a 25 per cent reduction from 1990 levels to a 3.8 per cent reduction from 2005 levels. While this adjustment makes it much easier for Japan to achieve its pledge, current official projections still place Japan\u2019s 2020 emissions slightly above its pledge threshold (UNFCCC, 2014a).

Four parties \u2013 Australia, Canada, Mexico, and the USA \u2013 are likely to require further action and/or purchased offsets in order to meet their pledges, according to government and independent estimates. Australia had been on track to meet its pledge in part through its carbon pricing mechanism, but this mechanism was abolished on 1 July 2014. Recent policy developments in Mexico (the Special Program on Climate Change (PECC) for 2013\u20132018) and the USA (draft emission standards for existing power plants) bring each country nearer to meeting its pledge, but further action will be necessary in both cases (see, for example, Climate Action Tracker, 2013; RHG, 2014; World Resources Institute, 2014.) The USA has published an analysis suggesting that it will meet its pledge if it successfully implements the President\u2019s Climate Action Plan (Executive Office of the President, 2013). The Republic of Korea may also require further action to meet its pledge, but this could not be verified based on publicly available official projections. Korea did release a road map in early 2014 outlining a pathway to achieving its 2020 pledge (Climate Connect, 2014; Korea Green Foundation, 2014). In the case of Indonesia and South Africa, insufficient information is currently available to determine whether they are on track. Official projections to 2020 do not reflect recently adopted and implemented policies, and independent estimates vary widely, from well below the pledge level to well above it. Finally, Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have not proposed greenhouse gas reduction pledges. 3 .3 Summing up This chapter finds that global 2020 emissions range from 52 Gt CO2e, if all countries were to achieve their conditional pledges and apply strict accounting rules, to 54 Gt CO2e, if all countries were to achieve only their unconditional pledges and apply lenient accounting rules. If each country were to achieve the pledge it is currently pursuing \u2013 conditional for 32 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 3 Emissions pledges and the emissions gap some countries and unconditional for others \u2013 and apply the current set of accounting rules, which are lenient, 2020 emissions would reach 53 Gt CO2e. This is 8 per cent above 2010 emissions and 10 per cent below business-as-usual in 2020. Relative to the previous update of the Emissions Gap Report (UNEP, 2013), this year\u2019s unconditional pledge cases result in slightly lower 2020 emissions, due primarily to the fact that the USA has recently clarified that its pledge should be considered unconditional. Revisions in accounting assumptions also play a minor role (the remaining 2020 cases, and 2030 emissions, were not considered in the 2013 update of the Emissions Gap Report). Several studies now indicate that Brazil, China, the EU, India, and the Russian Federation are on track to achieve their pledges. Conversely, Australia is no longer on track, due to the abolition of its carbon pricing mechanism. Japan is closer to achieving its pledge than estimated last year, but this is due primarily to the fact that its tentative new pledge is less ambitious. Japan\u2019s 2020 emissions will also depend on the future of its nuclear energy production. Recent policy developments in Mexico and the USA bring them closer to achieving their pledges, but further efforts will be necessary. Likewise, further efforts are still needed in Canada. Available data for Indonesia and South Africa are inconclusive and Argentina, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey have not made pledges. Finally, extrapolating trends from the pledge cases in 2020 out to 2030 leads to an emissions gap of 14\u201317 Gt CO2e in 2030, which is about a third of current global emissions. These estimates assume emission pathways with delayed action until 2020 and follow cost-optimal paths afterwards (Section 2.3.3). 33 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Chapter 4 Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits 4 .1 Climate mitigation in a development context 4 .1 .1 Sustainable development and addressing climate change Sustainable development continues to be an over- riding priority for developing countries, where poverty is a major issue and 1.3 billion people still do not have access to basic energy services. While sustainable development is the aim, the reality is that another model is steering world development, bringing the unintended impacts of climate change, resource scarcity, air pollution, water pollution and other large-scale types of environmental degradation.

This model has been articulated by a range of international organi- sations, such as UNEP in its report Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication (UNEP, 2011), the African Development Bank in its African Development Report 2012: Towards Green Growth in Africa (AfDB, 2012), the World Bank in Inclusive Green Growth: the Pathway to Sustainable Development (World Bank, 2012), and OECD in its Green Growth Strategy (OECD, 2011). They all make a strong case for integrating climate change mitigation in a policy framework that can deliver economic growth, development and stringent climate action. Most recently Better Growth, Better Climate: The New Climate Economy Report from the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate (NCE, 2014) made the case for a new economic model in relation to the urgent need to deal with climate change. Key messages from the report are: 1: countries at all levels of income can have lasting economic growth, while effectively dealing with the risks of climate change; 2: the next 15 years of investment in the world\u2019s urban, energy and land use systems will determine the future climate; if climate change is not tackled, economic growth itself will be at risk; 3: future economic growth does not have to replicate the high-carbon, unevenly distributed model of the past: there are now enough efficient and low-carbon solutions available; 4: stimulating innovation and making it attractive to invest in low-carbon infrastructure can drive a greater resource efficiency that will lead to economic growth, many social and environmental benefits, and lower emissions; and 5: additional investments needed for this chApter 4: Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits Lead authors: Kornelis Blok (Ecofys), Tim Farrell (Copenhagen Centre on Energy Efficiency), Niklas H\u00f6hne (NewClimate Institute), Ritu Mathur (The Energy and Resources Institute), Daniel Puig (UNEP DTU Partnership), Lisa Ryan (University College Dublin) Contributing authors: Andreas Ernst (University of Kassel), Lewis Fulton (University of California at Davis), Kelly Levin (World Resources Institute), Neha Pahuja (The Energy and Resources Institute), Lynn Price (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), Julia Reinaud (European Climate Foundation), Hans-Paul Siderius (Netherlands Enterprise Energy), Diana \u00dcrge-Vorsatz (Central European University) 34 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 4 Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits transformation will be modest compared to the basic investments needed to raise the level of well-being worldwide. 4 .1 .2 Sustainable development goals can deliver strong climate benefits The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)1 aim to build on economic, social and environmental links in achieving sustainable development. The proposed SDGs, to be realized by 2030, provide a concrete opportunity to achieve climate co- benefits while mitigating climate risks. One of the proposed goals is to ensure access to affordable sustainable, and reliable modern energy services for all, building on the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative (UN, 2012). The 2030 goals of the SE4ALL initiative are to: 1: ensure universal access to sustainable modern energy services for all; 2: double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix; and 3: double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. Studies on the SE4ALL initiative (Rogelj et al., 2013; IRENA, 2014) suggest that achieving these objectives could provide a major contribution to putting the world on an emissions pathway that stays within the 2 \u00b0C limit, assuming other actions are taken such as stopping deforestation and expanding sustainable agriculture. Other SDGs can also contribute to addressing climate change, not only by reducing emissions, but also by improving resilience against climate change impacts. 4 .1 .3 Climate change mitigation has multiple benefits While the previous section argues that sustainable development can lead to climate mitigation, the reverse is also true \u2013 actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions yield many important benefits to development. Comprehensive overviews of the benefits of many climate policies are included in the IPCC\u2019s AR5 (Clarke et al., 2014) and in a UNFCCC technical paper (UNFCCC, 2014). Table 4.1 lists these mitigation actions and Appendix 4-A presents a short overview of their economic, social, environmental and other benefits. These options include: introducing more renewable energy in the energy supply system, improving energy efficiency across all sectors and expanding sustainable agriculture and forestry.

These scenarios highlight that there are several technological options that could help meet the twin objectives of reducing emissions and enhancing energy access, and through these, support sustainable development. For example, energy efficiency often brings economic gains in addition to reducing energy use and emissions (Section 4.2.2). Moreover, decentralized power generation through renewables could lead to additional benefits in the form of improved livelihoods, and better health of women and children, in addition to helping achieve a low carbon development path. Some of the important areas where clear synergies exist are improving energy efficiency, increasing the deployment of renewable energy technologies and increasing the efficiency of transport systems (TERI, 2009). ____________________ 1 For details on each sustainable development goal see: http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/focussdgs.html 35 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Chapter 4 Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits climate change often have close synergies with policies that countries pursue to fulfil their own priorities; this includes domestic goals such as energy security, reduction in local air pollution, reduced congestion on roads, and improved access to electricity and modern fuels (Box 4.1). An important point is that the emission reduction potentials of the various options in Table 4.1 add up to a substantial global potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (about 28.5 Gt CO2e relative to a baseline in 2030). This is equivalent to nearly 60 per cent of the global greenhouse gas emissions released in 2010. 4 .1 .4 Barriers Even though the arguments for a transformation to a low carbon, climate resilient and resource efficient economy are compelling, there will be trade-offs to be made and barriers to be overcome.

Therefore we used the IPCC RCP scenarios to derive the order of magnitude of the potential. We used the difference between a reference scenario (RCP 8.5) and a 2 \u00b0C compatible scenario (RCP 2.6) as a measure of potential. The analysis in the IPCC AR5 on the full IPCC scenario dataset does not include the sectoral split that was chosen in this report. *** Estimates of mitigation potential from forestry are very diverse. For a simple estimate of potential we assumed that total current net emissions from forests (as in RCP 2.6) can be reduced to zero by 2030. The resulting emissions reduction potential estimate is in line with the range from the full IPCC scenario analysis of about 1 to 8 Gt CO2 (Figure 6.35). a Summary rating based on IPCC AR5, WGIII Table 6.7. b Coverage adapted from Braun et al., 2014.

The scale of these up-front investments can be a real obstacle, as in the case of smaller manufacturing units that do not have the capital or the borrowing power to undertake such investments. In some cases the lack of appropriate and affordable technologies becomes an additional barrier. In another case, a study by the Energy and Resources Institute of India and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF/TERI, 2013) examined the technical feasibility of a 100 per cent renewable energy scenario for India. The study found that although the country had the technical potential to run on renewable energy sources, significant technological gaps made it difficult to realize. Also, barriers to innovation must be overcome. The diffusion of innovative technologies is hampered by current pricing systems, risk aversion of potential users, regulations that favour existing products and lack of supporting networks \u2013 for example, infrastructure for electric vehicles (NCE, 2014). In most cases a transition will also create losers in that some economic sectors, companies and segments of the population may see their business or incomes being affected. Hence, it is important to carefully consider the impact of new policies on these groups and to give them time to adjust. 4 .1 .5 Policies and international collaboration that support sustainable development and reduce greenhouse gas emissions To overcome the above barriers, new government policies are needed to create the right incentives. One approach is to incorporate the costs of climate change into the price of fuels through carbon taxes or emissions trading systems. A complimentary approach is to reduce or abolish subsidies on fossil fuels and thereby avoid annual government expenditure of more than US$ 600 billion (IEA 2013a; OECD 2013). At the same time, it is important to provide financial assistance to poor households that may not be able to afford more efficient fuels and technologies. The good news is that countries are already widely applying policies that are overcoming barriers, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development. This is confirmed in Table 4.1 which shows that about half the countries in the world have national policies for promoting more efficient heating and/or cooling in buildings, and that about half are working on raising the efficiency of appliances and lighting. About 30 per cent of countries have programmes for sustainable waste management and sustainable forestry. Moreover, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Maldives, Norway and Sweden have carbon neutrality targets. By 2050 Denmark aims to be independent from fossil fuels and to have 100 per cent of its energy demand covered by renewable energy. Already 144 countries have set renewable energy targets (REN21, 2014). Some aim to cover 100 per cent of their electricity supply by renewable energy, such as the Cook Islands, Fiji, Niue, Tokelau, Tuvalu and Scotland. Germany\u2019s Renewable Energy Sources Act provides for \u201cconstantly and cost effectively\u201d increasing the share of renewable energy sources in electricity supply, to reach 80 per cent by 2050. Experience shows that countries have made rapid progress when they integrate climate policy into their core development strategy, lay out a long- term strategic vision, and build wide-ranging political support for a new approach. More details on policies are provided in section 4.2.3. Not only are countries active, but also regions, cities and companies have joined together to launch international cooperative initiatives (ICIs) to pursue sustainable development, environmental protection and climate change mitigation 37 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Chapter 4 Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits objectives. These initiatives, which in some cases include national governments, have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in support of, and potentially beyond, national emission reduction pledges (UNEP, 2013). Interest is increasing in these efforts, as was noted at the UN Secretary General\u2019s Climate Change Summit in New York, in September 20142 and in the UNFCCC negotiations3. Over the last year, some estimates have become available on the possible impact of the targets of a few ICIs (Appendix 4-B). The collective impact of these initiatives could add up to a substantial global emissions reduction. But further research has to determine whether these reductions are additional to current government action. 4 .1 .6 Investment Requirements Scaling up the many efforts described above in order to reach emission targets will take consider- able investment \u2013 one estimate is US$ 44 trillion over 40 years to limit", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d693f32a-5d98-4ec8-abee-94ee75f5e36a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d693f32a-5d98-4ec8-abee-94ee75f5e36a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4e4a19ca191994ba1ec164a94f838538f61faddc6345f61cf243a940c688748"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba945432-2a80-4714-b561-1d225a4e0c1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae8e352e86e93a34a200aafe010d005604b724d02bade4e18037d28652b6f741"}}, "hash": "82e29a9e8c04dfcf9ec3d77dda579831dec6726a174ba00acd7b49d64c162422", "text": "global warming to 2 oC4 (IEA, 2014a). Although a significant amount of public and private investment is already flowing into energy efficiency and renewable energy, it is far below what is needed. Investment in energy efficiency was estimated to be between US$ 310 and US$ 360 billion in 2012 (IEA, 2014b) and in renewable energy about US$ 244 billion in 2012 (IEA, 2014b), with the latter figure estimated to be US$ 250 billion in 2013 (IEA, 2014g). Therefore a greater policy push is required to enhance investment in this direction. To make it attractive for investors to invest in low-carbon and resource-efficient assets, the financial, policy and technological risks need to be reduced, general investment conditions need to be improved, financing costs need to be lowered and government budget support made available (GGGI, 2014; NCE, 2014). 4 .2 Spotlight: energy efficiency has benefits for all 4 .2 .1 Introduction As in past emission gap reports, this chapter reviews successful policies and measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time support development. This year\u2019s focus is on improving energy efficiency. Energy efficiency improvements are defined here as a reduction of energy use per unit of energy services delivered, for example, a reduction of the energy used to heat 1 m2 of a home, or to drive 1 km with a car. This could also mean delivering more services with the same amount of energy. These improvements could be technical, as in replacing existing equipment with more energy efficient equipment (for example, energy efficient light bulbs), or behavioural, in which people use equipment more efficiently (for example, adjusting the thermostat setting on heating and cooling appliances). Table 4.1 shows the substantial potential of energy efficiency improvements as part of a package of approaches to reduce global emissions. More specific estimates are presented in Section 4.2.2, which also reviews the multiple benefits to be garnered from energy efficiency improvements, beyond energy savings alone. Section 4.2.3 summarises policies and measures to improve energy efficiency in key sectors. 4 .2 .2 The multiple benefits of improving energy efficiency The impacts of energy efficiency measures go far beyond energy savings and bring multiple benefits in line with the SDGs. An understanding of these could improve the benefit-cost assessment of energy efficiency outcomes and also show that it is unnecessary to trade environmental goals off against economic and social development ones. ____________________ 2 The Chair\u2019s summary is available online at: http://www.un.org/climatechange/summit/2014/09/2014-climate-change-summary-chairs-summary/ 3 The Ad-hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action\u2019s draft text on Accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 climate action is available online at: http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2014/adp2/eng/8drafttext.pdf 4 However, these investment costs are offset by nearly US$ 115 trillion in fuel savings in a scenario that lowers emissions enough to stay within the 2 \u02daC limit. 38 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 4 Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits Many of the benefits are derived from two effects: a: lower energy use which increases environ- mental performance, disposable income, and/ or productivity, or b: investments in energy efficiency goods and services which increase spending in the economy5 (IEA, 2014e). One way to look at the multiple advantages of improving energy efficiency is to divide them into environmental, social and economic benefits, as in the following paragraphs. Environmental benefits Reducing greenhouse gas emissions Energy efficiency represents one of the most important pillars in efforts to decarbonize the global energy system and achieve the world\u2019s climate protection objectives. Improving energy efficiency is prominently featured in government strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions because of its significant potential to do so. Compared to other measures, improving energy efficiency is generally one of the most cost- effective options and can be implemented quickly (IIASA, 2012; IEA 2013a, 2013b; UNFCCC, 2014). Some ongoing improvement of energy efficiency is indicated by the 1.6 per cent per year worldwide decline of energy intensity between 2002 and 20126 (IEA, 2014b). These improvements of course come at a price, with the annual investment in energy efficiency noted above to be US$ 310\u2013360 billion in 2012 (IEA, 2014b). While there has been steady progress over the past decade, there is great potential to further increase the rate of energy efficiency improvements (IEA, 2014c) and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba945432-2a80-4714-b561-1d225a4e0c1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba945432-2a80-4714-b561-1d225a4e0c1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4e4a19ca191994ba1ec164a94f838538f61faddc6345f61cf243a940c688748"}, "2": {"node_id": "d693f32a-5d98-4ec8-abee-94ee75f5e36a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82e29a9e8c04dfcf9ec3d77dda579831dec6726a174ba00acd7b49d64c162422"}}, "hash": "ae8e352e86e93a34a200aafe010d005604b724d02bade4e18037d28652b6f741", "text": "The extent to which greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced depends on both the emissions intensity of energy supply and use, and the effectiveness of those energy efficiency measures in reducing energy consumption.

A recent assessment (UDP, in preparation) provides world and G20 national- and sector-specific estimates of the emissions reduction potential associated with energy efficiency measures. The findings of this assessment, which are consistent with related studies (Appendix 4-C), highlight a significant emissions reduction potential through energy efficiency improvements, in particular in the power generation and industry sectors. By this estimate, energy efficiency improvements worldwide could abate 22\u201324 Gt CO2e in the period 2015\u20132030 (or 2.5\u20133.3 Gt CO2e annually in 2030) relative to a baseline scenario. This corresponds to a reduction in primary energy demand of about 5-7 per cent over the same fifteen-year period. Cumulative emission reductions attributable to improvements in energy efficiency over the period 2015-2030 represent about one-fifth of all cost effective emission reductions.7 Depending on the assumptions, estimates are higher (Appendix 4-C). For example, the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2014a) reports that end-use fuel and electricity efficiency could save 6.8 Gt CO2e in 2030, and power generation efficiency and fossil fuel switching could save 0.3 Gt CO2e, also in 2030. An assessment by the ____________________ 5 Much of the research material for this section is sourced from the IEA\u2019s Multiple Benefits of Energy Efficiency (IEA, 2014c). More details on the subject can be found there (see http://www.iea.org/W/bookshop/475-Capturing_the_Multiple_Benefits_of_Energy_Efficiency ) 6 Energy intensity is an indicator of the energy efficiency of a country and is defined as the amount of primary energy used per unit of GDP of a country. But energy intensity does not only reflect an economy\u2019s energy efficiency; it also reflects the mix and type of economic activity. However, if the structure and level of economic activity remains relatively stable, then trends in energy intensity can serve as a proxy for changes in energy efficiency. 7 These emission reduction estimates relate to abatement costs that would be economically efficient to incur in the period to 2030 (on average, worldwide) if carbon emissions were priced at US$ 70 per tonne over that same period. 39 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Chapter 4 Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits German Aerospace Centre (EREC, 2012) estimates that 13 Gt CO2e could be saved in 2030 through energy efficiency improvements alone. Reducing air pollution Emissions from fossil-fuels and biomass burning account for the majority of energy-related air pollution. The emitted substances include particulate matter (PM), precursors of tropospheric (the lower layer of the atmosphere) ozone (O3), nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and organic compounds and metals. These compounds have a range of harmful impacts. The most recent global burden of disease report (Lim et al., 2012) estimated that in 2010 there were 3.5 million premature deaths from indoor smoke from solid fuels and another 3 million premature deaths from urban air pollution (ClimateWorks and World Bank, 2014). In addition, air pollution causes major crop losses. It was estimated that one pollutant alone, ozone, causes annual crop losses of around 79\u2013121 million tonnes (reference year 2000), equivalent to about US$ 11\u201318 billion (Avnery et al., 2011). Energy efficiency improvements can reduce air pollutant impacts by lowering the burning of fossil fuels and hence their air-polluting emissions, leading to health benefits in addition to those described in the health and well-being section below. A recent study showed that nearly 100 000 premature deaths could be avoided annually in Brazil, China the EU, India, Mexico and the USA by 2030 through energy efficiency measures in the transport, buildings and industrial sectors (ClimateWorks and World Bank, 2014). Economic benefits Improvements in energy efficiency can produce significant positive macroeconomic impacts such as increases in GDP, public budgets, employment, and national competitiveness, as well as improved trade balances and reduced energy prices. Economic output and public budget impacts Investment in energy efficiency implies a transfer of capital from energy supply to less energy-intensive activities. This can have significant impacts on the wider economy if the transfer involves a restructuring of the economy to more labour- intensive activities. Both energy cost savings and increased investment in energy efficiency goods and services can lead to spending throughout the economy and increased economic activity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ea5775b-e99f-46da-b159-1e909c570f2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ea5775b-e99f-46da-b159-1e909c570f2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "671e2520c1ed9e4497a8329b32660804b729bdedcaa7491b6d1b959c51525daf"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed8ac641-0a95-4249-9942-30b4c721f6ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da8565626e79505d97ac76360ed2058aab71821e494fa43b2102635d3f0a16b5"}}, "hash": "4e82bab2dea96127aacba2cd2e0f24489765711d436bc3555068c5ffccbe7397", "text": "Policy makers tend to think of energy efficiency policies in terms of their costs to the public budget such as costs for implementing regulations, information and enforcement measures.

However, the more positive effects on the public budget are often overlooked. These include: 1: direct effects such as reductions in operational expenditure and capital expenditure for the public sector itself; and 2: indirect effects such as increases in tax revenues from the sales of energy efficiency-related goods and services; or reductions in unemployment because of stimulated spending and economic activity. A few studies have confirmed that energy efficiency programmes have positive benefits to the public sector in that around 50 per cent to 75 per cent of the total investment in energy efficiency is returned to the public budget9 (Lehr and Lutz, et al., 2012; Kuckshinrichs et al., 2013). ____________________ 8 Financial incentives can also be funded through user charges and other private sources, which would not be counted as public budget expenditure. 9 In terms of the public investment alone rather than total investment in energy efficiency; in Germany, Kuckshinrichs et al. (2013) estimated that the return on investment for the public budget is up to 7:1. 40 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 4 Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits Employment effects Investment in energy efficiency programmes has significant potential to create jobs, both directly through action that requires firms to carry out the work, and indirectly because of the boost in economic output caused by investment and energy cost reductions, as noted above10. However, it is important to clarify whether there is a net or gross job creation, since the employment produced may only shift jobs between sectors. Research shows a wide range of estimates for changes to employment, from zero net jobs across all sectors in G20 countries per million euros spent on energy efficiency11 (UDP, in preparation), to 19 jobs per million euros invested in energy efficiency in the buildings sector in Europe12 (Janssen and Staniaszek, 2012). Not only is the number of jobs created important, but also the value of those jobs. This depends on various factors such as labour intensity, local content, wage rates and temporal durability. In the USA, it is estimated that US$ 1 million spent on energy efficiency in retrofitting buildings and mass transit generates 2.5\u20134 times more jobs than the same amount spent on oil and natural gas because of the higher labour intensity associated with energy efficiency work (Pollin et al., 2009). The effectiveness of an energy efficiency programme in creating jobs will also depend on the size and structure of financing and the type of energy savings intervention. Benefits to industrial productivity Energy efficiency measures in industry have been shown to provide a range of direct and indirect non- energy benefits for businesses (Lilly and Pearson, 1999; Pearson and Skumatz, 2002). These include reduced environmental compliance costs, enhanced productivity and competitiveness, decreased maintenance costs, extended life of equipment, reduced waste-disposal costs, and improved process and product quality (IEA, 2014b). Worrell et al. (2003) analysed 72 case studies and found that the non- energy benefits can also extend to improvement in individual working conditions, such as less noise, and higher levels of safety and worker morale. However, these impacts are very difficult to quantify. The implementation of energy efficiency measures has also been associated with the generation of business opportunities and access to new markets, as new energy-efficient technologies are manufactured and traded (Mundaca et al., 2010). Although it is difficult to compare studies, since every industrial plant is different, there is evidence to suggest that the value of the benefits related to improved industrial productivity and operation could be up to 2.5 times the value of energy cost savings (IEA, 2014e). Social benefits Health and well-being from more comfortable buildings There is a growing body of evidence that energy efficiency measures contribute to public health. As mentioned above, there are significant health benefits due to reduced air pollution. Energy- efficiency improvements in buildings (improved insulation, heating and ventilation systems and increased efficiency of other energy using devices) can also lead to a warmer, drier, more comfortable indoor environment (Milne and Boardman, 2000). Studies show that this improved indoor environment reduces respiratory and cardiovascular disease, allergies, arthritis and rheu- matism and creates feedback loops generating improved mental health. Health improvements in turn generate wider social and economic impacts, including lower spending on public health. ____________________ 10 Causal links are difficult to establish but the indirect jobs appear to be more durable with potential to last the period of the energy efficiency improvement itself, i.e. the 20 year lifetime of an improved heating system, rather than the shorter lifetime of an energy efficiency programme. 11", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7c8b2c8-64f9-4347-9a2a-dbaf91b08845": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7c8b2c8-64f9-4347-9a2a-dbaf91b08845", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1616adf5f8bd2250458c98364f9eca1d174f81811377019cfc4985b43d12360"}}, "hash": "d1616adf5f8bd2250458c98364f9eca1d174f81811377019cfc4985b43d12360", "text": "While the study shows nearly no change to global employment as a result of energy efficiency improvements, this result obscures the significant differences between regions. For most regions there are net employment increases but employment falls in some regions where \u201cthe domestic economy is affected by higher prices and trade relationships with the rest of the world\u201d (UDP, in preparation). 12 The Janssen and Staniaszek (2012) estimate of 19 jobs per Euro 1 million invested in upgrading the energy efficiency of the building stock represents an arithmetic average of the results of 35 data points from 20 sources. 41 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Chapter 4 Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits Often the health and well-being impacts alone outweigh the benefits of energy savings and emission reductions, not only in societal value, but also in financial terms. In fact, health benefits of energy efficiency measures in buildings are estimated to account for up to 75 per cent of overall benefits (IEA, 2014e). However, it is difficult to determine the causal link between energy efficiency and health outcomes due to the complex nature of human health and the complex interactions of different physical, social and economic drivers (Evans et al., 2003). Access to energy The alleviation of poverty in both developed and developing countries is a central concern to society. Access to modern energy services is fundamental to pulling communities out of poverty by providing the energy required for social and economic development. It is estimated that nearly 1.3 billion people in developing countries do not have access to electricity. More than 95 per cent of them are either in sub-Saharan Africa or developing countries in Asia (IEA, 2013a). In other countries with better access to electricity, fuel shortages sometimes lead to disruptions in fuel supply and temporary interruptions in access to energy. Another important issue is that the expansion of energy infrastructure in developing countries sometimes does not extend to the poorest households, so special programmes are needed to reach these people. Cook-stove improvements are an example of an energy efficiency initiative that can yield better energy services while providing other social benefits such as reduced indoor air pollution13. Improving the energy efficiency of energy infrastructure can also be interpreted as providing more people with access to energy services for the same primary inputs and costs. Alleviating fuel poverty Energy affordability issues are both a cause and a symptom of poverty. Fuel or energy poverty describes a situation in which energy services are not affordable enough to maintain healthy living conditions. In OECD countries, fuel poverty is often defined as a situation in which households need to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on achieving adequate levels of energy services in the home. By this definition, just under 20 per cent of the UK\u2019s population is in fuel poverty and around 15 per cent in the USA. European studies estimate that 50\u2013125 million Europeans are fuel poor14. In general, the poor are more likely to live in inefficient housing, have less access to energy subsidies and therefore face higher relative energy costs. Energy saving measures in buildings can contribute to improving this situation by reducing heating energy bills. Several OECD countries, including Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, the USA and the UK have used energy efficiency policies to address fuel poverty with positive results (IEA, 2014e). Barriers to energy efficiency Given the significant benefits associated with improvements in energy efficiency, it seems surprising that there is an energy efficiency gap in that the technical potential remains unfulfilled. The reason for this is that certain barriers, what economists call market failures, prevent energy efficiency measures from being carried out, even when their costs can be recovered quickly through energy savings. The main market failures and barriers are: - Imperfect information: this is probably the most common barrier. Energy consumers may not understand the benefits of improved efficiency because they lack sufficient information about the energy performance of equipment or the trend of future energy prices. ____________________ 13 See the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves for more details (http://carbonfinanceforcookstoves.org/). 14 European fuel Poverty and Energy Efficiency (EPEE) project: www.fuel-poverty.org/ 42 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 4 Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits - Split incentives: this is sometimes known as the landlord-tenant problem where the benefits of investing in energy efficiency do not accrue to the investor.

This is important in countries where energy is subsidised and energy prices are low. Other important market barriers are the higher upfront costs often associated with better energy efficiency and the lack of access to finance for covering these costs. Resistance to change and human inertia are also powerful deterrents to taking action. Another possible obstacle to obtaining the full benefits of energy efficiency improvements is the so-called rebound effect that some experts believe can undermine energy savings expected from efficiency projects (Box 4.2). Policy intervention is needed to overcome these obstacles, market failures and barriers, to encou- rage greater improvements in energy efficiency. These are further discussed in the section 4.2.3. Key points about benefits Improvements in energy efficiency are among the most cost-effective measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the economic, social, and environmental benefits of energy efficiency measures other than energy demand reduction could significantly outweigh energy cost savings in terms of value and level of priority for governments. The benefits of energy efficiency can affect all levels of society \u2013 from individual benefits of increased health, well-being, disposable income and access to energy services and employment, through increasing industrial productivity and profits, and on to national-level macroeconomic benefits such as increases to GDP, trade and public budgets, and reduced air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The benefits of energy efficiency improvements are generated from: 1: energy cost reductions, leading to increased disposable income, wellbeing, environmental performance, and competitiveness; and 2: increased investment and spending on energy efficiency. Ultimately both types of effects can lead to an increase in economic activity, justifying the inclusion of energy efficiency measures in mainstream economic policy. In addition, the social and environmental benefits from improvements in energy efficiency suggest that energy saving measures should be embedded in strategies to achieve the SDGs. Although the benefits of energy efficiency measures are large, there remain many barriers to implementing them. Policy intervention is clearly needed to realize these benefits. 4 .2 .3 Policies and measures to improve energy efficiency in key sectors There are many examples of energy efficiency policies and measures adopted in various regions, countries, states and cities that are transferable. There are also various measures and targets that can help accelerate energy efficiency in economies (Box 4.3). Rather than providing an inventory of such measures, this chapter aims to give specific examples of successful action that has made a difference in key sectors. We focus on three sectors that comprise 95 per cent of world energy use: buildings, including lighting and appliances 43 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Chapter 4 Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits Box 4 .2: The rebound effect The rebound effect, as applied to energy consumption, refers to a situation in which an efficiency improvement is counteracted by additional energy consumption (IPCC, 2014; Santarius, 2012). One classic example is the increase in fuel efficiency of passenger cars which some authors claim has led to an increase in the kilometers driven per person (Sorrell et al., 2009). On one hand, it can be argued that an increase in consumption enhances welfare and therefore is a good thing. On the other hand, if the aim is to reduce overall energy use and greenhouse gas and other emissions as far as possible, then the rebound effect makes this strategy less effective. Three classes of rebound have been identified (Santarius, 2012). Financial rebound means that cost savings of energy efficiency measures stimulate higher energy consumption, for example, when households invest energy savings in further consumption. Material rebound means that the act of improving energy efficiency also involves some energy costs (for example, that it takes energy to produce the wall insulation used for reducing household heating). Finally, psychological rebound has to do with consciously or unconsciously consuming more, just because it is assumed that, with some new, efficient appliance, it does not matter anymore. The limited number of studies makes it impossible to generalize about the impact of rebound in a typical energy efficiency project. Some authors estimate the rebound effect to be 10\u201330 per cent for household energy use and buildings, and as large as 60 per cent for mobility and it can be higher in developing countries where energy demand is unsaturated (Sorrell et al., 2009; Thomas and Azevedo, 2013).

One proposal is to tax profits arising from efficiency improvements (von Weizsacker et al., 2009); another is to introduce a carbon price in combination with energy efficiency measures to reduce increased spending on carbon-intensive activities. But the question remains whether some of the rebound effect can be viewed as an acceptable price for society to pay to get the multiple benefits described in this chapter. For example, energy efficiency measures have been known to provide benefits such as stimulating jobs and economic activity, but these in turn stimulate further energy use. Is some lessening of the climate mitigation effectiveness of energy efficiency projects an acceptable trade-off for societal welfare gains? Considering the potential impact of the rebound effect on energy efficiency policies and measures, it is important to better understand its impacts and to take it into account when charting strategies for mitigating climate change. (38 per cent), industry (33 per cent), and transport (24 per cent)15. In addition, we look at the electricity production sector. Buildings The scope for improving the efficiency with which energy is used in building design, construction and operation is large. Recent advances in materials and know-how mean that new energy efficient buildings can use 60 to 90 per cent less energy than conventional buildings of a similar type and configuration, suggesting they would be cost-effective in all countries and climate zones (GEA 2012). Energy use in buildings represents a complex interaction between physical, economic and human systems. Many policies have focused on addressing individual components within these systems. Although this approach has been successful up to now in improving ____________________ 15 Data for 2010 are calculated in terms of primary energy, taking into account global energy conversion efficiencies for power plants. Use of energy for non-energy purposes is not taken into account. The calculation is based on data from the IEA energy balances from both OECD and non-OECD countries. 44 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 4 Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits energy efficiency, a more integrated approach is required to drive further improvements \u2013 that is, an approach covering the building shell, fixed and plug-in appliances, energy generation and enabling technologies, and occupant behaviour (Box 4.4). For new structures, buildings codes stipulating minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) have become the most popular policy instrument for reducing energy demand. If stringent building codes are not universally introduced, high energy use and emissions risk being locked in for decades, leading to a 33 per cent increase in global energy use for buildings by 2050 instead of a decrease of 46 per cent (GEA, 2012). To achieve real energy savings, these codes need to be enforced, reviewed and regularly strengthened (IEA, 2011a). Virtually all OECD countries and several developing countries have building codes in place (IEA 2008)16, Box 4 .3: Cross-cutting measures that support energy efficiency Box 4 .4: Energy for heating, cooling and hot water A number of measures can be used to improve energy efficiency across the economy. The main measures include: \u2022\ufffd putting\ufffda\ufffdprice\ufffdon\ufffdcarbon\ufffde.g.\ufffdcarbon\ufffdtrading,\ufffdcarbon\ufffdtax; \u2022\ufffd energy\ufffdefficiency\ufffdtargets; \u2022\ufffd energy\ufffdintensity\ufffdreduction\ufffdtargets\ufffd-\ufffddecoupling\ufffdgross\ufffddomestic\ufffdproduct\ufffdfrom\ufffdenergy\ufffduse/emissions; \u2022\ufffd emission\ufffdreduction\ufffdtargets; \u2022\ufffd setting\ufffdcarbon-neutral\ufffdtargets;\ufffdand \u2022\ufffd removing\ufffdfuel\ufffdsubsidies\ufffdto\ufffdreflect\ufffdthe\ufffdtrue\ufffdprice\ufffdof\ufffdenergy. Naturally, not all measures are suitable for all countries. In addition, success depends on regular monitoring, verification and enforcement. The provision of heating, cooling and hot water is estimated to account for roughly half of global energy consumption in buildings (IEA, 2012c). Some cities are adopting district energy systems to supply thermal energy (heat, cooling and hot water) and in some cases electricity to buildings. District energy systems coordinate the supply of heating, cooling and power and in so doing optimize energy use and maximize energy efficiency. While district energy systems are appropriate for different climate zones (IPCC, 2014), up to now they have been used mostly to provide heating in cooler climates \u2013 in Europe and the USA. Nonetheless there are now a growing number of district energy systems providing cooling in warmer climates such as in Dubai, Kuwait and Singapore. which require a level of insulation that substantially reduces energy demand.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16202dbc-06d6-4b96-bf74-9e9f90d0c02a": {"__data__": {"id_": "16202dbc-06d6-4b96-bf74-9e9f90d0c02a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bbab5951add898b1b79b1373a2feeaad510667117ae4d08efcc4a4e550c4541b"}, "2": {"node_id": "11991ecf-c4f7-43fb-99b7-0d6bdd47c37c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "640668339524956fc4950e1e6da69ebcb2d2fb746f81d1bde4f76332e7d7e435"}}, "hash": "794e31c5a4970460a40a92baebd1180cc04b8b7976d16769f8bfe12eeb97fb0e", "text": "which require a level of insulation that substantially reduces energy demand.

With this in mind, it is important to note that many countries have adopted very ambitious codes. 45 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Chapter 4 Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits as much energy as they consume (IPCC, 2014). Increased construction of low-energy and efficient buildings can be encouraged mainly through the establishment of targets for market share in new constructions, updates of building codes and demonstration projects17. Energy-plus buildings \u2013 buildings that produce more energy than they consume \u2013 represent a relatively recent concept that is being applied to pilot and demonstration projects (Wang et al., 2009; Miller and Buys 2010). There have been a handful of commercial and residential buildings that have demonstrated they are energy-plus buildings. Some cities, such as Boston in the USA, have developed an Energy Plus green building programme to promote energy efficient buildings throughout the city. There are other measures that can improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings, including energy audits, energy rating schemes, incentives to encourage investment, as well as education and awareness programmes (IEA, 2014d). Some important energy efficiency measures target specific building components such as: 1: performance requirements and labelling of windows and other glazed areas; 2: reduced energy demand from heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems through, for example, increased efficiency, labelling and correct sizing; and 3: promoting energy management and controls to reduce energy use and capture energy efficiency opportunities (IEA, 2014d). ____________________ 17 The European Performance Buildings Directive requires that all new buildings in European Union member states are nearly-zero energy buildings by 2020, with all new buildings occupied and owned by public authorities being nearly zero-energy buildings by 2018 (European Union 2010). Some European member states have already moved to ambitious performance goals of low- or zero-emissions buildings (Hermelink et al. 2013). California has set a target that all new residential constructions are to be net-zero energy by 2020 and all new commercial constructions will be net-zero energy by 2030 (CA, 2013). 18 For some devices, such as game consoles, up to 80 per cent of the energy consumption is used just to maintain a network connection. Policy measures mandating minimum performance standards could reverse this situation (IEA, 2014f). 19 Detailed assessments of energy performance standards can be found in \u00dcrge-Vorsatz et al., (2007); Koeppel and \u00dcrge-Vorsatz, (2007); Boza-Kiss et al., (2013); Siderius and Nakagami, (2013); and Molenbroek et al., (2014). 20 The success of any standards and labelling programme depends on an effective strategy for monitoring, verification and enforcement (Ellis et al., 2010; IEA, 2010) to ensure the delivery of energy, financial and climate benefits. Appliances and lighting Appliances include all types of equipment used in buildings \u2013 refrigerators, air conditioners, televisions, equipment for water heating, etc. Electrical appliances, excluding heating and cooling systems and lighting, typically account for 20 per cent or more of residential energy consumption18 (IPCC, 2014). It is now technically possible to substantially reduce the energy use of appliances, equipment and lighting without diminishing their service levels or working effectiveness. Two key measures are typically used to this end: - Energy performance standards which encourage rapid adoption of higher efficiency products19. The number of different products subject to energy performance standards has grown from 42 to 55 between 2004 and 2013 (EES, 2013); and - Labelling which informs consumers about the comparative energy consumption of products and provides an incentive for manufacturers to innovate in order to gain a market advantage. Mandatory energy labelling has been applied to many appliances and lighting products (Ellis et al., 2010; IEA, 2010). The combination of energy performance standards and labelling in its various forms are often complementary tools applied to the same product type20. The number of countries with a standards and labelling programme has grown rapidly, from 50 to 81 between 2004 and 2013 (EES, 2013).

One of the most concerted efforts to reduce energy use in lighting is UNEP\u2019s En.lighten Initiative21. Industry There is substantial potential for reducing energy use in the industrial sector. Fuel use for process heating can be reduced through heat recovery and better insulation, as well as by modifying the production process. The electricity requirements of driving equipment such as compressors, fans, and pumps can be reduced by optimising motor systems. Not least, energy efficiency can also be substantially improved by low- or no-cost changes to management practices in industrial facilities (Reinaud and Goldberg, 2013). Implementing these and other measures requires effective policies, but no single approach dominates in the industrial sector. Governments seldom implement isolated policies: they prefer policy packages that address several energy efficiency improvements at the same time22. In addition, governments often try to avoid the application of stringent and costly measures that reduce the competitiveness of their industries. Governments promote industrial energy efficiency by helping companies identify the most cost effective efficiency investments, mainly through energy audits or in-depth energy reviews. They also encourage industries to make efficiency investments by reducing the payback time of these investments, typically through subsidies and loans; by mandating, mostly through energy-saving targets and emissions trading; or by encouraging implementation, for example through voluntary agreements and differentiated electricity pricing. Governments generally adopt policies that allow flexibility as to how their industries achieve energy savings (Reinaud and MacNulty, 2014). This flexibility is needed because policies have to be applicable to industries that encompass a wide variety of sub-sectors, all with different energy consumption profiles (World Energy Council and Ademe, 2013). The following policies and measures have proved to be particularly promising: - Energy management programmes that require or encourage companies to adopt energy management guidelines such as ISO 50001 have been introduced in several countries23 (IEA & IIP, 2012). Experience has shown that government-led energy management programmes are most effective when they are part of a broader government programme or a voluntary agreement between industry and government, coupled with a mix of incentives, supports and the threat of regulation (IEA & IIP, 2012; Reinaud and Goldberg, 2013). - A corporate energy-saving programme is a comprehensive effort to reduce energy use in the industrial sector and is usually country- specific24. China has one of the most extensive of these, the Top-10,000 Energy-Consuming ____________________ 21 En.lighten is a partnership of more than 60 countries committed to phasing out the use of inefficient incandescent lamps and replacing them with energy efficient lighting sources by 2016 (http://www.enlighten-initiative.org/). 22 Most policy packages are very country-, sector- and size-specific. 23 Energy management systems establish a framework for industrial facilities to manage their energy use, and require companies to adopt a suite of procedures and practices to ensure systematic tracking, analysis and planning of energy use in industry. 24 For more details on energy management programmes, see: http://www.iipnetwork.org/databases/programs 47 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Chapter 4 Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits ____________________ 25 This is a package of policies and measures including a specific energy-saving target assigned to each of around 15 000 Chinese enterprises, and the requirement to adopt the Chinese energy management system standard. Each company\u2019s 5-year energy-saving target has to be reached by the end of the current Five Year Plan (2011\u20132015; Ke et al., 2012). 26 Included are energy-intensive sectors such as aluminium, cement, chlor-alkali, fertilizer, iron and steel and pulp and paper. Certificates are issued to companies that can verify their energy savings and these certificates can be traded between the companies. This programme sets a plant-specific energy reduction target compared to its baseline, with the average reduction target being 4.8 per cent between 2012 and 2015 (CDKN, 2013). 27 In the EU, the standard for electric motors is combined with an obligation to install equipment for power-speed control (Reinaud and MacNulty, 2014). 28 ETS are operational in the EU, California, several provinces in Canada, several cities and provinces in China (with plans to extend it to the entire country in the coming three years), South-Korea, Kazakhstan and New Zealand (H\u00f6hne et al., 2014). 29 Canada, Japan and the USA have emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles.

This would result in about a 50 per cent reduction in the fuel use of all cars on the road by 2050 (IEA, 2012b). 32 For example, Korea has implemented a tyre labelling programme to promote reduced rolling-resistant tyres. Enterprises25, and another example is India\u2019s Perform, Achieve and Trade programme, which sets a specific energy consumption targets for 478 companies26. - Energy performance standards contribute to energy savings in industry but are usually only applied to specific equipment or technologies. The most popular application of these standards is to electric motors. Up to now, 44 countries have such standards, including Brazil, China, South Korea, and the USA (EES 2013)27. China has applied specific energy efficiency standards to the production of 39 industrial commodities. - Emissions trading systems (ETS) are proliferating across the globe and are now in place or scheduled for implementation in many regions28. Although current low price levels limit their impact, future higher prices could change this situation. Transport Worldwide, more than half of oil consumption is for transport. Three-quarters of the energy used in this sector is consumed on roads (IEA, 2012a). Without strong new mitigation policies, fuel use for road transport is projected to double between 2010 and 2050 (IEA, 2012b). Currently, the principal measure used to improve energy efficiency in the transport sector is to impose mandatory fuel economy standards on road vehicles \u2013 these are in place in most OECD member countries and China (IEA, 2012a). For freight transport, the development of fuel economy standards is less advanced29, as the wide variety of freight transport modes makes them challenging to set30. In addition to fuel economy standards, measures such as labelling, taxes and incentives can help increase vehicle efficiency and accelerate the market penetration of more efficient vehicles31 (IEA, 2012b). Vehicle fuel efficiency can also be boosted by improving the efficiency of non-fuel related components, such as tyres, air conditioning and lighting (IEA, 2012a). For example, reducing the rolling-resistance of tyres and promoting optimal inflation levels are effective measures for reducing energy use32. Ecodriving provides a further means of improving the efficiency with which energy is used in the transport sector. It involves the modification of driving habits to conserve fuel use (for example, by paying special attention to driving at steady speeds and low rpm), which can reduce average fuel use by 10 per cent or more (IEA, 2012b). Land use planning and management also plays an important role in improving the energy efficiency of transport by encouraging the greater use of public transport and reducing the overall need for motorized transport. It can do so by increasing density, so that public transportation can work at capacity. It can also reduce the distances between 48 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 4 Improving energy efficiency and reaping development and climate benefits residences, commercial areas and work places, so that it is easier and more convenient to travel by foot or bicycle. Zoning can also be used to discourage private vehicles and encourage more energy efficient modes of travel33. Electricity production, transmission and distribution In 2005, the overall efficiency of the energy system from primary energy to useful energy was only about 34 per cent (GEA, 2012). It is, however, possible to raise this level by saving energy at power plants and reducing losses during electricity distribution. Despite the rapid expansion of renewable energy production in many countries, fossil fuel facilities will continue to play a significant role in energy production. Therefore legislation and incentives are needed to boost the energy efficiency of fossil fuel-based energy generation. At a technical level, energy can be saved by replacing conventional turbines with super- or ultra-super critical boilers or combined-cycle gas turbines. Energy can also be saved by improving ____________________ 33 For example, drivers in many German cities have to obtain a special sticker to drive in the green zone of these cities. 34 Network losses produce more than 700 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year. 35 Australia, Canada, China and the USA, among other countries, have introduced energy performance standards for distribution transformers. 36 These schemes have various names such as energy efficiency obligation schemes, energy saving initiatives or white certificate schemes. 37 In the USA, 25 states have utilities with such obligations (ACEEE, 2014). In the EU, eight member states have introduced these obligations, and eight more are planning to do so (Bean et al., 2014). operating practices at electrical generation facilities, such that they operate near their design heat-rate values.

Worldwide, the cost of energy losses in networks amounts to more than US$ 61 billion annually34 (Leonardo Energy, 2005). Most of these losses occur in the distribution system, and of those, one-third occur in transformers \u2013 the majority in distribution transformers (SEAD, 2013). Energy per- formance standards for distribution trans- formers can help reduce these losses35. Some governments have created regulatory and other policies to ensure that energy utilities carry out energy efficiency improvements36. These schemes enable utilities to trade energy- saving obligations and encourage competition in delivering energy services and meeting energy savings targets. Some schemes allow utilities to recover their costs while maintaining revenues and profits by sharing the costs and benefits with consumers37 (IEA, 2011b). 49 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis References Chapter 1 IPCC. 2013.

Additionality A criterion sometimes applied to projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It stipulates that the emission reductions accomplished by the project would not have happened anyway had the project not taken place. Aerosols Airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical size of between 0.01 and 10 micrometer (a millionth of a meter) that reside in the atmosphere for at least several hours. They may influence the climate directly through scattering and absorbing radiation, and indirectly by modifying the optical properties and lifetime of clouds. Agroforestry Farming management practice characterized by the deliberate inclusion of woody perennials on farms, which usually leads to significant economic and/or ecological benefits between woody and non-woody system components. In most documented cases of successful agroforestry, tree-based systems are more productive, more sustainable and more attuned to people\u2019s cultural or material needs than treeless alternatives. Agroforestry also provides significant mitigation benefits by sequestering carbon from the atmosphere in the tree biomass. Annex I countries The industrialised countries (and those in transition to a market economy) that took on obligations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Biomass plus carbon capture and storage (BioCCS) Use of energy produced from biomass where the combustion gases are then captured and stored underground or used, for example, in industrial processes. Gases generated through, for example, a fermentation process (as opposed to combustion) can also be captured. Black carbon The substance formed through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass, which is emitted in both anthropogenic and naturally occurring soot. It consists of pure carbon in several linked forms. Black carbon warms the Earth by absorbing heat in the atmosphere and by reducing albedo, the ability to reflect sunlight, when deposited on snow and ice. Bottom-up model In the context of this report, a model that represents a system by looking at its detailed underlying parts. For example, a bottom-up model of emissions would compute the various sources of emissions, sector-by-sector, and then add these components together to get a total emissions estimate. Business-as-usual In the context of this report, a scenario used for projections of future emissions that assumes that no new action will be taken to mitigate emissions. Carbon credits Tradable permits which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by giving them a monetary value. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) A simplified way to place emissions of various radiative forcing agents on a common footing by accounting for their effect on climate. It describes, for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse gases, the amount of carbon dioxide that would have the same global warming ability, when measured over a specified time period. For the purpose of this report, greenhouse gas emissions (unless otherwise specified) are the sum of the basket of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents assuming a 100-year global warming potential.

Integrated assessment models Models that seek to combine knowledge from multiple disciplines in the form of equations and/or algorithms in order to explore complex environmental problems. As such, they describe the full chain of climate change, including relevant links and feedbacks between socio-economic and biophysical processes. International cooperative initiatives Initiatives outside of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by promoting actions that are less greenhouse gas intensive, compared to prevailing alternatives. Kyoto Protocol The international environmental treaty intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It builds upon the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Later-action scenarios Climate change mitigation scenarios in which emission levels in the near term, typically up to 2020 or 2030, are higher than those in the corresponding least-cost scenarios. Least-cost scenarios Climate change mitigation scenarios assuming that emission reductions start immediately after the model base year, typically 2010, and are distributed optimally over time, such that aggregate costs of reaching the climate target are minimized. Lenient rules Pledge cases with maximum Annex I land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) credits and surplus emissions units, and maximum impact of double counting. Likely chance A likelihood greater than 66 percent. Used in this report to convey the probabilities of meeting temperature limits. Medium chance A likelihood of 50\u201366 percent. Used in this report to convey the probabilities of meeting temperature limits. Montreal Protocol The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international treaty that was designed to reduce the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances in order to reduce their abundance in the atmosphere, and thereby protect the Earth\u2019s ozone layer. Non-Annex I countries A group of developing countries that have signed and ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. They do not have binding emission reduction targets. No-tillage agriculture Farming practice characterized by the elimination of soil ploughing by seeding a crop directly under the mulch layer from the previous crop. It relies on permanent soil cover by organic amendments, and the diversification of crop species grown in sequences and/or association. This approach avoids emissions caused by soil disturbances related to ploughing, and from burning fossil fuels to run farm machinery for ploughing. Pledge For the purpose of this report, pledges include Annex I targets and non-Annex I actions, as included in Appendix I and Appendix II of the Copenhagen Accord, and subsequently revised and updated in some instances. Radiative forcing Change in the net, downward minus upward, irradiance, expressed in watts per square meter (W/m2), at the tropopause due to a change in an external driver of climate change, such as, for example, a change in the concentration of carbon dioxide or the output of the Sun. For the purposes of this report, radiative forcing is further defined as the change relative to the year 1750 and, unless otherwise noted, refers to a global and annual average value. Scenario A description of how the future may unfold based on if-then propositions. Scenarios typically include an initial socio-economic situation and a description of the key driving forces and future changes in emissions, temperature or other climate change-related variables. Strict rules Pledge cases in which the impact of land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) credits and surplus emissions units are set to zero. Top-down model A model that applies macroeconomic theory, econometric and optimisation techniques to aggregate economic variables. Using historical data on consumption, prices, incomes, and factor costs, top-down models assess final demand for goods and services, and supply from main sectors, such as energy, transportation, agriculture and industry. Transient climate response Measure of the temperature rise that occurs at the time of a doubling of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

Under-Secretary-General, UNEP Executive Director The latest assessment by Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released earlier this year, concluded that climate change remains one of the greatest challenges facing society. Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, human-influenced, and many unprecedented changes have been observed throughout the climate system since 1950. These changes threaten life on Earth as we know it. Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. But how much reduction is needed? Further to the Copenhagen Accord of 2009 and the Canc\u00fan agreements in 2010, international efforts under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are focused on keeping the average rise in global temperature to below 2\u00b0 C, compared to pre-industrial levels. Current commitments and pledges by developed and developing nations can take the world part of the way towards achieving this 2\u00b0 C target, but this assessment shows that the there is still a significant gap between political ambition and practical reality. In short, additional emission reductions are needed. With this fourth assessment of the gap between ambitions and needs, the United Nations Environment Programme seeks to inform governments and the wider public on how far the response to climate change has progressed over the past year, and thus whether the world is on track to meet the 2\u00b0 C target. In addition to reviewing national pledges and actions, this year\u2019s assessment, for the first time, also reviews international cooperative initiatives which, while potentially overlapping, serve to complement national pledges and actions. From a technical standpoint, meeting the 2\u00b0 C target remains possible: it will take a combination of full implementation of current national pledges and actions, a scaling up of the most effective international cooperative initiatives, and additional mitigation efforts at the country level. All these efforts will require strengthened policies aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Crucially, they also require the promotion of development pathways that can concomitantly reduce emissions. As in the previous assessment, this year\u2019s report provides updated analyses of a number of tried and tested sector- specific policy options to achieve this goal. Specifically, we show that actions taken in the agricultural sector can lower emissions and boost the overall sustainability of food production. Replicating these successful policies, and scaling them up, would provide one option for countries to go beyond their current pledges and help close the \u2018emissions gap\u2019. The challenge we face is neither a technical nor policy one \u2013 it is political: the current pace of action is simply insufficient. The technologies to reduce emission levels to a level consistent with the 2\u00b0 C target are available and we know which policies we can use to deploy them. However, the political will to do so remains weak. This lack of political will has a price: we will have to undertake steeper and more costly actions to potentially bridge the emissions gap by 2020. This report is a call for political action.

Foreword xi The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Executive summary xi Executive summary The emissions gap in 2020 is the difference between emission levels in 2020 consistent with meeting climate targets, and levels expected in that year if country pledges and commitments are met. As it becomes less and less likely that the emissions gap will be closed by 2020, the world will have to rely on more difficult, costlier and riskier means after 2020 of keeping the global average temperature increase below 2\u00b0 C. If the emissions gap is not closed, or significantly narrowed, by 2020, the door to many options limiting the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0 C at the end of this century will be closed. Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (\u2018Climate Convention\u2019) declares that its \u201cultimate objective\u201d is to \u201c[stabilize] greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\u201d. The parties to the Climate Convention have translated this objective into an important, concrete target for limiting the increase in global average temperature to 2\u00b0 C, compared to its pre-industrial levels. With the aim of meeting this target, many of the parties have made emission reduction pledges, while others have committed to reductions under the recent extension of the Kyoto Protocol. Since 2010, the United Nations Environment Programme has facilitated an annual independent analysis of those pledges and commitments, to assess whether they are consistent with a least-cost approach to keep global average warming below 2\u00b0 C 1. This report confirms and strengthens the conclusions of the three previous analyses that current pledges and commitments fall short of that goal. It further says that, as emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise rather than decline, it becomes less and less likely that emissions will be low enough by 2020 to be on a least-cost pathway towards meeting the 2\u00b0 C target2. As a result, after 2020, the world will have to rely on more difficult, costlier and riskier means of meeting the target \u2013 the further from the least-cost level in 2020, the higher these costs and the greater the risks will be. If the gap is not closed or significantly narrowed by 2020, the door to many options to limit temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0 C at the end of this century will be closed, further increasing the need to rely on accelerated energy-efficiency increases and biomass with carbon capture and storage for reaching the target. 1. What are current global emissions? Current global greenhouse gas emission levels are considerably higher than the levels in 2020 that are in line with meeting the 1.5\u00b0 C or 2\u00b0 C targets, and are still increasing. In 2010, in absolute levels, developing countries accounted for about 60 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The most recent estimates of global greenhouse gas emissions are for 2010 and amount to 50.1 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) per year (range: 45.6\u2013 54.6 GtCO2e per year). This is already 14 percent higher than the median estimate of the emission level in 2020 with a likely chance of achieving the least cost pathway towards meeting the 2\u00b0 C target (44 GtCO2e per year)3. With regards to emissions in 2010, the modelling groups report a median value of 48.8 GtCO2e, which is within the uncertainty range cited above. For consistency with emission scenarios, the figure of 48.8 GtCO2e per year is used in the calculation of the pledge case scenarios. Relative contributions to global emissions from developing and developed countries changed little from 1990 to 1999. However, the balance changed significantly between 2000 and 2010 \u2013 the developed country share decreased from 51.8 percent to 40.9 percent, whereas developing country emissions increased from 48.2 percent to 59.1 percent. Today developing and developed countries are responsible for roughly equal shares of cumulative greenhouse gas emissions for the period 1850-2010. ____________________ 1 For this report, a least-cost approach means that emissions are reduced by the cheapest means available. 2 For this report, a least-cost pathway or a least-cost emissions pathway or least- cost emission scenarios mean the same thing \u2013 the temporal pathway of global emissions that meets a climate target and that also takes advantage of the lowest- cost options available for reducing emissions. ____________________ 3 See footnote 2. xii The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Executive summary xii 2.

It is only possible to confirm that a few parties are on track to meet their pledges and commitments by 2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 are estimated at 59 GtCO2e per year (range: 56\u201360 GtCO2e per year) under a business-as-usual scenario \u2013 that is, a scenario that only considers existing mitigation efforts. This is about 1 GtCO2e higher than the estimate in the 2012 emissions gap report. There have been no significant changes in the pledges and commitments made by parties to the Climate Convention since the 2012 assessment. However, both rules of accounting for land-use change and forestry, and rules for the use of surplus allowances from the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s first commitment period have been tightened. Implementing the pledges would reduce emissions by 3\u20137 GtCO2e, compared to business-as-usual emission levels. A review of available evidence from 13 of the parties to the Climate Convention that have made pledges or commitments indicates that five \u2013 Australia, China, the European Union, India and the Russian Federation \u2013 appear to be on track to meet their pledges. Four parties \u2013 Canada, Japan, Mexico and the U.S. \u2013 may require further action and/or purchased offsets to meet their pledges, according to government and independent estimates of projected national emissions in 2020. A fifth party \u2013 the Republic of Korea \u2013 may also require further action but this could not be verified based on government estimates. However, new actions now being taken by all five of these parties many enable them to meet their pledges, although the impact of these actions have not been analyzed here. Not enough information is available concerning Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa. It is worth noting that being on track to implement pledges does not equate to being on track to meet the 1.5\u00b0 C or 2\u00b0 C temperature targets. 3. What is the latest estimate of the emissions gap in 2020? Even if pledges are fully implemented, the emissions gap in 2020 will be 8\u201312 GtCO2e per year, assuming least-cost emission pathways. Limited available information indicates that the emissions gap in 2020 to meet a 1.5\u00b0 C target in 2020 is a further 2\u20135 GtCO2e per year wider. Least-cost emission pathways consistent with a likely chance of keeping global mean temperature increases below 2\u00b0 C compared to pre-industrial levels have a median level of 44 GtCO2e in 2020 (range: 38\u201347 GtCO2e)4. Assuming full implementation of the pledges, the emissions gap thus amounts to between 8\u201312 GtCO2e per year in 2020 (Table 1). Governments have agreed to more stringent international accounting rules for land-use change and surplus allowances for the parties to the Kyoto Protocol. However, it is highly uncertain whether the conditions currently attached to the high end of country pledges will be met. Therefore, it is more probable than not that the gap in 2020 will be at the high end of the 8\u201312 GtCO2e range. Limiting increases in global average temperature further to 1.5\u00b0 C compared to pre-industrial levels requires emissions in 2020 to be even lower, if a least-cost path towards achieving this objective is followed. Based on a limited number of new studies, least-cost emission pathways consistent with the 1.5\u00b0 C target have emission levels in 2020 of 37\u201344 GtCO2e per year, declining rapidly thereafter.

In these scenarios, global emissions in 2050 amount to 22 GtCO2e (range: 18\u201325 GtCO2e). These levels are all based on the assumption that the 2020 least-cost level of 44 GtCO2e per year will be achieved. 5. What are the implications of least-cost emission pathways that meet the 1.5\u00b0 C and 2\u00b0 C targets in 2020? The longer that decisive mitigation efforts are postponed, the higher the dependence on negative emissions in the second half of the 21st century to keep the global average temperature increase below 2\u00b0 C. The technologies required for achieving negative emissions may have significant negative environmental impacts. Scenarios consistent with the 1.5\u00b0 C and 2\u00b0 C targets share several characteristics: higher-than-current emission reduction rates throughout the century; improvements in energy efficiency and the introduction of zero- and low-carbon technologies at faster rates than have been experienced historically over extended periods; greenhouse gas emissions peaking around 2020; net negative carbon dioxide emissions from the energy and industrial sectors in the second half of the century5 and an accelerated shift toward electrification6. The technologies required for achieving negative emissions in the energy and industrial sectors have not yet been deployed on a large scale and their use may have significant impacts, notably on biodiversity and water supply. Because of this, some scenarios explore the emission reductions required to meet temperature targets without relying on negative emissions. These scenarios require maximum emissions in 2020 of 40 GtCO2e (range: 36\u201344 GtCO2e), as compared to a median of 44 GtCO2e for the complete set of least-cost scenarios. 6. What are the implications of later action scenarios that still meet the 1.5\u00b0 C and 2\u00b0 C targets? Based on a much larger number of studies than in 2012, this update concludes that so-called later-action scenarios have several implications compared to least- cost scenarios, including: (i) much higher rates of global emission reductions in the medium term; (ii) greater lock-in of carbon-intensive infrastructure; (iii) greater dependence on certain technologies in the medium-term; (iv) greater costs of mitigation in the medium- and long-term, and greater risks of economic disruption; and (v) greater risks of failing to meet the 2\u00b0 C target. For these reasons later- action scenarios may not be feasible in practice and, as a result, temperature targets could be missed. The estimates of the emissions gap in this and previous reports are based on least-cost scenarios, which characterize trends in global emissions up to 2100 under the assumption that climate targets will be met by the cheapest combination of policies, measures and technologies. But several new studies using a different type of scenario are now available \u2013 later-action scenarios, which assume that a least-cost trajectory is not followed immediately, but rather forwards from a specific future date. Like least-cost scenarios, later- action scenarios chart pathways that are consistent with the 2\u00b0 C target. Contrary to least-cost scenarios, later-action scenarios assume higher global emissions in the near term, which are compensated by deeper reductions later, typically, after 2020 or 2030. For least-cost scenarios, emission reduction rates for 2030\u20132050 consistent with a 2\u00b0 C target are 2\u20134.5 percent per year. Historically, such reductions have been achieved in a small number of individual countries, but not globally. For later-action scenarios, the corresponding emission reduction rates would have to be substantially higher, for example, 6\u20138.5 percent if emission reductions remain modest until 2030. These emission reduction rates are without historic precedent over extended periods of time. Furthermore, and because of the delay between policy implementation and actual emission reductions, achieving such high rates of change would require mitigation policies to be adopted several years before the reductions begin. Apart from assuming higher global emissions in the near term, later-action scenarios also have fewer options for reducing emissions when concerted action finally begins after 2020 or 2030.

Lastly, when action is delayed, options to achieve stringent levels of climate protection are increasingly lost. 7. Can the gap be bridged by 2020? The technical potential for reducing emissions to levels in 2020 is still estimated at about 17 \u00b1 3 GtCO2e. This is enough to close the gap between business-as-usual emission levels and levels that meet the 2\u00b0 C target, but time is running out. Sector-level studies of emission reductions reveal that, at marginal costs below US $50\u2013100 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, emissions in 2020 could be reduced by 17 \u00b1 3 GtCO2e, compared to business-as-usual levels in that same year. While this potential would, in principle, be enough to reach the least-cost target of 44 GtCO2e in 2020, there is little time left. There are many opportunities to narrow the emissions gap in 2020 as noted in following paragraphs, ranging from applying more stringent accounting practices for emission reduction pledges, to increasing the scope of pledges. To bridge the emissions gap by 2020, all options should be brought into play. 8. What are the options to bridge the emissions gap? The application of strict accounting rules for national mitigation action could narrow the gap by 1\u20132 GtCO2e. In addition, moving from unconditional to conditional pledges could narrow the gap by 2\u20133 GtCO2e, and increasing the scope of current pledges could further narrow the gap by 1.8 GtCO2e. These three steps can bring us halfway to bridging the gap.

Also important is the fact that many actions to reduce emissions can help meet other national and local development objectives such as reducing air pollution or traffic congestion, or saving household energy costs. 9. How can international cooperative initiatives contribute to narrowing the gap? There is an increasing number of international cooperative initiatives, through which groups of countries and/or other entities cooperate to promote technologies and policies that have climate benefits, even though climate change mitigation may not be the primary goal of the initiative. These efforts have the potential to help bridge the gap by several GtCO2e in 2020. International cooperative initiatives take the form of either global dialogues (to exchange information and understand national priorities), formal multi-lateral processes (addressing issues that are relevant to the reduction of GHG emissions), or implementation initiatives (often structured around technical dialogue fora or sector-specific implementation projects). Some make a direct contribution to climate change mitigation, by effectively helping countries reduce emissions, while others contribute to this goal indirectly, for example through consensus building efforts or the sharing of good practices among members. The most important areas for international cooperative initiatives appear to be: -\ufffd Energy efficiency (up to 2 GtCO2e by 2020): covered by a substantial number of initiatives. -\ufffd Fossil fuel subsidy reform (0.4\u20132 GtCO2e by 2020): the number of initiatives and clear commitments in this area is limited. -\ufffd Methane and other short-lived climate pollutants (0.6\u20131.1 GtCO2e by 2020); this area is covered by one overarching and several specific initiatives. (Reductions here may occur as a side effect of other climate mitigation.) -\ufffd Renewable energy (1\u20133 GtCO2e by 2020): several initiatives have been started in this area. Based on limited evidence, the following provisions could arguably enhance the effectiveness of International Cooperative Initiatives: (i) a clearly defined vision and mandate with clearly articulated goals; (ii) the right mix of participants appropriate for that mandate, going beyond traditional climate negotiators; (iii) stronger participation from developing country actors; (iv) sufficient funding and an institutional structure that supports implementation and follow-up, but maintains flexibility; and (v) and incentives for participants. 10. How can national agricultural policies promote development while substantially reducing emissions? Agriculture now contributes about 11 percent to global greenhouse gas emissions. The estimated emission reduction potential for the sector ranges from 1.1 GtCO2e to 4.3 GtCO2e in 2020. Emission reductions achieved by these initiatives may partly overlap with national pledges, but in some cases may also be additional to these. Not many countries have specified action in the agriculture sector as part of implementing their pledges. Yet, estimates of emission reduction potentials for the sector are high, ranging from 1.1 GtCO2e to 4.3 GtCO2e \u2013 a wide range, reflecting uncertainties in the estimate.

Among the important provisions of the accord was the call to parties to submit voluntary emission reduction pledges for the year 2020. To date, 42 developed countries have responded to this call and submitted economy-wide greenhouse gas emission reduction pledges, 16 developing countries have submitted multi-sector expected emission reductions, and in addition 39 other developing countries have submitted pledges related to sectoral goals2. Another important provision was the setting of a target to keep the increase in global average temperature below 2\u00b0C relative to pre- industrial levels. In the wake of these two provisions, some very critical questions arose: -\ufffd Are the pledges for 2020 enough to keep the world on track to meet the 2\u00b0 C target? -\ufffd Will there be a gap between where we need to be in 2020 versus where we expect to be? UNEP, together with the scientific community, took on these questions in a report published just ahead of the Climate Convention meeting in Canc\u00fan in late 2010 (UNEP, 2010). This \u201cemissions gap\u201d report synthesized the latest scientific knowledge about the possible gap between the global emissions levels in 2020 consistent with the 2\u00b0 C target versus the expected levels if countries fulfil their emission reduction pledges. Many parties to the Climate Convention found this analysis useful as a reference point for establishing the level of ambition that countries needed to pursue in controlling their greenhouse gas emissions. As a result they asked UNEP to produce annual follow-ups, with updates of the gap and advice on how to close it. Besides updating the estimates of the emissions gap, the 2011 report also looked at feasible ways of bridging the gap from two perspectives (UNEP, 2011). The first was from the top-down viewpoint of integrated models, which showed that feasible transformations in the energy system and other sectors would lower global emissions enough to meet the 2\u00b0 C target. The second was a bottom-up perspective, which examined the emissions reduction potential in each of the main emissions-producing sectors of the economy. These bottom-up estimates showed that enough total potential exists to bridge the emissions gap in 2020. The 2012 report presented an update of the gap but also good examples of best-practice policy instruments for reducing emissions. Among these were actions such as implementing appliance standards and vehicle fuel- efficiency guidelines, which are working successfully in many parts of the world and are ready for application elsewhere to help reduce emissions. The current report reviews the latest estimates of the emissions gap in 2020 and provides plentiful additional information relevant to the climate negotiations. Included are the latest estimates of: -\ufffd the current level of global greenhouse gas emissions based on authoritative sources; -\ufffd national emission levels, both current (2010) and projected (2020), consistent with current pledges and other commitments; -\ufffd global emission levels consistent with the 2\u00b0 C target in 2020, 2030 and 2050; -\ufffd progress being made in different parts of the world to achieve substantial emission reductions. New to this fourth report is an assessment of the extent to which countries are on track to meet their national pledges. Also new is a description of the many cooperative climate initiatives being undertaken internationally among many different actors \u2013 public, private, and from civil society. Special attention is given to analysing new scenarios that assume later action for mitigation, compared to those used earlier to compute the emissions gap. The report also describes new findings from scientific literature about the impacts of later action to reduce global emissions. This year the report reviews best practices in reducing emissions in an often-overlooked emissions-producing sector \u2013 agriculture. Innovative ideas are described for transforming agriculture into a more sustainable, low- emissions form. As in previous years, this report has been prepared by a wide range of scientists from around the world. This year ____________________ 1 Since then, the number of parties agreeing to the Accord has risen to 141 (see https://unfccc.int/meetings/copenhagen_dec_2009/items/5262.php). 2 With the 28 member states of the European Union counted as one party. 2 The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Introduction 2 70 scientists from 44 scientific groups in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf92ef78-1c28-4902-8386-0f372683cc98": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf92ef78-1c28-4902-8386-0f372683cc98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a05eb69787e19c9df87e895253eb8b79b4e6d883383fca0a5a04757510f207e7"}}, "hash": "a05eb69787e19c9df87e895253eb8b79b4e6d883383fca0a5a04757510f207e7", "text": "17 countries have contributed to the assessment.

UNEP hopes that this fourth update will help catalyse action in the forthcoming climate negotiations. Box 1.1 From emissions gap to adaptation gap This report\u2019s definition of the emissions gap is based on the internationally agreed limit to the increase in global average temperature of 2\u00b0 C (or possibly 1.5\u00b0C). Chapter 3 summarizes the latest scientific findings regarding both least-cost and later-action scenarios for meeting that 1.5 or 2\u00b0 C target. The chapter concludes that, with later-action scenarios, the cost and risk of not meeting the target increases significantly, compared to least-cost scenarios. The 2\u00b0 C target has become associated with what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) termed \u201cdangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\u201d, even though the IPCC has thus far never attached a specific temperature threshold to the concept. Nevertheless, the IPCC has characterised \u201cdangerous anthropogenic interference\u201d through five \u201creasons for concern\u201d, namely risk to unique and threatened systems, risk of extreme weather events, disparities of impacts and vulnerabilities, aggregate damage and risks of large- scale discontinuities. These reasons for concern would thus gain particular relevance in the event that the world followed a later-action scenario emissions trajectory that in the end failed to meet the 1.5 or 2\u00b0 C target. Today, when the choice between least-cost and later-action scenarios is still available to us, later-action scenarios highlight a growing adaptation problem which, by analogy with the emissions gap, could be termed an adaptation gap. The adaptation gap is more of a challenge to assess than the emissions gap. Whereas carbon dioxide and its equivalents provide a common metric for quantifying the emissions gap, we lack a comparable metric for quantifying the adaptation gap and assessing the impacts of efforts to close it. While the emissions gap indicates the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions that need to be abated, the adaptation gap could measure vulnerabilities which need to be reduced but are not accounted for in any funded programme for reducing adaptation risks. Alternatively, it could estimate the gap between the level of funding needed for adaptation and the level of funding actually committed to the task. Developing countries needs for adaptation are believed to cost in the range of US $100 billion per year (UNFCCC, 2007; World Bank, 2010). By comparison the funds made available by the major multilateral funding mechanisms that generate and disperse adaptation finance add up to a total of around US $3.9 billion to date. From a funding perspective therefore, the adaptation gap is significant3. The concept of the adaptation gap is in line with the IPCC\u2019s Working Group II\u2019s use of the term adaptation deficit, which is used to describe the deficit between the current state of a country or management system and a state that would minimize the adverse impacts of current climate conditions. Framing the adaptation gap in a way useful for policy making also requires a better understanding of how the costs of adaptation vary with different temperature projections. Data on the costs of adaptation under business- as-usual, and best- and worst-case emission scenarios could help policy makers better understand the relationship between adaptation to, and mitigation of climate change. Adaptation cost estimates also put the true costs of climate change, as opposed to only looking at the costs of mitigating it, into a broader and clearer perspective. There is also a knowledge gap between what we know and what we need to know to successfully adapt to climate change. It is true that we already have enough knowledge to act on adaptation, but not enough to act well. For example, we lack information about how much existing and planned policies can reduce people\u2019s vulnerability. Evaluating the effectiveness of various interventions would arguably be a very effective way of measuring progress towards adaptation. ____________________ 3 The US $3.9 billion figure is a rough estimate based on information from the following major multilateral funding mechanisms for adaptation: an equivalent of US $399 million has been committed by the EU\u2019s Global Climate Change Alliance from 2008 to 2013 (GCCA, 2013).

The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Emissions trends, pledges and their implementation 3 Emission trends, pledges and their implementation Chapter 2 2.1 Introduction This chapter presents an update, based on the scientific literature, of the following critical topics: -\ufffd current (2010 global) emissions of greenhouse gases; -\ufffd projected emissions (to 2020) of greenhouse gases under a business-as-usual (BaU) scenario; -\ufffd projections (to 2020) of greenhouse gas emissions under four different sets of assumptions regarding implementation of national pledges to reduce emissions; -\ufffd the extent to which parties are positioned to implement their pledges, in light of their current policy portfolios and plausible assumptions regarding macroeconomic trends and offsets. The estimated emission level in 2020 under a business-as- usual scenario is 1 gigatonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) higher compared to last year\u2019s emissions gap report1. While the emission levels in 2020 for the strict-rules cases are higher by roughly 1 GtCO2e (unconditional) and are comparable to last year\u2019s emission level (conditional), the emission levels associated with the two lenient-rules cases are lower by roughly 1 GtCO2e, as compared to last year\u2019s estimates. These changes are mainly due to decisions on surpluses made by countries during the Doha climate negotiations and downward revisions to the assumptions on double counting of offsets. They illustrate that increasing stringency through the climate negotiations can help reduce emission levels in 2020 under lenient-rules cases. However, they do not reflect an increase in ambition or action, but represent a move towards stricter accounting rules. To illustrate, in last year\u2019s emissions gap report, emission levels associated with the strict-rules cases were 3 GtCO2e lower than those of the lenient-rules cases, whereas this year they are lower by around 1 GtCO2e (unconditional) and 2 GtCO2e (conditional). While previous reports assumed full pledge implementation, this year we also explore the extent to which 13 parties, accounting for 72 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, are already on track to implement their pledges, and where further policy implementation or offsets are likely to be required. 2.2 Current global emissions Last year\u2019s report estimated total global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 at 50.1 GtCO2e, with a 95 percent uncertainty range of 45.6\u201354.6 GtCO2e2. This bottom-up estimate from the EDGAR database (JRC/PBL, 2012) has not been updated since and is considered a comprehensive assessment of global greenhouse gas emissions in 20103. Figure 2.1 shows emission levels by major economic grouping for the period 1970\u20132010, using this database4. These may differ from data derived from the National Inventory Reports, which are the latest estimate of emissions for most developed countries. The latest global estimates of energy- related carbon dioxide emissions show a continued increase for the years 2011 and 2012, although at a lower pace than the average since the beginning of the 21st century (Olivier et al., 2013)5.

The graph shows emissions of 50.1 GtCO2e in 2010, as derived from bottom-up emission inventories. Source: EDGAR 4.2 FT2010 (JRC/PBL, 2012. Percentages refer to shares in global emissions in 2010. While the last decade of the 20th century saw little change in the relative regional contributions to annual global greenhouse gas emissions, this changed drastically during the first decade of the 21st century. Between 2000 and 2010, the developed country share decreased from 51.8 percent to 40.9 percent, whereas developing country emissions increased from 48.2 percent to 59.1 percent (JRC/ PBL, 2012). Referring to Figure 2.1, between 2000 and 2010 the share of global emissions of the non-OECD G20 countries (i.e. Argentina, China, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia and South Africa) increased by 8.7 percent, while the share of all OECD countries and other industrialized countries declined by 9.0 percent, and the share of the remaining developing countries changed little. Today developing and developed countries are responsible for roughly equal shares of cumulative greenhouse gas emissions for the period 1850-2010 (den Elzen et al., 2013b). Greenhouse gas emission estimates are uncertain due to differences in definitions and in the accounting of national emissions. To produce a statistically significant assessment of the uncertainty associated with those emission estimates, a large number of independent but consistent datasets is required, which at present is not the case (Appendix 2.A). It is nonetheless clear that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions have the lowest uncertainty (UNEP, 2012a), while land use and land-use change emissions of different greenhouse gases have the highest. 2.3 Projected global emissions under business-as-usual scenarios Business-as-usual scenarios of future developments are generally based on an extrapolation of current economic, social and technological trends. They usually reflect policies that have taken effect as of a recent cut-off date, for example, 20108. However, in some cases they may include policies that, while approved, will only enter into force at a future date (DEA/OECD/URC, 2013). Business-as-usual scenarios of greenhouse gases are benchmarks against which the effectiveness of mitigation policies and measures can be tested. They are also used in this report to assess the extent to which parties\u2019 pledges can meet the 2o C or 1.5o C targets. Business-as-usual emissions for 2020 were derived from estimates by 12 modelling groups that analyzed the reduction proposals of parties, as described in Section 2.4 9. Most of the modelling groups followed the same approach with regards to the types of policies included in the BaU scenario \u2013 they did not include new policies with a potential effect on greenhouse gas emissions beyond those in effect at the cut-off date10. Some of the modelling groups used the BaU scenarios that the parties provided. Based on the analysis by these 12 modelling groups, global greenhouse gas emissions for 2020 are estimated at 59 GtCO2e (range 56\u201360 GtCO2e) in 2020 under BaU assumptions, which is about 1 GtCO2e higher than the figure in the 2012 emissions gap report11. Two key factors explain ____________________ 8 BaU scenarios typically vary with regard to which policies they take into account for a variety of reasons, including: the cut-off year for their inclusion; whether policies have to be planned, adopted, and/or implemented if they are to be included; methodologies for quantifying the effect of included policies; and the determination of whether a policy will have a significant effect that warrants inclusion. 9 See Table B.1 in Appendix 2.B for a listing of the modelling groups. 10 The cut-off date for exclusion of policies varies among the modelling groups. 11 Unless stated otherwise, all ranges in the report are expressed as 20th\u201380th percentiles.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b13e9e58-70be-4a7a-91e4-94dfe1121004": {"__data__": {"id_": "b13e9e58-70be-4a7a-91e4-94dfe1121004", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "628b5ba3077b26194a3987e8075ef04ea3c0a0fefc569e27d9525e3d0b54ce67"}, "2": {"node_id": "aeec3bfa-a183-4ead-b803-6267ceb534c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5307a1c1619c5c7a04cb1e7ce755623f9b272eb130140776e7a1f2020f37c0b6"}}, "hash": "a70be5c3719ea2067f83b8c54a269ce024e67d0ff760d1b9b85cf0ae03cbad95", "text": "1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 GtCO\u2082e Bunkers Least developed countries Other developing countries OECD Latin America OECD Europe OECD North America Non-OECD G20 members Other industrialized countries OECD Paci\ufb01c 60 2.2% 4.7% 16.3% 42.5% 2.1% 5.2% 1.5% 11.0% 14.5% 50 40 30 20 10 0 Years The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Emissions trends, pledges and their implementation 5 this increase: using the BaU numbers from China\u2019s second national communication to UNFCCC (Government of China, 2012), and moving the base year from 2005 to 2010 in more model studies12.

The BaU scenarios with which we compared our estimates (24 scenarios, developed by 12 different models) give a median of 58 GtCO2e, with a range of 55\u201360 GtCO2e. In spite of the different lower bound, this median, 58 GtCO2e, is consistent with that obtained by the modelling groups contributing to this report. 2.4 Projected global emissions under pledge assumptions Under the 2010 Canc\u00fan Agreements of the Climate Convention, 42 developed-country parties have submitted quantified economy-wide emission reduction proposals for 2020. Since November 2012, when the last emissions gap report was released, only New Zealand has significantly changed its pledge14. Some countries, notably Mexico, have changed underlying assumptions that effectively change their pledge15. At the latest Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Climate Convention, held in in Doha in late 2012, parties agreed on a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. This period will run from 2013 to 2020 and provides for quantified emission reduction targets for the following Annex I parties: Australia, Belarus, the European Union and its member states, Kazakhstan, Monaco, Norway, Switzerland and Ukraine. No binding emission reduction targets were set for any other Climate Convention parties, neither Annex-I nor non-Annex I. To date 55 developing country parties and the African group have submitted nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) to Climate Convention (UNFCCC, 2013). Of these, 16 have been framed in terms of multi-sector expected greenhouse gas emission reductions16. The remaining 39 are expressed as sectoral goals or, in fewer instances, specific mitigation projects. In this assessment only the former 16 are considered17. Together, the 42 developed country parties with reduction targets and the 16 developing country parties accounted for about 75 percent of global emissions in 2010. ____________________ 12 This resulted in higher emission levels, as economic activity \u2013 and thus emission levels \u2013 was higher in the period 2005\u20132010, compared to the previous base year. 13 The estimates in this report do not include new policies affecting greenhouse gas emissions after the cut-off year. 14 In August 2013, New Zealand announced a single 5 percent reduction target with respect to its 1990 emission levels, replacing its initial 10\u201320 percent target. 15 The Mexican government recently updated the country\u2019s BaU scenario for 2020. This updated scenario leads to 960 MtCO2e emissions, which is above the previous BaU estimate, and also affects the 2020 emissions resulting from the pledge (see Box 2.1). ____________________ 16 China and India have expressed their mitigation goals in terms of emission reductions per unit of GDP; Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and the Republic of Korea, in terms of deviations below their respective BaU emission scenarios; Antigua and Barbuda, Marshall Islands and Republic of Moldova, in terms of absolute greenhouse gas emission reductions; and Costa Rica and the Maldives, in terms of a carbon neutrality goal. The reader is referred to Appendix 2.C for additional details on these goals. 17 Quantifying the emission reductions resulting from these 39 actions is difficult. For this reason, this assessment assumes no reductions below BaU emission scenarios for these countries. This might be a conservative assumption. 18 For example, in November 2012, as a part of the country\u2019s second national communication to the Climate Convention, the Chinese government released national BaU and mitigation scenarios for the first time (Government of China, 2012). The BaU scenario excludes all climate-related policies implemented since 2005, which leads to energy-related carbon dioxide emissions of 14.4 GtCO2 in 2020. The mitigation scenario reflects both domestic policies and the country\u2019s international emission-intensity target and results in emissions levels of 4.5 GtCO2 below BaU levels. Similarly, the Mexican government recently updated the country\u2019s BaU scenario for 2020.

Most national BaU scenarios from non-Annex I parties are relatively high compared to the range in the corresponding scenario by 12 modelling studies.

Crucially, some developing countries are increasingly clarifying those assumptions and the methods used to calculate the baseline18.

Department of Environmental Affairs, 2011); Korea, Republic of (Republic of Korea, 2011). Note that the national BaUs for South Africa and India were reported as a range. For the figures, the mid-point has been used. Some pledges are unconditional, whereas others have been made conditional on the ability of a national legislature to enact necessary laws, the action of other countries, or the provision of financial or technical support. We refer to these pledges as, respectively, unconditional and conditional. Some countries have submitted one of each type, whereas others have submitted only a conditional or only an unconditional pledge. This creates a range of possible collective impacts from the pledges, bounded on the low end if only unconditional pledges are implemented, and on the high end if all conditional pledges are implemented. Emission levels in 2020 resulting from implementation of the pledges also depend on the rules used to account for both land use and land-use change credits and debits, and surplus emission units. These concepts are introduced in the following sections, followed by a quantification of the emission reductions resulting from different combinations of pledge cases. 2.4.1 Use of land use, land-use change and forestry credits and debits Under the Kyoto Protocol, Annex I parties may receive credits or debits from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities dependent on a set of complex accounting rules that contribute to the achievement of their individual emission reduction targets. During the seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the Climate Convention, held in Durban in late 2011, new LULUCF accounting rules for countries participating in the second commitment period (CP2) of the Kyoto Protocol were agreed (UNFCCC, 2012a). The potential contribution of LULUCF accounting under these new rules appears to be relatively modest for Annex I parties that joined the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (Grassi et al., 2012): a difference of up to about 2 percent of 1990 emissions between strict and lenient accounting, equal to about 0.3 GtCO2e per year. If the USA, which did not join the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, followed these rules, the number would increase to 0.45 GtCO2e per year20.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19378998-b8ff-4a8f-bda9-db77f7630e3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "19378998-b8ff-4a8f-bda9-db77f7630e3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "566e843b131a864be9fd4091f916df35a3056f95e132dbfbccbfcf4bd200a4ce"}, "2": {"node_id": "8299f0cb-504b-453a-8a82-43e38e55d254", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "08e9e1e035fe2e458e87abd4a777fa1545049761393a3e378a3fe68cc36c4155"}}, "hash": "0a5d70de3a4ca108bb62265aac1af595dfe1ba17dba3d40697e9a31930adfc3d", "text": "While these estimates ____________________ 20 For the USA, the estimated potential contribution from LULUCF credits is about 0.15 GtCO2e per year.

However, it is unclear if this statement is fully binding. Purchase of units was not excluded by the European Union, but is highly unlikely to happen, as the European Union holds the largest share of surplus units. 24 In their respective pledges, the governments of Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus proposed target emission levels above that 2008-2010 emissions average. Further details are available in Chen et al. (2013) and Kollmuss (2013). ____________________ 25 Calculations assume as a starting point the initial assigned amounts of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The uncertainty ranges come from the future decisions of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. If these countries stay in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and lower their commitments to their 2008-2010 emission levels, they can make use of surplus emissions. 26 At least in theory, emission reductions could also be shared, with a certain percentage attributed to the buyer and the seller retaining the remainder. are generally consistent with the information contained in UNFCCC (2012c), they may underestimate emissions from those countries that may adopt different accounting rules from those of the Kyoto Protocol, for example, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Russia21. 2.4.2 Surplus emissions units Estimates of emission levels in 2020 can also be influenced by the potential use of surplus emission units. These surplus units could arise either when parties\u2019 actual emissions are below their emission targets for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, or when their emissions in 2020 are below their target for that year, when this does not require significant emission reductions. Note that surplus emission units refers to surpluses arising from different types of allowances \u2013 assigned amount units, emission reduction units and certified emission reductions \u2013 all introduced in the next paragraphs. The 2012 emissions gap report estimated the maximum emission reduction in 2020 due to surplus credits at 1.8 GtCO2e22. However, as a result of the rules for using such surplus allowances agreed to in Doha, these estimates need to be revised (UNFCCC, 2012b; Kollmuss, 2013). The parties agreed that allowances, referred to as \u2018assigned amount units\u2019 (AAUs), not used in the first commitment period can be carried over to the next period. However, recent decisions on surplus emission units significantly limit the use of such surplus allowances and prevent the build-up of new ones. Only parties participating in the second commitment period can sell their surplus assigned amount units. This will exclude Russia, which is the largest holder of surplus assigned amount units, but which will not participate in the second commitment period. Buyer countries can only purchase surplus assigned amount units up to a quantity of 2 percent of their own initial assigned amount for the first commitment period. In addition, Australia, Japan, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway and Switzerland have said that they will not purchase units from others, while the European Union has declared that they will not use any surplus emissions units (UNFCCC, 2012b)23. Finally, new surplus allowances are prevented by the fact that allowances that exceed the parties\u2019 average emission levels in the period 2008\u20132010 will be cancelled. This rule affects Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine24. These decisions reduce the impact of surplus emissions in 2020.

The impact of surplus emissions could also be zero if the European Union decides not to use any of its Kyoto surplus emissions for complying with its 30 percent conditional target. In addition to the assigned amount units, two of the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s flexible mechanisms, the Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism, provide credits that parties can use in the form of emission reduction units (ERUs) in the case of Joint Implementation, and certified emission reductions (CERs) in the case of the Clean Development Mechanism. These credits can be carried over to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The 2012 Conference of the Parties to the Climate Convention did not change the rules for these credits: certified emission reductions and emission reduction units can each be carried over up to 2.5 percent of the initial assigned amount of the first commitment period. There are no restrictions on their use. Those units add to a total impact of 0.2 GtCO2e in 2020. 2.4.3 The potential impact of offsets Offsets could affect the emissions levels associated with the pledges in two ways. First, double counting of offsets could arise where emission reductions in developing countries achieved through offsets, such as certified emission reductions, are counted towards meeting the pledges of both countries. Second, some of the offsets may actually not achieve the intended, additional emission reductions. It is clear that emission reductions associated with \u2018emission reduction units\u2019 and \u2018certified emission reductions\u2019 or with the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s third flexible mechanism \u2013 emissions trading, should not be double counted26. Nevertheless, rules for avoiding double counting have not been agreed to. A rough estimate of the impact of double counting is as follows. If all parties\u2019 offsets were counted twice \u2013 a likely overestimate of double counting \u2013 global emissions would be 0.40 GtCO2e higher in the case of conditional pledges, and 0.55 GtCO2e higher in the case of unconditional pledges. In the 2012 emissions gap report (UNEP, 2012a) double The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Emissions trends, pledges and their implementation 8 counting was estimated at 1.5 GtCO2e, which is now believed to be an overly high value27. In addition to double counting, there is a risk that more offset credits could be generated than emissions actually reduced. Stated differently: project activities need to be additional to the development expected without the project28. Although estimates are fraught with uncertainty, available evidence suggests that a significant amount of emission reductions in Clean Development Mechanism projects are not additional in this sense (Haya, 2009). Assuming this share to be 25 percent by 2020, it is estimated that offsets of up to 0.1 GtCO2e for conditional pledges and 0.15 GtCO2e for unconditional pledges could be non- additional. This would raise the total estimate of the impact of offsets to about 0.5\u20130.7 GtCO2e. 2.4.4 Four cases of expected emissions in 2020 The findings from 12 modelling groups have been brought together to estimate expected emission levels in 2020, taking into account emission reduction proposals by parties to the Climate Convention. For more information on the contributing modelling groups, see Table B.1 in Appendix 2.B. Of the seven modelling groups that participated in the 2012 emissions gap report, most have updated their analyses29, and five new modelling groups contributed to this year\u2019s update30. In line with the 2012 report (UNEP, 2012a), the current update is structured around four emission scenarios in 2020, based on whether pledges are conditional or unconditional, and on whether accounting rules are strict or lenient (Figure 2.3). Under strict rules the allowances from LULUCF accounting, offset double counting, and surplus emission credits cannot be counted towards the emission reduction pledges. Under lenient rules this is permitted. The results for each of the four scenarios are given below.

Two exceptions are made, however. First, no offset use for the USA and Canada is assumed, because their respective governments have indicated that they will only make very limited use of offset credits (UNFCCC, 2012c). Second, regarding the European Union\u2019s unconditional pledge, the rules in the European Union\u2019s energy and climate package are assumed to have been implemented. 28 A criterion sometimes applied to projects aiming at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It stipulates that the emission reductions accomplished by the project would not have happened anyway if the project had not taken place. 29 More specifically, (i) Climate Action Tracker by Ecofys, Climate Analytics and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, PIK, www.climateactiontracker. org (Climate Action Tracker, 2010); (ii) Climate Interactive (C-ROADS) (Sterman et al., 2012); (iii) Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM) (Tavoni et al., 2013); (iv) Grantham Research Institute, London School of Economics (updated based on Stern and Taylor, 2010); (v) OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050 (OECD, 2012); (vi) PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (den Elzen et al., 2013a; Hof et al., 2013) and (vii) UNEP Risoe Centre (UNEP, 2012b). 30 The five new modelling groups are: Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN), International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). Additional information on the participants in the project (dubbed LIMITS) is given in Appendix 2.B. Kriegler et al. (2013) summarises some of the project\u2019s findings. Case 1 \u2013 Unconditional pledges, lenient rules Parties implement their lower-ambition pledges and are subject to lenient accounting rules: the median estimate of annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 is 56 GtCO2e, within a range of 54\u201356 GtCO2e. Case 2 \u2013 Unconditional pledges, strict rules Parties implement their lower-ambition pledges, but are subject to strict accounting rules: the median estimate of annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 is 55 GtCO2e, within a range of 53\u201355 GtCO2e. Case 3 \u2013 Conditional pledges, lenient rules Some parties offered to be more ambitious with their pledges, provided some conditions were met. If the more ambitious conditional pledges are implemented, and accounting rules are lenient, the median estimate of annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 is 54 GtCO2e, within a range of 52\u201354 GtCO2e. Case 4 \u2013 Conditional pledges, strict rules Parties implement higher-ambition pledges and are subject to strict accounting rules: the median estimate of annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 is 52 GtCO2e, within a range of 50\u201352 GtCO2e. Compared to the 2012 update (UNEP, 2012a), emission levels in 2020 corresponding to the two cases for which strict rules apply are higher by around 1 GtCO2e under unconditional pledges and comparable with the corresponding estimate in the 2012 update for conditional pledges. The remaining two cases, those in which lenient rules apply, have median emissions that are around 1 GtCO2e lower compared to the 2012 update. The latter is due to the lower impact of both double counting and surplus assigned amount units due to the Doha decisions and does not reflect an increase in ambition or action, but represent a move towards stricter accounting rules. To illustrate, in last year\u2019s emissions gap report, emission levels associated with the strict-rules cases were 3 GtCO2e lower than those of the lenient-rules cases, whereas this year they are lower by around 1 GtCO2e (unconditional) and 2 GtCO2e (conditional). Including five additional modelling groups has increased the robustness of the analysis. Despite the inclusion of these five new studies, the overall conclusions have not changed. 2.4.5 Pledged reduction effort by Annex I and non-Annex I countries For Annex I parties, total emissions as a group of countries for the four pledge cases are estimated to be 3\u201316 percent below 1990 levels in 2020.

Source: See Appendix 2.B 2.5 National progress: do policies match pledges? Section 2.4 examined four scenarios for national and global greenhouse gas emissions assuming that parties\u2019 pledges would be fully implemented \u2013 that is, assuming that, in 2020, parties will emit the amount indicated by their pledges. As 2020 approaches, however, the time is ripe to take stock of the extent to which parties are, in fact, on track to achieve their pledges. This section considers the likely impact of current domestic policies, describing parties\u2019 climate-policy portfolios and examining the extent to which these policies, in combination with other factors, have put parties on track to meeting their pledges. The section focuses on the 13 parties whose economies are amongst the 20 largest in the world and who have formulated a quantitative pledge31. It is important to note that the 13 parties\u2019 pledges varied in terms of the extent to which they required deviation from various BaU estimates, as discussed in Appendix 2.D. The larger the deviation, the more difficult it is to achieve the pledge and the more important the role of additional policies becomes. In order to assess whether parties\u2019 expected greenhouse gas trajectories are in line with 2020 pledges, projected 2020 emission scenarios that take into account currently adopted policies (current trajectory for 2020) were compared to the 2020 emission levels needed to achieve each pledge through domestic abatement (pledge threshold for 2020)32. ____________________ 31 These parties account for 72 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. They are: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Russian Federation, South Africa, the Republic of Korea and the USA. ____________________ 32 We consider offsets only when a country has explicitly stated its intent to purchase a specific quantity of offsets. 33 This contrasts with the BaU ranges presented in earlier sections of this report, which include estimates that do not factor in these effects. To establish the current trajectory for 2020, we identified emission scenarios that factor in the effects of currently adopted policies33. We based this trajectory on official estimates presented in national communications to the Climate Convention and other government sources, and corroborated these estimates with other available literature (Table 2.1), adjusting where necessary to ensure consistency with official figures, for example, in the treatment of LULUCF. An official trajectory was not available for the Republic of Korea. To establish the pledge threshold, we sought to identify the maximum level of 2020 emissions that each party would consider to be consistent with meeting its pledge through domestic abatement. Where a pledge is presented as a range, we adopted the higher quantity of resulting emissions as the pledge threshold \u2013 for example, if a country states it will reduce its emissions by 5\u201310 percent, our pledge threshold represents the 5 percent reduction. Note, if 10 percent were used, countries would have lower expected emissions in 2020. For each of the 13 parties examined, Table 2.1 below presents both official and independent estimates of emission levels in 2020. Five parties \u2013 Australia, China, the European Union, India and Russia \u2013 appear to be on track to meet their pledges under the policies they have adopted to date, given current assumptions about macroeconomic and technology trends and offsets. Of these, three \u2013 China, India 1990 2005 2010 2020 BAU 2020 Unconditional Lenient rules 2020 Unconditional Strict rules 2020 Conditional Lenient rules 2020 Conditional Strict rules GtCO\u2082e Global emissions, harmonized, including LULUCF emissions CAT OECD CROADS FEEM Grantham PBL PNNL PIK IIASA NIES ECN 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 Median UNEP Ris\u00f8 The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Emissions trends, pledges and their implementation 10 countries with a greenhouse gas pledge37 action but this could not be verified based on government estimates. However, new actions now being taken by all five of these parties may enable them to meet their pledges, although the impact of these actions have not been analyzed here. Examples of new actions include Mexico which has recently adopted comprehensive climate-change legislation, and is in the process of developing its second special programme on climate change (NCCS, 2013)36.

The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Emissions trends, pledges and their implementation 12 The Republic of Korea is about to implement an emissions-trading scheme and is defining other elements of its Framework Act on Low Carbon38. The USA presented a Climate Action Plan in June 2013 (Executive Office of the President, 2013), and analysis has shown that it is possible for the USA to deliver on its pledge if the administration makes full use of available legal instruments (Bianco et al. 2013), many of which are referenced in the Climate Action Plan. A 2012 study concluded that Canada\u2019s 2020 goal was still achievable if Canada were to implement specific additional policies, though it would become more costly and difficult to achieve the longer further action was delayed (NRTEE 2012). Japan is currently in the process of reviewing both its pledge and its policy portfolio in light of the Fukushima nuclear incident and a recent government transition (GWPH, 2013). While the three remaining countries, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa, have all made significant progress on monitoring and reporting in recent years, for a variety of reasons insufficient information is currently available to determine whether they are on track to achieve their pledges. These countries\u2019 governments have not published estimates of their 2020 emissions that consider only currently adopted policies, and independent assessments (Roelfsema et al., 2013) present a wide range of possible trajectories. Indeed, some of these countries\u2019 climate policies are rapidly evolving, making it difficult to develop meaningful estimates of future emissions \u2013 South Africa, for example, is considering a carbon tax and a range of additional measures. Emission trajectories for Brazil and Indonesia are subject to considerable uncertainty related to land-use emissions (Roelfsema et al., 2013). As policies continue to evolve, the forthcoming Biennial Reports and Biennial Update Reports of 2014 to the Climate Convention can serve as one option for parties to take stock of, and quantify, their progress, and to communicate this internationally. 2.6 Summary If country pledges are implemented, expected emission levels in 2020 will range from 52 to 56 GtCO2e, depending on how pledges are implemented \u2013 for reference, the BaU level is 59 GtCO2e. The factors affecting implementation are whether the pledges are conditional or unconditional, and whether the accounting rules applied are lenient or strict. According to best estimates presented in this chapter, global greenhouse gas emissions are expected to continue to increase.

It is noteworthy that the decisions on surplus assigned amount units in Doha have lowered the emission levels under the lenient rule cases by 1 GtCO2e. For these figures to hold true, parties must also deliver on their pledges, which in some cases may require additional policies or purchased offsets. Five of the 13 major parties are well positioned to achieve their pledges using policies they have already adopted, enhancing confidence in the pledge scenarios outlined in the previous section. Of the five parties that may not yet be so positioned, all are within striking distance of achieving their pledges in 2020. Three, in particular, have taken significant steps to enhance their policy portfolios, which could lead to the ambitious policies needed to meet their pledges. It should be noted that some parties have defined their pledges at a higher level of emissions than those used to calculate the size of the gap in this report. Moreover, even those parties that have adopted ambitious policies may find it difficult to meet their pledges, owing to political circumstances, implementation shortcomings, and potentially adverse macroeconomic trends. Therefore, it will be important to monitor and, where possible, take steps to mitigate these risk factors. Finally, serious information gaps preclude a comprehensive assessment of several countries\u2019 emission trajectories under current policies. Given the disconnect that can occur between country pledges and the policies that support them, it is imperative to address this information gap in order to fully understand the magnitude of the gap between countries\u2019 policy portfolios and the 2o C target. ____________________ 38 No official government estimate is available that concludes that the Republic of Korea is not on track to meet its pledge. However, since independent estimates point towards emission levels that are largely inconsistent with those required to meet the pledge, and given that the government of the Republic of Korea is currently developing new, aggressive policies including an emissions trading scheme, it is likely that the country is indeed not yet on track to meet its pledge through current policies. The new policies being developed may reverse this situation. The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 The emissions gap and its implications 13 The emissions gap and its implications Chapter 3 3.1 Introduction Countries have pledged to reduce or limit their greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and at the same time have agreed to limit the increase in global mean temperature to 1.5\u00b0 C or 2\u00b0 C compared to pre-industrial levels. These two important commitments raise some critical questions: -\ufffd Does the combined effect of these pledges put the world on a path towards limiting warming to below 1.5\u00b0 C or 2\u00b0 C with a high chance of success? -\ufffd Is there an emissions gap between where the pledges lead and where pathways indicate emissions should ideally be? -\ufffd What are the implications and trade-offs of such a possible emissions gap for the achievability of the 1.5\u00b0 C and 2\u00b0 C targets and their associated mitigation challenges? Earlier emissions gap reports have set out to answer these questions by combining the assessment of where emissions are heading (Chapter 2) with an assessment of emission scenarios that could limit warming to below 1.5\u00b0 C or 2\u00b0 C (see Appendix 3.A for background). The assessment is updated here, as it has been annually since 2010 (UNEP, 2010; 2011; 2012). UNEP\u2019s 2012 report mentioned a new class of scenario, termed later-action scenarios, that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0 C or 2\u00b0 C. The special aspect of these is that they allow the achievement of climate targets even though global emissions in the near term, up to 2020, are higher than in scenarios based on immediate action. In this 2013 report we take advantage of the many new articles that have been published on later-action scenarios and examine their implications and their assumptions much more closely (Sections 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6). 3.2 Which scenarios are analyzed? The scientific literature contains many different emission scenarios computed by integrated assessment models that limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0 C or 2\u00b0 C above pre- industrial levels (Appendix 3.B). The differences between scenarios arise from the range of assumptions made about inputs such as costs, potential and performance of different mitigation technologies, as well as driving forces of emissions such as economic and population growth. Also important are differences in model design", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "792fd0e3-b3e0-438a-ab4a-7e33bb8b7aed": {"__data__": {"id_": "792fd0e3-b3e0-438a-ab4a-7e33bb8b7aed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2509d9a753aacad4ecad40b1eeaaff280ff1dfcda5e289c847afadf8622caebd"}}, "hash": "2509d9a753aacad4ecad40b1eeaaff280ff1dfcda5e289c847afadf8622caebd", "text": "and the design of model experiments. The scenarios highlighted in this chapter stay, respectively, within the 1.5\u00b0 C or 2\u00b0 C targets with a certain probability but can differ significantly in their underlying assumptions. We also present a re-analysis of the scenario literature, where the scenarios have been divided into two groups: least-cost and later-action. Least-cost scenarios depict the trend in global emissions up to 2100 under the assumption that climate targets will be met by the cheapest combination of policies and measures over the time period considered by a particular model. This assumes that, in the model, actions are allowed to begin immediately; that is, in the specified base year of the model\u2019s calculations, which is often 2010. This set of scenarios can be seen as a useful benchmark for evaluating implications of less stingent climate policies. As discussed below, the fact that real emissions since 2010 already deviate from these pathways has important implications. Later-action scenarios also attempt to keep warming to below 1.5\u00b0 C or 2\u00b0 C, but assume that actions to reduce emissions are generally weaker and take place later than assumed in least-cost scenarios. Hence, later-action scenarios assume that less action is taken to reduce emissions in the near term as compared to least-cost scenarios (Section 3.5). Although less action is assumed, it might, for example, include complying with current pledges to reduce emissions. The set also includes scenarios that have no policy action at all in some or all regions until 2030.

In other words, the lack of ambition to reduce emissions in the short term is compensated by faster and/or deeper emission reductions later. Once these scenarios do begin emission reductions, they again attempt to minimize costs of mitigation, but some options are no longer available. By definition the later start will lead to higher overall costs. Each of these scenarios has a particular trajectory of emissions. The reason a particular trajectory keeps within a specified limit of global warming \u2013 during the 21st century or in a certain year in the future \u2013 is that it stays below a certain maximum value of cumulative emissions of long- lived greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide (Allen et al., 2009; IPCC, 2013; Matthews et al., 2012; Meinshausen et al., 2009; Solomon et al., 2010)1. Integrated- assessment models provide insights into how, and at what rate, the global energy system and other greenhouse gas emitting sectors can be transformed so that cumulative emissions do not exceed a particular budget over the long term. Therefore they provide very useful information about what levels of emissions are consistent with temperature targets at different points in the future. ____________________ 1 Some greenhouse gases such as methane and tropospheric ozone have a much shorter lifetime in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide, and are therefore sometimes called short-lived climate pollutants or forcers. As compared to carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, the cumulative emissions of short-lived climate pollutants have a smaller effect on maximum temperature than their annual emissions at the time when maximum warming occurs (Smith et al., 2012). ____________________ 2 In this chapter we refer to the 20th\u201380th percentile range as the central range or just as the range, while the minimum-maximum range is referred to as the full spread or just as the spread. Box 3.1 Gap implications of the Working Group I Contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC The IPCC launched its fifth, and latest, assessment of climate science in September 2013 (IPCC, 2013). It emphasizes that the scientific community has a higher level of confidence than ever that human activity is significantly impacting the climate system. A key aspect of the new IPCC Working Group I report is a quantification of the sensitivity of the climate system to increased greenhouse gas emissions and to radiative forcing. This sensitivity is expressed through several different metrics.

The transient climate response is a measure of the temperature rise that occurs at the time of a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. Its current likely range is 1\u20132.5\u00b0 C, compared to 1\u20133\u00b0 C in the previous IPCC assessment. The climate simulations used in this report are consistent with this new range (Rogelj et al., 2012). The transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions is a measure of temperature rise per unit of cumulative carbon emissions, and has not been previously reported in an IPCC assessment. The implication of this concept is that global average temperature can only be kept to a certain value if cumulative carbon dioxide emissions do not exceed a maximum amount, or budget, over time. This is called the \u201ccarbon emissions budget\u201d. The idea of a budget is that if emissions are high now, then they have to be lower later. In general, the budget total cannot be exceeded. If it were exceeded, carbon would have to be subsequently removed from the atmosphere so that emissions returned to within budget limits. Conversely, if emissions were lower at the beginning, then they can be somewhat higher later. Thus, different emission pathways staying within the same budget will meet the same temperature target. This explains the trade-off between early and late emission reductions. UNEP\u2019s emissions gap reports explore these trade-offs by taking into account many important factors that influence emission trends. 3.3 Emissions in line with least-cost 2\u00b0 C pathways This section analyses emission levels achieved in least- cost scenarios through comprehensive, immediate action. Implications of later-action scenarios are discussed in Sections 3.5 and 3.6. To analyze these scenarios, we bring them into a common analytical framework and estimate the probability of each scenario exceeding 1.5\u00b0 C or 2\u00b0 C of warming. A probabilistic approach is important because of the uncertainties of climate response (see Box 3.1). Probability statements in this chapter only refer to climate-response uncertainties (see Appendix 3.A for more information), not to the plausibility of particular policy outcomes. Least-cost emission scenarios consistent with a \u2018likely\u2019 chance of staying below 2\u00b0 C have a median emission level of 44 GtCO2e per year in 2020, with a central range of 38\u201347 GtCO2e per year \u2013 dependent on their post-2020 emission trajectories (Figure 3.1 and Table 3.1)2. For comparison, emissions in 2005 were 45 GtCO2e per year. In this and previous emission-gap reports, we define a \u2018likely\u2019 chance as having a greater than 66 percent probability, consistent with the definitions of the IPCC (Mastrandrea et al., 2010). For a less stringent \u2018medium\u2019 chance (50\u201366 percent), median emission levels in 2020 can be somewhat higher at 46 GtCO2e per year (range 44\u201348 GtCO2e per year). Global emissions in these scenarios peak around 2020 or earlier. The main results do not differ from those presented in the 2012 report (UNEP, 2012), because most new scenarios also initiate comprehensive action from 2010 onward and near- The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 The emissions gap and its implications 15 ____________________ 3 In this case optimal means following a least-cost pathway. ____________________ 4 Negative emissions in this case refer to negative emissions from the fossil fuel and industrial sectors. Land-use emissions are not included here in the calculation of negative emissions. For the subset of scenarios that do not reach net negative emissions in the long term, it was found that their median near-term emissions were about 4 GtCO2e per year in 2020 lower than the median of all least-cost scenarios that have a likely chance of staying below 2\u00b0 C. term mitigation potentials have not greatly changed in the past year. Least-cost scenarios are indicative of the emissions path the world would have followed if it had started to implement comprehensive policies at the beginning of this decade, and serve as an important benchmark to evaluate scenarios with delayed or weaker-than-optimal near-term policy actions3.

(For scenarios with a \u2018likely\u2019 chance of meeting the 2\u00b0 C target see Table 3.1). The ranges are due to differences in assumptions of the integrated assessment models. Despite wide ranges, the models agree that substantial emission reductions relative to business-as-usual and current emission levels are required by 2050. Higher near-term emissions will have to be offset by steeper and larger reductions later. Moreover, many of the least-cost scenarios assume that emissions become negative in the second half of the century. This raises the question of the feasibility of negative emissions. Negative emissions are achieved in these scenarios through bio-energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS), or through land-use changes, such as afforestation or reforestation. In addition, negative emissions can be achieved, for instance, by direct air capture of carbon dioxide in combination with carbon capture and storage. Technologies such as bio-energy combined with carbon capture and storage are still not proven on the large scale and, moreover, their use can have significant impacts, for instance on biodiversity and drinking-water availability (Coelho et al., 2012). Some models, therefore, try to account for these impacts and explore the consequences of not being able to achieve negative emissions or the consequences of a much smaller bio-energy potential. It was found that scenarios that assumed that negative emissions cannot be achieved required substantially lower emissions in the short term in order not to exceed the carbon budget that complies with the 2\u00b0 C target4. Around mid-century, the scenarios without net negative emissions have similar emission levels as other scenarios, while in the long term, by 2100 they are higher since the other scenarios have negative emissions. In general, limiting the long-term mitigation potential in scenarios, by, for example, not allowing negative emissions, will require more stringent near-term emissions reductions (Table 3.1) and generally larger mitigation costs. Note that limiting key mitigation technologies in scenarios, including carbon capture and storage and bio-energy, will increase the overall mitigation costs because of the required additional short-term action, and because more expensive technologies will have to be used. Since these scenarios assume cost- effective emission reductions from 2010 onward, they are included in our set of least-cost scenarios.

Emissions in line with least-cost 1.5\u00b0 C pathways The 2010 Canc\u00fan Agreements include a provision for a possible 1.5\u00b0 C limit on global mean temperature rise. The 2012 report found five scenarios in line with 1.5\u00b0 C, with at least a \u2018medium\u2019 probability, which showed average emissions not exceeding 43 GtCO2e per year in 2020 (UNEP, 2012). Also, in 2010, UNEP found that stylized emission trajectories that start emission reductions in 2010 and stay within the 1.5\u00b0 C target have average emissions of up to 44 GtCO2e per year (range 39\u201344 GtCO2e per year) in 20205. No new 1.5\u00b0 C scenarios are analyzed in this report, as all new scenarios came from model inter-comparisons which focused on the 2\u00b0 C target. However, some single-model studies have looked at the implications of later action for 1.5\u00b0 C. Scenarios from these studies were not included in the main scenario set, but are discussed below6. Three new studies available in the scientific literature (Luderer et al., 2013b; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Rogelj et al., 2013b) and one report (Schaeffer et al., 2013b) have looked explicitly at scenarios that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0 C by 2100. Azar et al. (2013) also looked at 1.5\u00b0 C scenarios, but to 2150 instead of 2100. Least-cost scenarios from Rogelj et al. (2013b) have emissions between 37\u201341 GtCO2e per year in 2020, 27\u201331 GtCO2e per year in 2030, and 13\u201317 GtCO2e per year in 2050 (Table 3.2)7. Mitigation in these scenarios starts after 2010 and is further tightened to limit warming below 1.5\u00b0 C by 2100 with at least a 50 percent chance of achieving the target. These scenarios feature a radical commitment to energy efficiency in order to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the future. In addition, they rely heavily on negative-emission technologies such as bio-energy combined with carbon capture and storage (BioCCS). All three studies (Luderer et al., 2013b; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Rogelj et al., 2013b) show that immediate action is very important if warming is to be limited to below 1.5\u00b0 C by 2100. However, Rogelj et al. (2013a) also present later-action scenarios consistent with 1.5\u00b0 C. These, which are discussed further in Sections 3.5 and 3.6, are able to limit warming below 1.5\u00b0 C from emission levels higher than the ones cited above. On the basis of this (limited) information, and compared to the 2\u00b0 C, the 1.5\u00b0 C emissions gap in 2020 is between 2 and 5 GtCO2e per year wider. 3.5 Later-action scenarios in the literature Since the 2012 update (UNEP, 2012), several new studies of later-action scenarios have become available. These scenarios assume in the near term, up to 2020 or 2030, a lower level of action to reduce emissions than implied in the least-cost scenarios. All other assumptions being the same, the later-action scenarios have higher near-term emissions than least-cost scenarios. These scenarios assume that comprehensive emission reductions would begin at a later point, but are still able to stay within long-term climate targets.

It is important to note that these studies cover a wide range of assumptions regarding the time at which comprehensive mitigation begins, and the nature of the climate-policy regime assumed for the early period until the adoption of comprehensive mitigation actions. Most studies consider scenarios in which comprehensive emission reductions are postponed until 2020 or 2030 (Kriegler et al., 2013b; Luderer et al., 2013a; Luderer et al., 2013b; Riahi et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Rogelj et al., 2013b). While some scenarios assume climate policies to be absent altogether in the near term, others incorporate the impact of current climate policies or their extensions. Some of these scenarios assume that current country emission pledges for 2020 are implemented. Compared to emissions in least-cost scenarios, emissions in the later-action scenarios are reduced more rapidly after the adoption of comprehensive mitigation actions in order to have at least a \u2018medium\u2019 chance of meeting the 2\u00b0 C target. ____________________ 5 Stylized emission scenarios are ones that are not computed with a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a164ef90-8b83-4e21-9e5e-dbd9dd114346": {"__data__": {"id_": "a164ef90-8b83-4e21-9e5e-dbd9dd114346", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a1f1bbc27a13ec27ce396e76255d1712e1da9a3063d40825a29691dd2ddc084"}, "3": {"node_id": "cf6a20d0-35aa-4c77-80b5-73ca6ec3364a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07dbe9595ea7de772273040e5db2411ce7e74a449578212d1814900ed22f8a6d"}}, "hash": "14a7012a16fd36672f9fb97d9fab1ec8e5f2210656c79b70b22d7d1549c05ff2", "text": "detailed integrated assessment model, but by assuming an evolution of emission reduction rates throughout the century. 6 The reason for only including model inter-comparisons in the main scenario set is to achieve a somewhat balanced representation of the various modelling frameworks that are available in the scientific literature.

First, their emission-reduction rates throughout the 21st century are high \u2013 and both improvements in energy efficiency and the introduction of zero- and low-carbon emission technologies are often at rates faster than experienced historically over an extended period of time (van der Zwaan et al., 2013). Second, the scenarios typically reach their peak emission levels before or around 2020 in order to avoid an extensive overshoot of emission budgets, concentrations and, possibly, temperatures in the 21st century (Kriegler et al., 2013c). Third, the scenarios often have net negative emissions in the second half of the century. Finally, these scenarios almost universally feature an accelerated shift towards electrification (Krey et al., 2013). The 2012 report (UNEP, 2012) highlighted the potential role of both negative emissions and energy-efficiency measures. Negative emissions refers to the potential of actively removing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than is emitted at a given period. Here we highlight new literature on the topics of both negative emissions and energy efficiency in scenarios that meet the 1.5\u00b0 C and 2\u00b0 C targets. Negative emissions About one third of the scenarios analyzed in this chapter with either a \u2018likely\u2019 or a \u2018medium\u2019 chance of meeting the 2\u00b0 C target \u2013 and most of the small number of 1.5\u00b0 C scenarios \u2013 have negative total emissions of all Kyoto gases, not only carbon dioxide, before 2100. Moreover, about 40 percent of the scenarios that have a likely chance of complying with the 2\u00b0 C target have negative energy and industry-related carbon dioxide emissions by 2100. In these scenarios, bio-energy with carbon capture and storage is usually applied in the second-half of the century, assuming this option is economically attractive within a least-cost path over time. Such a path implies that the discounted costs of an additional unit of reduction is stable over time, and thus allows for much more expensive technologies to expand in the second half of the century.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf6a20d0-35aa-4c77-80b5-73ca6ec3364a": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf6a20d0-35aa-4c77-80b5-73ca6ec3364a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a1f1bbc27a13ec27ce396e76255d1712e1da9a3063d40825a29691dd2ddc084"}, "2": {"node_id": "a164ef90-8b83-4e21-9e5e-dbd9dd114346", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14a7012a16fd36672f9fb97d9fab1ec8e5f2210656c79b70b22d7d1549c05ff2"}}, "hash": "07dbe9595ea7de772273040e5db2411ce7e74a449578212d1814900ed22f8a6d", "text": "Also considered economically attractive is the ability to avoid very rapid, and thus costly, emission reductions in the short term (Azar et al., 2010; Edmonds et al., 2013; van Vuuren et al., 2013).

The last option is often applied in model-based studies because of its attractive costs and overall potential. Still, the validity of assuming large-scale bio-energy with carbon capture and storage deployment crucially hinges on two key factors (UNEP, 2012; van Vuuren et al., 2013): -\ufffd the technical and social feasibility of large-scale carbon capture and storage, for example, the development of a carbon capture and storage infrastructure; and -\ufffd the technical and social feasibility of sustainable large-scale bio-energy production, for example, the development of second-generation bio-energy conversion technologies, such as technologies for producing fuels from woody biomass. Even if both technologies are technically feasible and socially acceptable, the deployment of bio-energy with carbon capture and storage may have severe sustainability implications, for instance in terms of food-price developments and pressure on water resources. Many factors that may limit the availability of bio-energy are not fully represented in integrated-assessment models (Creutzig et al., 2012), and current integrated-assessment model estimates of the total mitigation potential vary greatly, sometimes by a factor of three (Tavoni and Socolow, 2013). Importantly, integrated assessment models also show that stringent climate targets can be achieved without bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (Riahi et al., 2012). As noted previously, if scenarios do not rely on this in the future, significantly lower emissions are required in the near term. Conversely, high emissions in the near term lock in the need for negative emissions later (Section 3.6). Energy efficiency Energy-efficiency improvements also play a key role in the early phases of mitigation, since they provide relatively rapid returns on investment and require technologies less advanced than low-carbon options (IEA, 2012; Kainuma et al., 2012; van Vuuren et al., 2007). However, as costs of low-carbon technologies gradually decline, and the most cost-effective energy-efficiency improvements are exhausted, further efficiency improvements gradually play a smaller role (Krey et al., 2013). By contrast, although 1.5\u00b0 C scenarios require the same type of technology options as 2\u00b0 C scenarios, these might only be sufficient when they are combined with strong and sustained efficiency improvements (Luderer et al., 2013b; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Rogelj et al., 2013b). In general, across all temperature targets and technology options, energy efficiency improvements appear crucial in significantly reducing overall costs. Strong and sustained efficiency improvements can also be a hedge against the risk of other mitigation technology failures, which would preclude achieving stringent temperature targets (Luderer et al., 2013b; Riahi et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013a). Box 3.2 Key Properties of 1.5\u00b0 C and 2\u00b0 C Scenarios The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 The emissions gap and its implications 19 Table 3.3: Overview of later-action scenarios in the literature 3.6 The emissions gap: trade-offs and implications of today\u2019s policy choices 3.6.1 The emissions gap We now update the estimate of the emissions gap from previous reports. To do so we draw on the assessment of emission reduction pledges in Chapter 2, and the computed range of emissions from the analysis of least-cost scenarios in Section 3.3. As in previous reports, we define the emissions gap in 2020 as the difference between global emissions from least-cost scenarios that are consistent with the 2\u00b0 C target and the expected global emissions implied by the pledges. Table 3.4 shows that, depending on the interpretation and implementation of the pledges, this gap ranges from 8\u201312 GtCO2e per year in 2020 for having a \u2018likely\u2019 chance of staying below 2\u00b0 C, and from 6\u201310 GtCO2e per year for having a \u2018medium\u2019 chance. As indicated earlier, a large number of least-cost scenarios assume implementation of climate policy from 2010 onwards. Certain later-action scenarios imply that in some cases current pledges could be compatible with the 2\u00b0 C target, if a radical shift to stronger emission reductions is assured later \u2013 risks and trade-offs are discussed in Section 3.6.3. However, if these emission reductions do not materialize, then the 2020 emissions under the four pledge cases in Chapter 2 (52\u201356 GtCO2e per year), will be on a trajectory with a \u2018likely\u2019 chance of limiting warming to 3\u20134\u00b0 C, not 2\u00b0 C (Figure 3.1) 8.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3faa6ec0-65c9-43e4-bb05-7765e2fa39d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3faa6ec0-65c9-43e4-bb05-7765e2fa39d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9ab428b1046dda51cb3ffcdaeb66f1c302d3380e912df240dcabefa0325669f"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c145e62-afc3-45c6-a984-03efc6964775", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e7a9c26739f43f315fdea9a3411ee54816815895905067b872238374d2d6b89"}}, "hash": "b3ea9ff5c8c037f1e7b7987cf92e2e68f3741d4e1a837212f509174a0074b67a", "text": "3.6.2 Implications of the gap for achieving least- cost 2020 emission levels Our assessment shows that there is a gap in 2020 between the emission levels implied by the pledges and the emissions under a least-cost scenario consistent with limiting warming to below 2\u00b0 C.

Some studies indicate it is still possible to close the gap by 2020 (Blok et al., 2012). However, as time passes, this comes with increasingly higher costs than indicated by the least-cost scenarios. The more real-world emissions deviate in the coming years from least-cost pathways, the greater the extra reduction efforts required for closing the gap in 2020 10. 3.6.3 Implications and trade-offs of not closing the gap If the gap between global emissions from least-cost scenarios and global emissions implied by the pledges is not closed by 2020, then a later-action scenario has, effectively, been assumed for limiting global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0 C or 2\u00b0 C.

On the one hand, later-action scenarios show short-term flexibility \u2013 they reduce the mitigation burden and associated costs in the near term, and move emission reduction requirements further into the future. This would give more time to build a global framework of ambitious policies, and for national policy makers to implement commensurate policies and measures. On the other hand, this short-term flexibility comes at the expense of stronger long-term requirements, reduced choices and higher risks of climate policy failure over the long term. Moreover, to meet the 1.5\u00b0 C target, there is much less flexibility to delay emission reductions in the coming years and mitigation requirements remain very stringent (Luderer et al., 2013b; Rogelj et al., 2013a).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d57be4f-6932-4e87-a7c1-867ada19e7eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d57be4f-6932-4e87-a7c1-867ada19e7eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23c20077d638f204729cefa54ea71b8fe7679a073ab646c5274d5615198bdc80"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a540d5a-4ca6-4a64-9d9c-04b88f1104ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35c50d881782f9e0e40b2aa4bc3e4304f8bcb0ef4ec0f188a043cafcb61adee3"}}, "hash": "cdae8f8fe5cc7c4b950ff6174d16fc9cf97c9571905349ff2ca6e03aeffba09f", "text": "As discussed in Box 3.2, any climate change mitigation scenario aiming at limiting warming to no more than 2\u00b0 C or 1.5\u00b0 C comes with major societal, economic and technological challenges.

Later-action scenarios delay the installment of such policies. Reduced societal choices. The more modest the near-term emission reductions, the higher society\u2019s dependence on specific technologies, thus foreclosing options and societal choices for the future. In particular, more scenarios depend on negative emissions to achieve the 2\u00b0 C target. Higher overall costs and economic challenges. Lower near- term costs in later-action scenarios imply a lower burden on current economic growth but larger overall mitigation costs. They also imply much higher economic challenges during the transition towards a comprehensive climate-policy regime, including substantial impacts on global economic growth and energy prices in the long term. Higher climate risks. The risk that the world fails in its effort to limit global warming to 2\u00b0 C or 1.5\u00b0 C increases strongly with further delays of global action. Stronger medium-term emission reduction requirements As discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0 C or 2\u00b0 C implies a tight limit on cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. As a consequence, scenarios with higher emissions in the near term require stronger medium- term mitigation to reach the same global average temperature over the long term. Inevitably, once comprehensive climate policies are finally introduced, emission reduction rates need to be greater than those in scenarios with strong near-term reductions. The AMPERE study found that modest emission reductions until 2030 imply that about 70 percent of the 2010\u20132100 cumulative carbon-dioxide emissions budget for a medium chance of limiting warming below 2\u00b0 C target will have been consumed by 2030 (Bertram et al., 2013; Riahi et al., 2013). Least-cost scenarios that achieve the 2\u00b0 C target take stringent action immediately to reduce emissions. Their rate of emission reductions over the medium term, 2030-2050, is around 2\u20134.5 percent per year11. Historically, such reductions have been achieved by individual countries (Peters et al., 2013), but not globally. By contrast, later-action scenarios delay stringent measures to reduce emissions, and consequently the annual rate of medium-term reductions needs to be much higher, around 6\u20138.5 percent in the case that emission reductions are modest until 2030 (Riahi et al., 2013), to meet the same target. Rogelj et al. (2013a) found similar results. Hence limiting the amount of mitigation over the next few years would require twice as fast a reduction in global emissions after 2030. It is important to note that these scenarios do not account for political and societal inertia, which could make such fast and radical emission reductions even more difficult to achieve if the change in policy comes unexpectedly (Riahi et al., 2013). A strong and reliable early policy signal is required in order to reduce emissions now, or have a chance of achieving higher ambition levels in the following decades.

As an example, some later-action scenarios in the AMPERE study have a 50 percent larger capacity of coal-fired power plants compared to current levels by 2030 (Bertram et al., 2013). The lack of near-term climate policies in these scenarios is also found to hinder the scaling up of low-emission, green- energy technologies (Eom et al., 2013).

Later-action scenarios tend to further lock-in power plants, buildings and other infrastructure with low levels of energy efficiency. This makes the transition to a high-energy-efficiency future more difficult, and creates a greater demand for alternative emission reduction measures. These lock-in effects can be reduced through an early policy signal as discussed above. For example, if power companies know for sure that stringent reductions will be required over the coming years, they might favour more in low-emissions infrastructure investments. Reduced societal choices As stated earlier, later-action scenarios need to compensate for their higher near-term emissions with faster and deeper reductions later. Many later-action scenarios assume that a full portfolio of mitigation options is available, including technologies that are not yet proven on the large scale such as bio-energy combined with carbon capture and storage. When key future mitigation technologies do not become available, costs increase (Kriegler et al., 2013c). This increase was found to be bigger in later-action scenarios than in least- cost scenarios (Luderer et al., 2013b; Riahi et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Rogelj et al., 2013b; van Vliet et al., 2012). If the range of future technological options is constrained, then the later-action scenarios were found to have higher mitigation costs and have a more difficult time complying with temperature targets than the least-cost scenarios. Furthermore, the more emission reductions are delayed, the greater the dependence on future technologies (Luderer et al., 2013b; Riahi et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013a)12. In other words, beginning emission reductions early, as is done in the least-cost scenarios, means that policymakers have a greater chance of meeting these temperature targets. It is not only the availability of specific technologies, that is, an important factor in later-action scenarios, but also the pace at which they can be scaled up. For example, emissions under later-action scenarios have to be reduced very quickly and this requires very rapid decarbonization of the energy system, which in turn puts great pressure on society to rapidly deploy low-carbon technologies13. Higher overall costs and economic challenges Later-action scenarios show that a delay in beginning global comprehensive mitigation action increases the overall costs to reach a climate target (Clarke et al., 2009; Jakob et al., 2012; Kriegler et al., 2013b; Luderer et al., 2013a; Luderer et al., 2013b; OECD, 2012; Riahi et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013b; Rogelj et al., 2013a). The larger the delay, the higher costs. Furthermore later-action scenarios clearly shift the burden of mitigation costs to later generations (Luderer et al., 2013b; OECD, 2012; Rogelj et al., 2013a)14. The cost penalty of later action depends on when comprehensive mitigation actions finally begin, the magnitude of emission reductions up to that point, and the future availability of technologies15. Later-action scenarios may also have higher economic costs during the transition from modest early actions to comprehensive mitigation actions (Kriegler et al., 2013b; Luderer et al., 2013a; Luderer et al., 2013b). For scenarios meeting the 2\u00b0 C target, transitional economic costs increase strongly with further delay. For example, beginning comprehensive reductions after 2030, rather than after 2015, causes a three times greater effect of mitigation policies on economic growth in the decade after reductions begin (Luderer et al., 2013b), as in this case very rapid reductions are required beyond 2030 that can only be achieved through adopting high-cost mitigation measures. Higher climate risks Although later-action scenarios can reach the same temperature targets as their least-cost counterparts, later- action scenarios pose greater risks of climate impacts for four reasons. First, delaying action causes more greenhouse gases to build up in the atmosphere, thereby increasing the risk that the carbon emissions budget is exceeded for particular temperature targets. The risk comes from the fact that the steep reductions required later may not materialize.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15a1c29f-a926-4ad4-a05e-6d6b3ad22aa1": {"__data__": {"id_": "15a1c29f-a926-4ad4-a05e-6d6b3ad22aa1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b679fe5c2954965a8136d90b9626e5e266728e66142114d3b615ea4af01a1152"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ba97541-24ae-44e1-860f-fd6643fdfd09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "117d36df3a9db9b1b8bd2f5cc61a86d79e700f93a9fd4e59f4b433971e074049"}}, "hash": "10a584217091f1676cd880cff42f852226677ee5ad31d82d0545591614f2ea16", "text": "The risk comes from the fact that the steep reductions required later may not materialize. ____________________ 12 As an example of technological dependency, it was found that only two out of nine models in the AMPERE study could reach a long-term 450 ppm carbon- dioxide concentration target, and thereby comply with the 2\u00b0 C target, without scaling up carbon capture and storage (Riahi et al., 2013).

(2013a) found that mitigation costs between 2020 and 2050 could be up to 20 percent higher in scenarios that meet the 2\u00b0 C target if global emissions in 2020 are 56 GtCO2e per year instead of 44 GtCO2e per year. Global carbon reduction prices after 2020 are increased by about a factor of two or more. This translates into an increase of discounted costs between 2020 and 2050 of more than US $7 trillion. Meanwhile, the cost of reducing emissions in the near-term, 2010\u20132020, was estimated to be about one third of this amount. When estimating cumulative mitigation costs over longer time frames, the medium to long-term economic effects appear to be relatively small because of discounting. 15 Note, however, that the costs of mitigation in least-cost scenarios can also vary widely depending on the set of mitigation technologies assumed to be available in the future. 16 For the case of staged accession to a global climate agreement aiming at stabilizing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at 450 ppm carbon-dioxide equivalent, Kriegler et al. (2013a) found that the risk of overshooting the 2\u00b0 C limit might increase from around 30 to around 50 percent even if reluctant nations join later, since late-joiners might not be willing to compensate for their initially higher emissions. The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 The emissions gap and its implications 22 This may happen because key technologies such as carbon capture and storage cannot be scaled up as expected. Equally likely is that future policy makers may be unwilling to take on the higher costs of mitigation16. Failure to steeply reduce emissions would cause a higher level of cumulative emissions than initially projected, and this would lead to higher eventual warming and a lower likelihood, or in some cases the impossibility, of staying below temperature targets (Meinshausen et al., 2009). As one example, Luderer et al. (2013b) found that delaying comprehensive mitigation actions beyond 2030 increases the achievable lower level of global temperature during the 21st century by about 0.4\u00b0 C as compared to a scenario with comprehensive reductions starting in 2020, in effect pushing the 2\u00b0 C target out of reach. Second, the risk of overshooting climate targets, both concentration and temperature, is higher (den Elzen et al., 2010; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Schaeffer et al, 2013a; van Vliet et al., 2012). Later-action scenarios have higher near term emissions than least-cost scenarios and this tends to increase the temporary overshoot of climate targets (Clarke et al., 2009; den Elzen et al., 2010; Kriegler et al., 2013a; Luderer et al., 2013a; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Schaeffer et al., 2013a; van Vliet et al., 2012). Overshooting these targets, or extending the overshoot period, implies a greater risk of large-scale and possibly irreversible changes in the climate system (Lenton et al., 2008). The extent of the risk is very uncertain. Third, the rate of temperature increase in the near to medium term is higher (den Elzen et al., 2010; Schaeffer et al., 2013a; van Vliet et al., 2012) and this can imply an earlier onset of particular climate impacts and require more rapid adaptation. For example, based on results from 11 integrated-assessment models, Schaeffer et al. (2013a) found that later-action scenarios meeting the 2\u00b0 C target have on average a 50 percent higher rate of decadal temperature increase in the 2040s than least-cost scenarios. Fourth, when action is delayed, options to achieve stringent levels of climate protection are increasingly lost. All other factors being the same, each year of delay results in the steady loss of options to meet temperature targets with high probability (Luderer et al., 2013b; Rogelj et al., 2013b). Assuming that emission reductions begin in 2010, Rogelj et al. (2013b) found that some scenarios have more than a 50 percent chance of limiting warming below 1.5\u00b0 C. However, if comprehensive mitigation action is delayed until 2020, the probability sinks to 40\u201350 percent. If delayed until 2030, the probability sinks to 10\u201320 percent. Also, spending large sums on mitigation, by assuming a carbon price of about US $1 000 per tonne of carbon dioxide, cannot make up for these lost options.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc323a50-ee00-47d5-8caa-d6823768b17b": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc323a50-ee00-47d5-8caa-d6823768b17b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc61ed27b9602cfef3e863d3587df6275c963d08b25f5f3e1578eb8bd2952a0d"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb91956a-6946-45a1-9cd1-19785db93712", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da2c6881d5bbac8c913982ae406820ff6a98cc2cc47a0b16b76f8f4489ea0d73"}}, "hash": "c729a5db03ff2c0327a287f4a0ca8eedd7f73e685a9bdec6656330fe44860044", "text": "3.6.4 Policy implications of the 2020 emissions gap and later-action scenarios In Section 3.6.1 and 3.6.2, we have indicated that a large emissions gap continues to exist between least- cost scenarios and the current emission pledges for 2020.

This situation has inspired the research community to look into scenarios that explore the impact of later action. While such scenarios can lessen the necessity for short-term emission reductions they come with many additional costs and challenges. To avoid these costs, it is important to increase near term policy efforts aiming at reducing emissions by 2020, even if they do not reach the level of the least-cost scenarios. Without such efforts, the carbon-emission budgets consistent with keeping temperatures below 1.5\u00b0 C or 2\u00b0 C are exhausted rapidly, and mitigation challenges in the future are increased. The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Bridging the gap I: Policies for reducing emissions from agriculture 23 Bridging the gap I: Policies for reducing emissions from agriculture Chapter 4 4.1 Introduction Bridging the emissions gap requires a substantial increase in ambition and action, as the previous chapters of this report have illustrated. In 2012, the UNEP Emissions Gap Report (UNEP, 2012) reviewed a number of policies in three sectors \u2013 building, transport and forestry \u2013 that are proving successful in substantially reducing emissions. In this report we review best-practice policies in agriculture, an often-overlooked emissions-producing sector. The sum of the policies from these different sectors, if replicated and scaled up, shows great potential for narrowing the emissions gap. Moreover, in many cases, these policies can help fulfil important national development objectives beyond climate goals as they can, depending on the policy, boost agricultural productivity, save costs of heating homes, promote eco- tourism, reduce traffic congestion, abate air pollution and associated adverse health effects, or a combination of these. Here we focus on agriculture because it is among the sectors most affected by climate change, while, at the same time, contributing a significant fraction of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC, 2007a). Tubiello et al. (2013) recently estimated that in 2010 direct emissions from agriculture contributed to 10\u201312 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, releasing 5.4\u20135.8 GtCO2e into the atmosphere. UNEP (2012) gave a best estimate of 11 percent. According to Bellarby et al. (2008) 38 percent of the emissions can be attributed to nitrous oxide from soils, 32 percent to methane from enteric fermentation in ruminant livestock, 12 percent to biomass burning, 11 percent to rice production and 7 percent to manure management. Direct agricultural emissions, as opposed to indirect ones discussed below, account for 60 percent of global nitrous oxide emissions and 50 percent of global methane emissions (Smith et al., 2008). Globally, 80 percent of deforestation and forest degradation is believed to be related to agriculture (Kissinger et al., 2012). A more realistic evaluation of emissions related to agriculture should therefore include the emissions released by the conversion of forests and grasslands into agricultural land and the degradation of peat lands. These emissions can be described as indirect emissions from agriculture and, according to Vermeulen et al. (2012), amounted to 2.2\u20136.6 GtCO2e in 2008. If agricultural pre- and post- production emissions are also added, the global food system accounts for about 19\u201329 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions (Vermeulen et al., 2012)1. Between 1990 and 2005, direct agricultural emissions rose by around 0.6 GtCO2e per year (IPCC, 2007b), reflecting trends in major drivers such as population growth and rising affluence. These trends are expected to continue although their trajectories largely depend on our choices in natural resource management, food systems and consumer behaviour. Scenarios of continued population growth and consumption suggest that, by 2055, global agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emissions might increase by 57 percent and 71 percent, respectively (Popp et al., 2010). Although current trends predict strong growth of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, there is significant potential to reduce them in the coming decades, particularly if mitigation options are mainstreamed into agricultural policies and incentives. At marginal costs of less than US $50\u2013100 per tonne of carbon-dioxide equivalent, the direct emission reduction potential of agriculture lies in the range of 1.1\u20134.3 GtCO2e per year in 2020 (Chapter 6). About 89 percent of this potential could be realized through improved management practices such as conservation tillage, combined organic/inorganic fertilizer application, adding biochar to the soil, improved water management and reducing flooding and fertilizer use in rice paddies (Smith et al., 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2d55459-d604-4012-ad0c-2bae312e94b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2d55459-d604-4012-ad0c-2bae312e94b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36a22eca56f4fea83e8047fe559cf8da03548c3064375debb097065a553c03f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "14816f85-93d6-4ba3-a78e-e5f2fd65e288", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "defba9c87f771dd7b5cbce9ee4eaea8c1f71fd5e51e92a2f1a3dd7521775f71b"}}, "hash": "3f780704aa7992d76b17727a57a085c91055c60cfcacf8a97c461cc4810eaf71", "text": "Emissions could be further reduced by abating emissions in the broader food sector, for example, by reducing food waste and meat consumption.

The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Bridging the gap I: Policies for reducing emissions from agriculture 24 The most promising and cheapest mitigation options in agriculture are those that lead to an increase in productivity and income, while the demand for inputs, land or labour rise at a lower rate. It is, however, necessary to minimize environmental externalities to avoid undermining the long- term provisioning capacity of our agro-ecosystems (Garnett et al., 2013; Neufeldt et al., 2013). It should also be noted that climate mitigation in agriculture involves more than reducing emissions. It can also mean increasing the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by biomass or soil organic matter. Furthermore it can also involve avoiding or displacing emissions, either by substituting fossil fuels with biofuels, or forestalling the conversion of natural vegetation into agricultural lands (Smith et al., 2008). Bringing about change in agricultural management practices, however, for climate or other reasons is not easy. More often than not there are important market- or tenure- related barriers that need to be overcome. Experience also suggests that overcoming these barriers individually is often unsuccessful. It is better that they are addressed in an integrated way, with interventions simultaneously supporting farmers, the governance and market conditions in which they operate, and the science and resources upon which technological change depends. Experience has also shown that the policies successful in overcoming barriers are often the ones that are attuned to local conditions. In the remainder of this chapter we present examples of concrete agricultural policies that have managed to overcome barriers and have been successful in mitigating climate change while raising income and enhancing food security. 4.2 Conversion of tillage to no-tillage practices Drivers and benefits of policy change Conventional plough-based farming developed largely as a means for farmers to control weeds. However, it leaves soils vulnerable to water and wind erosion, increases agricultural runoff, degrades soil productivity and releases greenhouse gases by disturbing soils and burning fossil fuels for farm machinery. No-till practices \u2013 sowing seeds directly under the mulch layer from the previous crop \u2013 reverse this process by minimizing mechanical soil disturbance, providing permanent soil cover by organic materials and diversifying crop species grown in sequence and/or association (FAO, 2013a). The financial benefits of no-till practices can be considerable, but depend on the location. Farmers save between 30\u201340 percent of time, labour and fossil fuel inputs using no-till practices, compared to conventional tillage (FAO, 2001; Lorenzatti, 2006). In Argentina it was found that one litre of fuel was needed to produce 50 kg of grain under conventional tillage, but it could produce 123 kg under no- till practices (Lorenzatti, 2006). Climate adaptation benefits can also be significant. While Kazakhstan\u2019s 2012 drought and high temperatures halved wheat yields overall, wheat grown under no-till practices were more resilient, producing yields three times higher than conventionally cultivated crops (FAO, 2012). Although no-till practices have only a small effect on reducing methane or nitrous-oxide emissions (Smith et al., 2008), a number of studies show the significant potential of no-till cultivation to sequester carbon. The expansion of Brazil\u2019s no-tillage system under its National Plan for Low Carbon Agriculture (ABC Plan), for example, may build up an additional 500 kg per hectare and year of soil organic carbon, offsetting a total of 16\u201320 MtCO2e by 2020, equivalent to 1.6\u20132.0 MtCO2e per year. Kenya anticipates an increase in carbon uptake of 1.1 MtCO2e by 2030, equivalent to 0.04 MtCO2e per year, from no-till farming activities under its Climate Change Action Plan (Stiebert et al., 2012). In China, no-till farming may sequester a total of 2.27 MtCO2e of soil carbon by 2015, equivalent to 0.5 MtCO2e per year (Cheng et al., 2013a).

Thus, support is required for farmers during the transition. In 2011 Brazil established its ABC Plan, the first national policy promoting no-till cultivation, which includes state-level activities, based upon local and sub-national government plans3. It sets implementation goals, anticipating that adoption of no-till practices increase from 31 million hectares to 39 million hectares under the plan. Farmers have access to ABC Plan credit and finance as well as training and extension services if management practices are compliant with the approach. The adoption of no-till practices in Brazil was brought about by many factors: new knowledge on no-till systems stemming from research by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation; support from farmer associations such as the Brazilian Federation of Direct Planting and Irrigation; backing from agricultural machinery companies who recognize the potential benefits from promoting the technology and expanding their markets; and recognition by farmers that no-till practices bring increased land productivity and reduced production costs (Cas\u00e3o Junior et al., 2012). Between 1982 and 1997 overall cropland erosion dropped by more than a third in the USA, where policy interventions to promote no-till practices on highly erodible land contributed up to 62 percent of the overall reductions (Claassen, 2012)4. Classifying soils as highly erodible made it easier to target ____________________ 2 To combat weeds, farmers may resort to an over-use of glyphosate or may rely on genetically modified crops, notably corn or soy. Alternatives are available, but support for farmers is required if those alternatives are to be introduced. 3 Brazil\u2019s ABC Plan also includes: species diversification through rotation of crops, succession or combination of crops in a variety of production systems; permanent soil cover, either as mulch or perennial species; organic matter of sufficient quality and according to the soil\u2019s biological demand; and further conservation agriculture practices, depending on the location. 4 From 3.1 billion tonnes of soil in 1982 to 1.9 billion tonnes in 1997. The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Bridging the gap I: Policies for reducing emissions from agriculture 25 specific areas for conversion to no-till cultivation, enabled by financial support from the United States Department of Agriculture. To get this support, farmers on highly erodible lands, approximately 25 percent of all USA cropland, had to devise and have approved a soil conservation plan. As a result, in 2009, 35 percent of USA cropland, mostly producing soy, was under no- or reduced-tillage, although often not permanently, which reduces its effectiveness to sequester carbon. No-till agriculture increased in Australia from 9 percent of cropland in 1990 to 74 percent in 2010 (Llewellyn and D\u2019Emden, 2010), particularly in grain producing areas. Awareness of soil erosion problems, region-specific information and learning opportunities for farmers, and declines in the price of glyphosphate, all contributed to the adoption of no-till practices (D\u2019Emden, et al., 2006; Llewellyn and D\u2019Emden, 2010). Australia\u2019s Landcare Programme, a community-based approach to land management, which is now made up of 6 000 farmer groups across the country, has played a key role in information dissemination and technical support (Department of Agriculture, 2013). The programme provides a refundable tax offset, financed by carbon-tax revenues, of 15 percent of the purchase price of an eligible no-till seeder to participating farmers. More recently, Australia has recognised the greenhouse gas reduction potential of no-till practices by including them in its Carbon Farming Futures programme \u2013 part of Australia\u2019s Clean Energy Future Plan, and central to the cropland management component of Australia\u2019s national greenhouse gas-reduction target. Chinese interventions to increase the use of no-till practices have aimed to reduce soil erosion, treat crop residue, and eliminate their post-harvest burning.5 Up to now, reducing greenhouse gas emissions has not been a factor. As in much of Asia, smaller farm sizes restricted adoption of no-till practices. In addition, crop residues were commonly used for alternative purposes, such as feed for livestock (Lindwall and Sontag, 2010). China hopes to expand no-till practices to 13.3 million hectares by 2015 (Ministry of Agriculture, 2009), especially by providing subsidies to farmers (Zhao, et al., 2012).

To obtain the cumulative emissions in column 5, the annual emissions were summed for each year from 2007/8 back to the base year (in column 3). To compute the area covered by no-till cultivation in each year, it was assumed that the area covered decreased linearly from 2007/8 back to the base year (in column 3). In countries with long histories of no-till agriculture this probably led to an underestimate of the mitigation that was achieved. However, if the use of no-till cultivation began very slowly, then it is also possible that cumulative avoided emissions were overestimated. (e) The 2007/8 estimate is derived from Derpsch et al.

Here we focus on three innovative and promising cropping practices that not only reduce methane emissions but also greatly improve the management of water and nutrients in rice cultivation \u2013 alternate wetting and drying (AWD), the system of rice intensification, and urea deep placement (UDP). Alternate wetting and drying is a water management practice for irrigated rice fields through which farmers can achieve 5\u201330 percent water savings, lower labour costs, no significant yield penalty and profit increases of up to 8 percent (IRRI, 2013). Where it has been used on farms in Bangladesh, yields have risen by more than 10 percent, raising income by US $67\u201397 per hectare (IRRI, 2013).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ab83bb4-f670-4d81-9c9f-d580d5ab1eba": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ab83bb4-f670-4d81-9c9f-d580d5ab1eba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35db836e4dbb3cee90d97fd75ce3fa8b34c67274739239b48200435591b23af5"}, "2": {"node_id": "451388de-e5f4-4fd8-a80a-d82445260185", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "038b3bb7891ea84fe75f6061b1d9991eb9c38d232516936ed765b0c1ac237e8a"}}, "hash": "3de6d56a8c2c73f4308ec52e02371168a0e291763835312ac0030fbd52cab28f", "text": "In Rwanda and Senegal, rice yield increased from 2\u20133 tonnes per hectare to 6\u20138 tonnes per hectare due to the similar system of rice intensification (Bald\u00e9, 2013; Ciss\u00e9, 2013). Another option for reducing emissions, urea deep placement, consists of inserting urea granules into the rice root zone after transplanting. It is reported to reduce fertilizer use by 35 percent while increasing crop yields by about 20 percent (IFDC, 2012). In Nigeria, for example, farmers were able to harvest 2.69 tonnes more rice per hectare using this technology than when broadcasting urea (IFDC, 2012)7. Although the emission reduction potentials of these nutrient and water conserving techniques are in principle very high, actual reduction figures are sparse.

With urea deep placement, large fertilizer users such as China and India could achieve nitrogen fertilizer savings of up to 6.43 Mt and 2.89 Mt per year, respectively (Sutton et al., 2013). At the same time, nitrous oxide emissions would be reduced because of lower leaching and denitrification. In China, for instance, a mitigation potential of 0.08 to 0.36 tCO2e per tonne of grain yield is possible by reducing nitrogen chemical fertilizer rates along with intermittent flooding in paddy rice cropping systems (Cheng et al., 2013b). Policies that work There are many examples of success in adopting alternate wetting and drying, the system of rice intensification and urea deep placement across the world. Governments have helped in many cases by providing the necessary incentives and support. In Bangladesh, government support and policies, as well as targeted public-private partnerships and research, have led to high adoption rates of both alternate wetting and drying and urea deep placement. As an example of government support, alternate wetting and drying was introduced into the draft of the first National Irrigation Policy of Bangladesh. A key incentive turned out to be the government\u2019s support for appropriate irrigation pipes or the adaptation of existing pipes (K\u00fcrschner et al., 2010). The International Rice Research Institute and the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute played key roles in mainstreaming the technique by raising awareness of its benefits and providing technical guidance. The use of TV, radio and newspapers also played an important role in the awareness raising process (K\u00fcrschner et al., 2010) \u2013 to date more than 100 000 farmers have adopted alternate wetting and drying practices (IRRI, 2012). As a promoter of the fertilizer deep placement technology, the International Fertilizer Development Center took a leadership role in introducing urea deep placement to Bangladesh in the mid-1980s. Among other actions, the Centre organized demonstrations of urea deep placement techniques. By 2012 more than 2.5 million Bangladeshi farmers were using the technology, and it was expected to be adopted by an additional 1 million farmers across the country (IFDC, 2013). Alternate wetting and drying and the system of rice intensification (a technique similar to alternate wetting and drying) have also been introduced very successfully to other parts of Asia. According to Uphoff (2012) more than 1 million Vietnamese farmers had adopted the system of rice intensification by 2011; in the Philippines, more than 100 000 farmers had begun using alternate wetting and drying by 2012, and it is expected that 600 000 farmers will have adopted this technology by 2015 (Rejesus et al., 2013; IRRI, 2013). In Africa, the government of Madagascar supported the diffusion of the system of rice intensification by providing access to microcredit services, particularly in areas with weak coverage by microfinance institutions. The government facilitated the acquisition of farm equipment by liaising with microcredit institutions and by offering incentives to the private sector in production areas (Ministry of Agriculture, 2008). These credits also promoted knowledge and information sharing and thereby helped scale up the technology. As women play a prominent role in rice production in Madagascar, the government also relied extensively on women\u2019s networks to promote the system of rice intensification. Priority was given to providing women with training in how the system is practiced. Some rural communities relaxed current restrictions on women\u2019s access to land and agricultural equipment, suggesting that women, through government support, have significantly contributed to the increase in usage of the system8. The technique is also being used on a small scale, but with increasing interest, in several other African countries, including Benin, Cameroon and Senegal (Agridape, 2013)9. As a general lesson, emissions of greenhouse gases from rice cultivation can be substantially reduced through efficient management of fertilizer and water.

Finally, direct support to women involved in rice cultivation would be very effective in scaling up these practices. 4.4 Agroforestry Drivers and benefits of policy change Agroforestry refers to a land management approach involving the simultaneous cultivation of farm crops and trees. In addition to sequestering carbon in the tree biomass, agroforestry generally improves microclimate and water balance, reduces erosion and raises soil fertility, among other ecosystem services. It leads, therefore, to higher crop and livestock productivity and, hence, income (Garrity et al., 2006; Schoeneberger et al., 2012). For instance, Haglund et al. (2011) reported 18\u201324 percent higher household incomes following the introduction in Niger of a variant of agroforestry called \u2018farmer managed natural regeneration\u2019. Garrity et al. (2010) summarized experiences with maize grown in association with a tree called Faidherbia albida in several African countries, reporting yield increases of 6\u2013200 percent, depending on the age of the trees (Figure 4.1). In temperate mechanized agroforestry systems, Dupraz and Talbot (2012) have shown land equivalent ratios reaching 1.2\u20131.6, suggesting that planting trees and crops together is more efficient than when the two are planted separately10. Through diversification of income from fuel, fodder, fruit, timber, and the reduction of labour for firewood collection and the generally strong resilience of trees to climate variability, agroforestry has also shown to provide greater food security under climate shocks than conventional farming (Thorlakson and Neufeldt, 2012). The mitigation potential of agroforestry systems is theoretically very high, but strongly dependent on the agro- ecosystem, the species being planted, and on the specific type of agroforestry practice. One estimate is that it could potentially mitigate 2.2 GtCO2e per year (Verchot et al., 2007). This large figure stems from the fact that agroforestry has the possibility of being applied to 630 million hectares worldwide (Verchot et al., 2007). The amount of carbon sequestered in agroforestry systems typically ranges from 1.06 tCO2 per hectare per year to 55.77 tCO2 per hectare per year for biomass carbon (Nair et al., 2009) and from 0.17 tCO2e per hectare per year to 1.89 tCO2e per hectare per year for soil carbon (Smith et al., 2008). Recently Aertsens et al. (2013) estimated that agroforestry could provide 90 percent of the potential of agriculture in Europe to take up additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere11. Policies that work Despite agroforestry\u2019s high potential for increasing welfare and providing environmental services, there may be significant opportunity costs associated with establishing such systems and long time-lags before they generate returns (FAO, 2013b). Particularly in smallholder farming, the barriers include lack of access to farm inputs, capital, markets and training; uncertain land tenure situations; weak institutions and governance structures; and poor seed and seedling provisioning systems (Thorlakson and Neufeldt, 2012). Policies are needed to overcome these barriers. ____________________ 11 The total technical potential in the EU-27 is estimated to be 1 566 MtCO2e per year, corresponding to 37 percent of all carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in the EU in 2007. The introduction of agroforestry is the measure with the highest potential \u2013 90 percent of the total potential of the measures studied (Aertsens et al., 2013). Figure 4.1 Mature Faidherbia albida between maize in Tanzania. One of the characteristics of the species is its reverse phenology: the tree sheds its leaves in the rainy season and goes dormant, reducing competition for light and water while providing valuable nitrogen-rich litter that is also good fodder.

A ratio greater than 1 indicates that it requires less land to produce the same amount of crops and trees.

Within two decades this combination of non-governmental and governmental support led to a re- greening of about 5 million hectares of nearly barren bush savanna (Reij et al., 2009). Another example is Kenya, where the government has adopted policies to promote farm forestry12. Key actions include the relaxation of restrictions on harvesting and marketing of tree products, tax incentives for growing trees on farms, and the creation of contract farming schemes to enhance trading of tree products between landholders and companies13. Wangari Mathai\u2019s Green Belt Movement has also been instrumental in raising awareness about the importance of trees and for mobilizing thousands of women to plant millions of trees. In western and central Kenya this mix of regulation and incentives has resulted in a 215 000 hectares expansion of agroforestry over the last 30 years (Norton-Griffiths, 2013). Other national policies have promoted tree planting on Kenyan farms (Ajayi and Place, 2012) by supporting the training of extension service staff, establishing tree nurseries countrywide and prohibiting the harvesting of trees from public forests14. In northern India, beginning in the late 1970s, poplar trees have been rapidly added to irrigated wheat and barley farms and now cover about 280 000 hectares \u2013 or 10 percent of irrigated agricultural lands in this region. Poplars provide timber and other benefits to farmers and barely compete with crops for light and water. Meanwhile, the Forest Conservation Amendment Act of 1988 prohibited cutting timber from state forests, and this increased the price of wood and created an economic incentive to plant trees on farms (Ajayi and Place, 2012). Agroforestry was further encouraged through credits for tree planting from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development and through support provided by the timber industry in the form of higher quality planting material, such as seeds, fruit or aggregate fruit; training in agroforestry; and guaranteed timber prices. In Europe and North America, agroforestry is mainly promoted for the ecosystem services it provides (Dupraz and Liagre, 2008; Current et al., 2009; Jacobson, 2012; Schoeneberger et al., 2012). Yet, despite its long-term economic benefits, agroforestry has not achieved its potential in Europe because of high investment costs and the perceived complexity of introducing annual and perennial plantings into high-input, mechanized agriculture (Papanastasis and Mantzanas, 2012). To encourage the expansion of agroforestry, the European Agroforestry Federation has recently called for reforms of the European Common Agricultural Policy, including greater financial support to farmers and more flexible eligibility rules (EURAF, 2013). 4.5 Lessons learned To mitigate greenhouse gas emissions effectively while achieving development goals in the agriculture sector, the following factors should be considered: -\ufffd Agricultural mitigation options require a coordinated mix of policy support, private and public sector investment, strengthened research, and capacity building of key stakeholders. Specific actions are needed to demonstrate the benefits of new technologies to farmers, to coordinate needed investments and to disseminate information about benefits and how to overcome barriers. These actions can be supported by public-private partnerships and by research centres, governments, agricultural extension services, the private sector and non-governmental organizations. -\ufffd Multiple benefits require multiple goals. At the early policy-development stage it makes sense to articulate a number of environmental, social and other goals rather than one objective alone. This makes it easier to identify synergies between different goals rather than having to resolve trade-offs between them. Multiple goals can lead to multiple benefits of climate change mitigation, improved agricultural productivity and enhanced food security. -\ufffd Financial incentives are needed. A major barrier to the adoption of emission reduction measures has been the lack of financial incentives for farmers to adopt new technologies and practices. Financial incentives, including tax offsets, subsidies, and credits, are needed to help farmers in both developing and developed countries defray high up-front investment costs. Incentives are also needed because no-till and agroforestry practices can have a several year time-lag before their climate and other benefits are realized. Subsidies and microcredit may be particularly important for poor rice farmers who usually lack access to capital and credit. -\ufffd In order to be successful in mitigating emissions, new technologies must be context-specific to the region or country where they are introduced. For example, for no-till practices to be successful they must take into account local farm size, crop and soil types, carbon/nitrogen ratio over the crop rotation. Context specific research at landscape scale, as well as learning from past mistakes, is important for making each mitigation option work. In addition, land tenure issues have to be resolved before the needed investments and changes in new agricultural practices can be made.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc2ad38d-d2b4-4bc5-84ea-4fb798f273e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc2ad38d-d2b4-4bc5-84ea-4fb798f273e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7591a42497cbc0c369bdcf2650f3e3740a63c5fc0b0bf26470b78d8df3310d31"}}, "hash": "7591a42497cbc0c369bdcf2650f3e3740a63c5fc0b0bf26470b78d8df3310d31", "text": "____________________ 12 Through the Economic Recovery Strategy (Ministry of Planning and National Development, 2003), the Forest Act (Ministry of Water and Irrigation, 2005) and the Draft Forest Policy (Ministry of Enviroment and Natural Resources, 2007). 13 Contract farming is agricultural production carried out according to an agreement between a buyer and farmers, which establishes conditions for the production and marketing of a farm product or products (FAO, Rome, 2008). 14 The Forest Policy (Goverment of Kenya, 1968) and the Rural Afforestation and Extension Services Division, set up in 1971. The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Bridging the gap II: International cooperative initiatives 29 Bridging the gap II: International cooperative initiatives Chapter 5 5.1 Introduction There are many initiatives underway outside of the Climate Convention aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by promoting actions that are less greenhouse gas intensive. We refer to these initiatives collectively as international cooperative initiatives1. These initiatives complement and support pledges and other actions under UNFCCC in a number of different ways: some focus on assisting countries to meet a variety of goals and have climate change mitigation as an ancillary benefit, while for others the central objective is reducing emissions of greenhouse gases for climate purposes. This chapter pays particular attention to those initiatives that can support meeting and exceeding current pledges and help narrow the emissions gap. Specifically, this would include international cooperative initiatives that provide emission reductions that are likely to be additional to those stemming from national emission reduction pledges and actions. The chapter first provides an overview of the different initiatives, including a categorization by type. Appendix 5.A complements this information by giving a sample of the many international cooperative initiatives currently active. It then identifies where large potential exists to close the gap and finishes with a set of possible criteria for designing initiatives that could be most effective in closing the emissions gap. 5.2 Current international cooperative initiatives A categorization of existing initiatives reveals that the topics covered, actors involved and participation levels vary greatly across them. The reader is referred to Appendix 5.A for an overview of initiatives (note that the overview is illustrative and not comprehensive). Initiatives underway can be put into three categories: 1. Global dialogues. These initiatives provide a forum for national governments to exchange information and understand national priorities. Some are primarily at the head-of-government level, such as the G8 and the G20; others at the ministerial level, such as the Major Economies Forum. Some include industry, academia, and/or civil society. These groups may issue statements of intent or voluntary commitments and otherwise contribute to consensus building. 2. Formal multilateral processes. A number of international organizations and formal international negotiation processes are addressing issues that are relevant to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. These include international treaties such as the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer or sector specific organizations such as the International Civil Aviation Organization or the International Maritime Organization. These international cooperative initiatives can produce binding international agreements to reduce emissions. 3. Implementation initiatives. There are many initiatives that focus on enabling countries to meet their pledges through sharing good practices and technical knowledge. Some concentrate on technical dialogues, including for instance the Mitigation and MRV Partnership, or the Clean Energy Ministerial. The more technical the discussion, the more non-governmental actors are often involved. Other initiatives go beyond dialogue to support sector-specific initiatives through the collective implementation and, in many cases, funding of programmes or projects. This may include the facilitation of clean energy projects, for example, through the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership, the development of sector-specific action plans such as those developed under the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants, or the implementation of programmes Lead authors : Niklas H\u00f6hne (Ecofys, Germany), Jennifer Morgan (World Resources Institute, USA) Contributing authors: Lutz Weischer (World Resources Institute, Germany), Durwood Zaelke (Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, USA), Yemi Katerere (Independent Consultant, Zimbabwe) ____________________ 1 In this chapter we assume that international cooperative initiatives are initiatives with participants from at least three countries.

Global dialogues and many of the implementation initiatives focus on building consensus and sharing best practices, making an important \u2013 but indirect \u2013 contribution to narrowing the gap. Other initiatives lead to direct greenhouse gas reductions.

The remainder of this chapter focuses on initiatives that may lead to direct reductions, particularly in those areas that represent high mitigation potential. 5.3 Promising areas for international cooperative initiatives to close the gap Three studies (Blok et al., 2012; IEA, 2013; UNFCCC, 2013) have identified promising mitigation measures and areas to narrow the gap (Table 5.1). Criteria used to identify these promising areas across the studies include: -\ufffd a minimum level of already-started activity; -\ufffd an organization that can take the lead in scaling up activities; -\ufffd a positive or neutral impact on the economy; -\ufffd a minimum level of mitigation potential, of size or critical mass of participants. The above three studies highlighted four priority mitigation measures in particular: -\ufffd energy efficiency; -\ufffd fossil fuel subsidy reform; -\ufffd methane and other short-lived climate pollutants; and -\ufffd renewable energy.

Table 5.1 Promising areas for international cooperative initiatives and three estimates of associated reduction potential The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Bridging the gap II: International cooperative initiatives 31 Fluorinated greenhouse gases and international transport are also frequently listed as priority areas. In addition, the International Energy Agency (IEA) highlights the large short- term potential of limiting inefficient coal use in electricity generation, an area that is currently not covered by any international cooperative initiatives. On the other hand, other areas are covered by more than one initiative, for example, reducing emissions from deforestation. To date there have been very few quantitative assessments of the impact of cooperative initiatives. Some studies analyze the past and possible future impact of individual initiatives, notably studies on the Sustainable Energy for All Initiative (Rogelj et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a8a7c1f-dad3-437f-8318-13233a05558d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a8a7c1f-dad3-437f-8318-13233a05558d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6563a696a4bc3ed2afb63341f154512bc0c57d269d5262ee504d4a1854607737"}, "2": {"node_id": "a48f7ed3-54b9-49e4-8be1-126b297c253c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "856491310e8cea3b6cf78f3e342aafd25c4e3492eab2f5dc728e105f70e68df7"}}, "hash": "72c09c5e46d8cd3290e9322ad6134e0c224aed8c78f9f1c6185f910ad9030d4d", "text": "2013), the WWF Climate Savers Programme (Ecofys, 2012), the Covenant of Mayors (Cerutti et al., 2013), and the phase out of hydrofluorocarbons (Hare et al., 2013; Molina et al., 2009; UNEP, 2011; Velders et al., 2009; Velders et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013; Zaelke et al., 2012). No study was found on the aggregate past impacts of cooperative initiatives. Only a few initiatives are clearly outside the scope of national pledges, namely those on international aviation and shipping, and those on short-lived climate pollutants, or initiatives on non-carbon dioxide gases for those countries whose pledges only apply to carbon dioxide emissions. All other initiatives potentially overlap with national pledges and, because of this, it is not yet possible to assess the volume of reductions expected from these initiatives alone.

An element of coordination or integration among overlapping initiatives would likely strengthen their collective effectiveness. Finally, participation in the initiatives, especially for developing countries, is constrained by various factors. One is the limited amount of time and capacity available for participation. Another is limited expertise in the subject areas of the initiatives. These factors raise concerns about the credibility and legitimacy of some initiatives. This would argue for fewer, but more effective and ambitious initiatives. Some have proposed that a coalition of initiatives could be helpful (Blok et al., 2012). 5.4 How to make international cooperative initiatives effective in closing the gap? Few studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of initiatives (Bausch and Mehling, 2011; Weischer et al., 2012; Young, 2011). Nevertheless, based on the small amount of experience gained up to now, we speculate that five aspects are particularly important: focus and goals; participation; funding and institutions; incentives and benefits; and transparency and accountability. Focus and goals It has been argued that some international cooperative initiatives might be \u201cspecialized venues [that] could each address a small piece of the puzzle that the UNFCCC could not tackle as a whole\u201d (Moncel and van Asselt, 2012). As an example, the Consumer Goods Forum, a global industry network of over 400 retailers, agreed to begin phasing out hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants by 2015, and work to achieve zero net deforestation by 2020. Following this model, international cooperative initiatives could be effective by having a sharp focus on a limited number of ambitious goals. Participation Some authors argue that limiting the number of participants is an important factor for effectiveness. Smaller groups are able to act faster (Biermann et al., 2009) and can be expected to be \u2018narrow-but-deep\u2019, reaching substantial policy goals that would not have been reached in a \u2018broad- but-shallow\u2019 regime that has more participants but less ambition due to the compulsions of placating all signatories (Aldy et al., 2003). On the other hand, the contribution to closing the gap will be larger if all major current and future emitters participate, which might argue for a slightly larger group (Bausch and Mehling, 2011). In the field of renewable energy, we find all models. The recently launched German initiative for a renewables club brings together a small group of ministers from 10 countries considered to be leaders. Meanwhile, the Clean Energy Ministerial encompasses a larger group of 23 countries accounting for 80 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the International Renewable Energy Agency has almost universal participation, with 114 member states, plus 46 in accession. No assessment has been made on the effectiveness of these different models, but it is likely that the right group size depends on an initiative\u2019s mandate. Participation of stakeholders, beyond the government representatives that traditionally conduct climate negotiations, is another factor that might enhance effectiveness. International cooperative initiatives might help bring in constituencies that have so far not been active in climate change issues, but could make essential contributions to solving the problem (Moncel and van Asselt, 2012). This can include government agencies that deal with related issues such as energy or security, as well as business and civil society. Two examples of multi- stakeholder partnerships bringing together governments, industry representatives, non-governmental organizations and researchers are the Renewable Energy Partnership for the 21st century (REN21) and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to reduce Short-lived Climate Pollutants. Another important aspect of participation is whether high- level participation, for example from ministers or heads of government, might lead to a stronger political buy-in and thus make an international cooperative initiative more effective in closing the gap. To facilitate implementation of their programmes, it might be useful for such initiatives to include not only high-level dialogues, but also mechanisms for working-level cooperation. For example, the Clean Energy Ministerial and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition both incorporate meetings of ministers with meetings of working groups consisting of experts who work on implementation. Funding and institutions The design of international cooperative initiatives has to strike a difficult balance between providing the necessary institutional framework for meaningful cooperation yet avoiding too bureaucratic an operation. An appropriate set-up might include a secretariat, clear procedures and The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Bridging the gap II: International cooperative initiatives 32 sufficient resources (Bausch and Mehling, 2011). Conversely, avoiding bureaucracy means fewer formalities, allowing for more flexibility and pragmatic action. For example, the G8 and G20 presidencies rotate from year to year and have no permanent secretariat, which makes systematic implementation and follow-up difficult,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f871106-fcae-4b47-95dc-1992fe7f7c94": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f871106-fcae-4b47-95dc-1992fe7f7c94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2013", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e22400080131528b2e11e6ce29b669fbca1e65a3bc708935fe65010e2212ed9a"}}, "hash": "e22400080131528b2e11e6ce29b669fbca1e65a3bc708935fe65010e2212ed9a", "text": "whereas the International Energy Agency\u2019s Implementing Agreements have a secretariat, a dedicated budget and the capacity to implement their own projects. Incentives and benefits If international cooperative initiatives are to catalyse significant additional emission reductions, they need to offer compelling reasons for potential participants to join. These incentives would predominantly be economic benefits that need to be significant, equitably distributed among participants and, at least to a certain extent, exclusive to the participants (Weischer et al., 2012). One example of benefits is the technical and policy support provided by the Collaborative Labelling and Appliance Standards Program to governments working on energy efficiency standards and labels. Other examples are the two separate, complementary funding mechanisms provided by the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility. Transparency and accountability In order to determine whether an international cooperative initiative is making a contribution to closing the emissions gap, its activities and their emissions impact need to be transparent. Enhancing transparency and accountability might also make initiatives more effective, as it represents an incentive to follow through on commitments and provide participants with confidence that others are acting as well (Bausch and Mehling, 2011). This might, for instance, include regular reporting or peer-review procedures. A good example is the Covenant of Mayors initiative, which developed detailed monitoring requirements for its actions, regular reporting by participants, and the independent verification of results. 5.5 Links with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change At present, there are no formal links between UNFCCC and the various international cooperative initiatives. Nevertheless, within the Convention\u2019s Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform there is an on-going discussion about what role initiatives could play in helping to close the 2020 emissions gap. Whether and how to account within the convention for the emission reductions achieved by international cooperative initiatives is a key part of the discussion. Parties could, in principle, do this through existing reporting practices and rules, or through a purpose- made methodology to account specifically for reductions attributable to international cooperative initiatives. Irrespective of the form it takes, such a reporting mechanism could provide an informal platform for recognizing efforts and, in this way, encourage performance. 5.6 Conclusions International cooperative initiatives have the potential not only to support existing pledges, but to go beyond them to narrow the gap. To achieve this, however, they need to focus on the large opportunity areas and be designed and implemented in an effective way. A large number of international cooperative initiatives currently exists, and they are very diverse in scope and approach. Some make an indirect contribution to closing the emission gap by promoting dialogue and sharing experience and best practice. Others have the potential to make direct contributions, as their mandate focuses on catalysing additional mitigation \u2013 by involving additional actors or covering additional sectors or by providing incentives for action beyond current pledges. A review of the limited literature available suggests four broad priority areas: 1. Energy efficiency with significant potential, up to 2 GtCO2e by 2020. It is already covered by a substantial number of initiatives. Focus and coherency is needed. 2. Fossil-fuel subsidy reform with varying estimates of the reduction potential: 0.4\u20132 GtCO2e by 2020. The number of initiatives and clear commitments in this area is limited. 3. Methane and other short-lived climate pollutants as a mix of several sources. Reducing methane emissions from fossil-fuel production has received particular attention in the literature. This area is covered by several specific initiatives and one that is overarching. 4. Renewable energy with particularly large potential: 1\u20133 GtCO2e by 2020. Several initiatives have been started in this area. Focus and coherency is needed. While further research is needed to arrive at more comparable figures on emission reduction potential, additional sectors in which the potential may be high include fluorinated greenhouse gases, international transport, limiting inefficient coal use in electricity generation, agriculture and forestry. It would be useful to have guidelines for clear and quantifiable commitments, and transparent monitoring and reporting to allow for a more precise quantification of the contribution of international cooperative initiatives to closing the gap. Any instigator of a new initiative should assess the landscape before beginning something new. In issue areas with a high number of existing initiatives, a consolidation of efforts could be considered. International cooperative initiatives need to be effective in delivering actual emission reductions.

The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Bridging the gap III: Overview of options 33 Bridging the gap III: Overview of options Chapter 6 6.1 Introduction The analysis in Chapters 2 and 3 of this report concluded that the emissions gap in 2020 is likely to be 8\u201312 GtCO2e and showed an increase in projected business-as-usual emissions in 2020 compared to the 2012 report. Starting from the estimated total emission reduction potential, and based on the findings of the previous chapters, this chapter provides an overview of options to reduce the emissions gap. The chapter starts by asking whether the gap can be bridged. To answer this question, the best available estimates of the total emission reduction potential and possible changes in these estimates are discussed. Following this, a summary of options to narrow, and potentially bridge, the emissions gap in 2020 is presented. 6.2 Emission reduction potentials in 2020 and 2030: can the gap be bridged? The options to narrow the emissions gap discussed in the previous chapters of this report \u2013 emission reduction pledges, Chapter 2; national climate and development policies, Chapters 2 and 4; and international cooperative initiatives, Chapter 5 \u2013 all have connections with one another and all will help bridge the emissions gap in 2020. UNEP\u2019s Bridging the Emissions Gap Report (2011a) estimated the total emission reduction potential in 2020 to be in the range of 17 \u00b1 3 GtCO2e 1,2. Table 6.1 provides an overview of emission reduction potentials by sector from the earlier report together with estimates for 2030 from the IPCC (2007). The mid-range of 17 GtCO2e is slightly greater than the estimated difference between business-as-usual emissions in 2020 and the 2020 emissions level consistent with a likely chance of staying within the 2\u00b0 C target of 15 GtCO2e. This indicates that there is still a chance to close the gap by Table 6.1 Estimates of sectoral greenhouse gas emission reduction potentials, 2020 and 2030 Lead authors : Niklas H\u00f6hne (Ecofys, Germany), Anne Olhoff (UNEP Ris\u00f8 Centre, Denmark) Contributing authors: Kornelis Blok (Ecofys, Germany), Taryn Fransen (World Resources Institute, USA) ____________________ 1 Adopting a sectoral bottom-up approach, with marginal costs in the range of 50\u2013100 US $/tCO2e. 2 Assuming that the uncertainties are independent between sectors, which may hold under many cases, an error propagation rule to calculate the range of the sum of the sectors is applied \u2013 that is, the square root of the sum of squares of the range for each sector.

Total emission reduction potentials change over time, reflecting among other things technological development and the speed and comprehensiveness with which policies and options are adopted and implemented. UNEP\u2019s Emissions Gap Report 2012 emphasized that, although the emission reduction potential in 2020 remains high, time is running out with respect to realizing this potential (Chapter 3).

As countries rarely specify a split of their pledge by sector, it is difficult to make a complete assessment of the degree of overlap. Ideally, such overlaps should be taken into account when assessing options for narrowing the emissions gap through additional action. Comprehensive and regular updates of emission reduction potentials are a prerequisite for in-depth assessments of the feasibility of bridging the emissions gap. Unfortunately, the number of new studies published since the 2012 update (UNEP, 2012) is limited and prevents a thorough re- evaluation of the emission reduction potentials in Table 6.1. The new studies do, nonetheless, provide an assessment of the possible take-up of emission reduction options for particular scenarios and specific assumptions regarding policy regimes and carbon prices. They give an indication of current trends for the sectoral emission reduction potentials reported in Table 6.1. Recent developments in the power and transportation sectors point towards possible increases in the emission reduction potentials for 2020 \u2013 modest \u2013 and 2030 \u2013 potentially substantial. More specifically, for the power sector, rapid growth of renewable energy (Breyer, 2011; REN21, 2013) might be able to more than compensate for the limited development reported for nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage reported by the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2013). Some authors highlight that, if the current rate of growth of wind and solar photovoltaic power continues after 2020, decarbonization rates for electricity could be higher than expected in even the most ambitious scenarios, increasing the 2030 emission reduction potential by several GtCO2e (Blok and Van Breevoort, 2011). In the transportation sector, a rapid decline of carbon- dioxide emissions per vehicle kilometre for passenger cars is observed (IEA, 2013). Less is known about other parts of the transportation sector. A study for 2030 shows that implementation of appropriate policies for vehicle efficiency, modal shift and activity reduction could lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 5.8 GtCO2e in 2030, compared to a business-as-usual scenario (Fa\u00e7anha et al., 2012). This is more than double the potential in 2030 given in Table 6.1, although developments in other parts of the transport sector would need to be factored in. Progress in the manufacturing industry and building sectors is limited and raises concerns about the feasibility of achieving its mid-range potential by 2020. For the manufacturing industry current uptake of energy-efficient technology is moderate according to the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2013). However, large developing countries such as China and India now have substantial industrial energy efficiency programmes in place, although the actual impact of these is difficult to quantify at this stage. Given the limited level of implementation globally, the remaining potential in 2020 is likely to be closer to the lower end of the range rather than the higher. Since a large part of the potential is retrofit and add-on technology, the estimate of the 2030 potential is probably still valid. The building sector shows limited progress, according to \u00dcrge-Vorsatz et al. (2012) and the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2013), who claim that a large untapped potential exists. This raises concern about the feasibility of reaching the 2020 potentials and also makes it difficult to make a statement about the change in potential for 2030. Similarly for agriculture and forestry, the limited level of actual implementation of policies may limit the feasibility to achieve the higher ends of the range of emission reduction potentials for 2020. To conclude, the findings of recent studies are generally consistent with the range of 2020 emission reduction potentials summarised in Table 6.1. However, they do give reason for concern about the feasibility of achieving the potentials by 2020. They also illustrate the need for comprehensive updates of the potentials for each sector for 2020 and 2030, and for tracking progress towards them. Most of all, this section, along with the previous chapters of this report, illustrates that emission reduction potentials will only be realised if strong, long-term and sector-specific policies and policy portfolios are in place at the international and national level (Box 6.1). 6.3 Options to narrow and potentially bridge the emissions gap in 2020 A number of options to narrow the 2020 emissions gap can be identified based on the information of the previous chapters of this report. These range from applying more stringent accounting practices for pledges to increasing the scope of pledges to going beyond them. Figure 6.1 summarizes these options and illustrates how, if implemented together, they have the potential to bridge the emissions gap in 2020.

As described in Chapter 2, the gap can be narrowed by 1-2 GtCO2e by applying more stringent accounting practices for emission reduction pledges, i.e. by moving from lenient to strict rules. This includes: -\ufffd Minimizing the use of lenient land-use credits . -\ufffd Minimizing the use of surplus emission units -\ufffd Avoid double counting of offsets The gap can be further narrowed by 2-3 GtCO2e if all countries were to move from their unconditional to their more ambitious conditional pledges. This would require the fulfilment of the conditions on those pledges and the swift implementation of policies to deliver the additional reductions. These conditions include expected action of other countries as well as the provision of adequate financing, technology transfer and capacity building. Alternatively it would imply that conditions for some countries be relaxed or removed. These two approaches, applying more stringent accounting practices plus implementing the more ambitious pledges, leads to a reduction of the emissions gap of 4 GtCO2e. The gap can be further narrowed by other actions aimed at increasing the scope of current pledges: -\ufffd Coverage of all emissions in national pledges (up to 0.5 GtCO2e): some country pledges cover only a part of a country\u2019s total emissions. For example some countries have pledges to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and have not specified actions for the other greenhouse gases. This would apply to roughly 3 GtCO2e of current emissions. Assuming these are reduced by 15 percent ____________________ 3 Some countries are set to move in this direction (see Section 2.5) The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 Bridging the gap III: Overview of options 35 \u2022 Box 6.1 Best-practice policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving development goals from the 2012 and 2013 UNEP emissions gap reports The 2012 and 2013 UNEP emission gap reports identify policies for four sectors that have proven successful in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in many different countries, while contributing to national development goals (Chapter 4; UNEP, 2012). Such sector-specific policies have the potential to make a significant contribution to bridging the gap, if scaled up in both ambition and geographical reach. Agriculture \u2013 Promotion of no-tillage practices: no-till refers to direct seeding under the mulch layer of the previous season\u2019s crop, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from soil disturbances and fossil-fuel use by farm machinery. \u2013 Improved nutrient and water management in rice production: includes innovative cropping practices such as alternate wetting and drying and urea deep placement that reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions. \u2013 Agroforestry: consists of different agricultural management practices that all deliberately include woody perennials on farms and the landscape, and which promote a greater uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by biomass and soils. Buildings These policies lower energy use and therefore reduce carbon-dioxide and other emissions: \u2013 Building codes: regulatory instruments that set standards for specific technologies or energy performance levels and that can be applied to both new buildings and retrofits of existing buildings. \u2013 Appliance standards: regulations that prescribe the energy performance of manufactured products, sometimes prohibiting the sale of products that are below a minimum level of efficiency. \u2013 Appliance labels: energy-efficiency labels that are fixed to manufactured products to describe the products\u2019 energy performance. Endorsement labels are seals of approval that are awarded if energy-saving criteria are met. Comparative labels allow consumers to compare performance among similar products. Forests These policies slow down deforestation and thereby reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions: \u2013 Protected areas: designating some forested areas as protected areas. \u2013 Command-and-control measures: enacting and enforcing environmental regulations and putting adequate monitoring systems in place to ensure compliance. \u2013 Economic instruments: using economic tools such as taxes, subsidies, and payments for ecosystem services for encouraging forest conservation. Transport These policies reduce energy use and therefore reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions: \u2013 Transit-oriented development: the practice of mixing residential, commercial and recreational land uses to promote high-density neighbourhoods around public transit stations. \u2013 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT): key elements of bus rapid transit include frequent, high-capacity service; higher operating speeds than conventional buses; separated lanes; distinct stations with level boarding; and fare prepayment and unique branding. \u2013 Vehicle performance standards: establish minimum requirements based on fuel consumption or greenhouse gas emissions per unit of distance travelled by certain vehicle classes. These policies do not represent a comprehensive list. Moreover, some best-practice policies will be more appropriate and successful in reducing emissions in some countries than in others. Their success also depends on how stringently they are implemented.

Some ozone precursors and black carbon are not covered by national pledges, but are already assumed to be reduced in the calculations of the gap. Missing out on these reductions would increase the gap by a rough equivalent of 1\u20132 GtCO2e (Hare et al., 2012; UNEP, 2011b). 6.4 Conclusions This chapter illustrates that it is difficult to estimate the impact of various options for reducing emissions and narrowing the gap. For this reason it would be beneficial to set up an objective accounting system for tracking progress towards closing the gap. Also, comprehensive updates of emission reduction potentials in different sectors would provide invaluable information for decision making as we move closer to 2020. Importantly, this chapter shows that applying more stringent accounting practices, implementing more ambitious pledges, and increasing the scope of current pledges, will bring the world halfway to bridging the gap. The remaining gap can be bridged through further national and international action, including international cooperative initiatives. As shown in the beginning of this chapter this is technically possible. Figure 6.1 Overview of options to narrow the emissions gap in 2020 by 2020, the order of magnitude of pledges made by other countries, the resulting reduction would be 0.5 GtCO2e. -\ufffd New pledges by countries that have not yet pledged (up to 1 GtCO2e): some countries have not yet put forward pledges. Aggregated emission levels from those countries amounted to roughly 7 GtCO2e in 2010. If they were to reduce emissions by 15 percent by 2020, which is the order of magnitude of pledges made by other countries, the resulting reduction in emissions would be 1 GtCO2e. -\ufffd Additional reductions from sectors not covered by national pledges (0.3 GtCO2e): Some sectors, notably international transport, are not covered by national pledges. The mitigation potential in these sectors is 0.3 GtCO2e (UNEP, 2011a). These three actions to increase the scope of current pledges would further reduce the gap by up to 1.8 GtCO2e. Adding together the more stringent accounting practices, the more ambitious pledges, and the increased scope of current pledges, reduces the gap by around 6 GtCO2e, or about a half. The remaining gap can be bridged through further national and international action, including international cooperative initiatives. These initiatives may partly overlap with national pledges, but can also be additional to these pledges. If they are additional and implemented rapidly, they have the potential to substantially reduce the gap by 2020 (Blok et al., 2012). 37 The Emissions Gap Report 2013 \u2013 References 37 References Chapter 1 Adaptation Fund (2012) Trustee presentation: Update on sta- tus of resources and CER monetization.

PHOTO: REUTERS Endnotes: 1 Also known as global environmental goals. The compilation of the goals is ongoing and available at http://geg.informea.org/ THE MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY 2018-2021 2 The new agenda acknowledges the integrated nature of the many challenges that humanity faces, from gender inequality to inadequate infrastructure and from youth unemployment to environmental degradation. In the preamble to the 2030 Agenda, world leaders affirmed that they were determined to protect the planet from degradation, including through sustainable consumption and production, sustainable manage- ment of its natural resources and urgent action on climate change, so that it could support the needs of present and future generations. A synthesis report of the United Nations Secretary-General on the post-2015 sustainable development agenda states that the 2030 Agenda represents a truly universal and transformational course for sustainable development. Achieving the 2030 Agenda will require a new paradigm for sustainable development in which work on issues such as health, education and, critically, the environment, is no longer conducted in silos, but is intrinsically linked. Over 86 targets in the 2030 Agenda are concerned with environmental sustain- ability, including at least one in each of the 17 Goals. Within this framework, the medium-term strategy of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) for the period 2018 - 2021 is informed by relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations Environment Assembly, the General Assembly and the UNEP Governing Council, and by the strategies and plans of multilateral environmental agreements and other inter- nationally agreed environmental goals.1 Taking these directives as its starting point, UNEP will exercise its leadership role in the United Nations system and with other partners on environmental matters, which will entail promoting coherence in the way the United Nations system integrates the environment into sustain- able development. Within its mandate, UNEP will also support countries in their efforts to become more environmentally sustainable, while balancing the integration of the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development. The medium-term strategy sets out an analysis of the signi\ufb01cant environmental challenges that the world will face in the coming years (section 2). Climate change remains a pressing issue and must be addressed through enhanced adaptation and a reduc- tion in greenhouse gas emissions. Equally important is resilience to industrial accidents, con\ufb02icts and natural disasters, which are becoming more frequent and more damaging with the warming climate. Biodiversity is key to maintaing healthy and productive ecosystems, which in turn are necessary for conserving \ufb02ora and fauna, and to providing a large range of ecosystem services such as drinking water and secure food systems. There is a need to make better use of our natural resources for economic and social growth, to improve management of waste and chemical products and set up effective laws, policies and institutions to govern actions that affect the environment. There is also a need to monitor the state of the planet\u2019s health in order to gain a better understanding of the full extent of the challenges faced. The medium-term strategy recognizes that achieving the environ- mental objectives of sustainable development takes time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1667729b-9a38-4415-8743-9be0f7d4dc85": {"__data__": {"id_": "1667729b-9a38-4415-8743-9be0f7d4dc85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Medium Term Strategy 2018-2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c8cf93643a45980e28da697831c5214b065046a7d505c1754e0a541763fec10"}, "2": {"node_id": "183900b8-e822-401e-ab89-898f1ede9089", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4767cd545babbc42ebb05a7b401e25225b996d8ae1ed46eaee67e9ad7c3a173"}}, "hash": "ec249c36950f3bb759723c9364a507ec0a8c8c0e029fa53a7b370b9b314a9fb5", "text": "It acknowledges this important lesson by de\ufb01ning an ambitious 2030 vision for UNEP (section 3) and aligning itself with the principles contained in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d, as well as the 2030 Agenda.

The strong focus of UNEP on results is mirrored by its approach to evaluation, as detailed in section 8. Such measures will ensure that UNEP is better positioned to address environmental challenges and ultimately build a healthier, more sustainable world for all. In September 2015, the General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda) and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which cut across disciplines, sectors and institutional mandates. 3 THE MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY 2018-2021 SITUATION ANALYSIS Mountain landscape in Afghanistan where, since 2002, UNEP has taken an active role in laying the foundations for sustainable development, working with the government and other stakeholders to overcome serious land and resource degradation.

The world environment is continuously evolving and UNEP must operate within that context. Many of our most pressing environmental challenges are driven by large, transformative global forces that impact everyone on the planet. Resource ef\ufb01ciency and changing demographics By 2050, population growth will put further pressure on the planet\u2019s ecosystems and the goods and services they provide. Growing food and water scarcity will make it even harder for people living in developing countries to eat a healthy diet, access clean water and practice good hygiene (\ufb01gure 1). Growing demographic pressures, compounded by patterns of over-consump- tion, will deplete our supply of natural resources and increase waste production, resulting in negative social, health and economic consequences. Escalating resource use is causing signi\ufb01cant environmental pressure to the extent that a business-as- usual scenario could more than triple global resource extraction and per capita CO2 emissions by the middle of the twenty-\ufb01rst century (\ufb01gure 2).3 The depletion of natural resources will hinder long-term economic growth, while exacerbating global inequalities. At the same time, intensive mining, logging, agribusiness and oil and gas extraction could \u2013 if poorly managed \u2013 increase the risk of environment degradation and pollution, potentially triggering tensions in local communities. Urbanization is another important driving force for environmental change. The urban population, as a proportion of the overall population, is expected to rise to 70 per cent by 2050,4 by which time the world\u2019s cities will be generating 75 per cent of global waste and greenhouse gas emissions (\ufb01gure 3). However, a more concentrated population presents a strategic opportunity to improve environmental sustainability, as more people can be more easily reached.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ba53c56-f470-40ce-9cbe-415a724f2c20": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ba53c56-f470-40ce-9cbe-415a724f2c20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Medium Term Strategy 2018-2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbb5dc6e61a156e5512bbaeb3d9854b86a45acd553bb72b276f85b566e5b82ad"}, "2": {"node_id": "c13be943-0b47-47ce-a91c-d8282e6a385d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a004a479f713d7f83a0129169c8cbdc86cf71d453514a128f18b5d8d321cdacd"}}, "hash": "d17e4921955d5fdae30fdce9e3947b417c8b6354c0480673a06b82342a5b8289", "text": "FIGURE 2: Implications of per capita resource consumption in three growth and development models 5 THE MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY 2018-2021 global greenhouse gas emissions global waste total world population 50% 54% 2050 60% By 2050, greenhouse gas and global waste from cities will be 75% of the global total (at current rates) Climate Change Climate change continues to be one of the most pervasive and threatening issues of our time, with far-reaching impacts in the twenty-\ufb01rst century.5 Temperature changes and sea-level rise are already affecting human well-being in many places, including coastal zones and small island developing States.6 According to data set out in the \ufb01fth edition of the UNEP Global Environment Outlook (GEO-5) and the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate change is also putting signi\ufb01cant pressure on ecosystems.

Climate change is expected to have major and unprecedented social and economic implica- tions on where people can settle, grow food, build cities, and rely on functioning ecosystems for the services they provide. The effects are likely to hit women harder than men, particularly in developing countries, given that women represent the majority of the world\u2019s poor and are often more socially excluded. Since 2000, natural disasters have killed more than 1.1 million people and affected another 2.7 billion, with \ufb02oods, droughts and windstorms the most frequent events.7 Climate change could sharply increase the number of people forced from their homes as a result of land degradation and extreme weather events, which in turn can increase environmental pressures in the areas they \ufb02ee to. The UNEP Adaptation Gap Report 2014 stated that even if global greenhouse gas emissions are cut to the level required to keep the rise of global temperature below 2\u00b0C in the twenty-\ufb01rst century, the cost of adapting to climate change in developing countries is likely to reach two to three times the previous estimates of $70 billion -$100 billion per year by 2050.8 Member States meeting at the twenty-\ufb01rst session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December 2015 adopted a universal agreement aiming to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty. It sets the world on a course to a zero-carbon, resilient, prosperous and fair future. The Paris Agreement will capitalize and accelerate the momentum created by the intended nationally determined contributions submitted by Member States and the remarkable momentum from non-State actors. The Emissions Gap Report 2015 of UNEP assessed 119 intended nationally determined contributions that countries submitted to the secretariat of the Framework Convention on Climate Change by 1 October 2015. It found that efforts to tackle climate change, including those taken before the Paris agreement was adopted and before the full imple- mentation of the intended nationally determined contributions, could cut up to 11 GtCO2e from projected emissions in 2030, which is around half of the total required to reach the global emission level (42 GtCO2e in 2030) consistent with a likely chance of staying below the \u201csafe\u201d level of a global FIGURE 3: Current impact of cities in global greenhouse emissions, global waste and total population Since 2000 more than, 1.1 million people have been killed by natural disasters and 2.7 billion people affected SITUATION ANALYSIS 6 3 Billion rely on solid fuels, traditional biomass \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd traditional stoves for cooking and heating 4.3 Million die prematurely from illnesses resulting from impacts of indoor air pollution annually 1.1 Million deaths from acute lower respiratory infections among children less than 5 years old 3.7 Million deaths attributed to outdoor air pollution temperature rise of 2\u00b0C by 2100 9. There continues to be an unprecedented level of global recognition of climate change and a growing willingness to take signi\ufb01cant action through the Convention to combat climate change and its impacts, including by non-State actors10 and through clean energy use. Chemicals, waste and air quality Cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other non-commu- nicable diseases, many of which are associated with air and water pollution, are on the rise. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa alone account for 40 per cent of the global burden of disease. In almost all countries, per capita health-care expenditure is rising faster than per capita income; in some countries, health-care expenditure will increase from 20 per cent to 30 per cent of gross domestic product by 2024. How is this an environmental challenge? Better and sound management of chemicals and waste and improved water and air quality can signi\ufb01cantly lower disease rates, especially among vulnerable groups. For example, by 2030, measures taken by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer may prevent up to two million cases of skin cancer globally per year. Reducing environmental stress will reduce health risks in vulnerable groups, but this can only be achieved through an integrated approach, with partners across the environment and health sectors working together. Climate change is not the only major concern regarding the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Figure 4 shows other factors related to air pollution. The \ufb01gures given are more than double those of previous estimates and con\ufb01rm that air pollution is among the world\u2019s largest environmental health risks.11 A study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Devel- opment found that, in 2010, the cost of air pollu- tion in China was approximately $1.4 trillion, while", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fa6a921-614a-4739-84bc-7707f0b8c1d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fa6a921-614a-4739-84bc-7707f0b8c1d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Medium Term Strategy 2018-2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02fb5a9be865bf5f7c0253f543056ccb8fc2cc67789c74fec76c305e13e9fcf0"}, "3": {"node_id": "b4716af8-6223-4203-b794-bf3cd986d7fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bac3f8b6aab18c6885a2b4aa3f60b06c05e5b98985b9422c837fac83eaf42aa8"}}, "hash": "9198a1a5675111fcef5d13146ea6d89698b9598e34fd23ad780226dcbf561e92", "text": "Europe lost around $140 billion to $230 billion due to reduced air quality in 2009.

Similarly, industrial chemicals and hazardous and other wastes, including electronic waste (e-waste), require continued efforts. As the fastest-growing waste stream in the world, estimated at 20-50 million tonnes per year,12 e-waste is becoming a major environmental challenge.13 Emerging data show that the costs of using and producing harmful chemicals is quite high in terms of economic costs, health impacts, environmental degradation and effects on development planning. In its resolution 1/5, on chemicals and waste, the United Nations Environ- ment Assembly affirmed that a new approach was needed to minimize the risks of novel technologies and chemicals.14 Healthy and productive ecosystems We must help the planet to become more resilient to change by sustainably managing forests, combating deserti\ufb01cation, addressing land degradation, halting biodiversity loss and, more broadly, by protecting, restoring and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. These have all been identi\ufb01ed as priority issues by the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity,15 and the 10-year strategic plan to enhance the implementation of United Nations Convention to Combat Deserti\ufb01cation in those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Deserti\ufb01cation, Particularly in Africa (2008 - 2018). Oceans face signi\ufb01cant threats, such as over\ufb01shing, climate change and pollution.16 Marine debris is found in all parts of the ocean and is harming wildlife, \ufb01sheries and coastal economies, which poses a potential health risk to humans given that plastic and harmful chemicals ingested by marine wildlife and seabirds can be transported through the food chain. Micro- plastics17 are also increasingly used in a wide range of goods, such as toothpastes and facial cleaners.18 The UNEP Regional Seas Programme and the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activi- ties are leading the response to the United Nations Environment Assembly resolution 1/6 on marine plastic debris and microplastics. According to the Global Biodiversity Outlook 4,19 pressures on biodiversity will continue to increase at least until 2020 and, as a result, biodiversity will continue to decline. The Global Risks Perception Survey 2014 highlighted that three of the top ten risks over the next ten years will be environmental, with one of the top three being biodiversity loss. The degradation of freshwater and marine ecosystems will increasingly affect biodiversity20 and the provision of important goods (such as food, water, \ufb01bre and fuel) and services (such as nutrient cycling, puri\ufb01cation, \ufb02ood and climate regulation) that sustain human existence and livelihoods.21 GEO-5 and other key scienti\ufb01c reports such as Global Biodiversity Outlook 4 indicate that unsus- tainable exploitation of resources, compounded by climate change and pollution of the air, land and water, including habitat changes and the spread of invasive alien species, will result in substantial biodiversity loss. This will negatively affect the status and functioning of ecosystems and the provision of ecosystem services, with subsequent impacts on food security, livelihoods and poverty reduction efforts. Examples are the collapse of \ufb01sheries, the alteration of hydrological cycles and the loss of species used for medicinal purposes.

Keeping the environment under review Earth systems are being pushed to their biophysical limits and there is evidence that those limits are either close to being reached or have already been exceeded. They include changes to the bio-geochem- ical cycles (especially nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus), biodiversity loss and climate change. Half of the Sustainable Development Goals have an environmental focus or address the sustainability of natural resources. At least one target in each of the 17 Goals concerns environmental sustainability, meaning that progress on one cannot be achieved if there is no progress on others. Goals with an environ- mental focus include Goal 6 (ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all), Goal 7 (ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all), Goal 9 (build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation), Goal 11 (make cities and human settle- ments inclusive, safe, resilient and sustain- able), Goal 12 (ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns), Goal 13 (take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts), Goal 14 (conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development) and Goal 15 (protect, restore and promote sustain- able use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustain- ably manage forests, combat deserti\ufb01ca- tion, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss). For the other Goals, a healthy environ- ment is essential for their achievement. To track progress towards these and other global environmental goals, UNEP estab- lished six regional environmental informa- tion networks (REIN) and developed a common approach within the Global Environment Outlook (GEO) for indicator-based reporting and assess- ment to keep the environment under review. The biennial REIN meetings and regular GEO assessments could play an important role in delivering the evidence base for reviewing progress on the environ- mental dimension of sustainable develop- ment. If a four-yearly cycle is adopted for the Global Sustainable Development Report, the United Nations Environment Assembly would be able to ensure an effective review of the environment dimensions of the Goals through the regular GEO regional and global assess- ment processes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05470e8c-0325-479f-ab18-b891c7f4a8fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "05470e8c-0325-479f-ab18-b891c7f4a8fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Medium Term Strategy 2018-2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0229a2c642bbfcb93eddffb9642f1a72e0174cda17cd16239c3a2df6f47e13d"}, "2": {"node_id": "25066684-e8f5-46b2-a588-d3cc1302b96c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27f5d3bf8eee7f814070a0866e9683abe6cac9eaefbee905975ecf7ee70d2982"}}, "hash": "54d888b6fdbc66674154205961f2df611c1b341d1e341c7abc3e7775f4005124", "text": "Necessary tools and follow-up on the link between science and policy will be developed to provide guidance on global norms and standards for keeping the environment under review, to strengthen science-policy partnerships and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89bf6443-b885-4e51-8305-c5a08efc443a": {"__data__": {"id_": "89bf6443-b885-4e51-8305-c5a08efc443a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Medium Term Strategy 2018-2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5569327df888158b7febc2cfbc1bda9614ca8b81941cf05f84ff5ee2eabae7e"}, "3": {"node_id": "cd4d6e4b-3cf8-4992-814e-96abbfd03343", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/medium-term-strategy-2018-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c95bf6af8a6f1639078cc742f79916098a03bb9c94ad8fcb4e49c3e910ecbe5f"}}, "hash": "00ea3f397fa027fbbcb6e161ce8e4953b1a58b1477e1c3a863479554fc2e4403", "text": "to ensure prompt action on emerging issues and thematic follow-up and review.

This will not only foster the environmental dimension of sustainable development but also bring socioeconomic bene\ufb01ts. The period 2018-2021 will provide a stepping stone for UNEP to realize the vision for 2030. Environment in sustainable development The challenge of UNEP in the 2030 Agenda is to develop and enhance integrated approaches to sustainable development \u2013 approaches that will demonstrate that improving the health of the environment will bring social and economic bene\ufb01ts. An effective, integrated approach will ensure that the environment underpins prosperity; that environmental degrada- tion does not result in large social and economic costs; and that all countries and all sectors of society stand to bene\ufb01t, including across generations. Together with other internationally agreed environ- mental goals, the universal, inclusive and integrated scope of the 2030 Agenda offers UNEP a 15-year window of opportunity. UNEP will enable countries to balance environmental, social and economic objectives while promoting social develop- ment, sustained and inclusive economic growth and environmental protection for the bene\ufb01t of all. The full integration of the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustain- able development must take three factors into account. First, sustainable natural resource use is increasingly critical to economic and social development. Second, the regular review by UNEP of the state of the environment shows a reduction over time of social and economic costs as a result of gradual improvements in environ- mental sustainability. Third, compared to the rest of the population, marginalized and vulnerable groups enjoy greater social and economic bene\ufb01ts from the integration of environmental considera- tions into development planning. Such an integrated approach results in a more equitable distribution of resources, leading to healthier men, women and children. In an effort towards achieving the 2030 Agenda, UNEP will work with local econo- mies and partners such as the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in promoting healthy cities. UNEP will, within its mandate, also take a lead with partners on tackling challenges presented with transboundary resources such as marine issues. Science is fundamental in providing answers to some of the most pressing sustainability issues of the twenty-\ufb01rst century. Strengthening the science-policy interface to inform society of the risks and opportunities of new developments is therefore at the heart of the work of UNEP across the organization. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development recognized the green economy as a pathway to achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication. Building on this, an inclusive green economy is low-carbon, efficient and clean in production, but also inclusive in consumption and outcomes, resulting in improved human well-being and social equity, while signi\ufb01cantly Labourers collect rice saplings in Karjat, India.

They also stated the importance of working to build a dynamic, sustainable, innovative and people-centred economy that would particularly promote youth employment and the economic empowerment of women.30 While the focus of UNEP is on the environmental dimension of sustainable development through partner- ships, an inclusive green economy also brings social and economic bene\ufb01ts. It does this by adopting a more inclusive approach and encouraging investment in skills for future capacity, creating new jobs, providing livelihoods and reducing the risk of poverty. It goes beyond allocation and production aspects of the economy to include social aspects such as consumption and distribution. The approach proposes a more strategic allocation of resources to green sectors and the greening of brown sectors; more sustainable consumption; efficient, cleaner and safer production; and greater equity in the outcomes through public policies related to production and consump- tion decisions. It recognizes that there are many and diverse pathways to environmental sustainability. UNEP will deliver on the three dimen- sions of sustainable development for improved environmental outcomes through inclusive green economy pathways. An inclusive green economy acknowledges the centrality of the environ- ment to human well-being and explores the critical role of \ufb01nance, technology, sustainable trade and institutions in creating the necessary conditions for addressing environmental and social challenges for sustainable development. The drivers of reducing environmental degradation are largely in the realm of governance, policy space and the institutions that support governance and policy decisions. This is where an inclusive green economy approach, together with a range of enabling conditions, can achieve environmental sustainability.

As well as supporting the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, UNEP will focus on longer-term results by using an outcome map approach where the medium-term strategy sets out outcomes and impacts that UNEP will achieve by 2030, as well as outcomes for each intervening medium- term strategy period. Greater integration within UNEP and collaboration with other organiza- tions: sustainable development is a universal agenda; it compels society to think in terms of shared responsibilities for a shared future. Success is unlikely to come from any single player working on its own. It demands integration, a collabo- rative approach and policy coherence, both internally and externally. UNEP has enshrined these valuable lessons in operating principles. Internally, UNEP will better integrate how it works across its subprogrammes to be universal in appli- cation and provide a strategic regional presence. Externally, UNEP will create synergy through strategic partnerships and better integrate normative frameworks. Improved results-based budgeting facilitates better prioritization: the changing and increasingly complex operating context is creating new demands for the deployment of a planning and budgeting process that is agile and can Volunteers, including children, pick up trash along the seashore during a clean up drive at Freedom Island in Las Pi\u00f1as City, Manila, Philippines.

UNEP is now seeking to create a stronger linkage between inputs, outputs and outcome- level results in strengthening the budget and continuing the journey towards results-based budgeting. Better-synchronized planning cycles will improve the speed of delivery: while sequential planning allows for the medium-term strategy and programme of work to be clearly de\ufb01ned before a project portfolio can be con\ufb01rmed, a tandem development will improve delivery speed. UNEP will develop its project portfolio in tandem with the medium-term strategy and programme of work.

UNEP will also build on lessons learned in previous medium-term strategy cycles, and strengthen the connections and synergies among subprogrammes both through internal arrangements for planning, delivery and budgeting, and performance indicators. Where possible, UNEP will collect sex-disaggregated and age-disaggregated data to inform project design and monitor project progress and achievements.

Realizing the 2030 vision requires countries to systematically use best-practice environ- mental management to prevent and reduce the impacts of disasters and con\ufb02icts.36 It also means that Member States, supported by the international community, will need to respond to such environmental emergencies in a robust way and be in a position to implement appropriate sustainable practices rapidly after a crisis. The medium-term strategy for the period 2018\u20132021 will focus on integrating best-practice environmental approaches into the key prevention, response and recovery policies and plans of countries and the international community at the request of affected Member States. Subsequent medium-term strategy cycles will broaden, embed and institutionalize these approaches in order to deliver the 2030 impact, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030 provides the justi\ufb01cation and context for the prevention work of UNEP, recognizing that sustainable ecosystem manage- ment is an important mechanism for reducing risks from natural and technological disasters by buffering impacts and avoiding long-term environ- mental threats to health and livelihoods. In addition, the Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit, a partnership between UNEP and the Office for the Coordina- tion of Humanitarian Affairs established in 1995, provides an entry point to the humanitarian community, enabling UNEP to respond rapidly to environ- mental emergencies and to improve the environmental performance of the humanitarian sector in line with General Assembly resolution 46/182, on the strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian emergency assistance of the United Nations.

UNEP will work in partnership with Governments, the private sector and the international community, in accordance with respective mandates, helping them to address disasters and con\ufb02icts by providing technical, science-based advice to demonstrate how preparedness and improved environmental management reduce risks; to assess environmental impacts of crisis; and to catalyse more effective and sustainable responses. Critical drivers for the success of the subprogramme are the effective expan- sion of partnerships and the scaling-up and appropriate tailoring of successful pilot approaches from local to regional scales. Success also rests on the continued political support of national and inter- national stakeholders. Risks include an increase in uncontrollable factors such as extreme weather and deteriorating ecosystems.

To realize this 2030 vision, the subpro- gramme on healthy and productive ecosystems seeks to align the growing need for ecosystem goods and services with biodiversity conservation and the long-term functioning of ecosystems. The expected accomplishments are closely linked to the Sustainable Development Goals and the goals and targets of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020,37 the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and other ecosystem-related multilateral environ- mental agreements.38 The baseline and progress towards the 2030 outcome and impact will be measured through Goal indicators related to biodiversity and the health and productivity of ecosystems.39 The transition to ecosystem manage- ment that safeguards biodiversity and the long-term functioning of ecosystems and their contributions to the delivery of the 17 Goals requires long-term engagement and behaviour change across many sectors. UNEP will focus on assisting countries in achieving the Goals, implementing multilateral environmental agreements and both the short- and long-term processes that lead to integrated ecosystem management. To address the causes of ecosystem degra- dation and to promote the safeguarding and restoration of ecosystems, UNEP and its partners will provide countries with tools, best practice and support on cross- sector collaboration around ecosystem management. UNEP will also strengthen partnerships40 to institutionalize the ecosystem approach across society, e.g., in education, monitoring, economic decision-making and cross-sector and transboundary collaboration frameworks.41 Building on the ground-breaking work of UNEP on the economics of natural capital and spatially explicit data on biodiversity and ecosystem services, UNEP will help countries to integrate natural capital into measurements of progress on sustainable development and public and private economic decision-making. A key driver for successful delivery is the ability of UNEP to build strong partnerships and normative processes across sectors and to generate guidelines and knowledge-exchange that can help countries to manage and restore their Managing ecosystems to protect and restore their long-term functioning and supply of goods and services The Alto Madre de Dios river, part of the Man\u00fa Biosphere Reserve, Peru.

The Goals can further- more inspire countries to broaden their develop- ment agendas to include ecosystem health and a sufficient supply of natural resources. Many recent technological advances have further expanded our capacity to deal with big data and increase transparency around the positive and negative ecosystem-related externalities of societal choices. Key risks are the technical complexity of cross-sector approaches and the long time frame for ecosystem change, which often occurs at a slower pace than economic and political decision-making processes. These risks are countered by the 2030 Agenda, which provides an opportunity to link ecosystem management to multiple objectives and targets across sectors, and thus measure integrated ecosystem management against several sectoral targets. The Goals also provide an opportunity to drive a step change in the use of the ecosystem approach, encouraging its use in decision-making across all sectors of society.

The comparative advantage of UNEP lies in its leading role on the environment; its capacity to convene and build consensus at all levels of governance;43 and its key role in interagency mechanisms, including the Environmental Management Group and in promoting the progressive development of environmental law.44 UNEP also has a strong history of helping Governments to strengthen their institutions, including for the development and implementation of national legislation, increasingly embedding gender considerations into its work. Multilateral environmental agreements and inter- nationally agreed environmental goals (particularly the relevant goals, targets and indicators of the 2030 Agenda) provide the normative framework and thematic direction for the work of UNEP on environmental governance. UNEP will focus on relevant targets of Goals 1, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Recognizing that effective environmental govern- ance in\ufb02uences the achievement of results in all environmental \ufb01elds, the subprogramme draws upon and contributes to the implementation of all other subprogrammes. Critical drivers of success include effective partner- ships, collaboration among United Nations agencies and the existence of conducive, national-level governance foundations, all based on respect for the rule of law. UNEP will work on the assumption that the United Nations system will successfully foster effective governance beyond the environ- ment, for instance by promoting the rule of law as a principle of good governance, as effective governance cannot be achieved in isolation.

CHEMICALS, WASTE AND AIR QUALITY CHEMICALS, WASTE AND AIR QUALITY 38 By 2030, the negative environmental and human health impacts from harmful chemicals, hazardous and other waste, and air pollution will be signi\ufb01cantly reduced, contributing to a cleaner planet for all. This vision builds on the United Nations Environment Assembly resolutions on chemicals and waste and on air quality. By achieving the vision, the subprogramme is expected to contribute signi\ufb01cantly to Sustainable Development Goal targets 3.9, 6.3, 7.a, 11.6, 12.4 and 12.5.45 To realize the 2030 vision, several condi- tions must be met. The sound manage- ment of chemicals and waste must be integrated into national and sector-based legislation, policies, plans, budgets and strategies, and into \ufb01scal and institutional frameworks. Knowledge of the hazards and risks of chemicals and waste must be increased, and alternatives promoted, including green, sustainable chemistry within the context of environmentally sound management of chemicals and wastes, taking into account gender differentiated data. Waste prevention should be coupled with product design that minimizes the generation, use and disposal of hazardous substances throughout the product life cycle, especially given the bioaccumulation and negative impact of harmful chemicals. In addition, stakeholders should adopt environmentally sound technologies, especially best available techniques and best environmental practices for the sound management of chemicals and waste, which is also meant to enhance sustainable urban development. To create the conditions for success, UNEP will work to ensure that national and sector-based laws, standards, policies and plans on chemicals, waste management and air quality are fully grounded in the best-available science and technology. UNEP will help countries to strengthen and mainstream their knowledge on endocrine-disrupting chemicals, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals like mercury and lead, chemicals in products, air pollutants such as particulate matter, e-waste, municipal waste and other waste streams. UNEP will also generate the necessary assessments, tools, methods and guidance, and strengthen institutional capacity to help countries implement strategies to reduce the generation of harmful chemicals, waste and air pollut- ants and manage these substances and related processes. The role of UNEP in international frameworks will be further capitalized upon to strengthen its work on air quality during the coming years and beyond. The work of UNEP to promote better air quality will support interventions across cities, nations, regions, and the globe that build capacity and promote the adoption of practices, technologies and incentives Promoting the sound management of chemicals and waste, and improving air quality for a better environment and improved human health A child jumps on the waste products that are used to make poultry feed as she plays in a tannery at Hazaribagh in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Goal target 6.3: By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally. Goal target 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management. Goal target 12.4: By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and signi\ufb01cantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment.

RESOURCE EFFICIENCY 42 By 2030, there is enhanced and sustained prosperity for all, through circular and more efficient use of the planet\u2019s resources and sustainable and equitable consump- tion, transforming economic structures to be greener and more inclusive. The objective of the resource efficiency49 subprogramme is to support the transi- tion towards sustainable consumption and production, decoupling economic growth from unsustainable resource use and negative environmental impact while improving human well- being. This objective is in line with Goal 8 (sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth) and Goal 12 (ensure sustainable consumption and produc- tion patterns). To realize the 2030 vision, policies, frameworks and action plans will be needed to support countries as they transition to sustainable development through multiple pathways, including inclusive green economy and sustainable trade, and sustainable consumption and production. Enhanced institutional capacity in the public and private sectors will equip countries to imple- ment inclusive green economy and sustainable consumption and produc- tion approaches and invest in a shift towards green economies. Sustainable lifestyles and consumption patterns will increase the demand for sustainable and resource-efficient products and services and will support the demand side of the decoupling process, taking into account gender-differentiated data. The strong normative capacities of UNEP, along with its global partnerships, and ability to produce authoritative scienti\ufb01c assessments, policy analysis, knowledge products and tools put the subprogramme in a unique position to steer the global discourse on these issues. UNEP will support the public and private sectors with policy options and capacity development across sectors and value chains, including with policy support, assessments and technical assistance on life cycle-based approaches, green invest- ment, adopting sustainable consumption and production patterns, sustainable Workers ride on a motor rickshaw through an aluminium ingots depot in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, China.

This means reducing the total environmental impact of the production and consumption of goods and services, from raw material extraction to \ufb01nal use, recycling and disposal. The overall objective of resource efficiency is being realized through the promotion of inclusive green economy approaches and sustainable consumption and production patterns. Inclusive green economies are low-carbon, have efficient, clean and circular production systems and are inclusive in outcome and consumption. Sustainable consumption and production refers to the use of services and related products that respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life, while minimizing and decoupling the use of natural resources and harmful materials, as well as the emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardize the needs of future generations.

PHOTO: UNEP UNEP\u2019S BUSINESS MODEL 50 While the operating principles in section 4 de\ufb01ne how UNEP will make choices, the business model (\ufb01gure 6) shows how UNEP will coordinate and focus actions to respond to environmental challenges and realize the 2030 vision. UNEP will support Governments and other United Nations agencies while leading efforts to leverage impact through partnerships and achieve coher- ence and improve collaboration on environmental issues across the United Nations System. UNEP will also monitor and track these impacts to be able to identify change, adjust its business model, enhance its effectiveness and efficiency and communicate achievements and lessons learnt. These themes will run through all of the subprogrammes of UNEP. Through strategic partnerships, UNEP will catalyze transformative change, leverage impact in the environ- mental dimension of sustainable development and contribute to the social and economic dimensions of sustainable development. For example, development banks, health organiza- tions and others can build on the work of UNEP to improve environmental sustainability to accrue bene\ufb01ts in the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development. Member States will bene\ufb01t from the strengthened presence of UNEP in regions and subregions. Supported by the collective contributions of UNEP globally, Member States can engage with UNEP through FIGURE 6: UNEP\u2019s Business Model PROMOTING UNITED NATIONS COHERENCE Catalyzing global, regional and national investment partnership UNEP pilot results, re\ufb01nement of normative products UNEP service Lines based on demand for UNEP services .

UNEP can make a strategic differ- ence, taking advantage of its environmental leadership and strategic partnerships. The regional presence of UNEP will call upon the wider UNEP network expertise to support regional needs. The medium-term strategy will unfold in each region or across regions through the programme of work, in response to regions\u2019 and countries\u2019 priorities, including national follow-up and support in the implementation of the Goals and targets. Subpro- gramme coordinators located in the regions, along with regional-level technical, operational and manage- ment expertise and leadership are being gradually strengthened to drive strategic engagement, particularly in terms of upscaling work through partnerships at the regional level. UNEP will strengthen its communications and fundraising expertise in the regions to support regional delivery. The outcomes of the medium-term strategy in the regions will feed into the global monitoring and reporting systems of UNEP to inform intergovernmental forums, networks, partners and platforms at regional and global levels ,as well as UNEP governance bodies. UNEP service lines are a core element of the business model, which help staff and partners to ensure that their everyday activities are linked in a coherent, consistent manner to the implementation of the strategy. Built on strengths and comparative advantages that create value, the service lines will be central to delivering results in the period 2018-2021 as a step towards 2030 impact.

UNEP, in partnership with United Nations entities, will convene those responsible for social, economic and development policy, in\ufb02uence investment decisions and in\ufb02uence consumer choice. Such an expansion of the constituencies UNEP works with, especially in the economic and social arena, will be a change from previous medium-term strategy periods. A key aim will be to empower the environment sector to mobilize these key constituencies with the support of the convening power of UNEP, within the mandate of UNEP.

Implementation and enforcement of such laws and policies, including those relating to the implementation of and compliance with the multilateral environmental agreements will better support environmental sustainability UNEP will also work with partners to advise on development of \ufb01scal, economic and policy tools and frameworks that take the environment into account, facilitating innovative ways of enhancing \ufb01nance for sustainable development. These frameworks and tools should also provide incentives for private sector investments in sustainable development. Bringing information from different stakeholders together in data gathering, analysis and assessment processes at the national, regional and global levels and improving scienti\ufb01c robustness through UNEP Live, GEO reports and other processes will remain at the core of the medium-term strategy.

PHOTO: REUTERS EVALUATION OF THE STRATEGY 54 The plan proposes a combination of complementary evaluations at different levels that examine different themes. Project evaluations aim to assess project performance and determine the outcomes and impacts stemming from projects. They identify lessons of operational relevance for future project design and implementation. They also feed into the evaluation of subprogrammes by focusing on the role and performance of UNEP in achieving the set of outcomes and impacts that are speci- \ufb01ed in a programme framework and presented in the programme of work. Evaluation of expected accomplishments will be undertaken at the subprogramme level; these evaluations will examine the achievement of results, relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of the delivery of the subprogramme. In addition, UNEP conducts a formative evaluation of the design of the programme of work at the start of each medium-term strategy. These assess the causal relationships embedded in the projects within each programme framework and are aimed at determining whether these projects are optimally linked to the expected accomplishments and the higher-level results. Formative evaluations also help with the identi\ufb01cation of performance measures and key impact drivers that managers can use as they implement their projects and programmes. The Evaluation Office will also selectively undertake evaluations of service lines (for example, communi- cations awareness-raising and outreach) or effective approaches for bridging the science-policy interface. The mid-point of the medium-term strategy, namely the end of the biennium 2018-2019, is marked by a meta-evaluation of the progress made in imple- mentation, which will take the form of a biennial evaluation synthesis report. UNEP will conduct an overall evaluation of the medium-term strategy for 2018-2021 at the end of the medium-term strategy period and will assess progress made towards the achievement of the higher-level results outlined in the strategy. The aim is to provide evaluative evidence on the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementa- tion and delivery of UNEP; identify challenges in medium-term strategy implementation; and provide lessons and recommendations to guide the future strategic direction of the organization and improve programme formulation and implementation. A prominent feature of the medium-term strategy is its results-based orientation captured in the evaluation plan UNEP and WFP working together to assist vulnerable communities in Sudan.

The analysis covers all regions. The issues re\ufb02ected in column 2 (outcomes from the regional environmental information network) and column 3 (emerging issues) of the table below set out the outcomes of the deliberations of six regional environ- mental information network conferences facilitated by UNEP in early 2015. For each region, the issues and trends were identi\ufb01ed through regional consultations held in preparation for the sixth edition of the Global Environment Outlook.

Medium-Term Strategy 2022\u20142025 The United Nations Environment Programme strategy for tackling climate change, biodiversity and nature loss, and pollution and waste from 2022\u20142025. Foreword For 50 years, UNEP has scanned the horizons for environmental change, linked science to policy and decision making, coordinated responses to global environmental challenges, and supported countries in delivering on their environmental mandates. Today, in an era of unprecedented challenges, UNEP\u2019s mandate is more important than ever. As noted by the United Nations Secretary-General, Ant\u00d3nio Guterres, \u201cmaking peace with nature\u201d is the priority for people everywhere. Curbing decades of unsustainable consumption and production that are chipping away at the Earth\u2019s foundations, putting at risk our future on this planet, will be central to overcoming this challenge. Guided by the latest science, UNEP\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy for 2022\u20142025 seeks to deliver a transformational change for people and nature. And it does so by drilling down on the root causes of the three planetary crises of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste. Our aim is to propose solutions in line with a sustainable and just post-COVID-19 recovery. I am very proud to note that this strategy is the result of extensive consultations between UNEP and Member States, stakeholders and partners, including civil society and youth groups, faith-based organizations and the private sector. This engagement has shaped UNEP\u2019s contribution to the 2030 Agenda, but with a 2050 outlook on planetary sustainability for people, prosperity and equity. To accelerate global efforts to deliver the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals in this critical Decade of Action, UNEP\u2019s strategy is geared towards building a United Nations system that is stronger, more coordinated and mutually supportive of environmental action. In line with its mandate, UNEP will seize the opportunities provided by the Decade of Action and demonstrate that a networked and inclusive multilateralism is fundamental to discovering and implementing lasting solutions to global challenges. Nothing short of a transformation is required to address the triple planetary crisis and make peace with nature. It is my hope that UNEP\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy for 2022\u2014 2025 will serve as a vehicle for a transformation that inspires each and every one of us, everywhere and every day, to raise ambition and voice, and catalyze environmental action for people and planet.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}:

Tackling these challenges to achieve climate stability, living in harmony with nature and moving towards a pollution-free planet will require a recalibration of our economies and societies towards more sustainable and equitable models. The Medium-Term Strategy outlines a set of transformative shifts that target the drivers of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and looks at their impact. It maps out the actions needed to reshape our consumption and production patterns towards sustainability, framing UNEP\u2019s contribution in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Decade of Action to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals and beyond. It does so while respecting synergies with the Multilateral Environmental Agreements and in line with their relevant objectives, goals and principles, without prejudice to the outcome of future negotiations. The Medium-Term Strategy will also guide the support provided by UNEP in a manner consistent with other internationally agreed frameworks. It will leverage the United Nations development system reform to engage the wider United Nations system in stronger, more coordinated and mutually supportive environmental action. The programme of work (UNEP/EA.5/3/Add.1) sets out the UNEP\u2019s results framework for the biennium 2022\u20132023, focused on the three strategic objectives outlined in the Medium- Term Strategy. 3. Member States reviewed the road map for the preparation of the Medium-Term Strategy and programme of work at the sixth meeting of the annual subcommittee of the Committee of Permanent Representatives, held in October 2019. The streams of consultation for the preparation of the Medium-Term Strategy and programme of work and budget for 2022\u20132023 were: a. sessions with the Committee of Permanent Representatives; b. discovery sessions with Member States; c. UNEP internal discovery processes, including as part of the transformation process; d. consultations on priorities with strategic partners, including other United Nations entities; e. discovery sessions with Multilateral Environmental Agreement secretariats; and f. discovery sessions with major groups and stakeholders, including children and youth and faith-based organizations, and with the private sector. 4. The Medium-Term Strategy for 2022\u20132025 and the programme of work and budget for 2022\u20132023 build on consultations held with the Committee of Permanent Representatives on 10 December 2019 (on lessons learned), and on 4 June 2020 (on the outcome of the Committee\u2019s \u201cdiscovery sessions\u201d), 14 July, 14 September, 12\u201316 October (during the seventh meeting of the annual subcommittee of the Committee of Permanent Representatives), 19 November and 10 December 2020.

Dave Background 04 | Medium-Term Strategy 2022\u20142025 effects of these drivers of environmental deterioration have been evident for decades (UNEP, 2019d), the scale and pace of the global response to these three crises is failing to reverse or even slow down. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was put in place to boost the collective sense of urgency and accelerate cooperation, but today we are not on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, especially the environment-related ones, which are central to achieving all the goals.1 3. While the importance of linking science to policy and decision making remains stronger than ever, science alone is not enough. Science underpins solutions and actions that can chart a transformational path for the way we live, work and relate to nature. Yet only when sustained by strong environmental governance and supported by enabling macroeconomic policies can science help catalyze a response to the crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution \u2013 a response required to improve well-being, in general, and the lives of the poor and the vulnerable in particular. Science can and must inform and drive financial, economic and behavioral shifts towards sustainable consumption and production patterns to enable transformation at the pace and scale required. Unless we harness the digital revolution as a strategic asset for more inclusive, transparent and innovative outcomes, we will fall short of the urgent responses we need. 4.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30eb65a5-d320-4ece-8ad5-dda7c3e93d79": {"__data__": {"id_": "30eb65a5-d320-4ece-8ad5-dda7c3e93d79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/people-and-planet-unep-strategy-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "For people and planet: the UNEP strategy for 2022\u20132025", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/people-and-planet-unep-strategy-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2151aedfa3a18b47be488185722b6b6cf4f41a9657e407614122eadd19f68119"}, "2": {"node_id": "00b24587-ed3d-41b9-8fa1-db288182345f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/people-and-planet-unep-strategy-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89466157ef71af2417990a7ded27cf22ad90cb0ebd5f28796e6eb45d7e25eaaf"}}, "hash": "86943a49ffabb2c57d1955157722d09ee4158a8360ee729bded9f3f2701c564a", "text": "4.

UNEP was established in 1972 against the backdrop of a series of scientific reports that notified the world that the state of the global environment was in crisis. The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm Conference) provided a science-centred platform for world leaders and policymakers to converge and tackle the drivers of that crisis. As a result, UNEP was tasked with coordinating global responses to environmental challenges and related emerging issues, within and outside the United Nations, while keeping watch over the state of the world\u2019s environment and linking science to policymaking. 2. Today, the world finds itself in a similar situation, but the state of the environment has only worsened. Three interconnected crises\u2014climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution\u2014are putting our economic and social well-being at risk, while undermining opportunities to reduce poverty, and improve lives and livelihoods, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 crisis. Furthermore, they also risk irreversibly changing our relationship with the natural world. These crises are primarily linked to unsustainable patterns of consumption and production, which were recognized at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit) in 1992 as \u201cthe major cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment\u201d (UNCED, 1992). While the Three interconnected crises biodiversity and nature loss pollution and waste climate change 1 3 2 \u201cWith only 10 years left before the 2030 deadline, there is an urgent need to step up action. And every nation, every community and every person can and must make a contribution.\u201d \u2013 Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres Medium-Term Strategy 2022\u20142025 | 05 Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) and its outcome document, The Future We Want (A/ RES/66/288). The strategy proposes a trajectory for UNEP for 2022\u20142025, with strengthening the environmental dimension of the 2030 Agenda as its road map and a forward-looking 2050 perspective for planetary sustainability. It speaks to the central role of UNEP in supporting countries\u2019 work to build their capacity to deliver on their environmental goals and commitments under international agreements. 5. Through this strategy, UNEP places the three environmental crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution at the heart of its work. UNEP will tackle these crises through transformative multi-stakeholder actions that target the root causes and drivers of the crises, delivering deeper and broader impact that can underpin positive social and economic outcomes, while reducing vulnerabilities to support of sustainable development. UNEP will ensure that science remains at the centre of all decision making processes, including on emerging issues, and that environmental rule of law continues to improve global environmental governance, in close cooperation with the Multilateral Environmental Agreements and in the direction set by the 2030 Agenda. UNEP will also collaborate with its many partners, accelerating systemic interventions that engage financial and economic actors, while leveraging the power of digital technologies to scale up environmental sustainability. 6. This four-year strategy illuminates a path through the first half of the Decade of Action so that UNEP can strengthen the collective United Nations response to the crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. The United Nations development system reform presents a tremendous opportunity to empower the United Nations to address global environmental and socioeconomic crises. UNEP will leverage this opportunity to enhance its guiding role, raise ambition and accelerate and scale up progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, in the spirit of the Secretary-General\u2019s Decade of Action. 7.

For example, in 2018, damage from climate-related disasters cost an estimated US$155 billion (UNEP, 2019c). Global economic losses due to decreased labour productivity, increased health care costs and lower crop yields could amount to 1 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2060 (OECD, 2016). Any further progression of climate change increases the risks, specifically those relating to poverty and hunger, health and well-being and access to clean freshwater (UNEP, 2019c). Poor water quality has many associated economic costs, including those related to degradation of ecosystem services; water treatment and health; impacts on economic activities such as agriculture, fisheries, industrial manufacturing and tourism; and lost property value and opportunities for further development. Furthermore, current negative trends in biodiversity and ecosystem integrity undermine progress towards Sustainable Development Goal targets related to poverty, hunger, health, water, climate and cities (IPBES, 2019; UNEP, 2019c). For example, animal pollination is critical to more than 75 per cent of food crops, including many fruits and vegetables and important cash crops of developing countries, such as coffee, cocoa and almonds (IPBES, 2019). Loss of pollinators threatens an annual global commercial crop output of between US$235 billion and US$577 billion (IPBES, 2019). 11. The trajectory of global environmental change is out of line with international goals and objectives. The global community is failing to meet internationally agreed environmental goals. Earth\u2019s mean surface temperature has already warmed by about A rapidly deteriorating environment threatens not only our social and economic well-being but also the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals 8. Expanding human activity and increasingly unsustainable patterns of consumption and production are testing Earth\u2019s environment. In the past 50 years, the global human population has doubled, the extraction of materials has tripled, primary energy production has more than tripled, the economy has grown nearly fivefold and global trade has grown tenfold (UNEP, 2019c). Yet, over 820 million people still suffer from hunger (FAO and others, 2019). Human consumption is set to increase further as population, urbanization and per capita income continue to grow. Per capita consumption in developed countries generally far exceeds that in developing countries. Land, freshwater bodies and oceans are being overexploited for food production, infrastructure, industry and human settlements. Up to 400 million tons of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge and other industrial wastes are released annually into the world\u2019s waters (IPBES, 2019). 9. The accumulating pollution from chemicals and waste and the changing climate, biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, desertification, land degradation and drought are closely related and are reinforcing each other. Global chemical production capacity almost doubled between 2000 and 2017 (UNEP, 2019b). Fertilizers used in agriculture entering coastal ecosystems have produced more than 400 ocean \u201cdead zones\u201d totalling more than 245,000 km2 \u2013 a combined area greater than that of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008). Marine plastics pollution has increased tenfold since 1980 (UNEP, 2019b; 2019c).
