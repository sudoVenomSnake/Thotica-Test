From its focus on prevention services since 2000, BDS found itself increasingly drawn into human rights issues by 2003-4, and by 2006-7, got fully involved into a civil liberties movement. With the courting of arrest and the filing of the PIL against the newly promulgated \u2018Code of Conduct\u2019 for NGOs and Media by the new regime, the community\u2019s participation became more pronounced, overt and even combative.260 The fact that on human rights they could engage media more persistently is testified by their documentation of violations against the community and got positioned into the public domain, and eventually served \u2018as clinching evidence\u2019 for the court261 to pronounce the historic judgment in 2007- 2008. Aligning access to HIV prevention with Human Rights It is clear that having come together on the plank of a focused HIV prevention program, the LGBT community, while advocating on community initiatives, also posited the hardships faced by it within the larger issue of HIV in the country, highlighting the need for more inclusive efforts to address the specific needs of this most-at-risk-population. \u201cBDS was successful in convincing the National AIDS Programme to include men who have sex with men as a key population at higher risk in the National AIDS Strategy.\u201d262 On February 07, 2003, Inter Press Service carried the report \u2018Men Who Have Sex with Men Speak up\u2019 with the predominant message that \u2018metis\u2019 among homosexuals are the key population at higher risk as they have multiple \u2018ta\u2019 partners. The news was part of the coverage of the first Nepal National Consultation Meeting for Male Reproductive and Sexual Health held on February 01 2003.

The fact that community members (mostly staffers of BDS and its affiliate organisations working in HIV care and prevention across districts of Nepal) were as much at the receiving end of atrocities and abuses by authorities very often helped media highlight the critical overlap between the twin issues of HIV risk and harm reduction and LGBT rights. As the forefront community group, BDS\u2019s efforts in this are evident in how it engaged media through alerts, mailers and letters to authorities to this effect263. In effect, as BDS emerged as the sole sounding board for media on LGBT, it also helped bring gaps and challenges in access to HIV services and implementation, including in far off regions, on the public domain. Addressing structural barriers: Some challenges Media was occupied with reporting the many facets of the popular uprising and people\u2019s struggles in the country. Reports of violations suffered by the community did find some spaces on media. However, it was the peg of social injustice - rather than deep seated structural barriers marginalising the community in a far more entrenched manner \u2013 that continued to find appeal with media. Lack of any conscious, informed and strategic effort by the movement and its advocates to deepen media engagement on the issue of structural barriers had a significant impact, particularly on the community\u2019s relationship with stakeholders including the media in the post-judgment phase. Moreover, the fact that the community remained deeply distrustful of media and disinclined to come out in the open only meant that there were no engaging human interest stories \u2013 of individual dilemmas, of relationships, and unsaid family and social negotiations and the deleterious effect of these in abetting their vulnerability to all kinds of life- threatening challenges. Initial bids to \u2018engage\u2019 with the media could not negotiate this resistance, as BDS got consumed more and more into addressing increasing incidences of atrocities and violations against the community. \u201cImpressed with the HIV outreach work our community members could achieve in 2003, a sensitive English journalist at Nepali Times tried to do 101 detailed stories on us and our works. I spoke with all our community friends to speak to her. But when she came, everyone vanished. Finally, it was just me. The story was out,\u201d recounts Sunil Babu Pant. This disconnect, which in many ways pre-empted any deeper and meaningful media engagement with LGBT issues, resulted in a virtual absence of the necessary demystification of their issues on the public domain. The few and far in between independent early attempts on the media in this regard though are recalled with great appreciation and fondness by even the common members of the community. The Himal Khabar journalist and director Kiran Pandey (Nepal) wrote about gay rights early on. Others like Sandeep Chakai contributed significantly with their writings on our issues in the early days. The weekly evening programme \u2018Sangharsh\u2019 by Arti Chato on national TV proved to be a great mover as it raised our gender issue nationally. These and such others like Sudeshna Sarkar in India have been the true early media inspirations that helped bring our issues to light in a positive and balanced manner\u201d. Response in an FGD with young transgender members at BDS. Enhancing sexuality and HIV prevention education In the early phase there was a \u201cclear separation between our project activities and participating in the wider movement\u201d, admitted Sunil Babu Pant. As part of project commitments, BDS leveraged its HIV and AIDS and Sexual Reproductive Health mandate to focus on strengthening community awareness. A series of periodic newsletters, both in Nepali and English, which began being published by BDS for circulation within the community across districts of Nepal, clearly show that HIV education got built into a larger aim of \u2018using dissemination to empower and bring the community together\u2019264. No doubt, it helped strengthen, in particular, the MSM and gay identities, as it advanced HIV education. Beginning 2004 until 2006-7, the publication of Blue Diamond and the vernacular Neel Heera series of newsletters show a visible intensity, with their periodicity varying between weekly, fortnightly, and later monthly, with more gloss and the look of a general interest magazine. The content too shows gradual evolution \u2013from being limited to news and updates on community affairs from across the globe in 2004-5, to including support from highly recognisable popular celebrities; discussing issues of wider significance such as sex education, development support; and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09ca4c01-0652-40f7-b2fb-0714d50a2775": {"__data__": {"id_": "09ca4c01-0652-40f7-b2fb-0714d50a2775", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e585f90752ae6511ec0fa6ffbd3d569ada3121148607a9e366a451abb19ab3a"}}, "hash": "4e585f90752ae6511ec0fa6ffbd3d569ada3121148607a9e366a451abb19ab3a", "text": "also celebrating talents and milestones achieved by people with alternative gender and sexual identities. At the same time, these campaign publications were solely \u2018for-the-community and by-the-community\u2019, and \u2018we circulated these only among the fraternity\u2019, noted Sunil Pant. Not only did media not show any recall of these265, we also could not come across any instance where the content or a story in a community publication triggered a story by media. Clearly, community dissemination remained distanced, and even aloof, from the way public domain was responding to its issues. However, there are many instances of these community publications carrying stories published earlier on media of violations faced or assertions by the community.266 In the later phase, post the court judgment, BDS addressed the gap by undertaking wider public education through paid programmes on the national television channel, and later also, on FM radio.267 It is important to ascertain if this sequencing was deliberate on the part of the community leadership or if it emerged from the compulsions created by broader socio-political happenings and developments. Responding to this query, Sunil Babu Pant was clear that the strategic choices made by BDS and the LGBT community were clearly one of opting to work and intervene at multiple levels. \u201cAs far as I was concerned, yes between 10.00 am to 5.00 pm I was obliged to focus on the projects and work we have committed, but after 5 p.m. I was not in any way answerable to donors. I was fully engaged with the wider struggles and movement.\u201d Surge in positive media coverage As the wider social democratic struggles in the country was entering a fresh phase around 2007-8, the landmark legal milestones attained by the community catapulted it to the centre stage of public discourse. Especially from the announcement of the Supreme Court directive in November 2007 to end discrimination against LGBT communities and ensure The MSM and Transgender Persons (LGBT) Movement in Nepal: Role and Engagement of Media A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 102 equal rights for them to the final order in late 2008, media celebrated the historic gains, often illustrating its historic significance in reclaiming the rights of these communities the world over.268 Analysis of media reports show that both national and international media continued to toast and give prominence to this significant and historic development way up to 2012.269 Clearly, in the public domain, the gains reverberated with the wider public opinion which was upbeat with gains in sight for national democratic and social transitions in the period.270 In this phase of renewed public opinion, the LGBT issue accomplished victories of its own as it got recognised on the public domain as a distinct legitimised force. Media in Nepal put its strength behind the community, continuously arguing for and supporting it through these periods of ascent. An obvious question today therefore relates to the same media becoming completely disengaged in the current period of intense crisis271 facing the community which also threatens continuance of critical HIV prevention services. So much so that media outlets which were once among the prominent advocates for the community in the public domain have opted to side with a small group of others who are believed to be adversely targeting the community. Clearly, community\u2019s engagement with media in the past fell short of inducing the latter with any deeper and informed understanding of its vulnerabilities and risks. Also, the more like-minded and positively inclined ones like My Republica could not get the needed impetus to nuance their appreciation of the cross- cutting community issues, and develop a level of sensitivity needed to engage with these. BDS\u2019s continued documentation of violations against LGBT community members, however, clearly reveals that even as the state and legal responses were showing clear signs of positive shifts and media overall was felicitating these shifts, discrimination and abuse at the social and structural levels did not show signs of abatement in this period.272 Notwithstanding this, representation of the issue in the public domain by this time however had changed its hue rather decidedly in favour of positive and aspiration-centred depictions. Stories of the communities\u2019 continuing struggles for survival and basic civil liberties at best tended to get edged out by stories on the imperative to wrest constitutional rights of freedom and equality.273 With the final verdict of the Supreme Court affirming equal rights and non-discrimination against gender and sexual minorities, the pioneer of the LGBT movement in the country securing a significant political mandate as an elected MP, and the inclusion of community voices in the new", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7dd6ddcf-273b-44e1-a1dc-66e60de9c151": {"__data__": {"id_": "7dd6ddcf-273b-44e1-a1dc-66e60de9c151", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1865b1b6aa9a81b4f879bc0cc21efd8fe1ed1eb3f4fa4039c6b20c9685890bc"}, "3": {"node_id": "08009142-27e9-4bdd-b07d-4df4389e5ed9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79546f2c7afe948a7e94cbd32f9127b58ae5481bbaebb31dedd249f34380f0b8"}}, "hash": "fc808aefc3cc25f5be68926c3a8ccdd265d0c928a4c9b0769a4dfbbe8c26c38a", "text": "nation /constitution building processes, the public discourse may have gotten naturally inclined into celebrating the unprecedented gains and recognition for the community. Some matching state responses like inclusion of \u2018sexual and gender minorities\u2019 as a category in the federal budget (2008-9) and the introduction of transgender category in Nepal census around the same time appear to have contributed to the shaping of the contours of the discourse. A look at media reports of the period clearly brings this out.274 At another level, the more exploratory, in-depth and contemplative stories that tried to look at the course of evolution of the LGBT discourse in the country, given the obvious contours of growth and evolution, lauded the movement\u2019s pioneer, Sunil Babu Pant as the quintessential leader and spokesperson, as much as these celebrated the legal and constitutional recognition for the SGM.275 Key Factors to Success From the perspective of the media, besides continued incidences of atrocities and violations, the phenomenon of historic recognition \u2013 legal, state and constitutional \u2013 of community identity and rights, must have been more attractive themes. As the Chief reporter at Kantipur, Gopal Khanal, points out, \u201cAs a media person, I think that any story around the community has a lot of attraction, and often we provide anchor spaces for these\u201d. At the same time, the sheer charm, affability and accessibility of its pioneer, Sunil Babu Pant all through the decade, visible in the way local, national and international media continue to portray him, clearly stands out as a key factor that steered the representation of LGBT community and its issues. As a leader, he ought to have worked upon 103 this as well. \u201cSunil\u2019s strength is that he ensures proper and dedicated time and attention to media queries\u201d, notes Kyle G. Knight.276 \ufffd Increased presence of community spokespersons By his own admission, Sunil is extremely popular with the media in all far off regions in the country. Speaking about a weekly programme on LGBT277 that he spearheaded and anchored on the national television for over two years until Dec 2012, Sunil acknowledges that \u201cthe programme is more popular in rural areas. Whenever I go out there, I am recognised well. It brought celebrities and community members together.\u201d No surprise then that it is hard to locate a media story in this period without the mention of the name of this \u2018by far the sole spokesperson for the community\u2019, as he is often referred to in media circles. Other than him, the only names that appear, mostly in stories of violations, are those of BDS (the organisation and its members) and sometimes also of its affiliate gay or lesbian organisations in this period. Initiatives to position other community voices on the public domain, as also to help them evolve as possible spokespersons for the community, too is visible in this period. This includes \u201censuring representation of over 50 BDS staff members on government committees across ministries\u201d278; securing representation of community members in political parties; facilitating direct media connects for victims, survivors and role models including those who secured identity cards under the \u2018others\u2019 category279, etc. However, while some individuals (such as Bhumika Shresth) and cases (victims or protagonist therein like Bhakti Shah) became more recognisable entities on media, the recognition could barely stretch to a point beyond which these faces could have evolved into spokespersons on cross-cutting dimensions of LGBT. We also find a section in media trying to showcase people like Sandhya Tamang, Bhumika Shresth, Roshan Mahato, Jyoti Thapa and others as community faces. Here works of Sudeshna Sarkar, Mamta Dhakal, Bibek Bhandari, Kyle Knight among others in profiling these young voices from the community stand out. \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd New symbols of community assertion Alongside such attempts in this period to bring up a band of spokespersons capable of representing cross-cutting aspects of identity, representation, social and health vulnerability, and social parity, we find a conscious effort at generating for the community platforms for coming together and for wider assimilation. These include organising pride marches, gay marriages and tourism, gay sports, etc.280 Through these symbols there is a noticeable thrust on using the freshly attained recognition for the community to advance social assertion.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08009142-27e9-4bdd-b07d-4df4389e5ed9": {"__data__": {"id_": "08009142-27e9-4bdd-b07d-4df4389e5ed9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1865b1b6aa9a81b4f879bc0cc21efd8fe1ed1eb3f4fa4039c6b20c9685890bc"}, "2": {"node_id": "7dd6ddcf-273b-44e1-a1dc-66e60de9c151", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc808aefc3cc25f5be68926c3a8ccdd265d0c928a4c9b0769a4dfbbe8c26c38a"}}, "hash": "79546f2c7afe948a7e94cbd32f9127b58ae5481bbaebb31dedd249f34380f0b8", "text": "In the midst of growing international solidarity and support, the dominant community leadership focused on augmenting social and civil society acceptance for the community, and used cultural, sports and even ceremonial events like gay marriage, gay tourism, gay Olympics as popular symbols to connect with the mainstream. \ufffd Advancing citizenship rights Parallel to these, lead champions like Sunil Babu Pant and his team at BDS remained keenly conscious on using its", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe71d7e2-498e-4916-ba21-508f857c6440": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe71d7e2-498e-4916-ba21-508f857c6440", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "489108d453f43999b79597e897be96bd826745b0c0aaf68236838c2f4f43e992"}}, "hash": "489108d453f43999b79597e897be96bd826745b0c0aaf68236838c2f4f43e992", "text": "political stature to push for institutionalising the recognition mandated for the community in government and legal processes and norms. \u201cIn this period when we were trying to get the citizenship and identity issues worked out, I engaged personally with the vagaries of the system.

As instances of violations against the community, and more notably structural apathy282, did not show any veritable sign of abatement in the period, the leadership\u2019s thrust on securing these critical safeguards for the community assumed vital significance. At these macro levels, their persistence was also throwing up results. The National Task Force for Sexual and Gender Minorities got set up and, as an important \u2018sounding board for the government\u2019 it had representation from BDS, community and the UN\u2019. Other ministries such as Health, Women and Child Development and key agencies like the National AIDS Programme began to include community stakes in their plans and the \u2018other\u2019 identity in implementation norms283. The MSM and Transgender Persons (LGBT) Movement in Nepal: Role and Engagement of Media A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 104 We also find that media supported the community in these \u2018struggles with the system\u2019. As the community was wresting these incremental gains, however, what is also becoming increasingly visible on the public domain is how the \u2018system\u2019, and by implications, its structures, get posited in adversarial dispositions vis- \u00e0-vis the community and its core interests. \ufffd Continued community participation in HIV prevention The other notable trajectory of community involvement remained at the ground levels. \u201cAs I concentrated at the policy levels, our HIV work at the ground levels continued,\u201d asserts Sunil. The 2012 national figures show decline in new rates of infections, and there is recognition of the fact that Nepal recorded one of the lowest transmission rates amongst all groups in Asia- Pacific, including MARPs. It is well acknowledged that an organisation like BDS, operating close to 800 centres that deliver HIV related services to mainly at- risk groups across regions in the country, had a definitive role in this. Gaps, Challenges and Emerging Lessons \ufffd Deepening the HIV discourse However, we hardly find the media celebrating any such accomplishments of the community, or even for that matter, the community asserting its role. In a notable finding from the analysis of media reports in this period, we find that out of the 58 reports on the issue of citizenship rights for the community, only three have attempted to link up the argument for such a vital right with the community\u2019s need for basic health services, let alone HIV related risks.284 If projected deftly and from a solution-centric perspective, these certainly were opportunities for creating strong common stakes between community entitlements and rights and HIV prevention, treatment and care. That such an engagement was vital for the community to sustain is underscored by the fact that in the crisis that precipitated in 2012, the most pertinent arguments on media put forth in support of the community were centred on HIV prevention and risk and harm reduction. However, as has been pointed out earlier, the human rights trajectory for the LGBT movement in Nepal eventually had gotten too pronounced to effectively leverage the HIV dynamics.

Clearly, such signals were positing themselves as deepening the risks for the community. However, the leadership\u2019s pressing preoccupation with the policy level dynamics in these periods meant that these signals continued to go unheeded. In a sombre response, Sunil Babu admits they \u2018should long have had media gatekeepers\u2019 and a better worked out \u2018community coordination and response framework\u2019 overall. \ufffd Sustaining continuity in media engagement It is also crucial that the leadership\u2019s consuming engagement with negotiating policy discourses in these intervening periods distracted it from documenting evidences and sustaining a media trail \u2013 like the one it sustained in the beginning of the movement (2003-2008). The fact has assumed particular relevance today as a handful of media in 105 connivance of a few officials and disengaged community members took to challenging the decade long legacy of the community and its leadership, in the process severely jeopardising even the basic momentum necessary to keep the LGBT movement apace in the country.288 \ufffd Recognition of structural barriers as a critical challenge Predominantly, the public domain texture through this post-judgment and post-gains phase portrays media as positively inclined towards the community, yet lacking an engagement necessary to demystify and dismantle entrenched resistance to acceptance of the community at social and institutional levels. Occasional reports289 aside, the spate of media stories in this period clearly depict how media engaged only with the gains the community had made.290 Public domain had safely transitioned from the very hard, struggle- for-survival stories of the early phases to the very soft and feel-good tenors of the present. In these times of celebrations291, the media did also ensure necessary intactness of policy level dynamics292. However, a lot of these gains did not get translated on the ground. Neither was there any mechanism to engage media in looking at and writing about the barriers. As gains with more far-reaching implications such as citizenship recognition or inclusion of a separate category in the population census were made, chances of media engaging with disjoints and dilemmas at the ground levels dipped further. Owing to the absence of any sustained engagement with life realities and predicaments of the community, media could not be expected to comment on, assess and dissect the various systemic and social barriers that continued despite the macro level gains. The lack of engagement of different apparatus of the state could neither get chased up nor portrayed in the public domain. In effect, media never got readied for the \u2018post-victory\u2019 scenario for the community, to understand and deconstruct state obligations and establish supply-demand dynamics. It must be remembered that the community\u2019s assertion was largely built on the wider pro-democracy movement, and much of its expectations got entwined with the course and shape of this movement in the country. However, as this process of democratic transition \u2018slowed down\u2019, the macro connects necessary for the evolution of the issue discourse tended to get stuck. BDS too, with its new focus on impacting the \u2018system\u2019, had to focus more on using its macro level linkages to argue and push for change rather than on its tested strength in ground level mobilization. \ufffd Rebuilding terms of media engagement BDS\u2019s alliance with media \u2013 from the life-and-death plank of early 2000s to the post judgment celebrations \u2013 did not get advanced systematically. With a maximum order from the courts in 2008, the community leadership\u2019s alignment with both the state and media underwent a sea change. In the midst of all this, even as sections of gay and MSM continued to resist coming out, there were \u2018no qualitative media engagements\u2019 or sustained dialogue \u2018with select journalists\u2019293 by the community so as to have positioned the more underlying aspects of their issues on public domain. On the programmatic front too, the only organised exercise in media engagement was a media workshop BDS organised in April 2012 to help interface managers of community-led initiatives interface with media practitioners.294 \ufffd Entering the media space to address entrenched biases Once again, the community and its dominant leadership (BDS and Sunil Pant) may have taken it upon themselves to address continuing biases, as is apparent in their decision to go on air on national television with a programme like Pahichan aimed at disseminating information on LGBT issues. In a way, it meant that the community itself assumed the role of media.

The MSM and Transgender Persons (LGBT) Movement in Nepal: Role and Engagement of Media A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 106 Conclusion: A Carefully Nuanced Media Re- engagement to Advance MSM and Transgender Persons\u2019 Issues The evolution and course of LGBT movement in the country shows vital lessons in how it leveraged a popular tide on the public domain and aligned itself effectively to wrest salient gains. The making and evolution of a cult community figure Sunil Babu Pant, who steered the entire campaign almost single- handedly for the community, is clearly a remarkable aspect. Similarly, the manner in which the community\u2019s reckoning in Nepal, unlike in most other Asian countries, retained an identity largely independent of the HIV discourse is yet another key facet. Of as much significance has been the fact of how the entire movement retained a unified persona296 throughout \u2013 keeping in its ambit the transgender populations, gays, lesbians and bi- and inter-sex persons. At another level, however, a review of media\u2019s engagement with the movement and emerging issues of the community show that especially at critical junctures media engaged only selectively. The lack of a strategic approach by the community for engaging media meant that it could not address such selective engagements by media with any informed or coordinated mechanisms. So much so, when media remained largely disengaged during a phase of intense crisis for the community in 2012-13, the community was unable to harness either of its human rights, constitutional or HIV vulnerability standpoints to re-engage media. Clearly, a media engagement which is so universal and mega in scope and scale has intrinsic pressures of its own, and throws up constant challenges for champions and advocates who are expected to recognise and respond to these proactively. A lack of informed mediation here could lead to misplaced expectations, and media may not necessarily be investing in the most critical dimensions of the issue. While the volume of media reporting on the issues in Nepal have been nothing short of dramatic, what is important is whether such an intensity yielded the necessary outcomes for the community, especially in the phase of striving to mainstream the unique concerns of the community. As media largely chose to support the community and the movement, the alignment had to be defined by the issue advocates rather than the media itself. Lack of any conscious or strategic effort by the movement to align media interest with the dynamic issue needs at different junctures meant that issue-based evidence, developments and gains got used to serve the wider democratic struggles in the country exponentially more than building an affirmative body of long-term opinions and support in favour of the community. It further also meant that presence of community issues on the public domain could not be negotiated to effect strategic alliances with key stakeholder institutions like rights advocates, experts, government and the dominant civil society. Given the current state of media disengagement with the issue, the need to work on such gaps and challenges and etch out a dynamic framework for community\u2019s engagement with media becomes even more pressing. 107 In 2009 the estimated number of MSM in India was 23, 50,000.

During the BSS in 2001, use of a condom with a commercial male partner was lowest in Kolkata (18.9%) and highest in Mumbai (66.7%) in 2006, it was lowest in the state of Uttar Pradesh (13.1%) and highest in Goa (87%).340 In the BSS 2001, condom use with non-commercial male partners was lowest in Delhi (25.8%) and highest in Bangalore (80.7%) in the BSS 2006, it was lowest in the state of Uttar Pradesh (13.8%) and highest in Mumbai (88.2%).341 In a community-based study, the proportion of MSM reporting condom use at last anal sex with a paying male partner was highest in Andhra Pradesh (90.3%), followed by Maharashtra (83.0%) and Tamil Nadu (83.6%).342 The IBBA 2005\u20132007 conducted in Tamil 109 Nadu among hijras showed that condom use with a regular sexual partner was 73% (last time) and 34% (every time). With a paying sexual partner, it was 93% (last time) and 50% (every time).343 In 2009 condom use during last encounter among MSM was 58%.344 In 2010, condom use at the last occasion of anal sex with a male was reported by 57.6% of MSM in Manipur and 48.9% in Tamil Nadu. In 2007 50% of MSM reported condom use at the last occasion of anal sex with a male was ranging from 13% to 87%.345 In 2009, a study of 150 MSM in Mumbai found that of those engaging in insertive anal intercourse, condoms had been used in 63% of their encounters in the last month. Those engaging in receptive anal intercourse reported condom use in 95% of encounters.346 Consistency of condom use with male partners In the IBBA 2005-2007 survey among MSM, consistent condom use (every time) was low in Andhra Pradesh at four sites (ranged from 2% to 22%) with regular partners but was higher in Tamil Nadu at four sites (ranged from 25% to 41%).347 Condom use with paying partners (last time) was found to be relatively high in both the states (range 73\u201392%).348 Consistent condom use with paid male/hijra partners in the past one month was highest in Maharashtra (72.4%), followed by Tamil Nadu (46.5%) and Andhra Pradesh (17.5%).349 Consistent condom use (in general) with non-regular, non-commercial male/hijra partners varied among states: Andhra Pradesh (13.0%), Maharashtra (57.9%) and Tamil Nadu (25.1%). Consistent condom use (in general) with regular male/hijra partner during anal intercourse was highest in the state of Karnataka (76.7%), followed by Maharashtra (50.4%) and was lowest in Andhra Pradesh (9.4%).350 Consistent condom use with paid male partners from BSS 2008/09 remains low in Karnataka at 35%; it was reported at 54% in Tamil Nadu; 72% in Uttar Pradesh and as high as 95% in Andhra Pradesh.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e42f68c7-a2c3-4500-90e4-7583607f22cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "e42f68c7-a2c3-4500-90e4-7583607f22cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "151ca3bb1530ab570cc6759be92c2add11ee6c5a80a639d648178b5c0e727684"}, "2": {"node_id": "b18c3e0e-ae9d-4b7d-a8bc-da8469dd2158", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce96a61eb01e6b3b0308b3385de4ba928d8c452dd207b97624b8e8c30d986b61"}}, "hash": "5894f6eb25bdd08c9ca4c73a7b349b5db5cc1e06a9af060bf657805dedd6e8d9", "text": "This shows an increase in all stated compared to the previous round of BSS except for Karnataka.351 Condom use with female partners As per the IBSS 2001, Condom use at last sex with a female partner was lowest in Kolkata (23.5%) and highest in Bangalore (61.9%).

At other sites, 9.1% of MSM in Gujarat and Goa reported injecting drugs in the past 12 months. Drug use among MSM was highest in Delhi (60.4%), followed by Bangalore (21.1%) and lowest in Chennai (2.2%). Cannabis (commonly called ganja) was the non-injecting drug used most often.354 Risk perception and knowledge about HIV In 2010, 39.4% of MSM could correctly identify ways of preventing sexual transmission of HIV and rejected major misconceptions about HIV (ranging from 17.4% to 56.7%). In 2007, this figure was 45% (ranging from 16% to 75%). A 2010 study conducted in Mumbai showed that although only 27% of respondents had an accurate understanding of HIV and routes of transmission.355 The 2009 BSS also reported low levels of comprehensive knowledge about HIV among MSM surveyed, including: 21% in Uttar Pradesh, 30% in Manipur, 32% in Tamil Nadu, 22% in Karnataka, and 57% in Andhra Pradesh.356 In 2009, a study of 210 MSM reported psychosocial problems, such as anxiety and depression, attributed to HIV infection or perceived risk of HIV.357 Advocacy Programme Briefs and Fact Sheets A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 110 In 2009, 46.3% of MSM in Tamil Nadu reported having been tested for HIV in the last 12 months and were able to recall the result. This contrasts with 35% who reported the same in 2007.358 According to 2009 BSS, HIV testing among MSM in Uttar Pradesh was 9%, 7% in Manipur, 54% in Karnataka, and 83% in Andhra Pradesh.359 National Responses Coverage of interventions By late 2009, 2, 75,000 MSM were reported to be \u201ccovered\u201d through TIs. It has been reported by NACO that out of an estimated 3, 51,000 MSM considered to be at high risk for HIV in different states of India, the coverage is 78%.360 At the beginning of NACP III (2007), only 30 TIs for MSM were established but by September 2009, there were 131 TIs exclusively for the MSM population.361 Geographical distribution, coverage, and quantity of targeted interventions to key affected populations (KAPs), including MSM, increased between 2008- 2010.362 Nearly 11% of all targeted interventions overseen by the National AIDS Control Organisation are targeted to MSM.363 MSM and other most at risk populations are consistently involved in technical working groups related to HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment.364 Reaching a higher level of coverage will, however, be a challenge. As found in the BSS (2006) and reported in the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) country progress report of 2008, the percentage of MSM reached with HIV prevention programmes across ten states in India varied widely (17-97%).365 Similarly, the percentage of MSM who had undergone an HIV test in the past 12 months and who knew their results also varied widely (3-67%). HIV test in last year, MSM 17.0% (Year 2009).366 India has a free anti retroviral therapy (ART) programme for people living with HIV (PLHIV), and this is offered from 248 centres.

Consistent condom use with commercial and non-commercial male and female partners remains low overall, and behaviour change through information, education and communication (IEC) delivered through appropriate channels such as outreach or from TIs will be necessary. Addressing the needs of female partners of MSM through IEC appears to be missing and this will need to be given a higher priority. Information about the transgender population is available but further research among this key population at higher risk will be required to respond to their specific needs. Stigma and discrimination against MSM and the transgender community in health care settings and society still remains a challenge, which hinders access to HIV prevention, treatment and care services.381 INDIA \u2013 ADVOCACY FACT SHEET In 2009, the estimated number of MSM in India was 23, 50,000 and the estimated number of MSM at higher risk in India was 4, 30,000382.

MSM in Bangladesh ranged between 32, 967-14, 30,652.451 The recent National Serological and Behavioural Surveillance round in Bangladesh found zero cases of HIV among MSM and male sex workers surveyed in Chittagong, Hili, and Dhaka.452 However, the previous round found that the HIV prevalence rate for male sex workers was 0.7% and 0.2% for MSM.453 There is limited serological evidence for HIV infections among MSM. A 2009 modelling study estimated 450 cases of HIV among MSM and male sex workers or approximately 6% of total estimated infections nationwide. The same authors predict a rise from 0.7% HIV prevalence in 2005 to 2.3% by 2020.454 Among Male Sex Workers, from Round 3 (2000-2001) to Round 6 (2004\u20132005), none tested positive for HIV except 0.2% in Round 4 (2002). An HIV prevalence of 0.7% and 0.3% was recorded in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Among hijras, HIV prevalence has remained less than 1% with a lower range of 0.2% in Round 5 (2003\u20132004) and a higher range of 0.8% in Round 4 (2002) and Round 6 (2004\u20132005)455. Prevalence of Syphillis By 2011 the syphilis prevalence among MSM in Bangladesh was found to be 1.5%. 456 Among MSM, the prevalence of active syphilis varied from 2% in 2005, to 0.2% in 2006 and 1% in 2007. Among MSWs, the prevalence ranged from 7.7% in 2000 to 3% in 2007. Among the combined MSM and MSW group, syphilis prevalence fluctuated between 2.3% and 5.6% from 2002 to 2005. Although the prevalence of active syphilis decreased among hijras from 10.4% in 2002 to 5.2% in 2005, an increase has once again been identified: 6.5% in 2006 and 7.7% in 2007.457 HIV related risk behaviours among MSM and transgender persons MSM in Bangladesh are at increased risk for HIV infection due to sexual behaviour, including low condom use, association with IDU and blood sales.458 About half of MSM surveyed in a port city had unprotected anal sex with female partners. Their same-sex sexual practices were rarely disclosed to their female partners. In one survey conducted by the Naz Foundation at a drop-in centre in Northeast Bangladesh, 78% of 200 MSM surveyed had more than 10 male partners in the last month and 21% had more than 51 male partners459. Anal sex is common among MSM in Bangladesh. Consecutive rounds of behavioural surveillance found that 99% of male sex workers reported anal sex in the previous week460. BSS Round 2 found that 99% of these acts were receptive and 32% were also insertive. Among MSM not in sex work, 41% had engaged in receptive anal sex and 72% in insertive anal sex in the previous week461. Over the years, in general, the number of sexual partners (any type) of MSM has decreased (except in Sylhet). In Dhaka, the mean number of sexual partners of MSM in the preceding month decreased from 10 sexual partners in Round 5 (2003\u20132004) to five in BSS 2006\u20132007. The reason for this decrease was not known. However, the average number of sexual partners among MSM in Sylhet did not change between the different rounds.

Risk behaviours of MSM in Dhaka and Sylhet were much the same; in Sylhet, they have remained the same or have increased466. Condom use at last sex In 2011 condom use during last encounter among MSM was 26.1%467. Condom use at last anal sex with a non-commercial male partner was 37% in 2005 and 24.3% in 2007.

The Centre for Gender, Sexuality and HIV and AIDS at BRAC University in Dhaka recently became a member of the Coalition for Bodily and Sexual Rights (CSBR), an international advocacy organisation. The collaborative relationship is expected to lead to opportunities for capacity building related to advocacy479. International support The South Asian MSM and AIDS Network (SAMAN), which includes Bangladesh, was awarded a multi- country grant in Round 9 of the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). The grant will finance support from the Naz Foundation International (NFI), Population Services International (PSI), and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).480 Bangladesh also receives MSM-related support from: United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/ Family Health International (FHI), the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Government of Bangladesh, and Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU).481 Legal environment Sex between males is illegal under Penal Code 1860 Section 377. This law is generally not enforced.482 Law enforcement agencies are known to harass MSM outreach workers (Section 377 of the Penal Code), preventing some MSM from accessing sexual health services. Sex work is illegal for males, though legal for females over the age of 18. Harassment of both MSM and HIV outreach workers by law enforcement authorities has been documented.483 Current gaps in responses On the whole, there is a decrease in HIV programme coverage among these most-at-risk population groups. Accessing VCT and STI services is low among the MSM, MSW and hijra populations, and this also requires more focused attention. The hijra community has specific needs that are different from those of MSM and MSWs, but the service model is largely based on addressing the needs of MSM and is not really appropriate for the context of the hijra situation. Criminal laws against same-sex relations between consenting adults adversely impact upon an enabling environment for service delivery and this also contributes towards impeding efforts at HIV prevention interventions.484 Advocacy Programme Briefs and Fact Sheets A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 118 BANGLADESH \u2013 ADVOCACY FACT SHEET In 2010 the estimated number of MSM in Bangladesh ranged between 32, 967-1, 43 0652.485 Epidemiology The recent National Serological and Behavioural Surveillance round in Bangladesh found zero cases of HIV among MSM and male sex workers surveyed in Chittagong, Hili, and Dhaka.486 In 2011 the Syphilis prevalence among MSM in Bangladesh was found to be 1.5%.487 Risk factors MSM in Bangladesh are at increased risk for HIV infection due to sexual behaviour, including low condom use, association with IDU and blood sales.488 Nearly a third of MSWs and around 15% of other MSM engage in group sex.

The size of the MSM population is estimated to be between 1600 and 4200.496 No information is available about the transgender population.497 Prevalence and trends of HIV and STIs among MSM and Transgender Population The BSS 2008 indicated that the HIV prevalence among MSM was 0.0%.498 In terms of prevalence of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) among MSM, the BSS in 2008 found that in Maldives none of the MSM tested reactive for syphilis but STI related symptoms were reported by 17% of MSM sampled in Mal\u00e9 and 12% in Addu.499 A prevalence of 6% and 1% of Hepatitis B was reported among MSM in Addu and Mal\u00e9, respectively. The detection of Hepatitis B among MSM may be a result of unprotected anal sex, sexual linkages with PWID or an involvement with injecting drug use. The BSS 2008 found all such behaviours among MSM and this may have contributed further to the risk of acquiring Hepatitis B.500 MALDIVES - Country Profile 119 HIV-related risk behaviours of MSM Several high-risk behaviours were found among MSM in the Maldives: high rates of unprotected sex with men and women (wife, girlfriend and FSW), selling sex to men and women, buying sex from men and women, injecting drugs, consuming drugs and having sex, and having sex with PWID.501 However, there can be little doubt that once HIV enters the MSM population, the potential for rapid transmission of HIV across key populations at higher risk and their sexual partners is high. BSS 2008 reported that a high prevalence of unprotected sex was found among FSWs, MSM, PWID and youth. It also found that among all MSM participants, 48% have had sex with a male in the past month.502 Casual male sex partners The BSS report 2008 found that most MSM had sex with a man in the past year and in the past month no payment was exchanged nearly half of the time (48%). In addition, 16% of MSM in Mal\u00e9 reported that they had met a sex partner on the Internet.503 Male sex work The BSS 2008 reported that 44% of MSM in Mal\u00e9 and 18% in Addu had sold sex to another man and 29% in Mal\u00e9 and 18% in Addu had bought sex from a man in the past 12 months.504 Condom use The BSS 2008 reported that while 31% of MSM sold sex to men, 72% did not use condoms. Additionally, 58% of MSM had sex with other men (consensual or paying) but 77% had not used condoms. The incidence of unprotected anal sex with consensual and paid male partners was higher in Addu (86%) compared with Mal\u00e9 (67%).

In the absence of targeted interventions, HIV and STI information was received mainly through the television, radio, newspapers and magazines.512 Despite the apparent lack of targeted interventions, the BBS in 2008 reported that condom distribution was highest among MSM compared with the other groups that were surveyed: 65% in Mal\u00e9 and 72% in Addu.513 (It is not clear whether condoms were Advocacy Programme Briefs and Fact Sheets A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia 120 distributed to MSM by some NGOs.)

In the Maldives, as in many other societies, issues surrounding sexuality, especially same-sex sexuality, and sex work are not openly discussed.515 Current gaps in responses Despite the fact that HIV infection has not been detected among MSM, a high level of sexual risks behaviours within the MSM population and their sexual relations with women is a cause for concern. The lack of targeted interventions for MSM remains largely unaddressed. The widespread lack of condom use with all types of sexual partners shows a lack of information, education and communication (IEC) and counselling services on sexual health and ways of reducing risk behaviours. Lack of capacity among existing NGOs to implement targeted interventions with the MSM population was identified, as was the lack of community groups of MSM to serve their broad-based needs. Criminal laws against consensual same-sex relations and negative societal attitudes are also important structural barriers that need to be examined further and addressed.516 MALDIVES \u2013 ADVOCACY FACT SHEET The size of the MSM population in Maldives is estimated to be between 1600 and 4200.517 Epidemiology The BSS 2008 indicated that the HIV prevalence among MSM was 0.0%.518 In Maldives none of the MSM tested reactive for syphilis but STI related symptoms were reported by 17% of MSM sampled in Mal\u00e9 and 12% in Addu.519 Risk factors High rates of unprotected sex with men and women (wife, girlfriend and FSW), selling sex to men and women, buying sex from men and women, injecting drugs, consuming drugs and having sex and having sex with PWID are major risk factors.520 The BSS 2008 reported that while 31% of MSM sold sex to men, 72% did not use condoms and 75% of MSM had sex with women and 90% did not use condoms.521 Interventions and responses In the absence of targeted interventions, HIV and STI information is received mainly through the television, radio, newspapers and magazines.522 It is reported that, by 2011, a target of 80% of MSM will receive comprehensive HIV prevention services.523 Legal response Sex between same-sex adults remains criminalised in the Maldives as per Section 15, clause 173 (8a).524 In 2011 the estimated no of MSM in Nepal was about 246 419.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df2ab99b-8ad9-4f68-9df7-5fe8784ccb9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "df2ab99b-8ad9-4f68-9df7-5fe8784ccb9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e77a3a76d58e2471ed9baafb694e53930f13e3109f967be19b02de3f344950b1"}, "2": {"node_id": "82f841e4-11ed-48e6-9de7-07ef7ffbf1db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "50939fd42c5bc03135f270360fc30ed0c2f72e21e05b3ee04a21fcac4f9b1ea9"}}, "hash": "cf3916682cd13b51e508cfc1056a8200d9318f50a3e75736eca88c725ccd3cce", "text": "There have been a number of size estimates for the MSM/transgender population.525 In 2009, the National Centre for AIDS and STD Control estimated that there were 1, 40,691 MSM and in 2011 they estimated 7, 4,220 MSM at higher risk in Nepal.526 However, a major MSM nongovernment organisation (NGO), Blue Diamond Society, considers that number to be an underestimation.527 Information on the transgender population is not known to be available.528 Prevalence and trends of HIV among MSM and transgender populations in Nepal By 2009 HIV prevalence among MSM (capital city) was 3.8%.529 By 2009 percentage of all cases that NEPAL -

By 2009, HIV prevalence among youth MSM was 1.3%.531 HIV prevalence among the MSM has not changed much over the three rounds of the Integrated Biological and Behavioural Survey (IBBS) survey (3.9% in 2004, 3.3% in 2007 and 3.8% in 2009).532, 533, 534 Disparities were also observed among sub-populations of MSM. The third round (2009) of IBBS found that 5.2% of male sex workers had HIV, meanwhile 3% of other MSM also had it. In 2012 it was reported that sex between males accounts for 21.6% of cumulative HIV infections. This is an increase from the figure of 4% reported in 2008 and 6.2% reported in 2009.535, 536, 537 Prevalence of STIs among MSM and transgender populations in Nepal By 2009 the syphilis prevalence among MSM in Nepal was 1.5%. Prevalence of active syphilis (1.7% in 2004, 2.4% in 2007 and 1.5% in 2009) and syphilis history (8.9% in 2004, 2.8% in 2007 and 2.5% in 2009) among MSM was lower in the third round of IBBS as compared to the first and second rounds. Of all MSM surveyed in the 2009 IBBS, 20.8% of non male sex worker (MSW) MSM reported at least one STI symptom during the last 12 months. Among MSW, this figure was 25.9%. Most of the non-MSW MSM (86.8%) cited genital ulcers as an STI symptom.538 In the 2009 IBBS, 12.5% of non-MSW MSM and MSW had rectal gonorrhoea;539 and in the 2007 IBBS, 3.6% had rectal chlamydia, and 2.4% had syphilis.540 In all the three rounds, rectal chlamydia trachomatis infection (rectal-CT) was higher among MSWs (range 11.1% - 20.5%) than among non-MSWs (range 1.5% - 2.6%). Among MSWs, there has been a reported decline over the years in those with a history of syphilis (14.5% in 2004 to 4.5% in 2009). The overall higher rates of STIs among MSWs compared with non- MSWs appear to suggest higher rates of unprotected anal sex. Specific information about STIs among the transgender population is not known to be available. 541, 542, 543 HIV-related risk behaviours among MSM and transgender populations Many MSM in Nepal reported being sexually active at a relatively young age.544 More than 50% of MSM (58.4% in Round 1, 51.5% in Round 2 and 61.3% in Round 3) reported having had their first sexual experience before the age of 17 years. The first sexual partner was not always male. Half in Round 1, about 63.9% in Round 2, and 40.8% in Round 3 reported that their first sexual partner was a female. Anal sex was widely practiced in the three rounds: 71.1%, 82.4% and 71.4%, respectively, reported having had anal sex with a paying male partner in the past month.545 A recent multivariate analysis of data obtained from MSM in Nepal showed that \u201chigh risk of HIV infection\u201d was significantly associated with being involved in sex work, having no knowledge of male STI symptoms, and having a history of STI symptoms.546 Consistent condom use with various types of male partners Consistent condom use increased among non-MSW MSM with non-paying partners from 39.3% in 2004 to 77.5% in 2007 and then decreased to 65.1 in 2009. Among male sex workers, consistent condom use with regular paying male anal sex partners was found to be 97.2% in 2007 and 75.8% in 2009. Consistent condom use with non-paying partners also decreased from 71.8% in 2007 to 65.4% in 2009.547 Condom use during last anal sex with various types of male partners In Rounds 2 and 3, condom use during last anal sex remained almost the same (71.6% in Round 2 and 75.3% in Round 3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66d33a1e-915a-4a82-a09a-4cf921275124": {"__data__": {"id_": "66d33a1e-915a-4a82-a09a-4cf921275124", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Framework for Media Engagement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in South Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6556bb76e6a424c775864afc591cc591d6a6df94fe62ea35221d23fcc0478a67"}, "2": {"node_id": "6dc619f1-ee06-4b74-b2bf-ef95a0c1e4d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/framework-media-engagement-human-rights-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-south-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23996aaaf3ba90534d2fce4732d4ce2fcc07ee16384bd4e8a96a83143eb52653"}}, "hash": "d441f6b343f17288dae7931989cc0af410d5a937d2a9e1fff251f71fd571dfe9", "text": "However, within the subgroups, condom use during last anal sex decreased among MSWs (from 93.1% in Round 2 to 76.3% in Round 3), while among non-MSWs, condom use increased from 69.2% in Round 2 to 74.7% in Round 3.

According to IBBS Round 3 reported vaginal sex in past month among MSM was 66.6%. Several studies concluded that there was a lack of information about sexual behaviour and sexual networks in Nepal, particularly on MSM.550, 551 Little is known about the crossover and linkages between seasonal labour migrants, FSWs, and MSWs and non- MSWs but, if possible networks are established, rates of HIV infection would be likely to rise.552 Risk perception and knowledge about HIV The proportion of MSM who could correctly identify ways of preventing sexual transmission of HIV and rejected major misconceptions increased from 44.4% in 2007 to 64.3% in 2009.553, 554 In 2009, 42% MSM had been tested for HIV in the last 12 months and knew the result, increasing from 30% in 2007 and 7% in 2004.555, 556, 557 National response Policy and legal environment The Nepalese Government states that it has embraced the principle of universal access (with a target of 80%) for provision of HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support services to vulnerable and infected people.558 The second National HIV and AIDS Strategy (2006\u2013 2011) provides details of specific components of HIV intervention programmes among MSM. The Strategy also provides \u201cimpact/ outcome targets\u201d in relation to MSM that include a reduction in HIV prevalence among MSM from 3.6% (2004) to 2.0% and among MSWs from 4.8% (2004) to 3.0% by the end of 2011 and increase in condom use during last anal sex with a male from 55.9% (MSM) and 66.7% (MSWs) (2004) to 80% by the end of 2011.559 Legal response The Supreme Court decriminalised consensual sex between same-sex adults, however no action has yet been taken to introduce legal protections. Since 2007, transgender people have been officially recognised with \u201cthird gender\u201d cards. There has been a history of harassment of MSM and HIV project workers, but the situation has improved since 2007.560, 561 In 2008, an unpublished UN legal review found that Nepal was \u201cprohibitive in high intensity\u201d for MSM and transgender persons. In 2009-10, a second review conducted by the UNDP found that it was now \u201cprotective\u201d. This indicates the greatest degree of change possible, from the most repressive to the most protective category.562, 563 Coverage of interventions The Nepalese government has set a target of reaching out to 1, 02, 880 MSM (including MSWs) by the end of 2011.564 In 2007, among MSWs and non-MSWs, the percentage of those who had received an HIV test in the past 12 months and who knew their results was 51.85% and 30% respectively.

with HIV.580 International support The South Asian MSM and AIDS Network (SAMAN), which includes Nepal was awarded a multi-country grant in Round 9 of GFATM. The grant will finance support from the Naz Foundation International (NFI), Population Services International (PSI), and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).581 Nepal also receives MSM-related support from: United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/ Family Health International (FHI-360), and U.K. Department for International Development (DFID).582 The latter amounts to approximately USD 3.6 million over a 7- year period - a sizeable contribution relative to historical funding.583 Estimated funding for HIV prevention activities related to MSM during fiscal year 2011/12 represented 23% (or approximately USD 1.2 million) of the total national HIV prevention budget.584 This suggests increased emphasis on MSM programming but reduced overall funding as compared to 2009 spending estimates. Current gaps in responses Condom use is modest to high but there has been a recent decline in consistent condom use. Among MSWs 40.7% and among non-MSWs 44.5% both correctly identified ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and rejected major misconceptions about HIV transmission,585 suggesting that greater efforts are needed to increase IEC on such issues. The prevalence of STIs among MSWs has been consistently high, suggesting that the response to this unresolved health problem requires greater focus. Substantial numbers of MSM are married or have sex with females but the efforts of HIV prevention programmes to respond to the needs of wives or female sexual partners of MSM appear to be meagre. Too many MSM who had an HIV test did not know their results and consequently a greater response will need to be implemented by the NGO (linked to MSM issues) and health sector to lessen this gap.586 NEPAL \u2013 ADVOCACY FACT SHEET In 2011, the estimated number of MSM in Nepal was about 2, 46, 419.587 Epidemiology \ufffd As per 2009 estimates, HIV prevalence among MSM was 3.8%.588 \ufffd HIV prevalence among the MSM has not changed much over the three rounds of the Integrated Biological and Behavioural Survey (IBBS) survey (3.9% in 2004, 3.3% in 2007 and 3.8% in 2009).589 \ufffd In 2012 it was reported that sex between males accounts for 21.6% of cumulative HIV infections.

This court believes that the Indian Constitution reflects this value deeply ingrained in Indian society, nurtured over several generations. The inclusiveness that Indian society traditionally displayed, literally in every aspect of life, is manifest in recognising a role in society for everyone. Those perceived by the majority as \u201cdeviants\u2019 or \u2018different\u2019 are not on that score excluded or ostracised. Where society can display inclusiveness and understanding, such persons can be assured of a life of dignity and non-discrimination. This was the \u2018spirit behind the Resolution\u2019 of which Nehru spoke so passionately. In our view, Indian Constitutional law does not permit the statutory criminal law to be held captive by the popular misconceptions of who the LGBTs are. It cannot be forgotten that discrimination is antithesis of equality and that it is the recognition of equality which will foster the dignity of every individual.

The working class community was more difficult to reach out as they were hidden and the fear of the police was high. Hence we did not want too much visibility on our program. For the first two years the police did not indulge in violence but were stationed in front of our office. This scared away the community.

But from 2006 to 2010 there was a drastic change in this attitude.\u201d [Sudha, transgender, Tamil Nadu]. \u201cAbout 15 years back, we never found any news about our community in Pune. LGBT issues were completely ignored. The few that appeared had a more colourful undertone and resulted in creating a negative impression about the community. The catchy headlines would be accompanied by misinformation and in very insensitive language. This was particularly true of the Marathi newspapers.\u201d [Respondent, FGD Sampathik Trust, Pune]. 215 \u201cTheir confidence in the media, law enforcement was very low and they feared that their identity would be revealed which would lead to further discrimination\u201d. [Rex, MSM activist, Karnataka]. 216 \u201cFrom the time that Sangama started in 1999, we engaged with the media because we realised that social support was lacking and this was the only space where we could start building support. The first article on Sangama\u2019s work emerged in Deccan Herald on Human rights day in 1999. In the initial phase, we worked with selected journalists who were progressive and empathised with the MSM community. These include CK Meena, tapping expert spaces in the media; Vasanthi, Geetha, Subramaniam, Balan Chaouhan. We focused on exclusive stories. In the initial phase we did not approach the beat reporters too often, most of the times when we had evidence of human rights violations \u2013 when someone was beaten up and we had photographs or people who were willing to speak to the media. Initially the media was conservative, but after 4-5 press conferences they began to appreciate the level of brutality that the MSM and transgender community faced and they began to change.\u201d [Manohar, Sangama] 217 \u201cWe have been inconsistent in interacting with the media. Initially, we used to stay away from and did not want to face the media. After a few years, we realised that it was important for the media to understand our work. We started interacting with the journalists whom we know well or through the known references and started sharing about our activities and they have written reports. But they were sporadic and carry less information.\u201d [Krishna, President Suraksha Society] 218 \u201cIn addition to being transgender people, we were educated professionals, and that attracted media interest. These stories spoke of not just the struggles of community members but also spoke of their success and achievements. These stories then expanded to broader initiatives of the community members, such as setting up food stalls, small scale business, engaged as beauticians.\u201d [Kalki Subramaniam, transgender, Coimbatore] 219 \u201cWorking with a specialised organisation like CFAR we used all our events, special programmes to convey through the media our efforts, concerns, skills and talents, special requests to the government to include us in entitlements. We were also working to reduce HIV amongst the Aravanis (transgender people in Tamil Nadu), and the peer outreach efforts were also shared. We created a simple window for the media to access information on the community through these interactions. We became the news makers and source of information. It helped to reduce a lot of myths and misinformation in news reports.\u201d [Sudha, transgender, TAI Vizhudugal] 220 \"There are numerous myths about hijras and sexual minorities.

At the time the media discourse was not positive and there were few in-depth stories. Apart from the awareness and knowledge of these issues there was also a lack of information and news sources. The community was hidden and official agencies and NGOs working with these communities were tight-lipped. So getting quotes, statistics or any kind of information was very difficult. I started with an early story on how the hijra community has been creating nuisance at important junctions like MG Road and Bellary road. I interacted with community members of Sangama and slowly I started to realise that apart from begging and sex work, the community is so marginalised that they do not get any other work opportunities. Sangama started to work on human rights issues but later with HIV programmes coming up, the flow of information slowly started. The media outreach helped since, we were able to have a source which can provide authentic contacts and links with both the community and government officials.

The aim of the lessons These simple lessons are intended to be tools in the hands of priests, pastors and all Christian ministers in order to assist them in raising the awareness of their churches, and all those to whom they minister. They aim to encourage positive initiatives that target HIV prevention, provide support to those infected and affected by the virus, advocate for their rights and assist them to lead productive and fruitful lives. They are written in a simple language in order to ensure that they reach out effectively and can be agreed upon by all denominations. We were also keen on integrating Biblical principles and verses with scientific knowledge in a simple manner that makes the study accessible to unspecialized researchers. At the same time, we hope that we have included enough depth to benefit the more specialized reader. How should the lessons be used? The lessons could be used in the form of sermons or lectures. They can further be used in personal and group studies.

Breaking the Silence 2 \u201cSon of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say to them: \u2018This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who only take care of themselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock? 3 You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock. 4 You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally. 5 So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals\u2026.11 \u201c \u2018For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them.\u201d (Ezekiel 34: 2-5, 11)1 A Quick Introduction to HIV and AIDS \u2022 HIV [Human Immunodeficiency Virus]. HIV is the virus which can lead to AIDS. HIV reduces your body\u2019s immunities so they have more difficulty fighting off diseases. The immune system can never fully get rid of HIV because the virus attacks the immune system itself--the very thing that would normally get rid of a virus. \u2022 AIDS [Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome]. AIDS is a syndrome, a collection of signs and conditions resulting from low immunity tolerance which is signified by the presence of specific health conditions called opportunistic infections. These infections are caused by microbes such as viruses or bacteria that usually do not make healthy people sick. Some of these infections include Lymphoma (& other specific cancers), Candidiasis, recurrent Pneumonia, Dementia, Tuberculosis etc. 1All scriptural quotations are taken from the New International Version unless otherwise indicated Lesson One: A message to the pastors and ministers of the Church As a medical problem and from the aspect of the economy, AIDS is no doubt all bad news! But from a moral point of view, it does not need to be all bad news; through its challenge, it has the potential to make us all better human beings.

It\u2019s a little different with HIV since the virus can cause slow, subtle damage to the immune system long before an infected person will feel ill. HIV is a continuum with different stages. Health care providers use the term \u201cHIV disease\u201d to identify the variety of changes a person may experience, from initial infection to more advanced stages of serious, life-threatening illness. The term describes the medical condition of anyone infected with the virus, regardless of his or her symptoms. How does HIV cause illnesses? HIV reproduces continuously in the body from the first day of infection. A person who is infected with HIV will typically produce about 10 billion new HIV particles each day, and about 2 billion virus-fighting immune system cells (CD4 T cells- are produced and destroyed). A person\u2019s immune system attacks HIV soon after infection and at first is able to clear a large amount of virus from the body every 24 hours. However, for each virus particle cleared, at least one new one is created. The body\u2019s initial, vigorous anti-HIV response creates a temporary equilibrium between immune cells and the virus that may last for months or years. Typically, a person will show no outward signs of illness during this time, except in some instances flu-like symptoms after the initial infection as a sign that the immune system is kicking-in to fight off HIV. Over time, however, the virus gains the upper hand. The amount of HIV in the body (viral load) increases and the CD4 T cell", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "535c93f1-ea7b-4bb7-a0bb-0261fb07ea3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "535c93f1-ea7b-4bb7-a0bb-0261fb07ea3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Pacific Guide on Responding to HIV for Christian Ministers, Pastors and Communities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e419d5c6bab4edf2f2088662179818a4129f4f6136d78cc2c42f2812dd09e650"}, "3": {"node_id": "537f42f2-0d67-4685-9022-da8eec7eba68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2d4656cddeb6acb14c562d120ea7bd8e295b0e287226a7d2340a0e707b77783"}}, "hash": "cb59f1753bea2d7d2837a11e9257555815800e2ce0cfdd02d53c5467d55dd8c7", "text": "count declines. The immune system cannot work properly under constant attack from HIV. Eventually, the virus overwhelms the defenses of the immune system, which then can no longer ward off other illness-causing infections, some of which can be life threatening. How is HIV transmitted? The virus is present in certain bodily fluids and can be passed from one infected individual to another through: \u2022 Blood (including menstrual blood) \u2022 Semen (pre-cum) \u2022 Vaginal secretions \u2022 Breast milk The HIV virus is not easily transmitted. It depends on the amount of virus present in these bodily fluids which actually varies with the stage of infection. It is highest at the early stage of infection, decreases slightly during the long symptoms-free period and increases dramatically at the AIDS stage. The most \u2018infectious\u2019 bodily fluid is blood. Studies have shown that infection rates are generally higher for male-to-male transmission and needle sharing. Transmission is about twice as high from male-to-female than from female-to-male. The virus is more likely to be transmitted during certain sex acts where mucous membranes are more easily broken than during other sex acts where the mucous membranes are more likely to remain intact. The presence of other Sexually Transmitted Infections, particularly those who form lesions and ulcers on the genitals is a facilitating factor for HIV transmission. People living with HIV who are taking their anti-retroviral treatment correctly and consistently have low level of virus (sometimes almost undetectable) present in their bodily fluids and thus, they are very significantly less likely to transmit their virus to others compared to people not on treatment for example, even in the absence of preventative measure. Recent studies suggests that anti-retroviral treatment can reduce up to 96% the risk of transmission in couples where only one partner is infected with HIV. This represents a major breakthrough. As mentioned before, most HIV transmission in the world happen between people who ignore their HIV positive status (and therefore are not accessing treatment) and their sexual partners, husbands, wives, boyfriends, girlfriends and unborn children. Activities that can transmit HIV 3 Penetrative and unprotected sexual contact. 3 Direct blood contact/exchange, particularly through sharing injection drug needles. 3 Infections due to blood transfusions, accidents in health care settings or certain blood products are possible but tend to become very rare as universal precautions are routinely in place 3 Mother to baby (before or during birth, or through breast milk feeding) ANYONE that does not know his/her own HIV status, or the HIV status of his/her sexual partner(s), and or engages in any of the activities above can potentially be infected by the HIV virus or infect others if he or she is already and unknowingly infected.

The HIV test is one of the most accurate medical tests. More than 75% of people who are infected with HIV do not know that they are because they have not taken the test. HIV is mostly transmitted by people who do not know their HIV status. The HIV test looks for HIV antibodies in your body (this means the test actually looks at the response from your immune system to the virus). If you have HIV antibodies, your test results will be positive. This means you have HIV. If you don\u2019t have HIV antibodies, your test will be negative.

This period during which the antibodies are not detectable is called the Window Period. That is why it is When an antibody test is found positive, a confirmatory test using a different type of test is performed to double check. HIV Treatment: Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) There are neither known cures nor vaccine for HIV yet but a range of drugs have been developed and are used in combination to avoid resistance by the virus. These drugs referred to as antiretroviral drugs or ARVs do not completely kill the virus but they significantly slow down its progression and reduce the amount of virus circulating in the body (viral load) and thus allows for the immune system to recover. Therapy using ARVs is referred to as ART (AntiRetroviral Therapy). People taking ART are committed to a lifelong treatment. Thanks to ART, HIV is no longer a death sentence and people infected with HIV can live long and productive lives. Most countries provide ART free of charge. Increasingly new drugs are being developed that are more effective and have fewer side effects. When people are taking ARVs it is very important that they adhere to their doctor\u2019s prescription otherwise the virus may become resistant to the drugs. As mentioned above people on therapy have significantly reduced chances to transmit their virus to their long term sexual partners due to their reduced viral load. And it is to be noted that generally HIV is transmitted to others by people who ignore their HIV positive status. ART is also used to prevent the transmission of the virus from an infected mother to her infant. This is very effective and, along with other precautionary measures, it can virtually eliminate this mode of transmission. This is called Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission. HIV vulnerability: risk factors (\u201crisk behaviours\u201d) and drivers The term \u201crisk factors\u201d refers to aspects of personal behaviours or lifestyle, an environment exposure or an inborn or inherited characteristic, which on the basis of epidemiologic evidence is known to be associated with health-related condition(s).3 These include behaviours such as sharing needles for injecting drug use, unprotected casual sex and multiple concurrent partners over a long period of time with low and inconsistent condom use, rough and coerced sex, anal sex, etc\u2026. Because these particular behaviours carry a greater risk of HIV transmission or acquisition, they are often called \u201chigh risk behaviours\u201d. The term \u201cdrivers of HIV epidemic\u201d relates to the structural and social factors such as poverty, human rights violation, unequal access to information, income and opportunities and prominently gender inequality that increase people\u2019s vulnerability to HIV infection. These are not easily measured but account for the increase and maintenance of an HIV epidemic at the population level. \u201cDrivers\u201d at population level and risk factors at individual level are closely linked. Individual behaviours, sexual behaviour included, are shaped by the social environment in which individuals live, their degree of agency and gendered expectations and norms as defined by culture. Effective prevention efforts require action to understand and address the socio-economic and cultural realities in which behaviors are shaped. The assumption that education alone leads to behavior change is shortsighted. HIV and AIDS in the Pacific 4 After two decades of responding to HIV in the region, we still do not have consistent and reliable information about estimated levels and distribution of HIV, due to continuing poor surveillance and inadequate epidemiological data. The absence of biological and behavioural surveillance among specific groups limits understanding of who is at risk of HIV infection and the ability to target appropriate prevention strategies. The trends in the number of HIV cases detected is as much about changes in the availability and uptake of HIV testing as about real spread of HIV within and between countries. Conclusions on the basis of reported cases must be tentative and the true epidemiological picture of HIV in the region is still uncertain. Outside of Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Guam and perhaps Fiji, the low number of reported cases makes it difficult to predict with any certainty the future growth of HIV in the region. Only a limited number of countries (most notably Papua New Guinea) undertake HIV estimates; most of the countries depend on reported cases for the planning of their national responses. 3John M.

Annual reported HIV cases by sub-region 1981-2009 (source SPC 2010) As at December 2011, the total cumulative reported HIV cases in the pacific including PNG is 33,218; 98 new HIV diagnoses were reported in 2011 for the Pacific excluding PNG. Cases from Papua New Guinea make up over 99% of reported cases in 2008. In Papua New Guinea there are 31,609 reported cases as at 2011, although UNAIDS estimates that the number of people living with HIV is 54,000. A similar level of under-reporting in the rest of the Pacific seems likely. Sub-regional trends over the past 25 years show a mixed picture with incidence increasing in Melanesia (driven by Fiji), relatively constant in Polynesia and decreasing in Micronesia from a peak in 1998-1999. The vast majority of people infected in the Pacific are young (19-35yrs old), the average age at HIV diagnosis being 30 years. The share of women and girls in the caseload has increased steadily. In PNG, 60% of new infections in 2007 were amongst women. Region- wide, women\u2019s share of the epidemic has increased from 20% in 1985 to 46% lately. This is consistent with predominantly heterosexual transmission but is also likely related to the fact that women are more tested then men (through Ante Natal Care). In small populations even a small number of people living with HIV can be devastating, particularly so when the most impacted are young productive adults. On the basis of the reported numbers of people living with HIV, the region can be categorized as follows: Papua New Guinea\u2014the overwhelming locus of the Pacific epidemic; Fiji, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam\u2014 with significant HIV cases; and other countries, including the smaller island states\u2014where known cases are fewer. Sexual transmission is the predominant mode of transmission (95%) followed by vertical transmission (5-10%). The extent of male to male transmission is not well evidenced. It is believed to be underreported outside the French and US territories which exhibit significant proportions of infections due to male-male sex and injecting drug use. The share of MSM transmission for the region (PNG excluded) is tentatively 27%, largely driven by the territories mentioned above. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) like chlamydia and syphilis are endemic across the region. The presence of STIs significantly increases the risk of contracting HIV if exposed to the virus. The high prevalence of common STIs (chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, genital herpes) found in reproductive age groups across the PICs represent an important risk factor for HIV spread. Knowledge of reproductive health, STI signs and symptoms and health seeking behaviors for these highly stigmatized conditions (\u201cshame diseases\u201d) are very low as well as the use of preventative methods known to stop the transmission of STIs and HIV such as male and female condoms.

Percentage of positive syphillis tests by sub-region in 2009 (Screening in asymptomatic patients vs diagnostic in symptomatic patients) Data source SPC Public Health Programme HIV and STI section 2010: Mobility of occupational groups susceptible to be more exposed to HIV (sex workers, soldiers, mobile men with money) is also well documented throughout the region. Seafarers have been noted as one of the highest priority risk group for HIV transmission and contribute disproportionately to the HIV caseload of Tuvalu (41%) and Kiribati (100%). Limited studies have found HIV prevalence between 6 and 14% amongst Port Moresby sex workers. Data from other countries and other occupational groups at higher exposure risk is lacking. Sex work (or prostitution) per se is concentrated in urban centers, ports and around development enclaves but transactional sex is common and widespread and often associated with alcohol abuse and low condom use. Limited studies have also found multiple concurrent sexual partnerships relatively common. Intergenerational sex is well documented in PNG (i.e young girls infected by older \u201csugar daddies\u201d men).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf037eba-293b-449c-b7a1-a29b64dd44f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf037eba-293b-449c-b7a1-a29b64dd44f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Pacific Guide on Responding to HIV for Christian Ministers, Pastors and Communities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f54845657b29249cce3f30d258d92a79bcdec09a2f3ae7e1553d642adb8b5e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "4bd58be9-6e70-449b-8848-ce3f57fd7560", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d290887283fc4b1bf7b0f34c13d219a6be7ad6b1857e6a86ed93bb2fb3caf48"}}, "hash": "190d86120282132ccc81d56581875f4301e148e8fddb27bcfb66ce51702d3a56", "text": "100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Year Cases 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 All Melanesia (exc PNG) All Micronesia All Polynesia All PICTs (exc PNG) 35.0 30.0 25.0 20.0 15.0 10.0 5.0 0.0 Polynesia Micronesia Melanesia Chlamydia Screening Chlamydia Diagnostic 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 Polynesia Melanesia Micronesia Syphillis Screening Syphillis Diagnostic Guideline for Christian Leaders Guideline for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "911335a7-ea6a-4245-9b2b-0fb6b943bf9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "911335a7-ea6a-4245-9b2b-0fb6b943bf9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Pacific Guide on Responding to HIV for Christian Ministers, Pastors and Communities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce03afb8875f048ca85b181f3940bc59625ab64fc28bd36e39579584ca329407"}}, "hash": "ce03afb8875f048ca85b181f3940bc59625ab64fc28bd36e39579584ca329407", "text": "Christian Leaders 14 15 The record high levels of gender-based and often sexual violence by an intimate partner (above 60% in Fiji and Solomon Islands, 40% in Samoa) pose direct and indirect disproportionate risk vulnerability to women, girls and transgendered persons. In PNG, studies have found that over 50% of women were forced into sex mostly by men known to them and 2 out of 3 wives reported being beaten by their husbands (a national average). Violence against women carries direct and indirect risk for HIV transmission. Women and girls who are victims of abuse are at heightened risk of infection. Gender inequality in custom, practice and law is a prominent vulnerability factor at population level and is believed to be the single most important contributing factor to the HIV epidemic in Papua New Guinea.5 HIV related social research in the Pacific Islands has highlighted the sub-optimal understandings of sexually transmitted infections signs and symptoms and sexual and reproductive health related issues among young (and older) people. Many Pacific Island cultures consider open discussion about sexuality across generations or in the public realm socially inappropriate. As the Fijian researcher Miliakere Kaitani notes about young Fijians \u201cknowledge is limited because they [young Fijians] have a narrow range of sources of information on sexuality and they are misinformed about this taboo topic. The end result is a high incidence of teenage pregnancy and high incidence of Sexually Transmitted Infections among the indigenous Fijian population\u201d.6 High level of stigma and discrimination and inadequate and discriminatory legal frameworks on the basis of gender or sexual orientation exacerbate the problem. Save for very few exceptions, most Pacific legislations criminalize sex work, homosexuality and HIV transmission. Few countries have laws that protect people living with HIV from discrimination and fewer (only Papua New Guinea, Pohnpei in Federated States of Micronesia and Fiji) have enacted comprehensive laws that integrate international human rights principles as they apply to HIV responses so far. The importance of warning signals and caution \u2022 Our church pulpits should send out a clarion call to warn the inattentive to the existing hazard. \u2022 Indications show that there is an increasing number of young people (including churchgoers) who are sexually active outside marriage. \u2022 Some people are ostracised because of their behaviours or lifestyle such as commercial sex workers and men who have sex with men. \u2022 As a result of stigmatization, social condemnation and the cruelness faced by these people, they are forced to hide; as a result prevention services do not reach them and HIV may spread unnoticed. Messages we need to convey The value of the ailing 26 Then God said, \u201cLet us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\u201d 27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. (Genesis 1:26-27) 19 Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; 20 you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body. (1Corinth 6: 19-20) 8 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8) \u2022 Those living with or affected by HIV are still created in the image of God whether they are responsible for their condition or not. \u2022 The honour and pride of a nation is represented in the national flag. The morning salutation of the flag is a salutation of the nation. The flag is the image of the nation. \u2022 Man is the image of God. To love Man is to love God. \u2022 The sinner, the weak, the ailing and the broken, are still created in the image of God, hence their value is unlimited. \u2022 God demonstrated His love for us by sending His son to die on our behalf while we were yet sinners. \u2022 He still loves all sinners and calls upon them to enjoy His love. \u2022 Some heart patients, diabetics, hypertension patients and other patients are indeed responsible for their health conditions due to the frantic lifestyles they lead \u2013 for example through stress, overeating, smoking or lack of exercise. Undoubtedly, all such behaviour is sinful towards themselves and their bodies. \u2022 Some of those infected by HIV may be responsible for their condition because they", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92e1dff9-ba87-4963-b325-fcf41f60dd42": {"__data__": {"id_": "92e1dff9-ba87-4963-b325-fcf41f60dd42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Pacific Guide on Responding to HIV for Christian Ministers, Pastors and Communities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5172001299729d233384863810bf1ed3340d02cf5426154014b76a28ce6ce2e4"}}, "hash": "5172001299729d233384863810bf1ed3340d02cf5426154014b76a28ce6ce2e4", "text": "have behaved in a certain way which can rightfully be described as sinful.

Grave ailment - any grave ailment - is but a predicament that befalls the ailing and their families; yet, it is also an opportunity for spiritual growth \u2013 changing a lifestyle for the glory of Christ. \u2022 We have to declare a message of love and hope to those infected and affected by HIV from our pulpits and within our meetings. \u2022 We need to encourage those who think they may have been exposed to HIV to take the necessary blood test voluntarily; it is available free of charge in all Pacific Island countries. \u2022 We need to offer those affected and infected with HIV support, not hostility, love, not criticism, respect, not indifference. We need to show them the spirit of fraternity and not that of exclusion. \u2022 Those infected or affected by HIV may still come to be the \u201ctemple of God\u201d and a dwelling place for the Holy Spirit through repentance, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and the cover of Christ the Saviour\u2019s blood. \u2022 We need to spread the message that the healthy might be cautious and the ailing might return to the arms of the Father to be covered and redeemed.

I am no longer worthy to be called your son. \u2018 22 \u201cBut the father said to his servants, \u2018Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him.

Let\u2019s have a feast and celebrate.24 For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.\u2019 So they began to celebrate. 25 \u201cMeanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. 26 So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. 27 \u2018Your brother has come,\u2019 he replied, \u2018and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.\u2019 28 \u201cThe older brother became angry and refused to go in.

(James 1: 2-3) 13 When tempted, no one should say, \u201cGod is tempting me.\u201d For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; (James 1: 13) \u2022 Disease, predicaments and tribulations are all a test of faith. \u2022 The raging war that befalls us calls our souls to seek purity in faith. \u2022 Long-suffering and perseverance result in spontaneous joy and simple faith in the souls that pass the test. \u2022 A person who undergoes hardships is not judged in the same measure as one whose life has been easy going. You are created in the image of God; and God loves you whether you are responsible for your condition or not; He wishes to work out wonders in your life. God has a wonderful purpose for every moment in our lives; He has good works and He hath before ordained that we should walk in them. We - all humans- are His handmaiden, the very theme of His concern and love. His capable hands wish to intervene in our toughest circumstances, to do the good works in which we are ordained to walk. None of us knows when we shall die; every moment that we live is but a gift from God, an invitation to be fruitful and to live a life that reflects His glory. Changing our lives daily into the likeness of His love is a vocation for all mankind. The gravely ailing, or those anticipating suffering, are not exempted. God calls upon you not to fall into the ordeal of wondering whether your condition is a reflection of His punishment and wrath; whether you are guilty; whether others are guilty, or whether you are innocent and that therefore God deserves your anger and bitterness. The Lord invites you to ask the essential questions in life: How can I live a fruitful and meaningful life? How can I recognize the presence of the Lord within my ordeal or tribulation? How can I be sure of the steadfastness of my relationship with the Lord; or that I\u2019m being edified in His grace, His love and His service? How can I enjoy every single day of my life in a joyful relationship with Him \u2013 ministering for Him and to others? Whether you think you are responsible for acquiring HIV through carelessness or not, you need to be sure of God\u2019s forgiveness for your sins, and that you abide in Him; for whosoever abides in Him will never be lost, but will have eternal life. So pray a prayer of simple faith asking the Lord to enter into your life, to fill it with His grace and love; to give you the assurance that you are His son or daughter, and that no one will ever be able to snatch you from His hand.

Such power does not exist in seclusion, anger or bitterness; rather, it comes from loving God and those around us. How to gain spiritual and emotional power 3 Join a support group or be ready to form a support group for people living with HIV. The power you will experience in such a group is capable of supporting you in moments of despair, weakness or fear. 3 Cast yourself into the hands of the Mighty God who can do all things: He can heal you, sustain you when facing a crisis, grant you new faith to share with others, and make you a source of faith, joy and love to many others. 3 The way you cope with your condition could bring about incredible glory to God. 3 Your care not to transmit the virus to others, awareness of your condition, concern for your treatment, nutrition, and a healthy lifestyle, all this along with your prayers for yourself will bring glory to God before Man, angels and the entire universe. Lesson Three: A message of love and hope for people living with AIDS Themes: Christ identified with your suffering and ailment. Nothing can separate us from the love of Christ. Life is measured not by the number of days lived, but rather the depth lived. Faith gives a meaning to life. Care for the body and the spirit. Sione\u2019s story Sione learnt he had HIV three years ago and began ARV treatment. He began to feel and look better. But then the stories started. \u201cThe rumours started to circulate that there was a Tokelauan guy in Samoa who had this AIDS. The rumours were from other Tokelau Islanders here.\u201d Sione felt embarrassed and stigmatised. \u201cOne day, I went to my office and I asked someone from my island if there was any story about me back home. He said yes. I asked him what kind of story? He told me he\u2019d heard that I got AIDS. At that time, I didn\u2019t know what I would do because people were talking about me.\u201d Worse was to come. \u201cI walked into my office one day, you know I\u2019m a hard worker and do very well in my job. But my boss called me in and told me: \u2018Sorry, there is no more job for you.\u2019 I asked him why and he said: \u2018Because there is a virus in your body, you cannot work anymore\u2019.\u201d Sione was fortunate in the support of his wife and both their families. He now has his own small business and describes himself as having no problems. \u2018I\u2019m very happy to talk to people, not to talk about the disease, but just socialise and interact with people and my family,\u201d he says. Asked if he plans to publicly disclose his status and do advocacy work, Sione laughs \u201cNo that\u2019s not for me. I am a weak person, but who knows, maybe later\u201d.

And who can speak of his descendants? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken. 9 He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though Guideline for Christian Leaders Guideline for Christian Leaders 24 25 he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth. 10 Yet it was the LORD\u2019s will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0f93df8-740a-4dbb-867f-45bfbcadd58b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0f93df8-740a-4dbb-867f-45bfbcadd58b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Pacific Guide on Responding to HIV for Christian Ministers, Pastors and Communities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9e6a083bf475d64e5b400f5531a5a2b6cf6a288883964774a35de15728460c2"}}, "hash": "c9e6a083bf475d64e5b400f5531a5a2b6cf6a288883964774a35de15728460c2", "text": "of the LORD will prosper in his hand. 11 After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.

In his love and mercy he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old. (Isaiah 63: 9) 15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin. 16 Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.(Hebrews 4: 14-16) \u2022 Christ, our great high priest, suffered for the sake of each one of us. \u2022 He intercedes for us to grant us power to face suffering. \u2022 The Lord identifies with our weaknesses, impairments and infirmities and gives us power, might, health and life. \u2022 People believed that Jesus suffered because God was punishing him, as Isaiah says, but in fact His suffering was to deliver us from our sins. \u2022 People living with HIV suffer because of their condition, and because of people\u2019s insensitivity towards them. \u2022 Yet, God is aware and is mindful of our suffering; He personally suffered like us. He feels the pain of our infirmities and is mindful of the injustice befalling us; He too was wounded and unfairly treated unto death. \u2022 Indeed, He was wounded to give us life. He died and was resurrected that we may be restored to life along with Him. He lived out pain that we may face it with courage and power. He was unjustly treated to give us mercy and justice; to carry our sins and inequities. \u2022 Let us trust Him, the Mighty One, who is able to heal our bodies, and raise both bodies and spirits to eternal life, where there is no death, disease, sorrow or injustice. Nothing can separate us from the love of Christ 37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.(Romans 8: 37-39). \u2022 There is no tribulation or disease upon earth that is able to deprive us or separate us from the love of Christ. \u2022 The Lord loves you, even as you are ailing, weak and fainting; He longs to hear your voice, and to listen to the beat of your heart, full of His love, closeness and trust in His blessed person. \u2022 Ask Him to dwell in your heart and to fill your life with His spirit. \u2022 Trust His blood with forgiveness of sins and pursue the sacraments with faith and joy; He will give you power to face death and life - life as you live it and life after death. \u2022 The early Christians trusted Christ despite persecution, tribulation, famines (hunger), disgrace (nakedness), danger and death. \u2022 Every moment that you have on earth is an opportunity to experience and live such love and such trust. \u2022 Who can separate us from the love of Christ? Indeed nothing can separate us from Christ; and nothing can separate us from His love for us.

Caring for the body and the spirit 29 After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- (Ephesians 5: 29) 8 For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.(1 Timothy 4: 8) \u2022 Nurturing your body and fighting the ailment through medication, prayers, love and a balanced lifestyle is an expression of your faith and love for God. \u2022 Should your faith weaken or faint, seek power and help from the Lord. \u2022 Do not doubt your value as human, the value of your suffering, nor God\u2019s love for you. Should you doubt, ask the Lord to support the weakness in your faith. \u2022 Ask God to give you the power to face every hardship with dignity, joy and trust, as a child of God \u2013 a child of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. \u2022 Ask Him to reveal in you all fruits of the Spirit, all health of the body, all faith and all trust of which He is the source. \u2022 Let not your heart be troubled, nor tremble away from God\u2019s love; His love will always lead you, even in the hardest and cruellest circumstances.

(Romans 15: 1) 8 If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.(1 Timothy 5: 8) 37 Jesus replied: \u201c \u2018Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.\u2019 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 (Matthew 22: 37-39) \u2022 The first and greatest command is to love God and every person we deal with. \u2022 Love is to offer help and try to build bridges of communication, understanding, listening and support. \u2022 Love is to provide care and concern, sparing no effort. \u2022 The Apostle Paul rebukes anyone who does not provide for his own household; he takes such to be denial of faith. \u2022 Upon realizing their HIV infection, a person is mostly subject to trauma and great stress - anticipating severe symptoms and ailments and eventually death. \u2022 Hence Man senses his own feebleness, incompetence and great need for strength. \u2022 The Bible states that Christ died for the feeble and not for the strong. The Apostle Paul asserts the fact that we are all dissolute, and as such Christ died for us. Therefore, regardless of the means of transmission, people living with HIV are so precious in the eyes of the Lord that He died for them.

This applies equally to those whose symptoms have appeared and those in whom there is not yet any indication of the symptoms. People living with HIV; are they worse sinners than other people? Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 2 Jesus answered, \u201cDo you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? 3 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. 4 Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them--do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? 5 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.\u201d (Luke 13: 1-5) \u2022 Some people living with HIV feel that their condition is an expression of God\u2019s disapproval; and some of them feel guilty because of their condition. Their families may sometimes feel the same way. \u2022 While the Lord Jesus was on earth, it was believed that the eighteen people killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them were worse sinners than others; similar beliefs existed about the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. \u2022 People living with HIV are not worse sinners than the rest of the human race; we are all same when it comes to Divine balance (all fall short of the glory of God). \u2022 We may or may not know what caused the infection; but in all cases we need to trust in God\u2019s mercy, love and forgiveness. 24 and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. (Romans 3: 24) \u2022 Some of the families of people living with HIV believe that it was the wrong behaviour of their sons or daughters that caused the infection. \u2022 They may feel that they have fallen short or have gone wrong in raising their children \u2013 not offering the right support to them. \u2022 There is no need to feel that way. It can very well be that we did not go wrong in raising our children, nor have we faltered in offering them support; and yet they become infected. \u2022 In fact, no one is without sin, and there is no sin worse than another.

Even if you are not used to praying together, you may just need to try; either use your church prayer books, or simply improvise. \u2022 Let us try to pray together or ask a church minister to join us in prayer. Our perspective of people living with HIV \u2022 People living with HIV, whether their symptoms have appeared or not, are not a source of danger, nor are they a cause of panic and terror. As we mentioned before, HIV is not transmitted by water, air or everyday co-living. \u2022 We should not avoid, shun or fear people living with HIV. Likewise we should not treat them as weird nor make them feel that they have committed a crime or an obscene act which deserves punishment. Neither should we show them pity or sympathy in a haughty manner; nor make them feel as if they are little children, or that they are impaired. \u2022 We need to remember that our infected beloved one is the very same son,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b57cc310-a696-4973-995b-3ed6662fd981": {"__data__": {"id_": "b57cc310-a696-4973-995b-3ed6662fd981", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Pacific Guide on Responding to HIV for Christian Ministers, Pastors and Communities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc113bb3ae14c119055ecbae3b1d36022fff71f97977f5319577debbec6e94ac"}}, "hash": "dc113bb3ae14c119055ecbae3b1d36022fff71f97977f5319577debbec6e94ac", "text": "daughter, mother, sister or father whom we have loved and known all our lives. \u2022 People living with HIV are human beings with dignity and value; they are indeed worthy of our love and respect. Understanding the pain of the families of people living with HIV \u2022 Knowing that a beloved one is infected or affected with HIV causes great pain to family members. \u2022 This pain stems from fear of the infection and the stigma associated with it. \u2022 The grief in anticipation of the emotional and physical pain they will face. \u2022 The pain of confusion and not knowing when the symptoms will appear and when the end will come. 9 In all their distress he too was distressed, and the angel of his presence saved them. In his love and mercy he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.(Isaiah 63: 9) 15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin. (Hebrews 4: 15) 32 When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, \u201cLord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.\u201d 33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. 34 \u201cWhere have you laid him?\u201d he asked. \u201cCome and see, Lord,\u201d they replied. 35 Jesus wept. 36 Then the Jews said, \u201cSee how he loved him!\u201d 37 But some of them said, \u201cCould not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?\u201d (John 11: 32-37) \u2022 The Lord Jesus was deeply moved and troubled by the ailments of the people. \u2022 Jesus was troubled by the grief and predicaments of the people. Jesus, the knight, who was to soon strike a harsh blow to His greatest enemy, death, was troubled before the tomb of Lazarus; He even wept, right before He cried out loud, \u201cLazarus come forth.\u201d \u2022 Jesus Christ, the resurrection and the life, is troubled and weeps before disease and death. \u2022 The Lord is present in a special way and sends His angel to help the afflicted \u2013 the angel of His presence. \u2022 We pray that the Lord will open our eyes in time of confusion and pain in order that we might be in touch with Him and the wonderful angel of His presence. \u2022 The Lord Jesus gives us trust and hope in life eternal; likewise He gives us power and courage when He senses we are in the middle of pain and confusion. He was, like us, tempted in everything so that He would identify with the ailing and their families. \u2022 Does it amaze us that Jesus said that if we visited the ailing and treated them with love, that we would be doing the same to Jesus in person? (Matthew 25: 31-46). \u2022 Does it amaze us that the Lord of glory said that if we neglect or mistreat the ailing, we would be mistreating the Lord Jesus in person? Wonder, did Jesus mean to speak only of the righteous or the saints as He spoke of the ailing, or did he mean all of the ailing? Are not all the ailing sinners too? Ministering to our neighbours, people living with HIV \u2022 Whatever causes the infection of people living with HIV, they are all a reflection of the image of the Lord Jesus; when we serve and love them, we are indeed serving and loving the Lord Jesus in person. \u2022 Remember what the old man Simeon said to the Virgin Mary in his prophecy about the life and death of her beloved son. 35 so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.\u201d (Luke 2:35). \u2022 The same message goes for the families of people living with HIV - a sword pierces through their souls. \u2022 However, they too, like the Virgin Mary, enjoy blessings and opportunities to experience the presence of the Lord, should they endure and accept the pain with power, courage and faith. \u2022 We pray for people living with HIV, their families and beloved ones; we will minister to them much like the Virgin Mary ministered to Elizabeth as the latter was pregnant with John the Baptist.

They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.31 A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. 32 So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33 But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. 34 He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him. 35 The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. \u2018Look after him,\u2019 he said, \u2018and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.\u2019 36 \u201cWhich of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?\u201d 37 The expert in the law replied, \u201cThe one who had mercy on him.\u201d Jesus told him, \u201cGo and do likewise.\u201d (Luke 10: 27-37) \u2022 The Lord Jesus teaches us that every person we meet or may have contact with is our neighbour; His command to us is: \u201clove your neighbour as yourself.\u201d \u2022 The man who was wounded and was half dead needed the love of the Good Samaritan; and the Samaritan offered him that love. \u2022 People living with HIV need that same kind of love. \u2022 Perhaps the priest and Levite who passed by on the other side were scared to stop and help the man who was stripped, beaten and robbed, lest they face the same fate. In general, however, this fear is not justified. No need to isolate people living with HIV \u2022 Some people fear those infected or affected with HIV without justification. Unlike the \u2018flu, for example, HIV is not transmitted through food utensils, bath equipment, shaking hands, kissing or everyday co-living. There is therefore, no reason to isolate, avoid or fear people living with HIV.

These are the only means of transmitting HIV. \u2022 Sharing the same Cup of Communion with people living with HIV presents absolutely no danger of infection, regardless of the way the sacrament is practiced. \u2022 We should express our love and support to all suffering people (especially people living with HIV); we should invite them", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68acea55-f7a4-42b8-9ba5-ad3487a96265": {"__data__": {"id_": "68acea55-f7a4-42b8-9ba5-ad3487a96265", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Pacific Guide on Responding to HIV for Christian Ministers, Pastors and Communities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2e5d6abee058bed80d3cc468f8a73d99677bd463b64076cc36ffcf9496fec65"}}, "hash": "d2e5d6abee058bed80d3cc468f8a73d99677bd463b64076cc36ffcf9496fec65", "text": "to partake in communion and all the means of grace and not deprive them of the sacraments. \u2022 We pray that the Lord will grant that we may discern His voice, and treat everyone who enters His house with respect, love and appreciation.

Is it not the rich who are exploiting you?

(Hebrews 10: 24-25) \u2022 Some people living with HIV choose to isolate themselves and stop attending church or spiritual gatherings. \u2022 The word of God commands us to encourage them to participate in good deeds and acts of love; and not to quit spiritual gatherings and meetings. \u2022 There is no justifiable reason - neither medical nor based on faith - to cause those infected or affected by HIV to isolate themselves or to stop attending spiritual fellowship and meetings. \u2022 On the contrary, people living with HIV should be encouraged to take advantage of the spiritual support and prayers offered by others. 14 And we urge you, brothers, warn those who are idle, encourage the timid, help the weak, be patient with everyone.

I left home because I could not be myself, could not express myself and do things I was comfortable with. This job that I have guarantees that I pay my rent and buy my food.

If he had taken warning, he would have saved himself. 6 But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes the life of one of them, that man will be taken away because of his sin, but I will hold the watchman accountable for his blood.\u2019 (Ezekiel 33: 1-6) Breaking the Silence \u2022 With the existence of at least 30,000 people infected with HIV in Oceania, the issue is one which affects us all. \u2022 We need to speak out about the presence of HIV among us, stating the basic facts of the pandemic from our church pulpits, schools, study groups and prayer meetings. \u2022 We need to encourage and organize campaigns to reach out to vulnerable people, particularly those that society marginalises through judgemental attitudes: commercial sex workers (prostitutes) and their clients, gay men and transgender persons, injecting drug users, women and girls who are victims of violence and perpetrators of this violence. Reaching out to vulnerable groups 18 Then Jesus came to them and said, \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.

For example, a man who practices unprotected sex with commercial sex workers could be infected and then transmit the virus to other sex workers and to his wife, who might consequently transmit it to her infant baby. \u2022 An injecting drug user who uses a contaminated syringe may likewise transmit the virus to his wife. \u2022 Women, boys and girls who are victims of sexual violence in the family are at heightened risk", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16a81e51-5576-4f08-8fa4-bbca4c4e4f2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "16a81e51-5576-4f08-8fa4-bbca4c4e4f2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Pacific Guide on Responding to HIV for Christian Ministers, Pastors and Communities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7d00f2469f94bae50dbb5132692dddc0bfd5a7e07b6178c39fc107b014f1586"}}, "hash": "d7d00f2469f94bae50dbb5132692dddc0bfd5a7e07b6178c39fc107b014f1586", "text": "of contracting HIV directly from the perpetrators of the violence; and indirectly through their own risky behaviours they may subsequently engage in as the result of the loss of their self-esteem.

This might even result in them seeking desperate actions that may put themselves and others further at risk.

In fact, we should have moved much earlier. \u2022 Our aim is not merely to protect the healthy and righteous but to help the ailing and sinners.

If so, this Bible passage calls us to repent. \u2022 Do we condemn those who have sex outside marriage, reject them and seek to apply the Law of Moses on them? Do we seek to stone them or kill them, literally or emotionally? If so, those verses call us to repent. \u2022 The \u201cwoman was caught in the act\u201d; the law condemned the man as well but what happened to him? \u2022 In our society, do we tend to be more lenient with men who fall into sexual sins than with women? Do we tend to condemn women, holding them more accountable than men? \u2022 In what other areas are we being unfair to women in our society - not treating them equally - and giving men more rights than we do to women? \u2022 Let us pray for God to grant us justice and equality in all our dealings and, above all else, to be loving and humble that we may not condemn but rather love people \u2013 men and women - that our lives might be a source of blessings and salvation to them. \u2022 Protecting the lives of those rendered vulnerable by their behaviours or the behaviours of others, is likewise a holy mission for they are loved by the Lord. \u2022 How do we open the doors of change and repentance? \u2022 Calling upon people to undergo radical changes in their lifestyles does not contradict with alerting them to the dangers of risky behaviour and to the available means of prevention. \u2022 If it is unfeasible to provide alternative livelihood for commercial sex workers (prostitutes), or if they reject alternative livelihoods, it is still essential to make sure they have access to means of protection such as condoms as well as their clients, this could protect their lives until the right time comes for them to be able to change their lifestyle.

However, this call is not effective when it comes in hollow words and trumpet preaching; it only succeeds through perseverance in love, unconditional acceptance, refusal to condemn and understanding and listening to people who are marginalised because their behaviours are frowned upon by society. Change needs time, effort and spiritual and emotional support. Care and treatment for people living with HIV \u2022 Small groups of people living with HIV gathering to support one another may have significant and beneficial emotional, spiritual and even physical effects on their members. \u2022 The Lord commanded us to visit, care and pray for the ailing. Undertaking such visits and prayers is an essential mission for every Christian minister. \u2022 We need to encourage anyone who thinks he or she might have been exposed to HIV infection to undergo the necessary medical test (voluntarily) and to receive psychological counselling both before and after the test. \u2022 We need to assist people living with HIV however we can. This includes advocating for medication to be available to them and encouraging them to live a healthy and balanced life in all aspects: physically, emotionally and spiritually.

Employment and services are not keeping pace with their growing numbers. Improved access to education is less likely to open opportunities for paid employment. Pacific youth are at the forefront of rapid social change, including changes in sexual behaviour. Cultural identity is still important to young people in the Pacific, who typically have a strong sense of the importance of family expectations and their own obligations and status. But social change and disruption can expose young people\u2019s vulnerability to drug and alcohol abuse, mental health problems and suicide. All these reactions to the pressures of change are evident across the region: in some countries, recorded alcohol abuse and suicide rates are some of the highest in the world. In all Pacific countries, the proportion of HIV cases among youth has been increasing steadily, particularly for young women. More than 30 separate studies of youth\u2014defined in most Pacific surveys as males and females aged between 15 and 24 years\u2014have been conducted throughout the Pacific. Yet little information can be gleaned about the risk behaviours of young people, especially from Fiji and French Polynesia, two of the higher HIV incidence countries. A Demographic and Health Survey in the Marshall Islands found that, as with many young people across the world, 73% of young men and 60% of young women had sex before they turned 18. But only 10% of men and 16% of women aged 15\u201324 reported having used a condom during their first sexual intercourse. This pattern runs parallel to teenage fertility rates that are high in some countries. It is also roughly consistent with that of the median age of the first sexual experience, which is generally lowest in Melanesia and Micronesia.

Young women are affected by changing social attitudes and sexual practices, which have generally increased the extent of premarital and extramarital sex, even while reproductive health services remain largely restricted to married women, especially in more conservative rural communities. But young women also often fear that carrying or asking for condoms will brand them as promiscuous. As in many other parts of the world, many young people in the Pacific experience their first sexual encounter through force and coercion. Surveys in Samoa, Cook Islands and Kiribati found high levels of pressure and force involved in the first sexual experience of many young people. Young people can also be involved in higher risk practices such as drug use, transactional sex and male-to-male sex. Many young men (especially in all-male environments such as boarding schools or young men\u2019s houses) engage in same-sex behaviour (which does not necessarily include penetrative sex) but do not identify as being bisexual or homosexual. Relatively few young people report having sex with sex workers but the level of transactional sex is high. There are serious gaps in information on what influences these behaviours, why condom use remains low, or the specific contexts in which transactional sex and sexual violence occur. Clearly it is desirable that all countries should focus on carrying out systematic and repeated research studies of young people\u2019s behaviours, knowledge and the barriers to putting what they do know into practice.

(2 Timothy 2: 22) 3 For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. 4 When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. 5 Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. (Colossians 3: 3-5) \u2022 Self-control starts in the heart. \u2022 A pure heart is one full of love. \u2022 Your love for others is not a desire to use their bodies for your lustful pleasure. \u2022 Strong love is utter purity. \u2022 The Bible calls upon us all, both women and men, to love with brotherly love. \u2022 We are called to treat people as humans - brothers and sisters - not tools to fulfil our lustful desires and instincts. \u2022 Pornography does not regard people as humans but as tools for lust. \u2022 Avoid things that stir lust in your life and encourage and cherish what enhances respect, love and fraternity among people. \u2022 Guard your physical eyes from lust provoking scenes and your mind\u2019s eyes from lustful imagining. \u2022 Your genuine relationship with God and loving ministry to others gives you the power to overcome lustful desires. \u2022 We are more than conquerors in Christ; He loved us and gave us His purity, joy, love and holiness. \u2022 Delight yourself in the Lord; rejoice in Him, be filled with His love \u2013 be enriched enough to stay away from the lustful desires of the world and the selfishness of the flesh.

Guideline for Christian Leaders Guideline for Christian Leaders 48 49 Past terminology Preferred terminology HIV/AIDS; HIV and AIDS Use the term that is most specific and appropriate in the context to avoid confusion between HIV (a virus) and AIDS (a clinical syndrome). Examples include \u2018people living with HIV\u2019, \u2018HIV prevalence\u2019, \u2018HIV prevention\u2019, \u2018HIV testing and counselling\u2019, \u2018HIV-related disease\u2019, \u2018AIDS diagnosis\u2019, \u2018children orphaned by AIDS\u2019, \u2018AIDS response\u2019, \u2018national AIDS programme\u2019, \u2018AIDS service organisation\u2019. Both \u2018HIV epidemic\u2019 and \u2018AIDS epidemic\u2019 are acceptable, but \u2018HIV epidemic\u2019 is a more inclusive term. AIDS virus There is no AIDS virus. The virus that causes AIDS is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Please note that \u2018virus\u2019 in the phrase \u2018HIV virus\u2019 is redundant. Use \u2018HIV\u2019. AIDS-infected No one is infected with AIDS; AIDS is not an infectious agent. AIDS describes a syndrome of opportunistic infections and diseases that can develop as immunosuppression deepens along the continuum of HIV infection from acute infection to death. Avoid \u2018HIV-infected\u2019 in favour of person living with HIV or HIV- positive person (if serostatus is known). AIDS test There is no test for AIDS. Use HIV test or HIV antibody test. For early infant diagnosis, HIV antigen tests are used. AIDS victim Use person living with HIV. The word \u2018victim\u2019 is disempowering. Use AIDS only when referring to a person with a clinical diagnosis of AIDS. AIDS patient Use the term \u2018patient\u2019 only when referring to a clinical setting. Use patient with HIV- related illness (or disease) as this covers the full spectrum of HIV-associated clinical conditions. Summary of preferred terminology and errors to avoid Risk of AIDS Use \u2018risk of HIV infection\u2019 or \u2018risk of exposure to HIV\u2019 (unless referring to behaviours or conditions that increase the risk of disease progression in an HIV- positive person). High(er) risk groups; vulnerable groups Use key populations at higher risk (both key to the epidemic\u2019s dynamics and key to the response). Key populations are distinct from vulnerable populations, which are subject to societal pressures or social circumstances that may make them more vulnerable to exposure to infections, including HIV. Commercial sex work This says the same thing twice in different words. Preferred terms are sex work, commercial sex, or the sale of sexual services. Prostitute or prostitution These words should not be used. For adults, use terms such as sex work, sex worker, commercial sex, transactional sex, or the sale of sexual services. When children are involved, refer to commercial sexual exploitation of children. Intravenous drug user Drugs are injected subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. Use person who injects drugs to place emphasis on the person first. A broader term that may apply in some situations is person who uses drugs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "103b54d2-7597-438d-a192-90d4a35da28b": {"__data__": {"id_": "103b54d2-7597-438d-a192-90d4a35da28b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Pacific Guide on Responding to HIV for Christian Ministers, Pastors and Communities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "621646b8e825568e0cf0809478cead49096cc993112c275b851a03a93770cdbd"}, "2": {"node_id": "d9a38224-cfb0-49f6-a292-738e0264a8ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-guide-responding-hiv-christian-ministers-pastors-and-communities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8af8f1e59b54ce1bcd7772f7f47f214b23d1892dcf67ad4626aeee5a08ed8b00"}}, "hash": "f57f44b420992a0138fb0543212f44fce395c2479b8fe798fe1a50d2dd41b040", "text": "A broader term that may apply in some situations is person who uses drugs.

AIDS is currently the leading cause of death among peo- ple between 15 and 44 years old in Asia1. While the aggregate econom- ic impact of HIV is often negligible in Asia, it can exert devastating ef- fects on households. The Commission of AIDS in Asia report2 estimates that every AIDS death could result in an income loss of $5,000 on average. The report also projects that an additional 6 million households in Asia will have been pushed below the poverty line by 2015 given the current level of HIV prevention, treatment and care & support activities. This could jeopardise the achievement of the MDGs. Recent food price inflation in Asia warrants a careful analysis of its im- pact on households affected by HIV. Since 2000, food prices have been rising in Asia and the Pacific and throughout the world, with par- ticularly sharp increases since 2007. Recent projections on how these in- creases affect the poor in develop- ing countries show that increases in the poverty headcount are likely to be severe, eliminating much of the progress in poverty reduction that has been made in recent years. For families affected by HIV, the situation is potentially even more precarious. HIV-affected house- holds are likely to have lost income due to the disease or discrimination in some cases, or because a family member who would otherwise be working is needed to provide care for someone living with HIV in the household. HIV-affected households also have direct costs for medical care that are fairly inflexible. Finally, since households living in poverty tend to spend a higher percentage of total expenditures on food, medi- cal expenses must often come out 1 Commission on AIDS in Asia (2008): Redefining AIDS in Asia: Crafting an effective response.

There are several reasons why mal- nutrition is particularly risky for people living with HIV (PLHIV), in- cluding that deficiencies in micro- nutrients augment the disease\u2019s progression and that HIV infection also increases body\u2019s need for en- ergy. It is particularly important for those undergoing antiretroviral treatment (HIV treatment) to re- ceive sufficient nutrition. This paper investigates the potential impact of rising food prices in Asia on HIV-affected households in two ways. First, it presents a review of the research to date on how HIV affects the household economy. Second, it analyzes data from household studies in five countries to investi- gate specific ways that food price increases could affect households.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5e8eb0a-dfdb-45d5-a8ac-d0460ffad768": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5e8eb0a-dfdb-45d5-a8ac-d0460ffad768", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "590cee3988cd915dc3813c3a6844620c9edfd53f990188a8773ba32596bb6a80"}, "2": {"node_id": "61ac8197-f95e-40ba-a5b7-8e43ca65a7db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16811251a890eea436a23ca19b42f557ea59d678a2066312f8e5025193b635b7"}}, "hash": "2e43e70622bf25c68bce17f310adcbc015af10953762c301ac82c1e92d703c52", "text": "The key objective of the paper is to assess the impact of HIV on food security and identify gaps in current research on this topic in Asia. Summary of Key Findings Rises in food prices are likely to affect HIV-affected households more than those at the same income level that are not affected by HIV. In some cases, HIV-affected households spend a lower proportion of their total expenditures on food than their non-HIV counterparts, implying that these households divert money that they would otherwise spend on food to use for medical expenses.

While expenditures on grains do not vary much by income, HIV-affected households with higher incomes spend more money on protein-rich foods like meat, eggs and dairy products and nutrient-rich foods like vegetables and fruits. Poor HIV-affected households are financially more vulnerable and less able to withstand external shocks. HIV-affected households have much higher amounts of dissavings and borrowing than non-HIV households. Debts can further weaken their ability to buy sufficient quantity and quality of food items particularly at the time of increasing food prices. The provision of food support targeting poor HIV-affected households could be highly beneficial and effective. In Cambodia, the food support program had a strong positive impact. The intervention households spent a much lower percentage of expenditures on food as well as on medical costs. Lower medical costs can be presumed to be the result of better nutrition and better health. There is the presence of potential HIV threats to the agricultural sector and therefore food security. The study in China found a reduced farm activity, reduced area under cultivation as well as non-diversity of crops among HIV-affected farm households compared with non-affected farm households. Among the most obvious research gaps in the Asian region is the lack of good quality longitudinal data on the impact of HIV on households and food security. No study has followed HIV-affected households over time to see how they react to changing economic conditions and changing HIV-related policies. This need is urgent as we have already entered uncertain economic times, and policy makers are still debating how to respond to the economic crises and to protect the most vulnerable through various safety nets. 3 By the mid-2000s, many well-de- signed studies have investigated the impact of HIV on the house- hold economy. However, only a few studies have included matched samples of households affected and not affected by HIV, so that di- rect comparisons may be made of the household economy. Five relevant studies were analysed to examine the potential impact of higher food prices on HIV-affected households in Asia. Three of the studies, from China (A total of 2,043 households were surveyed), India (8,292 households) and Thailand (600 households), include matched samples from HIV-affected and non-HIV- affected households. The Cambodian study (684 households) examined two types of HIV-affect- ed households (including people living with HIV [PLHIV] and with orphans (due to AIDS) and vulner- able children [OVC]) and compares households who were beneficiaries of an integrated food support and home-based care program with those of similar income and com- position who were not. Finally, the Vietnam study investigated expen- diture patterns of 125 households that included a PLHIV in four cities. While there are variations among the countries studied, the analysis indicates that rises in food prices will likely impact the quality as well as the quantity of diets for HIV- affected households. It was found that in some cases HIV-affected households had spent a lower proportion on food than those not affected, as well as a higher percentage on medical costs. HIV- affected households spent a lower percentage on food than their non- HIV counterparts, while wealthier house holds spent about the same percentage whether they were HIV- affected or not. This implies that poorer households were diverting money that they would otherwise spend on food to use for medical expenses. \u201cOther\u201d expenses show the sharp- est increase at higher wealth levels, especially for urban households. With regard to the quality of food, expenditures on grains did not vary much by income. As generally ex- pected, households with higher in- comes spent more money on pro- tein-rich foods like meat, eggs and dairy products and nutrient-rich foods like vegetables and fruits. The findings on coping strategies among HIV-affected households are similar to those found by other studies. The top answer on how they cover increased medical ex- penses, mentioned by one-third of respondents, was to borrow from friends and relatives. Nearly the same proportion said that they had used their savings for medical expenses and another one-quarter said that they liquidated assets.

These findings suggest potential impact of HIV on food se- curity risks from the supply side. In Cambodia, the findings clearly show the positive impact of the food support program as the inter- vention households spent a much lower percentage of expenditures on food. Interestingly, they also paid a lower percentage on medical costs; since no additional medical services were provided as part of the program, this can be presumed to be a result of better health status due to improved food security. Comparing the control and inter- vention households, it is seen that the intervention households (re- ceiving the food support) generally spent the money they had saved on food and medical expenses on children\u2019s education and \u201cother\u201d expenses. The HIV-affected house- holds show similar differences in expenditure patterns between the control and intervention samples, although the difference in food expenditures is less sharp. Inter- vention households spent less on grains, as rice was provided to the households as part of the food support program. They also spent A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia 4 more money on protein-rich foods, indicating that the food support program had enhanced both the quality and quantity of food for these households. Additionally, the program enabled HIV-affected households to invest in children\u2019s education. The Vietnam study focused on HIV- affected households only. When asked the major sources of pay- ment for health expenses, only the poorest households reported that they had sold assets to pay for healthcare costs. The use of savings increased with household income while the use of borrowing de- creases. The study found that HIV- affected households had reduced consumption expenditures that they would otherwise make by be- tween 37% (for the poorest house- holds) and 42% (for the wealthiest households). With regard to pov- erty, they found that all households below the wealthiest quintile (in other words, 80% of households) would fall below the poverty line as a result of the income and expendi- ture effects of HIV. Future Studies Needed Among the most obvious research gaps in the Asian region is the lack of good quality longitudinal data on the impact of HIV on households. No study has followed households over time to see how they react to changing economic conditions. This need is urgent as we have al- ready entered uncertain economic times, and policy makers are still debating how to respond to global food needs and other aspects of the economic crises. At the same time, Asian govern- ments have responded in a variety of ways to meet the needs of PL- HIV and their households. It is im- portant to see the impact of these programs over time, including pro- grams addressing health-including antiretroviral treatment, care and support including psychosocial support, health insurance schemes, and other medical services-as well as food support and financial as- sistance programs should be exam- ined. More detail is also needed on the impact of antiretroviral treatment on households in Asia. The recently con- ducted studies in India and China also show evidence that the food situation is less severe for households with free antiretroviral drugs available, in com- parison to the high medical expen- ditures reported by Thai households in the 1999 study. The issue of the household economy, food security and risk behavior has also not been examined. As part of this research, attention should be paid to include the long-term impact of HIV as part of study designs. Most of the studies to-date have been cross-sectional, meaning that they provide a snapshot in time of house- holds with a PLHIV member at differ- ent stages of the disease. By analyz- ing how households react to different stages of illness and death and often volatile economic circumstances, pro- grams can be better designed to deal with varying needs. Finally, the topic of how agricultural and other liveli- hood systems interact with the HIV- affected household, particularly with regard to food production has not been sufficiently investigated in Asia. 5 Chapter Two introduction Recent food price inflation in Asia warrants a careful analysis of its im- pact on households affected by HIV. Thailand, for example, has witnessed a two-fold increase in the price of rice in the first quarter of 2008 [4]. The International Monetary Fund estimates that food prices have risen 65.7% globally from mid-2005 to August 2008 [32]. Price increases have been driven by several fac- tors, including the declining supply of rice and other cereals relative to consumption; fuel", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "359a9f9b-b19d-4b39-9a66-cf91111c693f": {"__data__": {"id_": "359a9f9b-b19d-4b39-9a66-cf91111c693f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fac43eb1ecba1d547bdf9ad671bd6cfff682e54b14c547c84dc07efd279edea2"}, "3": {"node_id": "c716d0ec-c2a5-497f-a666-5b4a110987be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "335ea771e661f4cd77e62c59896700960a41bbe3f0adf963d275639015ce46d9"}}, "hash": "aacc40f6cc785dcbf32b21818f64833891bf7823d33e804d1af7ec13cccb5e32", "text": "scarcity; adverse weather; turmoil in financial mar- kets making commodities an attrac- tive investment; changes in dietary habits globally towards higher meat and dairy consumption; conversion of grain to biofuels; competing de- mands for land; and many others [4]. Recent projections on how these in- creases affect the poor in develop- ing countries show that increases in the poverty headcount are likely to be severe, eliminating much of the progress in poverty reduction that has been made in recent years. Moreover, the favorable effect of higher prices on rural food produc- ers is projected by several studies to be minimal [4, 5, 33, 62]. Given the impoverishing effects of HIV in Asia and the Pacific, current food price inflation could further exacerbate economic challenges for HIV-affected households [3, 35, 49]. In particular, a rapid food price increase could cause a greater number of vulnerable HIV-affected households to fall below the food poverty line. The reasons for this may be outlined as follows: HIV-affected households are ` likely to have lost income due to the disease. Most persons living with HIV (PLHIV) are adults in the working age groups who may lose time at work due to illness or be forced to stop working altogether. HIV-affected households may ` also lose income because a family member who would otherwise be working is needed to provide care for someone with HIV in the household. HIV-affected households have ` direct costs that are fairly inflexible. Medical costs normally have to be paid in cash and at the time A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia 6 of service. Transportation costs are also associated with seeking medical care and have been rising as well. ` Households living in poverty tend to spend a higher percentage of total expenditures on food. For HIV-affected households, medical expenses must thus of necessity come out of the (already inadequate) household food budget. ` For persons living with HIV, not getting an adequate nutrition supply is lethal. This is particularly true for those on antiretroviral treatment. This paper investigates the impact of rising food prices in Asia on HIV- affected households in two ways. First, it presents a review of the re- search to date on how HIV affects the household economy. Second, it ana- lyzes data from household studies in five countries to investigate specific ways that food price increases could affect households. The key objective of the paper is to assess the impact of HIV on food security and identify gaps in current research on this topic in Asia. Methodology Data from five country studies are analyzed to examine the potential impact of higher food prices on HIV- affected households. Three of the studies, from China, India and Thai- land, include matched samples from HIV-affected and non-HIV-affected households [34, 53]. This allows us to compare how having an HIV-positive member makes household expendi- ture patterns differ for households that are otherwise similar. The Cambodian study examines two types of HIV-affected households: those including one or more PLHIV and those including one or more orphans and vulnerable children (OVC). This study compares house- holds who were beneficiaries of an integrated food support and home- based care program with those of similar income and composition who live in an area that has not yet been included in the program [56]. Finally, the Vietnam study investi- gated expenditure patterns of 125 households that included a family member living with HIV in four cit- ies [59]. Further details on these five studies are given in the Appendix. Differences in household expendi- tures and income between HIV-affect- ed and non-HIV-affected households are tested for statistical significance using an independent samples t- test. The independent samples t-test, with the variance of the two samples not assumed to be equal, was used rather than the paired samples t-test because the sampling for the two groups was done independently; that is to say, households were not selected as matched pairs. For exam- ining differences within the sample of HIV-affected or non-HIV-affected households-for example, whether lower income households spend more on food-the F-test is used.

While fuel prices have also been ris- ing steeply in recent years, it was not possible to examine fuel expendi- tures with these data as not enough information was collected by the studies. Transportation costs are examined where possible, but fuel costs are not separated from other transportation costs. Also, transpor- tation costs related to medical treat- ment are included with medical costs in some of the studies. While the five studies used for data analysis all contain rich data for this topic, they do not measure all fac- tors in the same way; these differ- ences are noted when known. 7 Chapter Three Background Price Increases and the Impact on Poverty The steep rise in food prices world- wide in the past three years has been called \u201cthe silent tsunami\u201d in terms of its effect on world hunger [23]. The UN World Food Program estimates that it needs an addi- tional $700 million dollars to keep up current levels of food aid [22, 51] The causes of these increases, which have affected non-food com- modities as well, are complex and interrelated, involving increased demand, decreased supply and the impact of government policies. Rapidly growing emerging econ- omies-most notably China, India and oil-rich nations in the Middle East-have created an increased demand for food in general, but also for higher protein foods such as meat and dairy products, which require greater amounts of grain to produce. The demand for biofuels has also diverted grain commodi- ties away from the food market. In China, the increase in food prices is mainly driven by increases in meat prices, particularly pork, and in veg- etable oil prices rather than grain prices. At the same time several factors have driven decreases in the sup- ply of food, including urbanization, industrialization, increased land costs, and long-term underinvest- ment in agriculture by develop- ing countries. These long-term structural changes in the supply of food mean that the market is not responsive to recent increases in demand in the short run; in other words, there is a time lag before price increases stimulate increased food production. At the same time, many countries have instituted cri- sis policies, such as restricting ex- ports of food, that increase price in- stability globally. Another factor is that increased trading on commod- ity markets, in the wake of financial failures in other sectors such as banking and insurance, has driven food prices upward [4, 18, 24, 27, 31, 33, 51, 56]. A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia 8 Will Higher Food Prices Alleviate Rural Poverty? Some have expressed the hope that food price increases would be passed along to rural produc- ers, and that the overall impact of these increases would be to reduce poverty in rural areas of developing countries. Since urban households tend to have higher incomes than rural households, and net consum- ers of food\u2014who earn enough to buy food in the cash economy\u2014 have higher incomes than net producers, it would follow that an increased flow of cash would make its way to rural households if prices go up [2, 50, 51, 56]. Others have argued that these ben- efits are not likely to materialize. One reason is that poor families consume much of their own food production, so that there is no net gain in income if prices go up. An- other is that urban constituents tend to hold more political clout, and many governments have insti- tuted such policies as export bans, trade restrictions and price con- trols to alleviate anger (and riots in some locations) over food price increases. Prices of agricultural inputs such as fuel and fertilizer have also sharply increased, as have transport costs, reducing potentially increased profits for producers. The IMF has called for countries to increase ag- ricultural production to take advan- tage of the benefits of higher com- modity prices, but it is unclear how soon such increased production could benefit rural producers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea4b659f-0d4b-4547-a0bf-8293314b5792": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea4b659f-0d4b-4547-a0bf-8293314b5792", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee1f9279f25bee68683de5a90702c2a33d748e95b78d698d5c9cabc6f3c435bb"}, "2": {"node_id": "6fb517fd-40c7-469c-ad2b-28d3b00bf177", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71a565fa13f82d7274c4aafbca16a4148f74834de71974efc480a5da7ec31a23"}}, "hash": "940424957b3be8a2bfd5ac0926cca4c31b28dd64a954ecdaff7ca0b068f47290", "text": "Finally, the poorest of the poor in rural areas are the landless; while demand and wage rates for daily labor may go up in response to higher profits, in the short run the rural poor are likely to suffer more than they benefit from higher food prices.

How Higher Food Prices may Impact Poverty Several recent studies have attempt- ed to estimate the impact of higher food prices on poverty. In China, ru- ral real incomes grew 9.5% due to price increases, in spite of input costs rising by 20%. The impact of higher prices on the urban poor however led the Chinese government to in- crease food subsidies [56]. A recent study by the World Bank uses household consumption and production data from nine coun- tries to estimate the impact of higher food prices on both food consumption and wages [33]. It concludes that the overall impact of higher food prices will be to increase poverty headcounts by 4.5%\u2014a loss of seven years of pov- erty reduction\u2014since most poor households are net consumers of food. While some rural producers may benefit, the large numbers of urban households already living close to the poverty line means that these benefits are far outweighed by increasing numbers of house- holds falling into poverty. Another World Bank study argues that the interrelationships between net food buyers and net food sell- ers are complex and that estimates of the impact of higher prices can- not be made without analyzing these [2]. A few studies have attempted to measure the impact on the pov- erty rate using national household surveys. An ADB study also found that food price increases would greatly increase the number of poor households in the Philippines and Pakistan [4]. At the same time a study using Indian household data showed that an increase in the price of rice would have a net benefit to poor households [52]. This study simulated changes in wages for ru- ral workers as well as producers. Another study using household expenditure and production data was used to estimate the impact of recent price increases on both con- sumption and income from produc- tion. The study found that increases in income from production were far outweighed by the negative impact of increased prices on con- sumption; the result was that an additional 2.8% of the population would fall under the poverty line after the 2006-2007 price increases and an additional 8.5% based on 2006-2008 price increases [62]. To summarize, recent analysis of how higher food prices will affect 9 poverty have come to varied con- clusions. The debate on the conse- quences of higher prices and how to best design policies to address these issues is complicated by re- cent economic changes globally, which need to be taken into ac- count in any future research and analysis. Poverty, Food Security and HIV Several have suggested that \u201ccop- ing strategies\u201d is an incorrect way to describe how HIV-affected house- holds manage to pay their extra expenses, and that \u201csurvival strate- gies\u201d would be more accurate [42, 54]. When such households already live at the margins, increased medi- cal expenses must either come from income that would be spent on other necessities, from savings, from liquidating assets or by going into debt. In Africa, the link between food se- curity risks and HIV infection is well established; as will be outlined in more detail below, household-level decreases in income, declines in food production and increased de- pendency are the causes of this [63]. In a comprehensive review of previ- ous studies published in 2005, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) delineates 150 stud- ies providing evidence on the link between HIV and household size and composition, agriculture, food crises, and human capital; as well as of the impact of food and nutrition insecurity on the spread of HIV; nu- trition, HIV transmission and disease progression links; and antiretroviral therapy and nutrition [26]. In Asia and the Pacific however, few detailed studies have been con- ducted to establish this link [25, 37]. Only two of the studies referenced in the IFPRI review article are from Asia [26].

When someone is infected with HIV, deficiencies in micronutrients have been found to augment the disease\u2019s progression. HIV infection also increases the need for energy and makes food more difficult to absorb, leading to the wasting ef- fects that are commonly seen in PLHIV. While antiretroviral treat- ment improves nutritional status, the side effects of antiretroviral therapy including nausea and vom- iting require that those under treat- ment continue to supplement their food intake. A recent study demon- strated that food supplementation for those undergoing antiretroviral treatment significantly improved adherence to medication [15, 60], which is indispensable to effective HIV treatment and the prevention of developing drug resistance. Previous Studies on the HIV-affected Household Economy Overview of Study Designs By the mid-2000s, many well-de- signed studies have investigated the impact of HIV on the house- hold economy. In a review article published in 2003, Booysen and Arntz outlined the four sampling approaches that have been taken to identify HIV-affected households for these studies [13]. Two methods are commonly used to recruit PLHIV: (1) through a clin- ic- or hospital-based program that provides treatment and/or other services [14, 21] or (2) through community based organizations or NGOs who work with PLHIV. A third method is to take a general popu- lation sample and then identify households where there is a recent death or chronic illness of a house- hold member. Some of these studies identify PLHIV through testing, but others never definitely confirm the HIV status of the household mem- ber. The fourth sampling method identified is to use some combina- tion of the first three methods. Booysen and Arntz also point out that some studies only interview the individual PLHIV without includ- ing other household members who may be more knowledgeable about the household economy, since the PLHIV may not have disclosed their A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia 10 status to family members. They also outline the inherent bias involved in using these sampling methods, since certain groups are less likely to give consent to be part of a study. These underrepresented groups include more affluent individuals, those with higher educational at- tainment and older men. Other factors affecting the repre- sentativeness of study findings in- clude that many do not include a matched \u201ccontrol group\u201d of house- holds that are not HIV affected for comparison, and that the sample size for these studies is usually small. Finally, formal sampling methods such as stratified random sampling are rarely used for these studies. Most studies examining the house- hold economy as affected by HIV use a structured questionnaire to collect a cross-sectional sample, but other methods have been used as well. Cohort or longitudinal studies are less common and more difficult to conduct, but provide valuable information on how the household economy changes as the illness progresses or the person dies. One study followed a sample of HIV- and non-HIV affected households for eighteen months and exam- ined how household expenditures change with morbidity and mortal- ity [6, 7, 10, 11, 12]. Several other recent studies have identified ART clients at treatment centers and fol- lowed them to see how work status, illness patterns, household expen- ditures and income change as the treatment progresses [29, 57]. A few studies have used qualita- tive methods such as in-depth in- terviews and focus group discus- sions to examine the social and economic impact of HIV on the family and household economy [44]. Some have used existing sec- ondary data to estimate the impact on the household, without includ- ing direct data on households with a PLHIV member. An example is Martin and Logan (2005) who used Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and living standards surveys to estimate HIV-related income and expenditure effects [39]. Only a few studies have included matched samples of households affected and not affected by HIV, so that direct comparisons may be made of the household economy. One example from Thailand, which is examined in depth in the analysis section, studied HIV and non-HIV households in Phayao province [34, 35, 36, 49].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b2407ae-cfa0-498e-bf7a-1f2383d1090a": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b2407ae-cfa0-498e-bf7a-1f2383d1090a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9da952c762a867d561fb8c57a29e624ff707879bd4fe609c4b2064101a56a398"}, "2": {"node_id": "e415b683-2475-49b5-9231-8f7e6aab3b14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f710d54017983bc0dc4f14997301f271032c5cbb72a17c956e3f66b7d49e43e"}}, "hash": "4d85ad7b1eee0aa7ff5370610c0f58fda14c4be3e1f1ad5ca8cb809ae03d4bd9", "text": "The study found that the economic costs of HIV to house- holds are severe and fall hardest on the poor, who have a fewer coping strategies to fall back on.

They found that about 45% of the stud- ies were conducted in Africa, with about one-third in East Africa, and a heavy concentration in Uganda and Tanzania. Asia was represented by two studies in India, three in Thailand and one each in the Phil- ippines and Sri Lanka. While about half of the studies were set in urban areas and half in rural areas, those studies that identified respondents in a clinic or hospital in an urban setting may actually include many rural respondents. Two-thirds of the studies focused on morbidity rather than mortality. Finally, very few included quality of life scales or other psychosocial measures as part of their impact studies, as most focused on economic and health is- sues [13]. Key Findings from Household Studies Studies of the impact of HIV on the household have clustered around four key themes: the impact of the disease on the household economy and livelihoods; coping strategies that families use to deal with added medical expenses and loss of in- come; implications of the changes in the household economy for pov- erty and food security; and changes in the social structure, particularly of the family. By this point in the epidemic, a number of carefully done studies have reached similar conclusions about the implications of HIV for the household economy. House- holds affected by HIV are faced with extra medical costs that vary by country, but are nearly always much higher than those faced by 11 a non-HIV affected household. Fu- neral costs in the event of a death can also require substantial sums of money in some settings as well. Households lose income when PL- HIV members become less produc- tive with their illness and/or are forced to stop working altogether. Some also lose their jobs due to dis- crimination. Caregivers often give substantial time to caring for PLHIV and lose income through being less productive or having to give up their job as well. [1, 19, 47, 55, 59]. Naidu and Harris (2005) in a review of 32 studies published from 1995- 2005 classify costs to households as direct costs (expenditures on treat- ment and associated costs such as funerals and transportation) and indirect costs (loss of earnings of the PLHIV and caregiver(s) through reduced productivity) [42]. Indirect costs have consistently been found to be higher than direct costs, when calculated over the lifetime of the individual without illness [49]. Di- rect estimates of the impact of HIV on household income over a period of time (such as the year before the survey) are also commonly calcu- lated. Many of the studies focus on cop- ing strategies\u2014perhaps more accu- rately termed survival strategies\u2014 of HIV affected households. These strategies are examined both by asking household members what they do to cover increased medical and other costs and by collecting detailed information about expen- ditures, earned income, and other ways of obtaining funds including borrowing, selling assets, etc. The most common first response for households to cover extra costs is to use savings [21]. Many also rely on borrowing from friends and rel- atives, with borrowing from finan- cial institutions or moneylenders a less favored strategy. Selling assets including land and other means of production, is also a frequent strategy [14, 28]. Indebtedness is thus common among HIV affected households [21, 44]. Mutangadura (1999) delineates a framework for examining coping strategies for rural households by categorizing them into strategies aimed at improving food security, strategies aimed at raising or sup- plementing income, and strategies aimed as alleviating the loss of labor [41]. Some studies have gathered evidence to prioritize these strate- gies as the disease progresses, and as the household has fewer resourc- es to call on as savings are depleted and lending sources dry up. Two studies that demonstrate these survival strategies are highlighted here. Mikael (2004) uses a sustain- able livelihoods framework to out- line how HIV is a shock to the rural livelihood [40].

Hilhorst et al. (2006) also delineate these factors, providing evidence that HIV has both time costs and pro- ductivity costs for PLHIV and caregiv- ers [27]. Besides the direct loss of job and income, the ability to run the A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia 12 farm is lost through reducing farm investments and liquidating means of production. The reduction in farm productivity, most importantly, leads to the erosion of food security for the household. Bukusuba et al. (2007) outline how some urban fam- ilies who practice small-scale farm- ing improve their food security and dietary diversity [14]. The impact of HIV on poverty has also been an important focus of household-level studies. Duraisamy et al. (2006) outlined how the bur- den of HIV care costs falls dispro- portionately on poorer households; since they lack savings and assets to liquidate, medical costs tend to come out of money that would be otherwise spent on food and other basic necessities [21]. Buku- suba et al. (2007) documented how households reduce food expenses by missing meals and by reducing dietary diversity [14]. Martin and Logan (2005) using household data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and Living Standards Survey (LSS) found that while in- come quintiles 2 through 5 expe- rienced decline in income by 15- 20%, the poorest quintile declined as much as 40%. They concluded that poverty reduction in the na- tion would slow as much as 25% from the impact of HIV [39]. Bachmann and Booysen\u2019s (2003) longitudinal study traces morbid- ity and mortality with expenditures and income. While expenditures were found to be a more sensitive indicator than income, they found that real expenditures decreased over time with morbidity [6]. Sev- eral studies have documented how children are often forced to drop out of school because the fam- ily cannot afford educational ex- penses and/or because their labor is needed at home\u2014eroding the longer-term financial prospects of poor families [39, 44, 55] Rules of inheritance and mourning practic- es also increase the vulnerability of the poor in many settings [28]. Recently several longitudinal stud- ies have outlined how antiretrovi- ral treatment, besides improving the health status of PLHIV, benefits the status of the whole household. A study from the state of Tamil Nadu, India systematically followed a large cohort of PLHIV receiving ART. It included information on quality of life, psychosocial sta- tus and socioeconomic status for both PLHIV and their families. The study found that as antiretroviral therapy clients gradually returned to the workforce and their health improved, the household reduced expenditures and borrowing. Con- sumption of food increased, which results in better health for all family members [29, 57]. Many studies have examined the impact of HIV on the family and on household structure. The main impact of the disease is to raise the dependency ratio within house- holds. When children are orphaned by AIDS, it is often the grandpar- ents who step in to care for them. Even with surviving but ill family members, older people find that they need to work beyond the age when they otherwise would have [44, 55]. Single parent households are also common through death or deser- tion of the spouse. Child headed households are often created with an older child dropping out of school and working, often in in- formal low paying jobs, to raise siblings. While traditional commu- nity support systems exist, Mikael points out that these systems are usually short-term and not suited to chronic illnesses like those re- lated to HIV [28, 40, 55]. 13 Chapter Four rESultS Expenditures of HIV- affected Households We first examine findings from the China, India and Thai studies as these have a similar design.

A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia 14 6 While the Thai study was designed to examine differences between two districts with different levels of services, these differences are not examined for this draft due to time constraints. 7 Dr. Jianhua Yuan, personal communication. In Thailand (Fig. 1.3) HIV households spent a much higher percentage on medical expenses (t=31.4, p<.00), a much lower percentage on food (t=-10.3, p<.00) and lower percent- ages on transportation and other expenses (t=-5.4, p<.00).6 It should be remembered that health programs that serve PLHIV differ greatly in these countries and have also changed over time. At the time of the surveys, PLHIV in China receive antiretroviral treatment free of charge and some PLHIV in the In- dia study states do as well [53]. The China survey found that many of the respondents are currently re- ceiving antiretroviral treatment. 7 This reduces medical expenditures relative to those in other countries, but may increase travel costs. It could also lead to higher food ex- penditures as good nutrition is vi- tal to maintaining health for PLHIV under treatment and as mentioned above food helps to alleviate anti- retroviral drug side effects. This may explain the fact that HIV households spend about the same percentage on food as non-HIV households in China, even though they have high- er medical expenses. The Thai data was collected in 1999, before ART was available and at a time where there were fewer pro- grams available for PLHIV. Though health care services are relatively low-cost in Thailand, the cost of drugs can be quite high, as reflected in the high medical costs for HIV af- fected households in Thailand [34]. Figure 1.2 Percent of household expenditures by type of expenditure, HIV and non-HIV households, China Figure 1.3 Percent of monthly household expenditures by type of expenditure, HIV and non-HIV households, thailand Figure 2.1 Percent of monthly household expenditures on food by income quintile, HIV and non-HIV households, India Figure 1.1 Percent of monthly household expenditures by type of expenditure, HIV and non-HIV households, India 15 Figures 2.1-2.3 show how the per- centage spent on food differs for HIV-affected and non-affected households by income quintiles. In India the pattern is clear (Fig. 2.1): poorer HIV-affected households spend a lower percentage on food than their non-HIV counter-parts (F=87.1, p<.00), while wealthier households spend about the same percentage whether they are HIV- affected or not (F=0.5, p=.49). This implies that poorer households are diverting money that they would otherwise spend on food to use for medical expenses. In China (Fig 2.2) the pattern is a bit different as middle income and wealthier households that are HIV- affected spend a higher percentage on food than those who are not af- fected. This is likely because these households are attempting to en- sure better nourishment for PLHIV in the household, many of whom are receiving antiretroviral treat- ment. In Thailand (Fig. 2.3), there is a more dramatic difference in the percent- age spent on food between the HIV and non-HIV households, likely due to the high percentage spent on medical care seen above. The already low percentage of expendi- ture does not decline much by in- come quintile for HIV households in Thailand (F=4.3, p<.00), though the typical pattern is seen for non-HIV households (F=4.6, p<.00).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39222d7a-854d-460c-b652-ef8074ce1454": {"__data__": {"id_": "39222d7a-854d-460c-b652-ef8074ce1454", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52693f0ae9fd6501f7209388f745cb2e8810bfbdd5ef964f83b28de1b333ff68"}, "2": {"node_id": "946ee86f-b8c7-44a2-b713-40996de2e043", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87341a36ff0f05658af4bdc5e72955ed0f5d463b501adc93ddd56c70e3a747e9"}}, "hash": "607f9df44a01e3d197484f1d40cf2d0fd9ea5576155dcd3df4e1d0de580e3cb0", "text": "Figure 3.1 shows total monthly per capita expenditure in rupees for HIV and non-HIV households in In- dia.

In China (Figure 3.2) HIV-affected households spend more over- all than non-HIV households; al- though they spend about the same on food, they have higher medical and other expenses. As seen above the Thai households spent less on food per capita (Fig- ure 3.3) (t=-1.96, p=.05) but much more on medical expenses (t=14.2, p<.00), so that their overall per cap- ita expenses are higher. Figures 4a.1 and 4b.1 show monthly per capita expenditures by income quintile for rural and urban areas in India for the HIV-affected house- holds. The amount spent on medi- cal expenses goes up with income (rural F=6.7, urban F=16.0, p<.00) as do food expenditures (rural F=221.2, urban F=260.6, p<.00). \u201cOther\u201d expenses show the sharp- est increase at higher wealth lev- els, especially for urban house- holds (rural F=72.0, urban F=125.9, p<.00). Rural and urban households do not differ much in expenditure patterns by quintile except in the highest income quintile, where ur- ban households have much higher expenditures. As seen in Figure 4.2, the expendi- ture patterns by income are some- what different in China. Food ex- penditures increase steadily with income, while medical expenditures are fairly constant\u2014except for the middle income group, which has the lowest medical expenses. Since the rural medical insurance scheme in China is the same for all income groups, it is difficult to explain this finding.8 \u201cOther\u201d expenses also do not have a consistent pattern by income in the China sample, though the over- all trend is increasing by income. Interestingly, a similar pattern is seen in Thailand (Figure 4.3) with the middle income group having the lowest expenditures. In general, food expenditures increase with in- come (F=3.1, p=.01) as do medical expenditures (F=7.6, p<.00). Finally, Figures 5.1 and 5.2 shows differences in the type of foods purchased by income level for HIV- affected households in India and China. The patterns are very similar in the two countries. Expenditures on grains do not vary much by in- come. Households with higher in- comes spend more money on pro- tein-rich foods like meat, eggs and dairy products (F=189.6, p<.00) and nutrient-rich foods like vegetables and fruits (F=215.9, p<.00). This implies that rises in food prices will impact the quality as well as the quantity of diets for HIV-affected households.9 The Chinese study also reveals the impact of HIV on HIV-affected farm Figure 3.3 Per capita monthly household expenditures by type of expenditure, HIV and non-HIV households, thailand 8 Dr. Jianhua Yuan, personal communication. 9 Breakdowns in food expenditures by type of food were not included in the Thai study.

While both types of households use these strategies, HIV households had higher amounts in each cat- egory (all t-statistics p<.05).

In rural areas, HIV and non-HIV households have similar per capita income levels; but HIV households add on average another 58% of their income amount through bor- rowing, dissavings and liquidating assets. Non-HIV households add only about 8% of earned income, though it should be remembered that these households were not asked about liquidating assets. In urban areas, HIV households had higher income levels and added another 33% of per capita income through borrowing, dissavings and liquidating assets.12 Analysis of Program Impact in Cambodia As mentioned above, the Cambodia study was designed to measure the impact of integrating food support to households with a PLHIV or OVC with an existing Home-Based Care program. A sample of PLHIV and OVC households who had received the food support for three years (the intervention sample) was matched with a sample of households who had been identified for inclusion in the program but had not yet re- ceived support (the control sample). This section presents findings on household expenditures for these samples, allowing an examination of the impact of the food support program on the household econ- omy. All of the samples are HIV- affected however, so that no com- parison is possible with non-HIV affected households from the same communities. 10 Information on coping strategies was included in the Thai study but not provided for this draft. 11 Non-HIV-affected households were not asked about liquidating assets. 12 Information on borrowing, saving, and liquidating assets was included in the Thai and China studies but not available for this draft. table 1.2 Coping mechanisms for additional expenditures and loss of income, China Percent (%) Borrow from friends and relatives 60.7 Use past savings 25.5 Medical insurance 14.5 Liquidation of assets/durable goods/ livestock 10.9 Wife had to take up job in order to support the family 9.1 Borrow from moneylender and other financial institutions 9.0 Had to take up additional job 8.5 Children had to take up job 8.0 NGO support 4.6 Usury 2.0 (N = 1027) Multiple responses possible 19 Figure 4.3 Per capita monthly household expenditures by type of expenditure by income quintile, HIV households, thailand Figure 5.1 Per capita monthly household expenditures on food by type of food and income quintile, HIV households, India Figure 1.4 shows the percentage of monthly household expenditures for the four samples.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c769fa60-4238-4b69-b015-60ff156bb52b": {"__data__": {"id_": "c769fa60-4238-4b69-b015-60ff156bb52b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2aa5fb07d5f59774ad8d2348fc2a8be796590ea82b6113cb0484bbdb3455ce19"}, "2": {"node_id": "1fcb3226-ad77-4063-a67a-f152bac135f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "91a1762cc4dff4a4e1f35c18a1e60e46707352265c57dafadf831c978c350aaa"}}, "hash": "1564d9e6a5f5d7b25b9eeb1e5245cf1740ff75a7f55ed3501f8edcaa4ac5af20", "text": "For Cambo- dia, educational expenses and school fees are a large component of household expenditures and so this is kept as a separate category.13 Looking at the OVC households first, the impact of the food sup- port program is clearly seen as the intervention households spend a much lower percentage of expen- ditures on food (t=6.0, p<.00).

In Figures 2a.4 and 2b.4 the per- centage spent on food by expendi- ture quintiles is shown for the OVC and PLHIV households respective- ly.14 It is interesting that even for households receiving food support, poorer households spend a much higher percentage on food (F=46.8, p<.00). The sharpest difference between the control and interven- tion samples comes at the highest income levels for the OVC house- holds (t=3.1, p=.00). For the PLHIV households, however, intervention households in the highest expendi- ture group had slightly higher food expenditures than those in the con- trol group. When looking at total per capita ex- penditures rather than percentages (Figure 3.4), it is seen that the OVC households in the intervention area have much higher expenditures on education (t=-2.7, p=.00), and much higher total expenditures, than those in the control area (t=-2.1, p=.03). For the PLHIV households, only medical expenditures are sig- nificantly different between the in- tervention and control households (t=2.3, p=.03). Figure 5.4 examines the type of food expenditures made by PLHIV households.15 Intervention house- holds spend less on grains, as rice is provided to the households as part of the food support program (t=2.2, p=.03). They also spend more money on protein-rich foods, indicating that the food support program has en- hanced both the quality and quan- tity of food for these households; however, the difference is not statis- tically significant (t=-1.1, p<.28). 13 \u201cCelebrations/social events\u201d was also a large category of expenditure, especially for wealthier households; this category was omitted from the analysis of household expenditures as it was so large as to make it difficult to examine differences in food consumption. Agricultural inputs were also excluded as they are generally not included in household consumption studies. 14 Expenditure rather than income quintiles are used because the survey did not collect information on income. A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia 20 The Cambodia study did not ask directly about coping strategies as the other surveys did, but did ask about loans and assets sold in the past year. Table 3.4 shows that the percentage who said they took a loan is relatively small, and does not differ for the control and interven- tion areas. When asked the purpose of the loan only a small percentage said that they took the loan due to illness or to cover daily expenses. 16 HIV and Poverty in Vietnam In 2005 the UNDP commissioned a case study on the household impact of HIV/AIDS in Vietnam.17 Individuals were contacted through health ser- vices in four cities; of the 129 individ- uals studied, 45 had already died of an AIDS-related illness and 84 were PLHIV. A few individuals were from the same household so that a total of 125 households were studied. By analyzing health care expenses the study estimated that an HIV-af- fected household in Vietnam has 13 times the expenditures as those for an average household. More than half the individuals studied had given up their job or had reduced income since being infected. About 25% of the caregivers for the PLHIV had to give up a job as well. Coping strategies for the house- holds in the Vietnam study were very similar to those reported in the other studies (Table 4.5). Notably however, cutting down on food con- sumption, which was not mentioned in the other studies, was one of the top strategies cited in Vietnam.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c01220b8-438e-4a66-b585-ccb4e135e3d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c01220b8-438e-4a66-b585-ccb4e135e3d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92f71a1f40c044647ca4a7f9f5b38b0b92f9ebae4637b0f6d9110561c8331188"}, "2": {"node_id": "597ce267-8903-4b8e-87f9-59d491f2e6ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e922e5f2cf76305cf3981beb6e92d48f585cdb543eb86a4735f13d58bd4dd1ab"}}, "hash": "625281830bdc20905fe12826df2e18059a1201c18e5896369aecddb58420cf41", "text": "When asked the major sources of table 3.4 Percent of OVC and PLHIV taking loans in the past year by type of loan, number of loans and number of loans by type, Cambodia OVC PLHIV Control Intervention Control Intervention Percent who took at least one loan 15.6 14.8 18.2 19.1 Percent who took a loan due to illness 3.9 2.7 7.9 5.1 Percent who took a loan due to need for daily expenses 5.9 5.3 5.0 5.2 table 4.5 Strategies adopted by households coping with loss of income, Vietnam Coping strategies Percent (%) Borrowing money from friends and relatives 36.0 Cutting down on food consumption 28.8 Borrowing money from moneylenders (with interest) 27.2 Decreasing health expenditure of other household members 25.6 Selling assets, including production means 20.8 Elderly going out to earn income 17.6 Selling land/house 5.6 Taking children out of school 3.2 Sending children out for income-generating job 2.4 Sending children away", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9d20eeb-d48f-4f1b-8d22-69095ad7c0d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9d20eeb-d48f-4f1b-8d22-69095ad7c0d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b81851690e96686c0f899059d301e50aee5fed3a4c5bc87eecab3bbd9809776"}, "3": {"node_id": "011c00fa-6a3b-4076-9554-bbec943d594d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/preliminary-study-impact-hiv-poverty-and-food-security-among-hiv-affected-households-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18118500e1eab63261988fa4c77fb013a13c722d03b9d9c4d2382f20b937fa22"}}, "hash": "e25892599301fbaf24d668b138faa98249b40064b0a0bcd5b78fb933d3b7d9bd", "text": "for foster care 1.6 Receiving a loan from credit programs 1.6 Source: Household Impact Case Study 21 15 There was a problem with the food data for the OVC households so this graph could not be created for this topic. 16 No poverty analysis was done for Cambodia due to the difficulty of estimating the value of the food provided by the food support program. 17 Primary data from the study were not available so the findings reported here are drawn from the study report [58].

Only the poorest households reported that they sold assets to pay for healthcare costs. The use of savings increases with household income while the use of borrowing decreases. The study also analyzed household consumption expenditures to esti- mate the impact of HIV on poverty, and to project the impact of pov- erty to 2015. Regression modeling was used to estimate this impact. It found that HIV-affected households reduced consumption expenditures that they would otherwise make by between 37% (for the poor- est households) and 42% (for the wealthiest households). With regard to poverty, they found that all house- holds below the wealthiest quintile (in other words, 80% of households) would fall below the poverty line as a result of the income and expendi- ture effects of HIV. In the aggregate, they found that 126,000 additional persons fell below the poverty line in 2004 due to HIV and that an ad- ditional 404,000 would fall into pov- erty by 2015.

Among the most obvious of these is the lack of good quality longitu- dinal data on the impact of HIV on households. While several studies have attempted to simulate the im- pact on poverty of increased food prices, and some have estimated the impact on poverty of HIV, no study has followed households over time to see how they react to changing economic conditions. This need is urgent as we have already entered uncertain economic times, and pol- icy makers are still debating how to respond to global food needs and other aspects of the economic cri- ses. Given the complexity of eco- nomic forces at the present time, it is particularly important to observe household responses directly rath- er than to attempt to simulate the various factors at play. At the same time, Asian govern- ments have responded in a vari- ety of ways to meet the needs of PLHIV and their households.

It is particularly urgent to link information about nutri- tion and food assistance programs A Preliminary Study of the Impact of HIV on Poverty and Food Security Among HIV-affected Households in Asia 24 with antiretroviral treatment as the knowledge base in this area is not well established. Although it was not addressed in this paper, the issue of the house- hold economy, food security and risk behavior has also not been ex- amined in Asia. If possible, migra- tion and mobility in and out of the household should be part of this fo- cus. The topic should be linked with changes in household structure and family relationships that occur with food insecurity and the loss of family members from HIV. It should be noted that several of the data- sets examined in this paper include rich information on this topic that has not yet been explored\u2014for ex- ample, on differences in household structure between HIV- and non- HIV households, on remittances in and out of the household, and on mobility of household members. As part of this research, attention should be paid to include the long- term impacts of HIV as part of study designs. Most of the studies to-date have been cross-sectional, mean- ing that they provide a snapshot in time of households with a PLHIV member at different stages of the disease. By analyzing how house- holds react to different stages of illness and death and often volatile economic circumstances, programs can be better designed to deal with varying needs. Kongsin [34, 35, 36] has already done important work in this area. An important topic that has not been sufficiently investigated in Asia is that of how agricultural and other livelihood systems interact with the HIV household, particu- larly with regard to food produc- tion. Studies that have been con- ducted in African settings such as Bukusuba et al. (2007), Hilhorst et al. (2006) and Mikael (2004) provide models for this [14, 28, 40]. Several of the studies cited here have made valuable suggestions that should be noted. Naidu and Harris (2005) call for multidisci- plinary studies on these topics, as many previous studies have tended to be narrowly focused on only one aspect of the issues [42]. Booysen and Arntz (2003) advocate for more systematic study designs, includ- ing more detailed reporting on methods, that can be used to make broader and more generalized con- clusions and recommendations. Mixed methods would also greatly contribute to a richer understand- ing of the issues [13]. Finally Mu- tangadura et al. (1999) advocate in- cluding community level factors in studies of the household economy as many households rely on a wider circle of support [41]. Conclusions This paper has attempted to review the literature on the economy of the HIV-affected household and to explore the potential impact of in- creased food prices using existing studies. Part of the purpose of this exercise was to investigate gaps in the research for Asia, particularly with the rapidly shifting economic forces that are currently affecting the world today. Secondary analysis of five stud- ies has revealed that HIV-affected households face substantial medi- cal expenses, which they often fulfill using money that would oth- erwise be used for food. We have also seen that the quality as well as the quantity of food is affected in these households, as less money is available for sources of protein and nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables. This is a particularly worrisome sit- uation given the need for PLHIV to receive adequate nutrition particu- larly those receiving antiretroviral treatment. The findings of the Cambodia study reveal that food supplemen- tation programs may be an impor- tant contribution to HIV-affected households. The recently conduct- ed studies in India and China also show evidence that the food situ- ation is less severe for households with free antiretroviral drugs avail- able, in comparison to the high medical expenditures reported by Thai households in the 1999 study. While it is beyond the scope of this paper to comprehensively analyze the impact of food programs for HIV-affected households in Asia and the Pacific, it is worth noting that many organizations have initi- ated interventions in this area.

Caitlin Wiesen-Antin Regional HIV/AIDS Practice Leader & Programme Coordinator, Asia & Pacific UNDP Regional Centre Colombo, Sri Lanka ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk The lack of evidence has been one of the critical missing links to discuss, explore and act upon the nexus between HIV and human trafficking. Heightened HIV risk of girls and women trafficked for sexual exploitation is often intuitively perceived. However, the paucity of systematic research and evidence on the linkage has deterred informed discussions on the subject. It may have also contributed to the absence of coordination and sometimes even the development of dissociation among stakeholders working on HIV prevention, human trafficking and the empowerment of sex workers, both at policy and programmatic levels. In an effort to strengthen Asia\u2019s knowledge base on the subject for initiating dialogue and collective action, UNDP Regional HIV and Development Programme for Asia and the Pacific commissioned this Southeast Asian multi-country research. It is built upon a series of South Asian studies on HIV vulnerability of sex trafficked girls and women conducted by Dr. Jay Silverman and Dr.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75da9677-2c96-4a80-bf9f-55c853fbab72": {"__data__": {"id_": "75da9677-2c96-4a80-bf9f-55c853fbab72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Regional Assessment of Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcb5779f6bba68973dadcbb84eaf2b1422d63b6fde4724d9d0a226d671ed1abd"}, "2": {"node_id": "66f89c73-9f7e-479f-bc84-7c8bb04edf66", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5054b889a4604fbb9b7be829957b8801a31b8e092b36d268e223069d60ad561f"}}, "hash": "cd02d73e027ccc879d64c428f27991916879bfdab4bef2c7f6bf1ed70848b02d", "text": "Jay Silverman and Dr. Michele Decker of Harvard University, who are also the leading authors of this Southeast Asian multi-country research.

Moreover, sex trafficking is thought to pose a number of unique and qualitatively different forms of STI/HIV risk,2 while at the same time posing significant barriers in accesssing HIV reduction education and related programming.3 However, little empirical data exist to describe 1) women and girls\u2019 experiences of sex trafficking, 2) sexual risk encountered in this context or, importantly, 3) STI/HIV outcomes among women and girls trafficked into sex work.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65e841a3-5509-43b3-887e-7cd96b789723": {"__data__": {"id_": "65e841a3-5509-43b3-887e-7cd96b789723", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Regional Assessment of Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc75ed8c1da749f29d1d56c1ae10d77b487d32f1534e324b36569b69c67a68c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "437d1e00-c1e7-4487-a022-4e69c56b3f08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c8b90e7a6bbb5ddb536cef0454c8cb2f59336b9d0d0c72751433c85d8cef245"}}, "hash": "99f123976aa4afe3b739443f24e832822b459eecf26a382bc7098fe159e9fa98", "text": "The need is particularly great regarding data that allow comparison of trafficked to non- trafficked women in sex work for more direct estimation of the effects of trafficking on STI/HIV risk and outcomes.

[NOTE: It is important to recognize that whether trafficking victims should include those under 18 regardless of quality of entry, and whether movement of persons is required for trafficking are both the subject of continuing international debate. However, as no official revision of this definition has taken place to date, we have conformed to the 2000 definition for purposes of this report, with a test of this potential revision included in one country-specific report.] Sex trafficking is a serious public health and human rights concern in Southeast Asia, with an estimated 200,000-250,000 women and children trafficked within the region each year.4 Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand provide important contexts for this problem, serving as source, transit and destination countries for sex trafficked women and girls, many of whom are under the age of 18.4-8 But each country is also distinct with regard to their roles within the region; within Cambodia, trafficking activity is typically confined within the national borders,9 with women and girls from rural areas trafficked to urban", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0a94137-0712-4f91-b5d0-ff0393f5dca0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0a94137-0712-4f91-b5d0-ff0393f5dca0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Regional Assessment of Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89c7c192b0131d7c61fb5eb75fd96d62623531ac456d6da80b3c1f8f43b7b060"}, "3": {"node_id": "be18297d-2da7-47e5-8f7e-ff3a6c075ddd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6436029a9f77300d07adb9344292ccd37b63a6b60836e0f8c7dc4cc9e9acdb64"}}, "hash": "8939b3b00b98c055d15e5b0d909740c9fae76b8b7d2a55e77c23ef3df3c1675a", "text": "destinations such as Phnom Penh. Indonesia is characterized by both domestic and international human trafficking,10 with destinations including Malaysia and other Southeast Asian, East Asian and Middle Eastern destinations.8, 10 Thailand is considered a leading destination country for trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation within the Southeast Asia region.11 Bangkok and, secondarily, Chiang Mai, are considered the main hubs of sex trafficking, drawing internally from communities in northern and rural Thailand as well as other major source countries including Myanmar, Yunnan province of China, Cambodia, and Laos.4 Given the prevalence of sex trafficking across Southeast Asia and the high degree of both domestic and international implications for the health and human rights of victims of this crime, particularly as it relates to the HIV epidemic, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health collaborated with the United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre in Colombo to launch a multi- country investigation of sex trafficking and STI/HIV within Southeast Asia. Sources of data on women and girls trafficked for sexual exploitation were identified and studied in each of three countries: Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk 2 Study Methods 1.2 In each case, most representative data of highest quality were sought. Data on the issue of trafficking among women and girls involved in sex work and their STI/HIV risk is scarce for the following reasons: As the topic has been recognized only relatively recently, it is criminal in nature; it involves an extremely vulnerable and \u2018hidden\u2019 population; it has been historically excluded from programs, surveillance or research regarding HIV and sexual risk among sex workers; and it has not been included in ongoing state-sponsored surveillance. After an extensive search, three national samples were identified involving the efforts of academic, country-level NGO and global NGO partners. Samples from Cambodia and Indonesia were comprised of sex trafficking survivors served via post-trafficking NGO services across these countries. In contrast, the data utilized in the report on Thailand is a national survey of female sex workers, some of whom reported having been trafficked. In this case, comparisons between trafficked female sex workers (FSWs) and non-trafficked FSWs were completed to determine whether experiences were qualitatively different based on trafficking status, allowing comparisons between experiences of sex work based on trafficking. All analyses attempted to characterize the experiences of trafficking survivors, related not only directly to STI/HIV, but also to the context for such risk and infection, i.e., workplace violence and maltreatment, deprivation of basic human rights such as denial of food and water, health care access and freedom of movement. Summary findings specific to each country study are listed below: 1.3 Key Findings 1.3.1 Cambodia l The majority (52.2%) of female sex trafficking survivors identified via this national network of rehabilitation NGOs were under the age of 17 at the time of trafficking l 3 out of 4 (74.1%) survivors were trafficked internally within Cambodia l Sexual violence was prevalent, with 1 in 4 (25.0%) reporting forced sex acts in the context of trafficking and sex work l A similar majority (73.4%) of survivors tested positive for sexually transmitted infection l Contrary to previous findings in this area, duration of exploitation was related to STI along a \u201cU\u201d shaped curve; l 90% of survivors exploited for 2 months or less were STI infected, suggesting tremendous risk for acquisition in the initial phases of sexual exploitation l Among victims that were exploited for longer than 2 months, the risk of STI infection decreased and then increased over time, with 100% of those exploited for over one year infected. l No cases of HIV infection were detected among this sample of trafficking survivors; given the high levels of STI detected (i.e., evidence of substantial levels of sexual risk and consequent exposure to infection), this finding suggests that either: l a) very little HIV infection is currently circulating among the men with whom these women and girls were made to have sex, l b) diagnostic detection of HIV among the NGOs participating in this surveillance system is inadequate, or Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk 3 l c) reporting of cases of HIV detected at the NGO-level to the surveillance system is inadequate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be18297d-2da7-47e5-8f7e-ff3a6c075ddd": {"__data__": {"id_": "be18297d-2da7-47e5-8f7e-ff3a6c075ddd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Regional Assessment of Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89c7c192b0131d7c61fb5eb75fd96d62623531ac456d6da80b3c1f8f43b7b060"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0a94137-0712-4f91-b5d0-ff0393f5dca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8939b3b00b98c055d15e5b0d909740c9fae76b8b7d2a55e77c23ef3df3c1675a"}}, "hash": "6436029a9f77300d07adb9344292ccd37b63a6b60836e0f8c7dc4cc9e9acdb64", "text": "1.3.2 Indonesia l The prevalence of HIV among trafficking survivors was 5.7%, rising to 19.4% among those trafficked for sexual exploitation one year or more. l 1 in 7 (14%) trafficking survivors tested for at least one of 4 sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, were infected. l The prevalence of HIV", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f240251-9615-4ece-95fe-c5d23e0cb908": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f240251-9615-4ece-95fe-c5d23e0cb908", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Regional Assessment of Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00a184f70f466e5f39a9f41697203b85939c7d5716bf4575a4b01a29167fef89"}, "3": {"node_id": "515aa97c-0d99-4c99-ab38-d84a8558ed25", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "591a7eb442849ddaaaa81df969228d248d46ebbadc98f29e5d93f5f151d55f7c"}}, "hash": "36e87b91b904c1248d961048efb78fea2646f93ee5a1e9b2d0c8c8de06dfceb9", "text": "among those trafficked within Indonesia was found to be 5.4%. l Slightly less than half (46.5%) of sex trafficking survivors were exploited under the age of 18 years; notably a substantial number experienced trafficking for sexual exploitation at very young ages, with approximately one-quarter (24.5%) of survivors trafficked under 15 years of age. l Most women and girls were trafficked within Indonesia (61.4%), with Malaysia being the destination for the majority of those trafficked across national borders (32.7%). l Conditions and treatment were oppressive; most (76.6%) survivors were denied all movement, and many were forced to use drugs or alcohol (24.8% and 36.4%, respectively). l Exposure to multiple forms of abuse was common; psychological abuse was reported by nearly 80% of women; 44% experienced physical abuse, and 75% of trafficked women and girls experienced sexual violence. l Several factors were significantly related to STI/HIV or HIV among sex trafficking survivors: l Duration in forced sex work of greater than one year l Being forced to drink alcohol or use drugs in the context of sex work l Greater average number of male clients per day l Imprisonment within sex work settings l Factors including violence victimization, and other experiences of maltreatment in sex work also appear to be meaningfully related to STI/HIV risk among sex trafficking victims. 1.3.3 Thailand l Approximately one in ten (10.4%) FSWs in the sample indicated they met the criteria for sex trafficking used in this report (i.e., began sex work under the age of 18 years, or entered via mechanisms of force, fraud, or deception). l Sex trafficked FSWs were younger in age as compared with non-trafficked FSWs and were also found to have been involved in sex work for longer periods of time as compared with non-trafficked FSWs. l Trafficked FSWs reported significantly greater numbers of male clients, reporting an average of 33.4 vaginal sex episodes with clients in the past month as compared with only 24.6 such acts among those non-trafficked (p=0.03). l Anal sex, which represents a relatively high level of HIV risk, was three times as common among sex trafficked FSWs (8.2% vs. 2.6%; p<0.01). Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk 4 l Trafficked FSWs faced greater difficulties regarding condom use; 22.4% of trafficked women reporting recent condom failure compared to 12.4% of non-trafficked FSWs. l Recent condom non-use was far more prevalent among trafficked FSWs compared to non- trafficked FSWs (8.2% vs. 3.1%; p=0.02). l Women who reported having been trafficked were far less knowledgeable regarding HIV transmission. l Trafficked women were three times as likely to experience violence at initiation to sex work as compared to non-trafficked women and girls, as well as being more likely to report recent violence or mistreatment in the context of sex work. Conclusions 1.4 In sum, the findings of this multi-country regional study for Southeast Asia provide consistent evidence that trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation places such individuals at high risk for HIV/ STI infection. Trafficking victims appear to suffer qualitatively and quantitatively different and greater levels of sexual risk and STI/HIV infection, and are less likely to be reached by HIV prevention programs. Critically, consistent across the studies in this regional analysis is the use of physical and sexual violence and other forms of maltreatment against trafficked women and girls in the context of sex work. Thus, a key message of this regional study is the denial of the most basic elements of human dignity, health and wellbeing associated with the trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation. Beyond the human rights costs of such maltreatment, this abuse appears to play a central role in placing women and girls at extremely high risk for STI/HIV. Hence, in addition to the primary prevention of trafficking, consideration of trafficking within HIV harm reduction and other prevention efforts among female sex workers should be prioritized. Such integration of trafficking and HIV may be challenging given the differing perspectives and priorities of partners involved in the prevention of HIV and of trafficking.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "515aa97c-0d99-4c99-ab38-d84a8558ed25": {"__data__": {"id_": "515aa97c-0d99-4c99-ab38-d84a8558ed25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Regional Assessment of Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00a184f70f466e5f39a9f41697203b85939c7d5716bf4575a4b01a29167fef89"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f240251-9615-4ece-95fe-c5d23e0cb908", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36e87b91b904c1248d961048efb78fea2646f93ee5a1e9b2d0c8c8de06dfceb9"}}, "hash": "591a7eb442849ddaaaa81df969228d248d46ebbadc98f29e5d93f5f151d55f7c", "text": "Existing HIV harm reduction approaches are challenged by their structure and incentives that are in opposition to identifying and assisting trafficked individuals, combined with the often violent disempowerment of individuals inherent to trafficking.

Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk 5 2.1 Sex Trafficking Human trafficking is a major and widespread human rights concern, with conservative estimates of victims in the hundreds of thousands annually, the greatest concentration of such victimization occurring within South and Southeast Asia.12 The majority of trafficking victims are thought to be women and girls,10 with large numbers trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation (e.g. sex trafficking). According to the United Nations, human trafficking is the forced, coerced, fraudulent or deceitful entry in to sex work or other labor, including entry by abduction or entry into such work under age 18.1 As noted previously, this definition is the subject of much debate, with many more recently arguing for the narrowing of this definition to exclude minors who report entering voluntarily, as well as those individuals who are not transported in the course of their exploitation. No official revision of the 2000 definition has taken place to date. Young women who are trafficked are often lured with false promises of economic opportunities, travel, or marriage, unwittingly placing themselves under the control of traffickers who subsequently exploit and sell them - in the case of sex trafficking, into sexual bondage. Abduction via use of drugs and force is also common in this context.2 The current and recent studies of this issue indicate that between 10 and 33% of current female sex workers (FSWs) have been trafficked into sex work.13, 14 Studies conducted among women served by post-trafficking victim services have also found an overwhelming prevalence of both physical and sexual violence during trafficking,15 further indicating the involuntary and violent nature of trafficking experiences. Southeast Asia is a leading source, transit and destination region for trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation.10 Within the region, Cambodia has been identified as both a high-risk source and destination country.16 The overwhelming majority of sex trafficking incidents in Cambodia occur internally, drawing on women and girls from rural areas of the country as well as Vietnam.9, 11 Indonesia similarly experiences internal trafficking from rural to urban areas.8, 10 However, most often the country is a source10 for destinations such as Malaysia, Japan, Saudi Arabia, among other locations primarily in Southeast and East Asia and the Middle East.17 Thailand is considered a leading destination country for trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation within the region,11 often drawing internally from communities in northern and rural Thailand as well as other major source countries including Myanmar, Yunnan province of China, Cambodia, and Laos.4 2.2 STI/HIV in Southeast Asia The HIV/AIDS epidemics in Southeast Asia are widespread, but differ in prevalence and impact across nations.

While sex work is widely acknowledged as a primary context for STI/HIV risk,19 sex trafficking is thought to pose a number of unique and qualitatively different forms of STI/HIV risk. Sex trafficking may be a particularly salient STI/HIV risk context given immature reproductive tracts of younger women, which can facilitate STI/HIV acquisition;24 limited power among trafficked victims to refuse unprotected sex or negotiate condom use;3, 25 restrictions on mobility and limited access to preventive health services including STI/HIV prevention messages and treatment;15, 25, 26 limited knowledge of STI/HIV transmission and prevention, particularly among those trafficked at young ages;25 and extensive physical and sexual violence victimization13, 15 which may serve to both facilitate HIV transmission as well as compromise sexual negotiation and condom use. Beyond the STI/HIV-related consequences for individual sex trafficking victims, trafficking likely facilitates the continued spread of the HIV epidemic from high prevalence to low prevalence settings. Specifically, sex trafficking may be a critical factor in the spread of the HIV epidemic as young girls are trafficked from lower incidence areas to epicenters of the epidemic, consequently infected with HIV, and then return to lower incidence regions-of-origin.2, 27 Also, these most vulnerable women and girls are less likely to be represented in sentinel surveillance efforts or, as presently demonstrated, in HIV prevention programs, or among those sex workers seeking medical care. Thus, the epidemic may be maintained among trafficking victims, although it may not be visible to authorities, even after substantial reductions are achieved among other populations. Hence, clarification of the extent of trafficking, STI and HIV among trafficking victims, and how experiences of such individuals relate to STI/HIV risk is critical in order for the public health and human rights communities to progress in prevention of both HIV and trafficking for sexual exploitation across Southeast Asia. Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk 7 3.1 Study Methods Data were collected through the NGO Joint Statistics Project on CSE Trafficking 2005-2006 with funding support from the ANESVAD Foundation, led by ECPAT-Cambodia in collaboration with a national network of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Cambodia. The Project collected information from 25 NGOs representing 63 shelters, referral agencies and legal aid NGOs in 17 Provinces. The collaboration of these NGOs represent the myriad of services available to victims of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, including but not limited to temporary housing, health care (e.g. STI and HIV testing), counseling services, and legal aid. Many of these NGOs additionally provide support for victims of other forms of violence and exploitation (e.g., domestic violence and sexual assault), rendering them comprehensive in serving victims from a variety of forms of gender-based violence. Reflective of this design, comparisons with other forms of trafficking (e.g., trafficking for labor exploitation) were not possible. In conjunction with participating NGOs, ECPAT-Cambodia developed a 66-item tool used to collect information on client records of trafficked women and girls receiving services at these organizations. Demographic characteristics, characteristics of the trafficking experience (e.g., destination, violence and disempowerment), health outcomes including STI and HIV, as well as aspects of service provision and criminal prosecution were collected. The data collection tool was also used to eliminate double-counting in the database. Given the large number of shelters operating independently, the significant number of referrals made between NGOs, the possibility that a woman/girl could be trafficked and rescued more than once, and the general mobility of the population, identification of duplicate records was critical. ECPAT-Cambodia conducted training to familiarize staff at each participating NGO with the data collection tool. Staff then reviewed the case and medical records kept at their NGO, and used the data collection tool to complete a standardized description of each trafficking case seen by their NGO during the relevant time period.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f848b40b-7f4d-472a-ba67-8fa1533ed462": {"__data__": {"id_": "f848b40b-7f4d-472a-ba67-8fa1533ed462", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Regional Assessment of Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99ce436cdaefb8bfae79b359570ca31855a39d6c8ae6a6353a9efbd9f2e598fe"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d0ed7fe-f9f6-4db7-a529-eb24ca629e51", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d813383aa8514189a234dc56a0b6b139039f27940e4e9c6237e0b7e8e86f4b2"}}, "hash": "67982422bee4d5456fc0e35cc6fe1e8249c553752e76d5c97ce6e8e24b41dd98", "text": "The ECPAT-Cambodia data management team provided ongoing technical assistance during this process, and collected completed records sheets submitted by each NGO and entered the data into the ECPAT Cambodia system.

Approximately one in three (32.4%) were between the ages of 18 to 21, while a smaller percentage (15.4%) were ages 22 and older at the time of trafficking. A majority (83.1%) of the sex trafficking survivors in the sample (N=136) were Cambodian and 16.9% were of Vietnamese decent. Primary education was reported by half the sample (54.6%) with almost a third of the sample (31.1%) reporting no formal education. While a small portion of the survivors were married or widowed, the vast majority were never married (86.1%). Consistent with recent trends in the region that demonstrate within-country trafficking as a primary mechanism,9 75.4% were trafficked to or within Cambodia. Other destination countries included Thailand (11.9%) and Malaysia (11.1%) with less than 2% being trafficked to Vietnam or China. Of the 136 women sampled, 14 were intercepted during trafficking and thus were removed from further analyses describing the nature of experiences during sexual exploitation and their relation to sexual health. Among the remaining 122 women, almost one in three women (30.0%) remained in sex work for greater than one year, with 18.6% remaining for 6 months to 1 year, 24.3% remaining for 2 months to 6 months, and 27.1% remaining for less than 2 months. % Age at trafficking <18 years 52.2 18-21 32.4 22 and over 15.4 Nationality Cambodian 83.1 Vietnamese 16.9 Education None 31.1 Primary only 54.6 Secondary or higher 14.3 Marital status Never married 86.1 Married/informal marriage 8.5 Widowed 5.4 Trafficked to Cambodia 75.4 Thailand 11.9 Malaysia 11.1 Other 1.6 Table 3.2.1a Demographics characteristics of sex trafficking survivors (n=136) Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk 9 Notably, approximately 1 in 5 survivors reported that they worked with other trafficking victims during their sexual exploitation. These data suggest that some establishments may be relatively reliant on trafficked women and girls for sexual exploitation, while in other settings, victims are either isolated from other victims of trafficking or perceive themselves to be the only victim of trafficking. It is currently unclear as to whether these workplaces reliant on a greater portion of trafficked sex workers may be qualitatively riskier regarding STI acquisition. Given evidence from other regions and patterns noted in Cambodia, however, it may be hypothesized that such establishments may be known for younger or trafficked female sex workers and, consequently, perceived by male clients as allowing greater opportunity for condom non-use and/or sexual violence. However, further data are needed to test these hypotheses. Being resold after having been trafficked was also common, with 16.8% of victims facing this experience. Frequent shuttling amongst work settings has been noted elsewhere, including India2 and Thailand,23 and is thought to maintain the anonymity of trafficked victims as well as maximizing client interest via repeated presentation of girls as \u2018new\u2019. High mobility of sex workers has also been noted in countries such as Indonesia;28 however, the shuttling experienced by trafficked sex workers is thought to be for the purpose of avoiding police detection.

Notably, both HIV and STI testing varied across the sample with respect to age at trafficking and destination of trafficking.

These findings may reflect differences in the availability of STI/HIV testing in Cambodia which has been scaled up in recent years,29 differences across NGOs that primarily serve specific populations (e.g., younger victims or internally trafficked victims), or biases within NGOs regarding those at greatest risk and, thus, tested. Given the significant STI and HIV risks demonstrated among sex trafficking survivors, routine STI/HIV screening and treatment must be considered a critical component of comprehensive care for trafficking survivors; programs and services serving this population must be supported in implementing universal screening and subsequent testing based on informed consent. This appears to be a particularly urgent need in the Cambodian context. 3.2.3 HIV Prevalence No cases of HIV were reported among the sample of those identified as victims of sex trafficking. Within the larger sample of 450 records assembled by ECPAT, there were 2 cases of HIV detected among those cases that could not be classified as meeting criteria for sex trafficking (i.e., under 18 years at time of entry to sexual exploitation, or evidence of force, fraud or coercion), although it is unclear whether infection occurred prior to or during trafficking. These individuals were 23 and 24 years old at the time that they were offered and accepted work as sex workers. There was no evidence that these individuals were tricked or forced into such experiences. The very low number of HIV cases detected among this broader sample, as well as the absence of HIV cases detected among those identified as sex trafficking victims, is a surprising contrast with both previously identified high levels of HIV among sex trafficking survivors in other regions,2, 13, 30 as well as evidence of HIV within the Cambodian population of sex workers 30-32 suggesting that this finding should be considered with caution.

The prevalence of such STI, however, clearly indicates the existence of unprotected sex and other risk behavior among this group. The low levels of HIV testing within the current sample are also of concern, and suggest that infected individuals may not have been detected. The need to support NGOs serving trafficking victims who have experienced sexual exploitation in their efforts to monitor HIV is paramount to protecting the health of these individuals as well as the broader public health interest. Finally, given the sensitivities surrounding disclosure of HIV status, it is also possible that NGOs participating in the NGO Joint Statistics Project were reluctant to report such information on behalf of their clients based on confidentiality concerns. Further research is needed to determine if the current findings accurately reflect the HIV prevalence among Cambodian women and girls trafficked into sex work, or is a biased underestimate based on patterns in HIV testing coverage and reporting. 3.2.4 STI Prevalence and Associations with Sex Trafficking Survivor Characteristics Across the subsample of those tested for STI, 73.4% of trafficking survivors were STI-infected.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9024581d-0e54-4667-b0b2-d7faf558105b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9024581d-0e54-4667-b0b2-d7faf558105b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Regional Assessment of Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39d798241183124abdde378a6f84d1a51c9bfaf53c75c52c5d310ef13dacfacb"}, "2": {"node_id": "9fae3436-4894-4e16-9667-db7b1517d586", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c664711fb5df1044632aa43eaff81490e9c9d4550d34b7719941aa556ca0da5a"}}, "hash": "04b31092063de80d9ad4ce8bf64b23f8fb70702c5f882c4eba1072a7080e104f", "text": "STI status varied, although not significantly, based on age at trafficking, with those ages 22 and older reporting STI most often (88.9%).

As illustrated in the graph below, those most recently initiated into sex work (e.g. those working less than 2 months) reported relatively higher rates of infection (90%). This is consistent with recent investigations from Cambodia34 and South Asia,13 indicating tremendous risk for STI in the early phases of sex work, potentially reflecting experiences of forced sex or forced unprotected sex. While not specifically tested in this investigation, research from India has highlighted the violent nature of initiation into sex work that trafficked women experience.13 This violent and, thus, risky initiation is a likely contributor to the current findings as 15% of this group reported forced sex and 20% reported sexual abuse. However, among those trafficked into sex work for longer than 2 months, the prevalence of STI infection increased with duration. This trend has been found in prior investigations of sex trafficked women that demonstrate % STI Infection 20 40 30 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 Figure 3.2.4b STI prevalence by the duration in sex work Duration in Sex Work <=2 months 2 mo - 6mo 6 mo - 1yr > 1yr Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk 13 increased levels of HIV with longer duration in sex work.22 The U-shaped trend found here suggests that those who avoid infection upon entry into sex work face a higher risk for infection with increasing duration of their exploitation. Findings provide support for primary prevention of sex trafficking as likely the only means of avoiding the high levels of STI (and perhaps HIV, as found in earlier work) suffered based on extreme levels of sexual risk faced during the period of initiation to sex work. Efforts to identify and assist victims as early as possible should also be supported in order to reduce the risk of STI that increases with the length of their exploitation. Efforts to prevent sex trafficking and efforts to prevent STI should work in tandem. 3.2.5 Violence, Mistreatment and STI Sexual violence was prevalent among this sample of sex trafficking survivors. One in four survivors (25.0%) reported being forced to complete unwanted sex acts, while an even greater number (28.1%) reported sexual abuse in the context of trafficking and sexual exploitation. STI was common among sexual violence survivors in the sample. The experience of forced sex acts demonstrated a trend, though not statistically significant, towards elevated STI risk with 87.5% of those victimized STI infected as compared with 68.8% of their non-abused counterparts (p=0.145). Sexual violence may pose direct STI risk via forced sex and resulting lesions that may facilitate infection in the presence of STI exposure. Violence may also affect STI risk via indirect mechanisms, including compromised ability to refuse unwanted sex or negotiate condom use following experiences of sexual violence. In addition to sexual violence, sex trafficking victims often face less obvious forms of maltreatment or disempowerment.35 An index of disempowerment experiences was assembled to capture a range of forms of maltreatment including being deprived of food, detained when not working, not being paid or paid less than promised, not being allowed to leave the sex work venue, and the withholding of identity documents by the manager. One in four survivors (25.0%) experienced 2 or more forms of maltreatment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5168c8ec-3159-4756-b045-7499466db87b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5168c8ec-3159-4756-b045-7499466db87b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Regional Assessment of Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b190cb74e85b46b427ca842903403bb31d10f7930ae73255463ce00a8fb357f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "85dea4f2-709c-4966-82a6-bf0b84489138", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ac7e79f2c9d5225d4b2a641155609c232eb730a0a90e145a016bf39a41ecde1"}}, "hash": "03c6b50d2c3535379eccc00bb5452208a3a166f49285a0b6af5d21564fb31af8", "text": "One in four survivors (25.0%) experienced 2 or more forms of maltreatment.

IOM monitors assistance and collects information on the trafficking survivors it assists. The IOM global human trafficking database is considered the world\u2019s largest database of primary data on registered victims of trafficking (VoTs), containing primary data on 12,500 registered victims of more than 80 different nationalities trafficked to more than 90 destination countries. The scope of data monitored varies extensively across countries, with the highest quality and quantity of data currently available via the Jakarta, Indonesia IOM Mission. The Jakarta IOM Mission has been using this standardized anti-trafficking data-management tool since 2002 to facilitate management of IOM direct assistance through a centrally managed system as well as mapping the survivor\u2019s trafficking experience. The Indonesia IOM Mission database includes data for survivors receiving services at four recovery centers (Jakarta, Pontianak, Surabaya, Makassar) based in Indonesia. On arrival, each trafficking survivor receives a comprehensive medical evaluation and completes an in- take interview; the database is constructed based on data obtained via these mechanisms. The database includes quantitative data on demographic characteristics of trafficking survivors (e.g., age at trafficking, marital status), trafficking experiences (e.g., destination country, escape mechanism), workplace conditions and violence victimization therein, and STI and HIV laboratory testing results. Analyses were conducted to describe characteristics of trafficking survivors and trafficking experiences, and evaluate factors related to a) infection of any STI, including HIV, and b) HIV alone. The current analyses are limited to 509 female survivors of sex trafficking documented by IOM Indonesia from January 2005 through November 2008. Data were provided to the research team at the Harvard School of Public Health in a form that did not include any personal identifiers based on a Memorandum of Understanding between the IOM and the Harvard School of Public Health. The process also follows the IOM Data Protection principles governing the collection, processing, storage and transfer of data. 4.2 Results 4.2.1 Demographics of Sex Trafficking Survivors The majority of women and girls who had been trafficked for sexual exploitation reported never being married (67.4%), with smaller numbers being married (11.6%) or divorced/separated (17.0%) prior to having been trafficked. The somewhat higher number of divorced/separated vs. married trafficking victims may, if this pattern is distinct from other migrant populations, support reports that young girls who are married in childhood and divorce early may be particularly vulnerable to exploitation into sex work. Nearly all of the women were of Indonesian nationality (99.1%). The majority of women (52.0%) escaped from sexual exploitation with help from the police. A notable 30% of girls and women left on their own.

Age of FSWs has related positively to greater likelihood of infection in previous work involving FSW samples. Further, mean duration of sexual exploitation among the current sample was 5 months, as compared to 13 months in the only FSW study where this information was reported. In fact, 7 out of 8 trafficking survivors in the current study faced less than one year of such exploitation. Notably, among those enduring more than one year in prostitution, the prevalence of HIV currently observed was far higher \u2013 19.4%. Thus, given that previous studies if STI/HIV among FSW samples involved older participants enduring sexual exploitation for longer periods of time, comparisons of HIV and STI among younger and less \u2018experienced\u2019 women and girls in the current sample to other HIV estimation efforts is likely inappropriate. In fact, if we limit consideration to those trafficked for sexual exploitation for a period of greater than one year, a perhaps more comparable group based on duration in sex work documented elsewhere, we find that HIV prevalence among trafficking survivors appears to be significantly greater than that reported for FSWs not identified as trafficked. Another critical concern in considering the relative risk of HIV among these women and girls as compared to other FSWs involves the lack of any comparable data for FSWs in Malaysia. The most recent data for HIV among sex workers in Malaysia were collected in 2000 and involved a convenience sample that was mostly comprised of transsexual individuals.38 Given that almost one third of the current sample of trafficked women and girls were exploited in Malaysia, such data are needed to further consider whether trafficking presents additional risk for HIV infection among FSWs in this national setting. Regarding the prevalence of other STIs, estimates for syphilis, gonorrhea, and Trichomoniasis ranged from 4.3-6.1%. These estimates are, similar to present findings for HIV prevalence, somewhat lower than those found among other samples of FSWs, e.g., prevalence of syphilis among FSWs in two earlier studies was 7.5-13.0%.36, 37, 39 Overall, 14% of sex trafficking survivors tested had at least one STI (syphilis, gonorrhea, or Trichomoniasis, or HIV). However, as with HIV, the prevalence of STI/HIV infection was far greater among those women and girls enduring sex work for more than one year (23.1% vs. 11.7%; Table 4.2.2). Given that the current sample is far younger and likely endured sex work for far shorter periods than samples included in previous FSW studies of STI, such comparisons may not be informative in advancing our understanding of STI/HIV risk based on trafficking. Studies are urgently needed that involve sampling of FSWs in which trafficking history may be assessed so as to allow for true comparisons of HIV/STI risk among trafficked and non-trafficked women and girls while taking into consideration potential differences in age and duration of exposure. 4.2.3 Demographic and Trafficking Characteristics and STI/HIV Infection Table 4.2.3 describes the demographic and trafficking characteristics of sex trafficking survivors and examines their association with STI/HIV infection among those with STI/HIV test results (n= 487).

The observed increased risk for STI/HIV as length of time spent in sex work increases likely reflects more opportunities for STI/HIV infection, for example, due to greater number of sexual partners. Further, recent examinations of STI/HIV risk among trafficked vs. non-trafficked FSWs suggest that risk exposures are not only more likely among those trafficked, but that these higher risk exposures continue throughout the entire period of sex work.23 Notably, the median duration of trafficking experience was 5 months across the sample, which also serves to contextualize the prevalence of STI/HIV and HIV presently identified relative to that of other samples. For example, in a study by Ford et al.,39 the sample of Indonesian sex workers reported a mean time in sex work was 13 months. Further work is needed to determine if, given similar levels of exposure, trafficking victims may be more likely to become infected with HIV and other STIs.

Also similar to results for the broader grouping of STI, HIV infection did not differ based on destination country (p=0.144), with 5.4% of those trafficked within Indonesia infected with HIV as compared with 5.0% of those trafficked to Malaysia.

The ability to detect differences in STI/HIV infection based on experiences of sexual violence may be compromised by variation in experiences of violence victimization within the three quarters of sex trafficking survivors who indicated such experiences. For example, STI/HIV risk may vary based on qualities of violence victimization within trafficking for sexual exploitation not fully captured within the current study, e.g., the relative severity and frequency of abuse. Nonetheless, the high prevalence of physical and sexual violence victimization identified is notable, and demonstrates consistency with prior work conducted among sex workers with and without attention to trafficking.13, 41-43 Violence is thought to pose STI/HIV risk via direct mechanisms (e.g., lesions associated with forced sex that may facilitate transmission) as well as indirectly (e.g., via compromising victims\u2019 future ability to refuse sex or negotiate condom use for fear of violent repercussions). Notably, while not fully captured within the current study, women and girls who have been sex trafficked likely face physical and sexual violence victimization from a number of different perpetrators, ranging from traffickers themselves to clients, brothel managers and even police;44 further work is needed to better understand experiences of violence among victims of sex trafficking and others in sex work, as well as mechanisms by which such experiences may pose STI/HIV risk. 4.2.6.

The only statistically significant predictor of HIV infection was duration of exploitation for longer than one year (AOR 4.70, 95% CI 1.61, 13.73). A similar trend towards elevated STI/HIV risk was identified based on duration of exploitation greater than one year (AOR 1.98, 95% CI 0.96, 4.08). One likely explanation of these findings is that longer duration may represent greater opportunity for exposure or accumulated exposure to sexual risks that are indicated by other factors. To better understand the individual roles and temporal ordering of these risk exposures, longitudinal studies are typically called for; however, such efforts are clearly unethical in this context. Although valid concerns exist regarding recall bias, clarity on these and related issues may be achieved via retrospective data collection involving detailed reporting on succeeding periods of exposure. Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk 23 THAILAND: STUDY METHODS and RESULTS 5 5.1 Study Methods Data were collected between February and March of 2007 by the Institute for Population and Social Research (IPSR) at Mahidol University (Bangkok, Thailand), in collaboration with local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Bangkok, Chonburi, Chiang Mai and Songkhla, Thailand. The sample was constructed to approximate the proportional number of sex workers in each province as reported by the STI Division, Ministry of Public Health of Thailand. Local NGO staff within each province developed maps of sex work establishments to facilitate recruitment and understanding of the distribution of sex workers and the types of sex work venues (i.e. massage parlors, brothels, karaoke bars, etc). Within each province, venues were stratified based on factors such as type of establishment, price range, and number of sex workers prior to being randomly selected based on the maps developed. Female sex workers (FSWs) working in these establishments were invited to participate in the study; sampling of FSWs was proportional to establishment size such that establishments employing larger numbers of FSWs had greater numbers enrolled. Of 301 invited, 202 establishments agreed, for a venue participation rate of 67.6%. At each participating establishment, FSWs were approached for recruitment by the research team; sampling was proportional to establishment size such that establishments employing larger numbers of FSWs had great numbers enrolled. Of the 1,025 participants recruited, 815 consented to participate for a response rate of 79.5%. The survey was administered by trained interviewers in Thai in a private location within the establishment. Two items were used to assess trafficking status among FSWs; FWS were characterized as having been trafficked if they were under the age of 18 at their first paid sexual encounter, or if they entered sex work via force, fraud or deception. Single items were used to assess demographic characteristics as well as forms of STI risk.

Sexual Risk Sex trafficked FSWs were found to face greater STI/HIV risks in a number of different ways. Trafficked FSWs experienced greater levels of sexual exposure, reporting an average of 33.4 vaginal sex episodes with clients in the past month as compared with only 24.6 such acts among those non-trafficked (p=0.03). Anal sex, which represents a relatively high level of HIV risk, was three times as common among sex trafficked FSWs (8.2% vs. 2.6%; p<0.01). These higher levels of sexual exposure (i.e., exposure to STI/ HIV) may reflect greater client demand for younger, trafficked women, limited negotiation capacity to refuse sex, and/or greater pressure to have sex with higher numbers of clients. Trafficked FSWs also faced greater difficulties in negotiating proper condom use, with 22.4% of trafficked women reporting recent condom failure compared to 12.4% of non-trafficked FSWs. This roughly doubling of condom failure may reflect limitations in knowledge about correct condom use, perhaps due to limited access to condoms, or male clients\u2019 lack of attention to correct condom use with these most vulnerable individuals. Recent condom non-use (past 5 vaginal sex acts) was also far more prevalent among trafficked FSWs compared to non-trafficked FSWs, with trafficked women reporting 3 times the number of incidents in which a condom was not used (8.2% vs. 3.1%; p=0.02). These indicators of reduced condom use among sex trafficked FSWs are particularly concerning in light of their higher levels of sexual exposure described above. Lifetime experience of client condom refusal was common among the total sample (71.5%); no differences were detected based on trafficking status. However, proceeding to having unprotected sex after a client refused to use a condom was twice as common among trafficked vs. non-trafficked FSWs (10.0% vs. 5.2%; not statistically significantly different based on small numbers of reports). This potential difference in trafficked women\u2019s capacity to refuse unprotected sex may reflect clients seeking out those younger and more vulnerable FSWs. While not available within the current study, understanding of the frequency and recency of experiences of client condom refusal is needed to add additional clarity regarding differences in related sex risk based on sex trafficking status. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Figure 5.2.2.

Of note, a higher prevalence of reported unwanted sex acts in the context of sex work was also reported by trafficked FSWs (18.6% among trafficked vs. 10.7% among non-trafficked, p<.01), again indicating limited ability to negotiate sex or sexual protection.

As reported in earlier work,22 those trafficked into sex work who do not comply willingly with such demands, likely set the stage for this sexual brutality to overcome initial resistance. Further, such resistance as well as trafficked FSWs likely relatively low status among FSWs overall may make it more likely that multiple forms of violence will continue beyond the period of initiation, as currently demonstrated. Beyond the broader mental and physical health consequences of sexual violence, sexual violence at initiation to sex work and beyond poses a number of risks for HIV infection. Such physical trauma to the genital tract, particularly in the cases of younger girls, may directly facilitate HIV infection. Beyond the initial assault, such women and girls may be forced or coerced to have sex with additional men prior to healing of wounds from the violence, thus extending their heightened vulnerability to HIV. Finally, early sexual violence victimization may also disempower trafficked FSWs regarding future sexual or condom negotiations with clients. These findings indicate that existing HIV prevention and education efforts Figure 5.2.3.

As discussed earlier, the greater prevalence of recent violence victimization (for this sample, long after initiation) among trafficked FSWs suggests that being trafficked into sex work may pose ongoing vulnerability throughout the time that they participate in sex work. This continuing violence likely leads to extreme disempowerment, may manifest in reduced sexual decision-making or condom negotiation power, and may explain findings of greater condom non-use and condom failure found among trafficking victims, both within brothel establishments and other indoor settings as well as amongst free-lance FSWs. Further research is needed to disentangle the role of pimps and other types of managers in controlling condom use and perpetrating violence against FSWs across this range of settings. 5.2.4. Working conditions: Mobility and Days Permitted without Sex Work As illustrated below, having worked in multiple locations was also more prevalent among trafficked FSWs than non-trafficked women (69.4% vs. 41.2%; p<0.01). This finding is consistent with prior research from South Asia2 and supports contentions that these victims may be shuttled between workplaces to avoid police and/or NGO detection,46 as well as to be presented as new/virginal to a new community of male clients; previous work has demonstrated that men will pay far higher prices for sexual access with younger girls and those perceived to be virgins.46 Such mobility also likely poses a critical barrier to the ability of sex trafficking victims to access help and health care,47 and may both prolong their victimization and increase their risk of developing serious health concerns. Though not statistically significant, trafficked FSWs also were more likely than those not trafficked to report that they do not have any days during which they are permitted not to participate in sex work (29.4% vs. 21.4%), further adding to our understanding of the qualitatively different experiences of sex work among trafficked FSWs reflective of their lower status and lack of control over their lives and participating in sex work.

Unlike STI/HIV testing outcomes, HIV knowledge did vary based on trafficking status. Sex trafficked FSWs demonstrated lower levels of HIV knowledge relative to non-trafficked FSWs (p=0.04), consistent with concerns that those trafficked into sex work at early ages may have less access to such information. This lack of access may well reflect difficulties of HIV prevention programs in reaching sex-trafficked FSWs based on their greater isolation from health care and other assistance,47 concerns among those controlling sex trafficking victims that the presence of those presenting as underage or being there against their will lead to sanctions by HIV educational agencies, or unwillingness of the part of HIV educational agencies to operate in settings involving younger FSWs in order to avoid the ethical issues that might arise. Such concerns are often described as being based on the reduced access to all FSWs that may result from HIV education agents acting against those responsible for allowing such agents to work in these settings. 5.2.6. Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Outcomes Recent STI symptoms (i.e., lesions, warts, itchiness, lower abdominal pain, pain when urinating) were common across the sample, with approximately two thirds reporting any such symptom during the past four months. Report of grouped recent STI symptoms was not found to vary based on sex trafficking status. However, trafficked women and girls were somewhat more likely to report lesions or warts as compared to other FSWs (17.9% vs. 11.8%; p=0.11).

Further investigation of STI/HIV outcomes among FSWs based on their trafficking status is needed, particularly given clear evidence of elevated sexual risk among trafficking victims. A trend towards elevated risk for lesions or warts for trafficked FSWs may reflect higher prevalence of ulcerative STI and suggests elevated risk for further transmission of infection including HIV. Further, lesions may reflect recent or prior genital injury, indicating both experiences of sexual violence and greater vulnerability to STI/HIV. 5.2.7. Demographics, Sexual Risk and STI among Sex-trafficked FSWs Restricting our analyses to those FSWs meeting criteria for sex trafficking (n=85), several demographic and sexual risk factors were related to STI infection. Among those reporting anal sex in the past month, 100% were STI infected (p<0.05). A trend toward increased STI risk based on multiple work locations was also detected; 71.2% of trafficked victims who worked in multiple settings were STI infected as compared with only 53.9% of those who stayed in one location. Among those reporting recent physical violence, 100% were STI infected as compared with 62.8% of those not exposed to such violence (p<0.05). A trend towards increased STI risk was also detected based on exposure to recent unwanted sex acts; 87.5% of trafficked victims violated in this way were STI infected relative to only 60.9% of those not victimized in this way. Notably, non-violent maltreatment also related to STI infection, with those experiencing non- violent forms of maltreatment such as verbal abuse or being made to do unwanted acts not involving sex observed to be over four times as likely to be infected as compared with their non-mistreated counterparts. Taken together, these findings illustrate the dual roles of sexual risk and disempowerment as represented by violence and maltreatment in posing STI risk to sex-trafficked FSWs.

Empirical Consideration of Alternate Definitions of Trafficking to Assess Consistency of Results While the current report defines sex trafficking as the forced, fraudulent or deceitful entry into sex work, entry by abduction, or entry into such work under age 18, based on the UN Palermo Protocol,1 as discussed earlier, the ongoing debate concerning the definition of sex trafficking must be acknowledged. The elements of force, fraud, and deceit are generally agreed on components of sex trafficking, but elements such as the age criteria (e.g., under age 18 at entry) are considered arbitrary by some. While there can be no doubt of the harm caused to children by involvement in sex work, the question remains as to whether this should be considered child sexual exploitation, or commercial sexual exploitation of children, for example, rather than part of the definition of sex trafficking. Others have argued that trafficking must by definition include travel or transport, either within or across geographic boundaries, to reflect the forced migration element common amongst trafficking victims. To inform this debate, post-hoc analyses were conducted of the current sample to consider an alternate definition of sex trafficking; specifically forced, fraudulent, or deceitful entry into sex work only (i.e., without consideration of the under age 18 component of the definition). For these post-hoc analyses, FSWs indicating that their entry to FSW was under conditions of force, fraud, or deceit, including violent sexual initiation as an element of force, were considered to have been sex trafficked, with those not reporting such elements defined as not sex trafficked. Given current and prior evidence that early age at entry to sex work confers negative health consequences as well as sexual risk, post-hoc analyses were limited to those individuals that entered FSW at or over the age of 18 years, to avoid the introduction of confounding. Among FSWs who began sex work at or over the age of 18 years, 4.8% met criteria for the alternate definition of trafficking (i.e., entry via force, fraud or deceit, including sexual violence at initiation). The relatively small number of those meeting criteria for trafficking limited statistical power to compare differences in HIV risk behaviors based on trafficking; however, several trends towards elevated sexual risk were noted, demonstrating consistency with findings presented earlier within the report. Specifically, trafficked FSWs were more likely to experience recent condom failure (18.2% vs. 12.8%, p=0.366); work in multiple locations (48.6% vs. 41.2%, p=0.386), face violence or mistreatment in the workplace (42.9% vs. 34.8%, p=0.331), and have had recent unprotected sex (5.7% vs. 2.9%, p=0.346). While not statistically significant at the p<0.05 level in part due to small cell sizes, these findings echo those presented earlier and suggest elevated sexual risk among trafficking victims classified by the alternate definition. Further research aided by larger sample sizes is needed to extend and confirm these findings, both in Thailand and elsewhere. Investigation of extent and role of force, fraud or deception is strongly indicated; recent findings from a small sample of FSWs in Nicaragua demonstrated that an estimated 2 in 5 FSWs entered via force, coercion or deception,49 suggesting that this element of trafficking may be prevalent in some national and regional settings. The current investigation was not able to assess other elements of alternate sex trafficking definitions that may be under consideration, e.g., transport; however, further research into these distinct components of potential trafficking definitions is recommended to best clarify the most relevant elements of this concept, and ultimately inform policy and programmatic efforts to assist those victimized.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f80da266-dafe-4fdb-8f74-0e8b5a18c79b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f80da266-dafe-4fdb-8f74-0e8b5a18c79b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Regional Assessment of Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "042642671a37066830280a11e661a686b838ba5116c47afc90d7c04b442243c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "051d6fdf-6652-4a96-a08c-f5852eaf82b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc26e5a92191a77c41daade3f708d6d3e9e1930732368977c713bfa18a6cd16e"}}, "hash": "e71e0736e49978536ed430ca04e0e95dcb477ef6a2f94b58c9093fd1b299ccd2", "text": "Nonetheless, when considering either the definition indicated by the UN Palermo protocol (i.e., age<18 at the time of entry or entry via force, fraud or deception), or an alternative definition consisting only of the force, fraud, or deception elements (i.e., that used in the post-hoc analyses), trafficked FSWs appear to Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk 32 demonstrate greater sexual risk for the contraction of STI/HIV.

Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk 33 Across all three country studies, our findings consistently indicate that trafficking for sexual exploitation relates to high risk for STI/HIV among women and girls, with victimized women and girls facing high levels of exposure to conditions and experiences within the sex work context that have placed them at risk for such infection. Further, in direct comparisons of trafficked to non-trafficked sex workers, trafficked women experienced significantly higher rates of STI/HIV risk factors as well as actual infection. It is also critical to observe that across all of the studies in this regional analysis, physical and sexual violence as well as other forms of maltreatment were used against trafficked women and girls in the context of sex work. Such abuse may well make trafficking victims further vulnerable to STI/HIV by making resistance to unsafe sex and negotiation of condom use less likely. These findings also demonstrate the tremendous costs of sex trafficking in terms of the loss of human dignity, health and wellbeing for women and girls. Taken together, this evidence clearly supports the need to consider trafficking for sexual exploitation as a key concern within regional efforts to reduce and prevent HIV. Increasing understanding of the sources of risk for being trafficked among vulnerable populations and how these vulnerabilities may be reduced is urgently needed, as primary prevention of trafficking may well represent a critical, yet missing, component of HIV prevention within Southeast Asia. As important, these results point to the need for the careful integration of trafficking prevention efforts with HIV prevention programs among FSWs and greater consideration of STI/HIV vulnerability in efforts to identify and assist sex trafficked women and girls in the context of sex work. All such efforts should be evidence-based and supported by a comprehensive research agenda on both trafficking prevention and the implications of trafficking for HIV, with the current report and other initial investigations viewed as a starting point, not conclusion, in this process. An initial step in considering mechanisms by which to integrate these dual concerns is evaluating existing HIV prevention programs in the context of sex work. One major component of current HIV prevention efforts is harm reduction via female sex worker \u2018regulatory boards\u2019 or \u2018unions\u2019 (e.g., The Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee(DMSC) in the Sonagachi District of Kolkata). The Sonagachi model, for example, has been demonstrated to be effective in improving condom use, empowerment of sex workers, and preventing HIV infection among sex workers and their clients. Some have criticized this model for the lack of attention to adolescents; however, it has not been assessed for its impact on adolescent sex workers. Regarding trafficking, a critically relevant element of this model involves sex workers actively working to eliminate the presence of minor girls as well as trafficked women. Although a major potential advance in counter-trafficking strategy, success of such efforts may be challenged by competing economic incentives for those involved in sex work operations to maintain the presence of trafficked individuals (i.e., the relatively high profits derived from the prostitution of adolescent sex workers). Thus, evaluation of these aspects of the model is critical. And if found to be effective, the Sonagachi model should be optimized and considered for broader implementation based on its ability to empower sex workers and their collectives to play a proactive role in reducing both HIV and trafficking. Elements of anti-trafficking efforts and policies have also drawn significant criticism. Most concerning are rescue operations involving police. Police raids on brothels have been reported to involve violence and sexual abuse of FSWs, and to have forced sex work operations underground where regulation and health services access is further restricted, and where even greater vulnerability to violence may be experienced by both trafficked and non-trafficked FSWs. However, few alternatives currently exists to bring trafficking RECOMMENDATIONS and CONCLUSIONS 6 Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk 34 victims out of such sexual bondage, and the current research indicates that this is, indeed, by far the most common vehicle by which trafficking victims escape from involuntary prostitution.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa940f75-bcac-4573-a854-7620356bbf9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa940f75-bcac-4573-a854-7620356bbf9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Regional Assessment of Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18306d4b26831f62d9ee108d49d652a0b8034eaf9a286112c57523602e9177ab"}, "2": {"node_id": "1703dfe5-647a-45b5-bf1f-4b5a3863c951", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97c6a19dfa359defad5f4a070b619b1cdfbc14d86bb6d6ccae416871cfa21f43"}}, "hash": "9e2c76a7a9dcb1eee3ee650c59e9343dc444e8092d2186a4809be98ff825aa81", "text": "Another possible approach, although still limited in scope and needs a thorough evaluation, is the Sonagachi approach in which a collective of sex workers themselves assist in the identification and removal of trafficked women and girls from sex work settings.

Greater involvement of human rights entities, within and outside of government, in overseeing the actions of police regarding trafficking victims, evaluation of anti- trafficking elements of sex worker empowerment models (e.g., the Sonagachi model), and development of avenues of assistance not involving the criminal justice system (e.g., the health sector) are critical to improving responses to the presence of trafficking victims in sex work settings. Although there are valid and serious concerns from both anti-trafficking and HIV risk reduction leaders regarding current approaches (i.e., the neglect of trafficking victims by HIV prevention efforts and the abuse of FSWs and disruption of HIV prevention programs in the context of removal of trafficking victims by police), these concerns must not lead us to embrace the artificial choice between 1) providing HIV prevention services to this extremely vulnerable population, or 2) assisting children or others forced into sexual exploitation ; this is clearly unacceptable from both a public health and human rights perspective. Thus, we must move beyond this debate, establish common ground, and begin a sincere dialogue leading to the development of programs and policies that provide desperately needed HIV prevention to female sex workers, yet also assist those trafficked into sexual slavery. Clearly, integration of anti-trafficking and HIV prevention efforts targeting FSWs poses unique challenges. As illustrated by the multiple perspectives described above, the HIV and anti-trafficking communities are simultaneously reasonable and disparate in their approaches to resolving the intertwined problems of young women and girls trafficked into forced prostitution and the resulting potential for HIV infection. However, given current and previous findings that between 1 in 10 and 1 in 3 FSWs meet current criteria for trafficking, coupled with the starkly elevated sexual risk observed among those trafficked, concerted action is strongly indicated. Dialogue amongst state actors, advocates, practitioners and researchers representing both HIV prevention and trafficking prevention efforts is a critical starting point. These experts must come together to overcome the limitations of existing HIV prevention efforts in preventing transmission to trafficked victims while simultaneously developing effective means of reducing trafficking of women and girls into forced prostitution in which financial and other incentives align with, rather than compete with, the overarching goal of reducing such sexual exploitation. The UN system may play a pivotal role in supporting such dialogue which brings together sex worker organizations, police, judges, leaders in public health efforts to prevent HIV, as well as NGOs working to either empower sex workers or to prevent trafficking to develop and assess effective responses that either simultaneously or in a complementary fashion address the intertwined issues of HIV and sex trafficking. The current findings also indicate that the 100% Condom Campaign, a large-scale and otherwise successful HIV prevention effort, may fall short of meeting the needs of those trafficked into sex work. A clear example of this is the significantly reduced ability to use condoms and reduced access to HIV-related information among trafficked vs. non-trafficked FSWs in Thailand. Such efforts may well be stymied by the limited access to necessary knowledge concerning condoms, as well as the reduced power that trafficked women and girls have to negotiate condom use and refuse sex without a condom. The high prevalence of violence and other mistreatment among trafficked FSWs also likely leads to reduced ability to negotiate condom use or otherwise protect themselves sexually. Moreover, HIV prevention efforts targeting those involved in sex work typically fail to assist individuals until after the initiation period, a time during which trafficked FSWs face tremendous risk for contracting HIV based on their often violent initiation into sex work. Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk 35 As discussed earlier, primary prevention of trafficking may be a critical component of HIV prevention. Evidence-based efforts in this area should address and reduce the integrated social and economic vulnerabilities that are responsible for creating a climate supportive of sex trafficking. While economic realities such as poverty and limited education and employment opportunities certainly contribute to trafficking in all forms, these factors render women disproportionately vulnerable given social realities of limited status of women, gender discrimination, and a climate of objectification and commodification of women. As important as targeting vulnerability of women and girls is reduction of demand for trafficking victims by men \u2013 the true root cause of trafficking for sexual exploitation. Reducing such demand requires engaging men and boys in shifting deeply engrained gender-based social norms, attitudes and behaviors regarding male rights to sexual access and control of women and girls; it is the persistence of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7753a99-e5ae-4f52-9610-608052b81a77": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7753a99-e5ae-4f52-9610-608052b81a77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Regional Assessment of Sex Trafficking and STI/HIV in Southeast Asia: Connections between Sexual Exploitation, Violence and Sexual Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a72175c6e0a21c19c559ed481655f203e706abcd26bd48394094f1602b69621b"}, "3": {"node_id": "0dcb5164-69f3-4cb5-be56-4fe39298594e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-assessment-sex-trafficking-and-sti/hiv-southeast-asia-connections-between-sexual-exploitation-violence-and-sexual", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67d6b3b2d4d2d04a5a021e04cd62cb41f909f426f3645aa0cee202dcc7198bf6"}}, "hash": "608449d6434ab6c6f6d95070c9d29e2428f5bce7024d9e96fefb0711b47c0ccb", "text": "such norms that maintains trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation as well as other horrific forms of gender-based violence. Paying for sexual access to very young women and girls must be made a highly stigmatized behavior that incurs both significant social costs and results in prosecution. Efforts to better understand the context and motivations for such demand are necessary to develop such interventions and policies and require working across a broad spectrum of gender networks and movements. NOTE: Given the documented risk for HIV infection among women trafficked for sexual exploitation, agencies caring for trafficked girls and women and health care providers either connected with agencies, as well as those who work in settings in which sex work is prevalent, must be aware of HIV-related diagnostic and treatment resources available in their communities.50 Although trafficked women and girls face multiple barriers to health care access, based on awareness of possible indicators of trafficking (trauma symptoms, recurring STI, apparent fear of accompanying individuals), providers should be aware of voluntary counseling, testing and treatment protocols and resources available to the general population. An educational approach is suggested if a provider suspects a woman or girls may be trafficked, rather than direct rescue efforts unless the provider is knowledgeable regarding the available systems of assistance for trafficking victims. Further, in asking patients about having been trafficked, safety must be the highest priority; e.g., do not ask accompanying people to interpret, and only ask such questions when privacy from accompanying persons is assured. A comprehensive guide to caring for the health of trafficked individuals has been published by the IOM (Caring for Trafficked Persons: Guidance for Health Providers 2009; Geneva: International Organization for Migration). 6.5 Conclusion In sum, findings of this multi-country regional study consistently indicate that trafficking for sexual exploitation places women and girls at high risk for HIV/STI infection. Trafficking victims appear to suffer qualitatively and quantitatively different levels of sexual risk, and are less likely to be reached by HIV prevention programs. Thus, sex trafficking may be a critical factor in the persistence of the Southeast Asian HIV epidemic. In addition to the primary prevention of trafficking and reduction of male demand for sex with trafficked individuals, consideration of trafficking within HIV harm reduction and other prevention efforts among female sex workers must be prioritized and accomplished. To achieve this goal, greater dialogue is required across the spectrum of responses to sex trafficking and HIV within sex work, including advocates for the rights of both sex workers and children, advocates for the prevention of trafficking, law enforcement policy-makers and practitioners, as well as those leading public health efforts to reduce HIV in the context of sex work. Only through such efforts we may develop effective and sustainable solutions to address the health, well-being and human dignity of sex-trafficked women and girls.
