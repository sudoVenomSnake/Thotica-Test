The Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review is a tool providing a starting point to mainstream climate change into the budgeting and planning process. Since the first CPEIR implemented by Nepal in 2011, 18 other CPEIRs have been conducted worldwide. Based on this body of experience, UNDP has commissioned the preparation of a CPEIR Lessons Learned Paper, which highlights the key regional findings and challenges from the previous CPEIRs and this Methodological Guidebook. In particular, this Guidebook reviews the processes and methodologies used in the 19 CPEIRs done to date and proposes a common framework for future CPEIRs. As such, this CPEIR Methodological Guidebook provides readers with background on context, purpose, process and tools in implementing a CPEIR together with an overview of the key challenges typically faced during the CPEIR implementation. This Guidebook recognizes that the scope, content and process for CPEIRs will differ between countries according to their needs and national circumstances. This guidebook, therefore, does not aim to be prescriptive in terms of the content of a CPEIR or the process in which it is developed. It does aim, however, to provide the basic components of a CPEIR, guidance on best practices and other practical advice for those who are faced with the task of implementing a CPEIR. Kibae Park/UN Photo Martine Perret/UNMIT 2 IntroductIon This Guidebook is developed based on experiences and lessons learned from existing CPEIRs implemented by UNDP, World Bank, Overseas Development Institute (ODI), and independent CPEIR practitioners. The Guidebook is also available in Spanish on UNDP\u2019s website.1 1.2. Chapters at a Glance Chapter 2 - Context for CPEIRs provides the context for a CPEIR, an overview of climate change and its implications. Chapter 3 - Objectives of CPEIRs outlines a list of different objectives some or all of which a CPEIR typically aims to achieve. Chapter 4 - What is CPEIR? describes the overall CPEIR analytical framework. Chapter 5 - CPEIR Process maps out the six steps of a typical CPEIR process. Chapter 6 - Undertaking CPEIR Analysis focuses on the three cornerstones of a CPEIR: Policy Analysis, Institutional Analysis and Climate Expenditure Analysis. In each component, it provides the tools and methodologies that can be used in the analysis, together with suggestions of data sources and an overview of typical challenges. Chapter 7 - Further Resources recommends further reading and resources available on the topic. 1 Link: http://climatefinance-developmenteffectiveness.org/ 3 CONTExT FOR CPEIRS 2 Context for CPEIRs In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report advised that \u201cWarming of the climate system is unequivocal\u2026. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased.\u201d The Assessment provided evidence that all regions are more susceptible to droughts, floods, leading to economic losses and weather related deaths, with increasing intensity and frequency. Southeast Asia, in particular, is vulnerable, with coast lines that are home to nearly 600 million people who are vulnerable to rising sea levels. Meanwhile, populations in the greater Himalayas region are heavily affected by diminishing water resources due to diminishing snow and ice. Such impacts will bring negative consequences to the poverty eradication and sustainable development efforts. In the 2009 Regional Review2 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the four countries in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam) could suffer a loss of more than 6% of GDP annually by 2100, more than double the global average loss. South Asia could lose around 1.8% of its annual GDP by 2050, which will progressively increase to 8.8% by 2100 on the average under the business-as-usual scenario. In response to the climate change challenge, governments in both developed and developing countries have been increasingly planning and implementing adaptation and mitigation actions. International climate finance has also been available and is expected to significantly increase in the coming years now that the Green Climate Fund (GCF) is operationalized and committed to providing up to US$100 billion per year by 2020.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7204167d-7591-4ac9-8bd0-1e66792eb9b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "7204167d-7591-4ac9-8bd0-1e66792eb9b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Methodological Guidebook: Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3c30085a9784842de5f4628cc334a063637a8b2024221b88a5f12a890d6736b8"}, "2": {"node_id": "5bcd05cc-5d59-4c53-b1e1-ab08deea2cd8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3f22f1cc8e0470e6c44e5cc02c3b7defae98f43ada3d63e76dfcd8c7c7ccb06"}}, "hash": "b4e38b68463c144ab2101078fd0d83f8bcd6d9b71e3f42becef8b76822c475b8", "text": "However, given that climate change is a cross-cutting issue affecting all sectors of the economy, effective responses to climate change require a whole-of-government approach, involving involvement from both the public and private sectors.

Through this, the CPEIR will be able to identify the gaps, if any, in climate policies to protect and benefit the vulnerability groups and opportunities to redirect policies and budget allocations accordingly. x) Strengthen stakeholders\u2019 capacity to formulate more informed policy proposals that respond to climate change while presenting economic, social and gender co-benefits.

The CPEIR analytical framework has three key pillars: Policy Analysis, Institutional Analysis and Climate Public Expenditure Analysis (see Figure 1). Policy Analysis: A review of the climate change policy framework and its monitoring framework as well as how the policy objectives translate into programmes and instruments. Institutional Analysis: An analysis of the roles and responsibilities of institutions and their capacities in formulating, implementing and coordinating climate responses. This pillar also includes the review of the budgetary and planning process and its linkages to financing climate change policies and programmes (adaptation and mitigation), involving funds from government coffers and development partners. The institutions can include ministries, departments, State- owned enterprises (SOEs) and Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). The coordination extends to other stakeholders including civil society and Parliaments. Climate Public Expenditure Analysis: This pillar quantifies the climate relevant expenditure out of the total national budget and measures fiscal policies, such as tax incentives and subsidies, as part of climate financing instruments.

In order to achieve that, initial discussions with key government ministries are needed to identify the needs and the key issues to be addressed in the CPEIR. Typically, the key ministries for the CPEIR include finance, planning, environment (or climate change portfolio lead), and local government. Given the cross-cutting nature of climate change, the involvement of other line ministries, such as agriculture, rural development, forestry, energy, transport, women affairs, etc., is also important. These ministries are responsible for many of the climate relevant policies and programmes that target the poor and vulnerable. Involvement of more ministries can also facilitate the data collection process during the CPEIR implementation phase. The scope of expenditures to be reviewed in the CPEIR is one of the important issues to be discussed and addressed at the beginning. The CPEIR typically reviews the expenditures for ministerial policies and programmes which are expected to contribute to the national climate change response. In addition, the CPEIR should review the following other types of expenditures and investments. \u2022 Expenditures that contribute to increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (such as fossil fuel subsidies) and/or hindering adaptation efforts \u2022 Tax incentives for climate actions (which is foregone revenue to the government) \u2022 Dedicated extra-budgetary climate funds \u2022 Investment sources from SOEs, PPPs and private sector. Outputs: A concept note which aims to outline the scope of the CPEIR, the review period, the institutional arrangement for the CPEIR process, objectives and expected outcomes, the methodology and timetables of expected outputs, etc.. Examples of concept notes for the CPEIRs of Bhutan, Viet Nam and Pakistan are available online at http://climatefinance- developmenteffectiveness.org/). 5 2 CPEIR Institutional Arrangement To ensure government ownership and oversight of the CPEIR process, institutional arrangements for CPEIR implementation should be established, including a Steering Committee involving relevant ministries, civil society organizations, and development partners. Outputs: Terms of reference for the Steering Committee, objectives for the committee, expected outcomes, membership, roles and responsibilities, key tasks, frequencies of meetings and timeframe of operation (Example TOR for the Steering Committee is available on http:// climatefinance-developmenteffectiveness.org/). 5 3 CPEIR Terms of Reference Development Once the buy-in from key stakeholders and the necessary institutional arrangements have been established, the next task is to develop the TORs for the CPEIR and specialists who will undertake the CPEIR analysis. See Annex I for templates, which can be adjusted depending on national contexts and needs. Example TORs for the CPEIR and the CPEIR Specialists are also available online on UNDP\u2019s Climate Finance and Development Effectiveness website. 8 CPEIR PROCESS Outputs: \u2022 Terms of Reference for the CPEIR: Describing the national context, objectives, scope, the expected outputs, methodology, the key issues to be addressed, CPEIR team composition, indicative work plan and budget. \u2022 Terms of Reference for the CPEIR Specialists with key expertise in the following areas: climate change, public financial management, local government, gender, poverty and statistics. 5 4 Undertaking CPEIR Analysis The CPEIR analysis might take several months to complete. During this step, the CPEIR team will collect data, undertake the analysis following the main themes of the CPEIR (policy, institution, expenditure), report on progress and seek guidance from the Steering Committee. The tools and methodologies to undertake the CPEIR Analysis will be covered in more details in Chapter 6. Outputs: \u2022 An inception workshop: To introduce the CPEIR study to relevant stakeholders to get buy-in, facilitate data provision and comments later during the analysis. \u2022 Interim meetings with Steering Committee: To seek strategic directions and feedbacks, especially when facing significant challenges such as scope changes etc. \u2022 Interim workshops: To seek feedbacks from government ministries and other relevant stakeholders. \u2022 CPEIR report: Policy analysis, institutional review, climate expenditure review as well as recommendations going forward. 5 5 Validation and Finalization In this step, the CPEIR report is to be presented to the Steering Committee for validation and finalization.

The recommendations can range over different timeframes (short to medium and longer terms) and include a variety of actions, such as coding and tracking of climate finance within the budgetary system, integration of climate change cost benefit analysis as part of budget prioritization, as well as the implementation of climate fiscal frameworks. The exact recommendations will vary by country to accurately reflect the national context and the scope of the CPEIR. 9 CPEIR PROCESS 5 7 Duration and frequency The duration of a CPEIR is approximately six to nine months between the start of the review and the completion of the draft report. Another three months is usually required to validate and finalise the report. The duration includes the time for preparation, the CPEIR team\u2019s engagement with the administrations (central and sub-national) and other stakeholders (civil society organizations (CSOs), representatives of vulnerable groups, private sector, donors), and the time to make data available and analyse it. For countries that implement a climate expenditure tracking tool (such as the Climate Expenditure Tracking Framework proposed in Bangladesh\u2019s Climate Fiscal Framework), climate expenditure can be measured in a systematic and regular manner. Given that institutions, country systems and administrations take time to change, the CPEIR might be repeated on a less regular basis. 10 uNDERTAkING CPEIR ANALySIS 6 Undertaking CPEIR Analysis This chapter is intended to provide an overview of the types of analyses undertaken during a CPEIR, the tools and data sources used, as well as the issues that analysts might encounter during the process. The relevance and importance of each theme under these analyses as well as the availability of data will depend on specific country context. 6 1 Policy Analysis The policy analysis starts with a review of the country\u2019s climate vulnerability assessments as well as existing gender and poverty related impact analyses. It will also look at national climate change policies in the context of national development plans and other sectoral policies. The review facilitates analyses of the overall policy environment for effective climate change expenditure such as policy coherence, effectiveness of monitoring framework, and ability to measure policy changes and impacts. 6 1 1 Review of Climate Vulnerability and Poverty/Gender Assessments Description: This section aims to review national climate vulnerability assessments as well as existing poverty and gender related impact analyses. It provides an understanding of the country\u2019s vulnerable areas to climate change impacts and how the climate risks would impact on the poor and disadvantaged. This understanding would provide the basis and evidence to formulate climate change responses and to determine how to best integrate poverty alleviation and gender equality goals therein. They also have the potential to highlight the gaps, if any, in targeting climate change actions towards the vulnerability areas (by geography, vulnerable population groups or sectors). Questions to be addressed \u2022 Have there been any vulnerability assessments conducted? What are the priority areas? \u2022 What are the key elements of climate resilience, poverty alleviation and gender equality policies? \u2022 Does climate policy reflect the climate risk impact on gender and poverty? \u2022 How does climate policy articulate poverty and gender related objectives more broadly? Kibae Park/ UN Photo Eric Sales/ ADB 11 uNDERTAkING CPEIR ANALySIS \u2022 How do gender and poverty policy relate to the risk impact analysis and incorporate climate change related objectives? \u2022 What synergies and contradictions can be identified in the three areas of policy? \u2022 What sectoral linkages can be identified for effective implementation of pro-poor, gender responsive climate change policy framework? Data Requirement \u2022 National Assessments: \u2013 Climate Change: Vulnerability Assessments (likely as part of a Nation Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), National Adaptation Plan (NAP), National Communications and specific studies) (see Annex II). \u2013 Poverty: Poverty Assessments / Participatory Poverty Assessments; national sample surveys; Demographic and Health Surveys; National Development Plan documents; Donor country report; National Millennium Development Goal (MDG)/Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) Reports \u2013 Gender \u2013 Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs (if any), Country reports for the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW); donor gender assessment reports \u2013 Data on the current and estimated potential impact of climate change on the poor and vulnerable groups (please see Annex III for more climate risk impact assessments on gender and poverty).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80b080fc-c2d8-4f7f-ae28-42cdefe617f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "80b080fc-c2d8-4f7f-ae28-42cdefe617f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Methodological Guidebook: Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb59169e73d22a1d70e8ade60d5afda1da021738e33ba2d0b17fd83744718177"}, "2": {"node_id": "6191b7b4-6076-4384-afa5-e9ac479dd301", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83ea12dc75280991c53bf1203ed6dd0b7e36bd889bbfcf9c2a689c4ce7f1defe"}}, "hash": "44ab2b830350785108805f48aabd8b1142184b22e05e74baf35094846554bc38", "text": "\u2022 International assessments: \u2013 UNDP Climate Change Country Profile http://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/research/climate/projects/undp-cp/ \u2013 World Bank Climate Risk and Adaptation Country Profile http://sdwebx.worldbank.org/climateportalb/home.cfm?page=country_profile \u2013 Maplecroft Corp.

However, downscaled vulnerability assessments as well as poverty and gender related climate impact analyses might be limited. 12 uNDERTAkING CPEIR ANALySIS 6 1 2 Review of existing climate and relevant policies Description: Following the understanding of climate vulnerabilities in the country, this section aims to review the existing climate change policies and the wider context of national socio- economic development strategies and sectoral policies. The review can be conducted through mapping, collecting and reviewing the relevant policy documentations as well as through a series of interviews with subject matter experts, covering the following areas: i) Climate Change Policy Framework: Map the existing national and sub-national (if available) strategies and action plans in responding to climate change. Further, the existence of climate change action plans at the sector level, for example energy, transport, building, agriculture, and health, amongst others, and at the sub-national level would be a basis for policy coherence analysis later. Going deeper, the review could assess whether climate change actions have been costed and had funding plans (e.g. from domestic and/or external sources). This would support the analysis of linkages between climate actions and expenditure. ii) Other relevant policies: Climate change policy cannot stand alone but needs to be considered in the context of other national development plans including socio-economic development strategies and other sectoral policies. This session would also need to map other relevant frameworks such as green growth and disaster risk management. Questions to be addressed \u2022 What does the GHG emission profile at the national, sub-national and sectoral levels look like? \u2022 What are the documentation for climate change policies: strategy/action plan? \u2022 Is there any climate change action plan at the sector level? \u2022 Is climate change a policy theme at the sub-national level? Is there any policy documentation? \u2022 Are there any other sustainable development, green growth and disaster risk management policy frameworks that might have relevance to climate change response? \u2022 How climate change policy is related to national development plans? Data Requirements \u2022 National climate change strategy and action plans: national, local and sectoral level. \u2022 Research on costing of climate actions (if not outlined in action plans). \u2022 Other strategies and action plans for green growth and disaster risk management. \u2022 Socio-economic development plans, sectoral strategies and policy statements. Potential challenges \u2022 Scattered or not available information. 6 1 3 Policy Coherence Description: Overall policy framework coherence is reflected in the way climate change is integrated into the country\u2019s development agenda, including poverty alleviation, sustainable development and green growth. Climate policy coherence can be assessed through the linkages and/or gaps between climate actions and the vulnerability areas as well as the GHG emissions characteristics of the country. In addition, policy coherence is reflected through the consistency between high-level sectoral policy statements and climate change action plans in those sectors. Similarly, local government development plans need to reflect the climate change adaptation and mitigation actions relevant for the area. Further, climate policy coherence analysis would 13 uNDERTAkING CPEIR ANALySIS also look into the consistence of the national response and the global agreements on climate change at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) level. Questions to be addressed \u2022 How much policy attention does climate change receive within national development planning? \u2022 Are the national climate actions (adaptation and mitigation) responsive to the priority areas identified in the vulnerability assessments? If not, where are the gaps? \u2022 Are the policies and programmes of the government helping the poor and vulnerable cope with climate change impact? Are there policies or programmes that the government includes in its climate change response that are not considered relevant by stakeholders? Why?

Such research and analysis may emanate from the public sector, civil society and private sector. Questions to be addressed \u2022 Are there scientific assessments of climate change impacts available to the policy-making process?

Potential challenges \u2022 Scattered data (especially inputs from community levels). \u2022 Lack of information (for example cost benefit analyses). 6 1 5 Monitoring & Evaluation Framework Description: The objective of this section is to review the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework for each climate change strategy, action plan and policy. The section would assess if there is any general monitoring framework for the national climate change strategy and action plan, and if it is up-to-date. It would also help to assess if the M&E framework is being used for the implementation and evaluation of the strategy and the action plan. For mitigation policies and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMAs)7, the assessment would cover the extent to which a domestic monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) framework has been developed and/or whether any other MRV system has been adopted from donors or international organizations. For adaptation policies, the assessment would map if there is any overarching M&E framework for adaptation actions in general and/or whether there has been any attempt in developing an M&E framework for individual adaptation policies. The existence and usefulness of a monitoring framework for national climate finance funds should also be assessed if such funds are operated or being developed in the country. In particular, a pro-poor and gender-sensitive CPEIR would be interested in an M&E framework that assesses climate actions and their implications to development goals. One of the tools in this field is the Tracking Adaptation and Measuring Development (TAMD) Framework developed by IIED (see Figure 3). The TAMD provides a useful tool to assess whether climate change policies and action plans enhance or compromise development overall. It measures how fairly the costs and benefits of climate change projects are distributed and helps to identify where to spend future investments. As such, this will bring better management and more accountability in how climate policies are implemented and how climate relevant investments are made. 3 More of these tools to assess vulnerability, impacts and adaptation can be found in UNEP\u2019s PROVIA Guidelines: http://www.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea6f80b9-c6ef-478b-bd5e-3f149941f044": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea6f80b9-c6ef-478b-bd5e-3f149941f044", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Methodological Guidebook: Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6baead044fac1ddbe5c0fe4f40d62693dc8fd855e3f114c1ffa468bd01b10a4f"}, "2": {"node_id": "d42f4617-297c-4f51-b929-cfb1c99ee629", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f278b7f49342ca6c0650d5f6173e7060a58e557a45a9dd695f187ce4fc09b302"}}, "hash": "ea81554504712f9c98c382f47b9854b5fd9a430c253aeb85bc23e080e9eb5a5c", "text": "unep.org/provia/ 4 http://www.iied.org/community-based-adaptation-climate-change 5 http://www.careclimatechange.org/tk/integration/en/quick_links/tools/climate_vulnerability.html 6 Community-based Risk Screening Tool \u2013 Adaptation and Livelihoods (https://www.iisd.org/cristaltool/) 7 Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action: NAMAs refer to any action that reduces emissions in developing countries and is prepared under the umbrella of a national governmental initiative.

The analysis can look into which policy instruments are adopted, their sectoral coverage and their targets.

It also looks at which institutions have a role in this process, their existing capacity and opportunities to strengthen their capacity. The analysis starts with an overview of the budgeting and planning process of the country under review and the institutional arrangement for coordination of climate policy formulation and budget submissions. The consistency between planned and actual spending as well as the link between costed plans, programmes, medium-term budget and annual budgets also need to be assessed in a CPEIR. It will also identify the roles of finance and planning ministries as well as climate change department and other sectoral ministries in that budgeting process. Such analyses help to identify potential weaknesses in the policy-budget linkages and areas of political economy dynamics around budget and budget execution.

The central finance and planning agencies initiate the budget process 6-9 months before the start of the fiscal year by preparing a pre-budget policy document that lays out the macroeconomic framework and proposes the broad allocation of resources in line with government plans and policies. 2. This policy statement is generally approved by the government. 3. The central finance and planning agencies issue a budget circular which contains instructions and policy guidance based on this policy statement. This document will lay out the resource allocations that agencies should use for budget formulation; this is typically an agency budget ceiling broken down by major categories of expenditure (i.e., capital investment, payroll, and other recurrent expenditures). In some cases, central agencies may specify allocations related to major government policy objectives or for major programs, and to distinguish the expenditures for ongoing and new policy initiatives. 4. Agencies prepare budget proposals that allocate resources between departments, programs, and projects in line with sectoral policy and submit these to the central agencies. 5. The central finance and planning agencies assess whether each agency\u2019s proposal is within expenditure limits and aligned with the government\u2019s policy objectives. Since agency proposals often exceed budget ceilings or differ in their interpretation of the government\u2019s priorities, each agency\u2019s final budget is usually the product of negotiations between the central agency and the spending agency. 6. The central finance agency consolidates agency budgets into a state budget. 7. The state budget is approved by the government. 8. The state budget is submitted to the legislature appropriations committee for legal authorization to spend funds.

The overview will provide the basis to identify the gaps and challenges (if any) as well as opportunities in strengthening the national climate policy coordinating mechanism. It will determine if a lead agency exists, which has the formal mandate for coordinating climate policies as well as a cross-agency institutional set-up to ensure climate policy oversight and coordination across different sectors. The review would specifically identify the extent to which finance and planning ministries are engaged in the climate policy coordination process. The analysis would then assess whether there is a formal coordinating mechanism and the challenges for the coordinating agency to fulfil their roles and responsibilities. In some countries, there is no formal coordinating mechanism which might mean that several institutions take up the role of climate change coordination. As such, there might be issues with conflicting or overlapping roles and responsibilities between different institutions. In some other countries, the Ministry of the Environment or a dedicated climate change agency has a formal mandate to coordinate climate change policy formulation and implementation. In some cases, in addition to a coordinating agency, there are also cross-agency committees, at ministerial and/or technical levels. However, even though a formal coordinating mechanism exists, there are still significant challenges in ensuring climate policy formulation and implementation to be well coordinated and receive meaningful engagement from relevant line ministries, including finance and planning ministries. The challenges could include lack of leadership and awareness of climate change issues at the line ministries to engage in climate change agenda, lack of allocated resources and capacity within the line ministries to take up \u201cadditional\u201d responsibilities. Further, the cross-agency institutional arrangement might still be weak, for example, not being able to meet regularly, absence of key members at meetings due to busy schedules, not adequately informed to provide quality guidance. 20 uNDERTAkING CPEIR ANALySIS Given that climate change responses would require engagement from many different actors, this Guidebook recommends that the various stages of the CPEIR include a further assessment of the climate policy coordinating mechanism by conducting a political economy analysis (PEA). Box 2 explains how PEAs assists in unpacking the institutional challenges in the country\u2019s climate change policy agenda and implementation. Many of the guiding questions that are included in this methodological assist in understanding the political economy of a given context. What is Political Economy Analysis (PEA)? According to the OECD-DAC, \u201cpolitical economy analysis is concerned with the interaction of political and economic processes in a society; including the distribution of power and wealth between groups and individuals, and the processes that create, sustain and transform these relationships over time\u201d. Why is PEA relevant to climate finance? Climate change finance is increasingly being seen as a political rather than just a technical issue, requiring governance structures and negotiations between institutions, varying interests, and different ideologies. Climate change is not an extension of Official Development Assistance (ODA), but a process that involves complex issues related to equity and shared responsibility. Given that climate change response requires engagement from many different actors, a PEA can help understand the interests and incentives of different stakeholders that exist to make the delivery of climate change finance more effective. A PEA can also help establish a baseline of actors, formal institutions, understand what change is feasible, and what is not, and finally, help to match different possible finance options to national conditions. A PEA can also assist in identifying influential decision- makers and likely champions for change. Some of the key benefits of a PEA include: i) PEA is useful not only to understand partner governments, as well as development partners \u2013", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2ee8449-a668-4227-a313-5cb032684572": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2ee8449-a668-4227-a313-5cb032684572", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Methodological Guidebook: Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ad135b29bcd0fc37b5f2d9a6c93b1913ccd8240ab0a515de0f277a02be6f934"}}, "hash": "9ad135b29bcd0fc37b5f2d9a6c93b1913ccd8240ab0a515de0f277a02be6f934", "text": "Decisions taken by development partners are as much driven by their own political economy considerations, as are those taken by partner countries. Understanding the incentives driving the decisions of development partners in their interaction with partners is equally significant. ii) Power relations are important to define incentives \u2013 Relations between different stakeholders can be key determinants in affecting change, or blocking it. While formal mandates and responsibilities are assigned to every institution, it is often the informal dynamics that drive actions. iii) Identifying who the most influential decision makers are, particularly likely champions for change \u2013 Engagement with stakeholders that are likely to wield more influence over processes, and have more decision-making leverage is an important step in consolidating partnerships for change. Such champions for change can bring in the required political will and commitment required for reform and progress. iv) Understand who benefits and who loses from specific interventions, and monetize the effects \u2013This is fundamental to understand and address, as those who are likely to gain less (or lose) may be important actors who hinder progress. Their legitimate fears and concerns about forthcoming change need to be understood, and options to alleviate the consequences should be identified. v) Understand the importance of information and its influence on power relations \u2013 Only well- informed decision makers can make their contribution to better and effective climate change delivery. This requires clear communication mechanisms between stakeholder groups to foster dialogue and enhances the ability to strengthen accountability structures within climate change finance governance structures Potential challenges There is reservation about PEA\u2019s feasibility, and what the most effective way would be to conduct such analyses given the sensitive topics that it tries to address in some cases.

The assessment will identify the relevant agencies/ministries and the institutional arrangements which are mandated to coordinate the poverty and gender agenda of the country (if any). It will then assess how these poverty and gender focused institutions and mechanisms have been engaged in the climate change policy dialogue and coordination. Finally, the assessment would also look at how poverty and gender policy objectives have been mainstreamed in climate change institutions and whether these institutions have sufficient capacity to integrate poverty and gender considerations into climate change policy formulations. Questions to be addressed \u2022 Climate Change Policy Coordinating Mechanism: \u2013 Is there a formal coordinating agency? If not, which agency is (informally) assuming that role at the moment? If yes, what is/was the reasoning for appointing such agency as the formal coordinating agency? \u2013 Is there clarity in the mandates and jurisdiction of the entities tasked with coordinating climate policy design? What is the capacity and level of resources allocated to the coordinating agency (if formally mandated) in order to take up their responsibilities? \u2013 Does the coordinating agency have the leverage to convene other key stakeholders? \u2013 Does the coordinating agency have a presence at the sub-national level? \u2013 Is there a formal cross-agency institutional arrangement? At which level, ministerial and/ or technical working group level? How are finance and planning ministries involved in such institutional set-up? \u2013 Are there clear institutional arrangements between ministries and institutions to ensure cross-agency dialogue and coordination of climate policy design and implementation? Are such cross-agency institutional arrangements effective in providing climate policy coordination and oversight? \u2013 What is the level of engagement and oversight from the top leadership such as the President Office or Office of the Prime Minister? \u2013 What is the level of awareness of climate change issues at line ministries and relevant institutions? Similarly, do they have the capacity and resources allocated to respond to sectoral climate policies? Is there capacity building programme for line ministries to understand climate change issues and link climate change to their work? \u2022 Poverty and Gender Sensitive Analysis: \u2013 Has the climate change coordinating agency appropriately mainstreamed poverty and gender? What are the existing gaps (powers, resources, capacity)? \u2013 Who are the key ministries and stakeholders (CSOs) mandated to deliver on poverty and gender policy objectives in the country?

The section should also assess the capacity of the local authorities to make plans in consultation with the communities and to deliver the services. It can cover their capacity to coordinate with central ministries and a capacity gap assessment for implementing climate change activities. It can include their capacity to manage large-scale projects. Questions to be addressed \u2022 What are the current administrative and political structures linking between sub-national governments (SNGs) and central government? What are the jurisdiction and responsibilities of SNGs in implementing national climate change response? \u2022 What are the coordinating mechanisms between central government and SNGs for climate policy design and delivery? Is this a formally recognised arrangement, or is it an informal set up? Does the national climate change coordinating body have a presence at local level? If not, what is the vehicle through which they coordinate? In a federal set up, or in a highly decentralized setting, are there climate related regulations at the local level that contradict what exists at national level? \u2022 Do SNGs have the control of the funds allocated to climate change activities? Is part of locally raised revenues used towards climate change activities? \u2022 Are there clear and practical instructions from central government to SNGs on the policies developed and their financing through the national budget and local budgets? \u2022 Is there any technical support to SNGs on developing plans and projects or proposals for special climate funds? \u2022 What is the level of awareness of climate change issues in the local governments? Is there any capacity building programme to local government staff? \u2022 Do SNGs have sufficient human resource capacity and capability in assessing their climate vulnerabilities and integrating climate change in the local development plans and policies? \u2022 What is the current channel that SNGs use to provide economic and social support to the poor and vulnerable, especially women? Do SNGs have the capacity to deliver climate finance to the poor and address climate impacts on vulnerable groups, especially women? Data Requirements \u2022 Laws and regulations on decentralisation and sub-national authorities. \u2022 Climate change policy documentations relating to the responsibilities of local governments in implementing climate change strategies and action plans (sometimes incorporated in the strategy and action plans themselves). \u2022 Interviews with SNGs and communities. Potential Challenges \u2022 There might be variations from reality and documented roles and responsibilities of SNGs in relation to climate policy design and implementation. \u2022 Lack of comprehensive or meaningful assessments of capacity and capability at SNGs in climate policy and climate finance delivery. 23 uNDERTAkING CPEIR ANALySIS Box 3: Linking National and Local Adaptation Planning: Lessons from Nepal Delivering national climate adaptation plans at the local level can deliver co-benefits if... \u2022 Social exclusion is addressed. The poorest and most marginalised groups of people complain of being excluded from development planning and decision-making and not being able to access state resources. \u2022 The process is used to refresh development efforts that focus on the most vulnerable and marginalised people. The narrative on climate change in Nepal emphasises inclusive governance and a commitment to using available funds for local level implementation. \u2022 Mechanisms for improving chains of communication are developed. Effective communication can help to reduce the mismatch between autonomous and planned adaptation, facilitate the use of traditional knowledge in planning processes, and theoretically lead to more successful adaptation interventions because they have community support. \u2022 Support for governance reform and capacity development is continued. This may well be one of the most effective ways in which donors can contribute to enhancing the prospects for the LAPA in Nepal. Having an appropriate structure that matches with the organizational circumstances and context improves the effectiveness of the organization in meeting its strategic goals and objectives. However, a structurally sound organization is only part of the successful approach for managing climate change adaptation.

The accountability institutions include the following, but are not limited to: \u2022 The institution tasked with the policy coordination and monitoring of climate change issues and impact \u2022 The Supreme Audit institution \u2022 The institutions to whom the government answers to in terms of its climate change policies or lack thereof, its implementation and associated spending. For example, in parliamentary system, Parliament and specialised Parliamentary Committees (such as Investment, Poverty, Environment, and Finance) are key accountability institutions. The role of Parliament and its committees is essential as they would have impacts during different budgetary stages: budget speech, budget hearings, budget debate, and questioning the executives on budget execution. Other non-state actors such as CSOs, private sector, media etc. would also be important stakeholders in providing cross-checking by way of monitoring, reviewing and challenging budgetary and policy implementation reporting. In some cases, donors might establish their own accountability mechanisms, especially in relation to projects and programmes they fund, including climate change projects. 11 In this Guidebook, we call these institutions \u201caccountability institutions.\u201d 24 uNDERTAkING CPEIR ANALySIS This section would first map out the relevant accountability institutions currently working in the national context and assess the extent to which they are involved in climate change issues. The assessment would need to also consider the level of awareness of climate change issues and recognition of its importance to/ the national development agenda. Further, the institutional capacity and capability to fulfil their role as accountability institutions also need to be assessed. This section could also identify donors\u2019 accountability mechanism on climate change projects and assess whether it is aligned with and complementing national accountability system. Media as an institution should also be included in this section. The frequency, quality of information and scope of opinions could be assessed. This may need online reviews. The UN Global Pulse initiative provide a tool for providing analysis on climate change related issues that are posted online. It is important to note that the list of accountability institutions mentioned here is only to provide guidance and by no means is prescriptive. The importance and effectiveness of each of these accountability institutions depend on the national context such as their administrative and political structures which the analysis should make sure to reflect. This section would also assess the availability of climate change monitoring information relating to climate policy implementation and spending. Information availability is important in enabling accountability institutions to monitor and scrutinize climate policy implementation and climate finance delivery. Two key sets of information relating to accountability are: financial and policy results. Financial accountability information is what a government regularly publishes on its budget and its execution. Policy results information would be public reports from the central and local governments\u2019 monitoring system and evaluations conducted for climate programmes and policies. Questions to be addressed \u2022 What institutions are currently ensuring accountability of policy implementation and government spending? Do they include climate change as part policy issues under their mandates? What is the level of awareness and capacity of these institutions in including climate change in their work programmes? \u2022 Do donors establish any accountability mechanisms for climate change related projects and programmes funded by them in the country? Are these mechanisms effective in complimenting and strengthening the domestic accountability institutions? \u2022 Does the media cover climate change issues? What is the level of awareness and understanding of media institutions on climate change issues? \u2022 Are monitoring reports and evaluations of climate change strategies, programmes and action plans publicly available and current? \u2022 Has the Supreme Audit Institution published any report on \u201cenvironmental and/or climate change policy performance\u201d? \u2022 Are budget execution reports on climate change programmes made available (if any) and variation between plans and execution explained? \u2022 How useful is such information for CSOs and other accountability institutions?

Potential challenges \u2022 Lack of information publicly available 6 3 Climate Public Expenditure Analysis This section outlines some of the required steps in order to identify and estimate how much the government is spending on climate change related activities. It starts with the data collection and deciding whether the expenditure items are climate relevant (answering the question \u201cIs the expenditure climate change related?\u201d). After excluding the non-climate change related expenditures from the analysis, the next step is to classify the climate related expenditures. There are two approaches that this Guidebook recommends, namely: i) Standardised UNDP/World Bank CPEIR Typology and ii) National Policy Objectives Typology. The data can, in addition, be grouped in accordance with key climate change topics such as mitigation and adaptation. Once climate related expenditures are classified, the proportion of the expenditures that is related to climate change can be assessed by applying the weight of climate relevance to these expenditures. This Guidebook outlines two approaches in applying the weight: i) Approach 1 \u2013 CPEIR Climate Relevance Index and ii) Approach 2 \u2013 CPEIR Benefit Cost Ratio. These two approaches are not mutually exclusive and the decision of which one to use would depend on the level of data available for the analysis. Following the application of climate relevance weighting, a pro-poor and gender sensitive CPEIR would also apply the poverty and gender weightings to these expenditures. Figure 4 provides a schematic overview of these steps. Figure 4: Schematic Overview of Climate Public Expenditure Analysis We also recommend that the CPEIR identify and analyse other types of expenditures and investments that might have climate change implications and are not yet included in the climate public expenditure analysis above, including: \u201cnegative\u201d expenditures, fiscal instruments (tax, tax breaks, subsidies), SOE and PPP investments.

Currently there is no agreed international functional classification of climate change related expenditure. This creates significant challenges for data collection and classification for CPEIR analysis. At the country level, there is usually no marker for climate change in the budget, although some countries like Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines have started to develop such mechanisms. However, many developing countries are currently implementing fundamental public finance management reforms, strengthening the financial administration system. Modifying budget classifications and Chart of Accounts to incorporate climate change can be a risk to these reform efforts. Further, in the absence of a common classification, comparisons across time and/or between countries are limited, which may pose difficulties to assess trends and limit opportunities to learn from other countries\u2019 experiences. To address these issues, this Guidebook proposes tools to guide data collection and classifications of expenditure data, enabling trends analysis and cross-country comparisons, using either a standardised UNDP/World Bank CPEIR Typology and/or a National CPEIR Typology.

It is important that budget line activities are identified in addition to administrative structures. However, if time and resources do not permit such comprehensive reviews, some pointers that may be considered to reduce the workload include: (i) identifying key sectors/ministries/ administrative responsibilities; (ii) identifying non-budgetary funds from key sectors ; (iii) identifying climate related codes from the administrative and/or the functional classification of the budget. CPEIR Typology for Data Classification Standardised UNDP/WB Typology One of the tools for climate expenditure data classification is a standard typology, derived from the jointly UNDP/World Bank supported CPEIR in Viet Nam. As described in the table below, the typology has three pillars classifying all policy actions and allocated resources: Policy & Governance (PG); Scientific, Technological and Societal Capacity (ST), and Climate Change Delivery (CCD). It also has three levels of classifications, capable of analysing enabling activities (such as capacity building) as well as delivery of specific sectoral programmes. Also, the typology 12 The MTEF Description is intended to explain the level of development and use of MTEF as part of the budget cycle. 27 uNDERTAkING CPEIR ANALySIS provides a sufficiently detailed framework for classifying all types of expenditures (recurrent/ capital, taxes/subsidies or mitigation/adaptation) and by sources (domestic and foreign). Through this detailed framework, the typology allows comparability over time and across countries. If a country\u2019 policy objectives change overtime, it should be reflected in shifting allocations. If a country\u2019s institutional setup changes but not its policies, the impact on the trends of resource allocation can be monitored.

This would ensure comparability overtime and across countries, within reasonable margins of errors; i.e. trends are sufficiently clear to allow for making analysis and taking decisions (for example, how to report water projects implemented by local governments or the construction of an embankment by the ministry of environment). National Policy Objectives Typology As in the case of Viet Nam\u2019s CPEIR, another approach was used to classify climate relevant expenditures which is to assess national climate change policy priorities against the state budget. The national policy priorities are most likely based on the strategic areas and themes for actions from government\u2019s climate change strategies and action plans. For example, in Viet Nam\u2019s CPEIR, the main references to the government\u2019s key strategic priority programmes are included in the National Climate Change Strategy, National Climate Change Action Plan and Viet Nam Green Growth Strategy (see Figure 5). Meanwhile, in Bangladesh, the key six themes of the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP 2009) were used to define the national policy priorities for addressing climate change.

Linking spending and policy objectives provides the insights into the distribution of resources across these policy objectives, at national and sub-national levels and helps identify gaps between resource allocations and policy objectives if any. VCCS and VGGS POLICY 30 uNDERTAkING CPEIR ANALySIS 6 3 2 Weighting Climate, Poverty and Gender Relevance Following data classification, in order to quantify climate relevant expenditures, the next step of climate relevant expenditure analysis is to identify and applying the weighting of relevance to climate change of these policies and programmes. The relevance to climate change of policies and programmes depends on the responsiveness to the estimated current and potential impacts of climate change on different population groups (the poor, vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, women and children), different geographic areas and different institutional capabilities to deliver services. Some programmes are wholly relevant, such as those developing climate change adaptation and mitigation policies or researching the impact of climate change. However, some programmes that address the development gap and already existing climate challenges may only provide additional benefits under climate change circumstances. To appreciate how resources are dedicated to policies and programmes responsive to the impact of climate change, it is thus useful to weight the allocation and expenditure data collected. The CPEIR lessons learnt paper13 and the Climate Responsive Budgeting Workshop14 have highlighted the need to define relevance in terms of responsiveness of policies and their programmes to the vulnerability of people and areas to climate change.

Mukherjee, Consultant, Climate Change, Gender and Poverty, UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Centre, Bangkok, October 21, 2014 31 uNDERTAkING CPEIR ANALySIS For the purpose of providing a weighting for allocations and expenditures, a clear decision needs to be made with regard to such questions as: Can addressing the development gap be distinguished from climate change impact adaptation? What is the additional benefit of the expenditure should climate change impact realise itself? Is the additional benefit of providing adaptation for vulnerable areas and groups the same in all regions and over time? Answering those questions requires detailed information and analysis that may not always be possible. This Guidebook proposes two weighting tools that reflect the different levels of data availability to the CPEIR team, namely: i) CPEIR Climate Relevance Index (if data is limited \u2013 Tier 1) and ii) Benefit Costs Ratio (if necessary data is available \u2013 Tier 2). These tools are not mutually exclusive but rather should be seen as a complementary: option 1 allows for a first rapid assessment, while option 2 requires more information and provides an economic assessment of the benefits associated with a specific programme. In both cases, as the CPEIR is a process that supports national stakeholders\u2019 capacity to formulate their needs and design their policy response, it is important to engage with the beneficiaries and stakeholders to validate the analysis. Approach 1 \u2013 CPEIR Climate Relevance Index The weighting method has been implemented in a number of previous CPEIRs, taking the form of a relevance index, from low to very high.18 In such cases, the CPEIR team, working with national counterparts in the administration and other stakeholders, mapped the declared objectives of the programmes and expenditures against the Rio Markers Methodology developed by the OECD and assessed the relevance on a scale of 0 \u2013 100%. All activities were then grouped into the four categories listed in the Table 3, with the corresponding weights then applied to the programme/policy expenditures in order to quantify the climate-relevant expenditures.

It reconciles the climate impact analysis and the climate relevance analysis by analysing the benefits when climate change impacts materialise compared to the situation without climate change. It provides a rational approach that will help to avoid \u201cgreen washing\u201d programmes whose objectives are climate related without delivering climate benefits. In that sense, it is capable of identifying the \u201cadditional\u201d climate change component of a programme on more objective grounds (compared to subjective judgement by CPEIR analysts in the CPEIR Climate Relevance Index method). 33 uNDERTAkING CPEIR ANALySIS Figure 6 visualises the analysis of benefits in situations \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d climate change impacts. The transparent and green areas represent the benefits of investing19 public resources. Further explanation of the methodology is provided in Annex IV. Figure 6: Benefit Cost Ratio Approach Three countries (Cambodia, Thailand and Indonesia) have undertaken this methodology. In all of these countries, the analysis used national evidence, wherever possible, supplemented by international studies. For all the countries, the benefits analysis supported public finance reform initiatives that aim to improve the evidence base of policy formulation and introduce results based management (see Box 4 for more information). This approach might not always be feasible however. Limited availability and reliability of data, the complexity of the analysis and national capacity might constrain a rigorous benefit cost ratio analysis. To address this issue, a less quantitative approach has been experimented. This method relies on experts\u2019 estimation of climate benefits (compared with economic, social and environmental benefits) of activities under \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout climate change\u201d scenarios instead of vigorous cost benefit analyses. Experts can be government officers from central and line ministries and other agencies. Once the climate and other benefits are estimated under these two scenarios, the climate change relevance formula can be similarly applied as above. This approach benefits from the participation and contribution of key stakeholders, is less time consuming and encourages government officers to consider climate impacts and climate risks into policy and activity formulation. This approach, unlike the BCR approach however, does not entirely eliminate the risks of inflating climate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "857d21bb-165f-4393-a723-ae3b93d1daf1": {"__data__": {"id_": "857d21bb-165f-4393-a723-ae3b93d1daf1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Methodological Guidebook: Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7fae8a6e3ac33aacab3e81eafa25453aeca63efbd7b1767f57fafe447576d02c"}}, "hash": "7fae8a6e3ac33aacab3e81eafa25453aeca63efbd7b1767f57fafe447576d02c", "text": "relevance given that the benefits are subjectively estimated. Therefore, clear guidance on how to score relative benefits is required to avoid overestimation of climate change benefits, compared with economic, social and environmental co-benefits. Expert opinions should also be complemented by other international and technical studies such as the IPCC and other regional/national assessments. The use of climate change relevance yardsticks would also help guide the estimation of climate benefits. More information on the recommended yardsticks and default values is available in Annexes IV and V. 19 Investing public resources can be done in any type of programme or tax incentives and subsidies, it is not tied to capital expenditures.

Identify a \u201crational\u201d proportion of climate change expenditure in a programme 2. Will be increasingly documented with new CPEIRs In Cambodia, the analysis was undertaken mainly by a Cambodian expert with experience in financial and economic appraisal. The working groups in line ministries were aware of the analysis and were consulted, but it was not possible to build much capacity. The primary role of the work was: a) to promote understanding of how climate change affects public expenditure; b) to illustrate how such analysis might be done; c) to show how it could be used to help refine the design of the programmes; and d) to draw attention to the potential benefits of wider public expenditure. In Indonesia, benefits were estimated both as part of the Mitigation Fiscal Framework (MFF) and the Green Planning and Budgeting Strategy (GPB). In the MFF, the work was done mainly by consultants and relied on conventional CBA. In the GPB Strategy, the analysis used a structured qualitative approach, in which the magnitude of each of the 5 green benefits (i.e. mitigation, adaptation, long term economic, social equity and environment) was estimated by an inter-ministerial group of experts using the following guidelines: 0.2 = marginal benefit; 0.5=significant benefit that affects whether the intervention should be accepted; 1.0=main benefit, but still relying on other benefits for acceptance; 1.5=large enough benefit to justify the expenditure without other benefits. In the MFF, the analysis of benefits resulted in an estimate of the Marginal Abatement Cost, which made it possible to estimate the extent to which existing expenditure allowed government to meet emission targets. In the GPB Strategy, the main role of the analysis was to assess the extent to which expenditure scenarios would reduce the damage expected from climate change and natural resource degradation. In Thailand, the work was undertaken in partnership with departments of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC). Five case studies were analysed using conventional CBA. The work aimed to encourage greater clarity on the nature and extent of the climate change impact on MOAC activities, in order to help with the refinement of design. It also aimed to build confidence in the Bureau of Budget that MOAC were responding to climate change and were able to demonstrate how it increases the returns from MOAC expenditure. The experience in the three countries demonstrated that, even in relatively sophisticated middle income countries, the ability to undertake benefits is limited to a relatively small cadre of planning officials. None of the countries have guidelines for policy appraisal and there are no existing procedures that can be adapted to incorporate the implications of climate change. The central economic ministries (i.e. of finance and planning) in Cambodia and Thailand are cautious about the value of this work, but have become more interested as the potential is illustrated. Nevertheless, it is likely to take five to ten years before policy appraisal guidelines are introduced to require the precise definition of benefits and the estimation of these benefits", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ed07ec3-f788-45f6-8426-0c49a9618efb": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ed07ec3-f788-45f6-8426-0c49a9618efb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Methodological Guidebook: Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71877025cffac0f33ccca7d83593c39fd7d5cd816287c39da39fbea9a233ddd1"}, "3": {"node_id": "9d500814-438d-4e03-b5fd-aede7a1a3545", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f28a4127a728f4b85d1a84a805c66601e144cfe1a01e79d6404caf0c46e1c03"}}, "hash": "054311b4ab2b080b8ff2dbdccc2c24da02deeb3ed19377f6621acc803a4ca7bd", "text": "and of the ways in which climate change affects the benefits. 35 uNDERTAkING CPEIR ANALySIS Poverty and Gender Weightings on Climate Relevant Expenditures A pro-poor and gender-sensitive CPEIR would also apply poverty and gender weightings to the climate relevant expenditures. The triple weightings (poverty, gender and climate) will be a powerful tool in identifying the type of spending which targets the poor and vulnerable in tackling climate change impacts. In some cases, the governments might have already applied poverty and gender weightings to their expenditures. In some other cases where government\u2019s gender and poverty weightings are not yet available, the CPEIR team is recommended to apply those weightings in tandem with the climate relevance weightings. An example of the triple weightings in Bangladesh can be found in Annex VI. 6 3 3 Key Aspects of Climate Expenditure Data Analysis Following the quantification of climate relevant expenditures by applying the weightings to climate relevant expenditures, the CPEIR will be able to produce detailed data analyses, including the following (but not limited to): 1. Total Government Budget Allocations and Outturns: a. By Types of Expenditures: Recurrent vs. Capital b. By Source: Domestic vs. External 2. Total Climate Relevant Expenditures: a. By Types of Expenditures: Recurrent vs. Capital b. By Source: Domestic vs. External c. By CPEIR Typology: Policy & Governance (PG); Scientific, Technological and Societal Capacity (ST), and Climate Change Delivery (CCD) d. By Levels of Relevance (depending on which weighting methods used) e. By Ministries: ministries with most allocations 3. Proportional Analysis: a. Climate relevant expenditures as a proportion to total government budgets/expenditures b. Climate relevant expenditures as a proportion to GDP These key data analyses would constitute the minimum aspects of a CPEIR\u2019s climate expenditure analysis, enabling cross-country comparisons. As such, UNDP\u2019s CPEIR Database currently captures these data analyses across different countries that have implemented CPEIRs. UNDP invites all future CPEIRs to contribute their data to the Database for richer cross-country comparisons and more learning between countries. Link to the CPEIR Database can be found here: http:// climatefinance-developmenteffectiveness.org/. 6 3 4 \u201cNegative\u201d programmes and expenditures Description: The climate relevant expenditures analysis described above captures the programmes and policies that have climate benefits to the poor and vulnerable, contributing positively to the national climate change response, both in mitigation and adaptation. Depending on the scope of the CPEIR agreed with the host government, the CPEIR should also identify and highlight expenditures that have negative consequences to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts (referred to as \u201cnegative expenditures\u201d in this Guidebook). \u201cNegative\u201d expenditures20 could include fossil fuels subsidies or development programmes that involve deforestation, or carbon lock-in such as building a coal power plant. 20 For a detailed list of positive and negative fiscal and regulatory instruments that impact climate change related behaviour, please refer to the Climate Change Public Expenditure and Institutional Review Sourcebook published by the World Bank (pp.35\u201336). 36 uNDERTAkING CPEIR ANALySIS Questions to be addressed \u2022 Which programmes and policies might contribute to increasing GHG emissions or reducing carbon sinks, for example by way of incentivising more use of fossil fuels or not creating a levelled-playing field for renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies? \u2022 Which programmes and policies might hinder adaptation efforts or have adverse impacts on climate resilience of communities (such as infrastructure projects, deforestation activities)?

They are becoming an increasingly significant way to finance large-scale infrastructure. It may be useful to ensure that appraisal guidelines and scoring system do include climate relevant mitigation and adaptation (or co-benefits), as it can become a source of learning in addition to being beneficial investment. SOEs may represent a large share of the public sector, whose investments are mostly in sectors highly relevant to climate change (such as energy, mining, water resource management, forestry etc.). Therefore, the CPEIR should also include a review of SOEs and PPPs climate-relevant investments, especially in the main sectors of interest in terms of climate change issues: energy, water, transport and waste. Questions to be addressed \u2022 Does the oversight exercised by the State on PPPs and SOEs include an oversight of the impact on climate change (mitigation) and of programmes to address climate change (adaptation)? \u2022 Are there specific policies and guidelines with regards to integrating climate change mitigation and adaptation principles into the PPPs and SOEs investments? \u2022 Do the investment programmes have a climate change impact assessment?21 \u2022 Is the procurement system applicable for PPPs and to SOEs climate sensitive?

It also seeks to integrate the role of stakeholders impacted by climate change and those engaging in economic opportunities in green growth. The questions below are indicative to help structure a summary assessment that weaves together the key findings as well as the patterns and trends analyses in the CPEIR: i) Is the data and qualitative information on predicted impact of climate change, particularly on the poor and vulnerable, informing the articulation of climate change policy within and across sectors? ii) Are these policies and their instruments costed? iii) Has the costing been reconciled through an iterative process with the fiscal framework and potential climate finance (based on current commitments, pledges and scenarios)? iv) Are the policies and their implementing instruments leading to resources allocation in the budget as per costing?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe56adc4-524d-406b-b34d-551067dc4b05": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe56adc4-524d-406b-b34d-551067dc4b05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Methodological Guidebook: Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4e950b9b090b407e05c52d9ee080a94f134447cf9185a68e65dc59fb91ee6c0"}, "2": {"node_id": "32d70f46-4f65-403a-a403-e7a123dd9da3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be6b5add2b73814f484d4d3c964b1869b0bd72a844d0b956bea3e34914a36b3a"}}, "hash": "8125d97fd09c1622acd6e65accdd3ef1a22fd08640f3eef9534c272de6333e08", "text": "(Pillar 1) v) Is there a clear set of objectives and targets that can be translated into a monitoring framework? vi) Have policies and their instruments been developed with due consultation with stakeholders, and are there patterns or trends emerging in their uptake by economic agents? vii) Does the administration have the necessary capacity to implement its programmes and enforce its regulations? viii) Is the monitoring information published, submitted to Parliament, and made available to the Public? ix)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da4ecbc6-a257-49d2-a00e-dd90e057b7f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "da4ecbc6-a257-49d2-a00e-dd90e057b7f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Methodological Guidebook: Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4053007d4320c87cdeff0be21768f87125990170c951417b0b7d3a35aa7bec17"}, "3": {"node_id": "64581246-02cb-42b3-aeac-bdceeff88615", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "70564b5a1ff9d2d528cb006b8a45e93a2b6595b10e345c2e963e7ecf0dfba0c8"}}, "hash": "0a0cb30d399783cace16ba0ef7ef5e2cc52d14cf20adf03ddf24363ebd2caca9", "text": "Is there evidence or are trends linking the availability of information for policy making and policy change? x) Are the Accountability Institutions playing a role with regards to climate change and do they have the necessary information to do so? The summary assessment should provide a summary of the key findings, referring the reader to the details in the review and to the annex aggregating all findings. The summary assessment should present a synopsis of the main recommendations. A section should be dedicated to explain the process for initiating and carrying out the CPEIR, referring in annex to the list of documents, data and website consulted and obtained and persons met. One annex should provide an explanation of how relevance and how weighting were performed on budget allocations and expenditure data. The process should include a description of the oversight or steering mechanism instituted. If recommendations are provided, the section explains how they were discussed with the stakeholders, and if necessary an annex should highlight the different views and perspectives on them. Recommendations: In some cases, as in a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report, the CPEIR is intended to facilitate a capacity development process whereby national authorities and stakeholders engage in domestic policy dialogue and policy-budget decisions over how to use the CPEIR findings and to address possible weaknesses. In such cases, the CPEIR might not provide recommendations and remain a basis for common references to support broad stakeholders\u2019 engagement in the policy cycle and resources allocation. 39 uNDERTAkING CPEIR ANALySIS In other cases, the CPEIR is expected to provide recommendations. The recommendations should be specific to the CPEIR findings based on the country context. Based on previous CPEIRs, the recommendations coming from the CPEIR analysis generally fall into the following broad options: i) Enabling coding or tagging of climate change items in the national budget systems: Tagging is a budget tool, consisting of adding a marker to a budget code (allocations). It can thus be used to identify climate change related financing in a country\u2019s budget. This, however, does not apply to the chart of account (expenditure). Tags can also be helpful in monitoring trends in allocations. ii) Implementing a climate fiscal framework or climate financing framework: A framework to ensure effective use of domestic and international climate finance within the national budget process. It identifies the demand (costed plan and projection of expenditures) and supply (funds, fiscal policies/green banking) of national climate finance as well as forecasts future climate financing needs for the country. For example, Bangladesh adopted a Climate Fiscal Framework following the CPEIR. iii) Strengthening capacity for institutions where gaps are identified. 40 FuRThER RESOuRCES 7 Further Resources The Guidebook aims to provide basic information for countries and CPEIR practitioners to undertake a CPEIR analysis based on previous experience and by no means is intended to cover all methodologies and analytical tools available.

These pilot studies served as a first adaptation of the public expenditure review methodology to the cross-cutting theme of climate change. The first CPEIRs and related knowledge products demonstrated the usefulness of the approach, increased demand for CPEIRs in other countries, and provided methodological guidance for countries and teams in undertaking such reviews. In 2014, with nineteen (19) CPEIRs or similar studies executed, a second CPEIR Lessons Learnt paper was developed and led to an Updated Methodology for CPEIR. It aims at proposing a common frame for ensuring that all CPEIRs take a similar methodological approach in defining their scope and how to carry out the data collection and analysis. CPEIRs are based upon a public expenditure review principle. As such they should allow verifying how climate change policies and their programmes are implemented through the budget process. CPEIRs seek to assess opportunities and constraints for integrating climate change concerns within the national (and sub-national) budget allocation and expenditure process, eliciting better responses to its estimated impact.

It does also provide a common reference/baseline for decision makers and development partners to assess how best to provide climate finance in support of national programmes and local programmes if requested. CPEIRs also aim at clarifying how responsive policies and their programmes are for reducing poverty related to climate change vulnerability (in terms of people, institutions and areas), and providing new economic opportunities. CPEIRs are effective tools and processes in support of policymaking and transmission. It is important to underline that undertaking a CPEIR exercise requires the participation of a broad variety of stakeholders, including officials in the ministries, local authorities, CSOs and private sector organisations. Leading a CPEIR therefore implies anticipating and allowing sufficient time for each institution to prepare itself, collect information, review the reports and effectively participate to the validation. Objectives <This section must describe what the primary objective of the CPEIR is. This will depend on a country\u2019s current climate change related policies development. A CPEIR may contribute to help a government understand the scope of its climate change related expenditures and how they impact adaptation and mitigation.> 45 ANNEx I \u2013 TEMPLATE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR ThE CPEIR <In other settings, where policies are well defined, a CPEIR will seek to review the responsiveness of policies to the climate change impact and how well are they translated into the budget and other policy instruments as laws and regulations. It is important that objective define how a CPEIR is intended to be used by development partners and how it will be used for capacity development purposes.> Scope <The Updated Methodology for CPEIR defines a number of options with regards to the scope of a CPEIR and to the data available to perform the analysis. This needs to be carefully analysed and discussed. Ideally, decisions on the objectives and the scope will have been agreed at a concept stage between the government and its partners.> <Please indicate if the CPEIR should be focusing on the central level only or is also carried out at decentralised level.> Key Activities <In this section the TORs should describe the key activities that are requires for the CPEIR to be a process in support on policy dialogue and developing a common understanding.> The scope of the CPEIR defined above will be the basis for defining the activities. The details of this activity planning, organisation and sequencing should be left to the CPEIR team and planned in the inception report. Inception report: Containing the team\u2019s understanding of the CPEIR, detailed activity planning, data and documentary request (exception of data and documentation made available with TORs, and web available) Capacity building workshop: A one to two day capacity building workshop will be organised by the assessment team for officials, at least two weeks before the field mission. The main purpose of the workshop is to enable the government officials to fully understand the methodology, data and documentation requirement. The workshop will also allow the assessment team to obtain reference documents, information and knowledge regarding current climate change policies, budgetary processes and establish a list of interviewees. Preparation for data collection/field phase: In addition to the capacity building workshop, the team will coordinate with relevant stakeholders to make available all basic documentation necessary and start with securing the initial meetings for the field phase. The CPEIR team will have begun with the initial desktop analysis of information publically available. The experts should inform the Steering Committee of any need for additional information. It will submit to the Steering Committee a finalised work plan describing the main steps of the field mission, notably specifying the list of interlocutors to meet and the tentatively scheduled meetings and the list or required information not yet collected and to be provided on the spot.

The report will consist of a high level synthesis and the detailed analysis. The outline of the report should be agreed with the Steering Committee by the end of the field mission. Dissemination workshop: The CPEIR team will organise and conduct a dissemination workshop under the auspice of the Steering Committee. The primary objective of this final workshop is the discussion of findings (and recommendations if applicable) of the CPEIR report, and their validation. The dissemination workshop should allow a broad discussion with all stakeholders, including sub-national governments, civil society and private sector. It may require a double workshop first allowing a government/team interaction and then a broader workshop. The final will reflect comments and how these were integrated (specific annex to the report).

It should indicate if Vulnerability Assessments are available and if a policy response exists (web links in foot notes are useful). > State Structure, Decentralisation and Fiscal relations <This section should provide a short description of how the State is organized and what is the level of decentralisation. It should draw on existing studies (list them in annex) such as the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountabilities that describe the fiscal relationships between the central and sub- national government levels. If the CPEIR intends to review both central and sub-national levels the description should be more detailed. If that is not possible, then the scope and tasks should include an analysis of the structure of the State and the fiscal relations. The suggestion is to compile a profile as described in the PEFA guidelines for sub-national government assessments: \u2022 the overall sub-national government structure \u2022 the main functional responsibilities of the sub-national government \u2022 key sub-national budgetary systems \u2022 key sub-national fiscal systems \u2022 the main sub-national institutional (political, administrative, and fiscal) structures.

This approach is new and has not been tested. As such the steps suggested should be tested and the present note updated with additional guidance and experience. Making the link to vulnerability assessments should allow for integrating poverty and gender imbalances concerns into CPEIRs, providing a practical methodology to analyse policies and programmes responsiveness to these vulnerabilities, and initiate a dialogue. Indeed, the analysis of vulnerability assessments will underline the relevance of climate action, based on the context and the beneficiaries/stakeholders perception in the following terms: \u2022 The responsiveness of policies and programmes to the estimated current and potential impact of climate change on vulnerable areas, poor people and vulnerable groups \u2022 The responsiveness of policies and programmes to the special needs for climate proofing and adaptation for vulnerable areas \u2022 The responsiveness of policies and programmes to the vulnerable groups; either as exposed to the impact of climate change either as groups already vulnerable and whose inclusion in a growing and prosperous society through development is at risk due to the impact of climate change \u2022 The responsiveness of policies and programmes to the economic threats and needs expressed by the professional associations and private sector at large, and to the opportunities for green growth. In this context, CPEIR should use Vulnerability Assessments to: 1. Clarify the contribution of public action to resilience, through: a. The screening of policies and plans with a specific focus on climate change response. b. The screening of climate relevant action in a developmental approach. 2. Identify policy gaps where the recommendations from the Vulnerability Assessment were not yet taken into account by plans and programmes. 3. Undertake a cost gap analysis, to inform on needs for funds to address vulnerability to climate change. 4. Identify the benefits of responses to vulnerability. 51 ANNEx II \u2013 VuLNERABILITy ASSESSMENTS What are Vulnerability Assessments? Vulnerability to climate change is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity (McCarthy et al., 2001, IPCC). Vulnerability is therefore dynamic and depends on the response that is given to exposure to risk. Figure 7: Risk, Response, Impact Framework of Vulnerability Assessment Vulnerability Assessments (VA) are commissioned to understand the degree to which a system is subject to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Such a study usually includes the socio-economic and ecologic context, the potential hazards and the current level of preparation to these hazards (i.e. a capacity analysis). These lead to a categorization of areas by type of vulnerability, the identification of causes and effects of vulnerability, and the establishment of levels of priority among these types and areas. Due to the dynamics of vulnerability, the assessment focuses on a temporal reference, which usually includes its current vulnerability and the foreseeable future. From these elements, Vulnerability Assessments provide a basis for formulating measures or projects that will minimize or avoid climate risks.22 Other initiatives such as the Tracking Adaptation and Measuring Development (TAMD) framework assess whether climate change adaptation leads to effective development and also how development interventions can boost communities\u2019 capacity to adapt to climate change. 23 This underlines the need to consider adaptation success as a combination of: 1) how widely and how well countries or institutions manage climate risks, but also 2) how successful adaptation interventions are in reducing climate change vulnerability and in keeping development on course. 22 Comparative analysis of climate change vulnerability assessments, March 2013, GIZ 23 \u201cTracking Adaptation and Measuring Development: a framework for assessing climate adaptation and development effects\u201d, International Institute for Environment and Development IIED, 2012.

CPEIR may verify to which extent policies do take into account the vulnerability analysis and the recommendations for action, and thus test their responsiveness. This can be done for policies with a climate change focus or a development focus, and lead to the following results. 1 Underline the contribution of public action to resilience.

These may include: climate change action plans, dedicated climate change programmes within sector programmes (e.g. agriculture, forestry, fisheries, water management), disaster risk reduction plans, projects originating from NAPAs, other climate change related projects. In this approach, the analysis seeks to determine responsiveness and which component is responsiveness to use this data for weighting allocations and expenditures. b Screening of climate relevant action in a developmental approach: There is also a need to verify if the issues raised in the Vulnerability Analysis are covered by policies and programmes that have a developmental focus, as they also may contribute to increasing resilience to climate change. This verification should also include the general development strategies and plans that were designed at sub-national level. In that case, the analysis seeks to identify the additional benefit of those programmes when climate change happens, and should be considered under the Benefit Cost Ratio approached. 2 Identify policy gaps. CPEIR may identify gaps where the recommendations from the Vulnerability Assessment were not yet taken into account by plans and programmes. It is important to clarify why such gaps remain, so as to identify potential recommendations at institutional level. 3 Identify the benefits of responses to vulnerability: Should the costs of a specific vulnerability be identified based on past events, and there has been a response to this vulnerability in the programme, the estimated reduced damages should be counted as future benefits. 53 ANNEx III \u2013 CLIMATE RISk IMPACT ASSESSMENTS ON GENDER AND POVERTy Annex III \u2013 Climate Risk Impact Assessments on Gender and Poverty Table 5: Climate Risk Impact Assessment on Gender and Poverty24 Category of Risk Description of Risk Gender Impact Poverty Impact Supply Risk Supply interruption; decreased access (food, water, public goods) Exacerbates existing gender disparity in basic needs Reduces access to basic needs in the absence of social protection Market Risk Demand and price increase; food and livelihood insecurity Increases gender inequity in basic needs Reduces purchasing power, requires coping mechanisms Operating Risk Loss of assets including shelter and livestock Widens gender-based asset ownership gap Pushes marginal households below poverty, deepens existing disparities Recovery Risk Impaired ability to recover asset losses after climate change related shocks Skews asset ownership towards men; time cost of rebuilding asset base higher for women Reduces chances of moving out of poverty; change in occupation with lower skill and reduced wages Socio-political Risk Adverse health and human development outcomes; Migration; Resource-related conflict; social disruption Disproportionate impact of vector borne diseases on women and children; increase in female-headed households; bears the brunt of physical and social violence Impoverishment due to increased healthcare cost; loss of livelihood; low skilled migration leads to deepening of poverty; loss of productive years due to conflict Domestic/Time Burden Risk Increased burden of unpaid work and time use for natural resource based livelihoods Burden of unpaid and care work falls exclusively on women; reduced years of schooling for girl child; lower human development outcomes for girls Less opportunity for productive work, especially for women; low returns to human development implies entrenched cycle of poverty Participant Risk Lack of financial stability; reduced credit worthiness; inadequate administrative and technical capacity Increased gender bias in economic opportunity; institutions do not address gender inequities Increased economic inequality; inadequate social protection mechanisms leads to socio- economic exclusion Source: uNDP (2011), Ensuring Gender Equity in Climate Change Financing; Methodology adapted from Hart, C.

The CCFFs in Cambodia and Indonesia, and the work in Thailand, have based the definition of climate change percentage (CC%) on the extent to which the benefits from the action are affected by climate change. This is done by estimating the benefits of an action both with and without climate change and comparing these benefits, as follows26 \u2026 (Note: Climate Change percentage is CC%) CC% = (B \u2013 A) / B Where A = the benefits that would be generated by the action, if there was no CC B = the benefits that would be generated with CC The benefits from an action are those conventionally recognised in national planning and include: economic benefits (e.g. incomes, assets \u2026), social benefits (e.g. education, health, welfare, gender \u2026) and environmental benefits (e.g. biodiversity, reduced pollution \u2026). For major investments, the benefits may be estimated as part of an economic analysis (e.g. rates of return for irrigation, roads, new crop varieties, energy investments \u2026). For other actions, they may be defined as outcomes27 in logical frameworks, with associated indicators (e.g. people protected from floods, hectares of forest planted, number of households\u2026). For mitigation, the benefits without climate change should exclude the value of carbon emissions, since there is no value in reducing emission if they do not lead to climate change. For adaptation, the most common way in which climate change affects benefits is to increase the value of any protection from extreme events and variable rainfall. There are also other important impacts, notably of temperature on agriculture and health. But the evidence on trends in total rainfall is less clear and is not easy to use for adaptation planning. 25 In Approach 2, they may include elements of subjectivity due to criteria definition, the sampling of regions and beneficiary groups and their perceptions. 26 It would equally be possible to define CC% as (B-A)/A, in which case it would give the % increase in benefits. This is intuitively simpler in some cases, but will give a value of infinity for those actions that are dedicated to climate change and for which A=0. 27 In logframe terminology, outcomes refer to the results that provide benefits and are clearly affected by the action. They are a level above outputs (which are largely within the control of the activity but which do not have any value unless they lead to outcomes) and a level below impact (which refer to the wider benefits and which are influenced by a wide range of factors. 55 ANNEx IV \u2013 BENEFIT COST RATIO APPROACh TO WEIGhTING CLIMATE RELEVANCE Where possible, the benefits with and without climate change should be estimated quantitatively.28 In some cases, reliable evidence on the absolute value of A will not be available. However, it may still be possible to estimate the proportional increase from A to B. For example, if climate change has an impact on biodiversity, it may be impossible to give an estimate of the market value of this change, but case studies may provide evidence on proportional changes in indices of species diversity. Yardsticks and Default Values The BCR approach might not always be feasible. Some general yardsticks and default values can be helpful in this process. These include the following. \u2022 SREX29 Rule. Benefits from avoiding or reducing the impact of dry spells, droughts or floods will become twice as valuable by 2050. \u2022 Temperature. This has variable impact for agriculture and health. \u2022 Rainfall trend. Rainfall trends are often difficult to project and it may not be possible to define any yardsticks in many countries. The analysis of benefits should lead to a more robust table of default CC%s for different types of expenditure. These should be subject to revision wherever more detailed evidence is available and, especially, for larger investment spending. The tables used in the Cambodia CCFF is presented below.

For some activity, 100% of the allocation and expenditures are dedicated to climate change (programme wholly dedicated to climate change whose benefits will occur with climate change; e.g. policy making, international climate finance). For the other activities a type is defined. Below are simple explanations on the calculation made by type. 1. Type A: Additional benefits of the allocation are wholly associated with climate variability. It is assumed to double by 2050, increasing in a straight line from now. 2. Type C: Some benefits are affected by climate variability (x), while some are not. If x is 100% of benefits, CC% = 33%; if x is 25% of benefits, CC% is 11% The transparent rectangle represents the benefits over the period considered if there was no climate change. The green triangle represents the additional benefits over that period (considering as IPPC does that the return period of extreme events will be divided by 2 at horizon 2050 and this change is linear), which double. As such the additional benefits are equal to the area covered by the green triangle, which is half of the area of the transparent rectangle. Additional benefits with CC is equal thus equal to 33% of total benefits and 33% is the weight to be used. Should climate proofing be added, it can be argued that the costs of rehabilitation/ livelihood relief avoided is another additional benefit. Figure 8: Illustration of additional benefits with climate change for type A and C 3. Type B: Concerns mitigation. In this case the value of reduced GHG emissions is taken as 5\u201310% of the value of energy generated/saved. This is based on the value of the carbon dioxide content in fuel or electricity, compared with the economic value of fuel or electricity. As shown in the yardstick guidance of annex IV, table 6, 10% of the benefits from electricity efficiency come from mitigation, based on the carbon content of coal fired power, using the social cost of carbon while 2% of the benefits from fuel efficiency come from mitigation, based on the carbon content of fuel, using the social cost of carbon.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43e8686c-a798-458f-bf3d-4f8cf8843d48": {"__data__": {"id_": "43e8686c-a798-458f-bf3d-4f8cf8843d48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Methodological Guidebook: Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "413c7708f5bce70dadbcab64f53a6f4846f25823450c990a41777e3e1f3d0c28"}, "2": {"node_id": "be150583-2a97-469f-9a1c-8e257b1ec989", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/methodological-guidebook-climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "619ec24e683eb5b5627f89b4dad245e98f79d5f51cdc1df9e5daf08c57905d2d"}}, "hash": "8538967d67ca5c2e2aeff73d16d3009acff0ad99bc5fe0222099a2d8a79b0dfa", "text": "Additional Benefits with Climate Change Benefits without Climate Change: the investment of public resources produces benefits over the period Period considered in 2012 SREX IPPC report: 2012-2050 As the return period of extreme events is divided by 2, there is doubling of benefits 59 ANNEx V \u2013 CALCuLATED RATIOS 4.

Participants were encouraged to explore how NHRIs can strengthen engagement on LGBTI human rights issues through research, education, promotion, dialogue, law reform, monitoring, advocacy and cooperation. The workshop aims to review progress in implementing the 2010 recommendations made by the ACJ and APF in these areas.

It also feeds into Phase 2 of the \u2018Being LGBT in Asia\u2019 project launched in February 2015, which is an initiative of UNDP, the Embassy of Sweden in Bangkok and the USAID in partnership with LGBTI civil society organizations. As official and independent bodies, NHRIs have a legal mandate to promote and protect human rights, and to act to influence laws, policies, practices and attitudes including in relation to the human rights of LGBTI people. In this work, strategic partnerships with LGBTI people and their organizations, religious leaders, law enforcement agencies, lawmakers, judges and UN agencies are critical. In 2009, APF held a workshop in Yogyakarta hosted by the Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights. The 2009 workshop was convened in response to the recommendations of the Yogyakarta Principles agreed in 2006. The 2009 workshop\u2019s communiqu\u00e9 provided an important resource to direct the work of the APF. In 2010, the ACJ reviewed the compliance of APF member countries with the Yogyakarta Principles and provided recommendations to assist NHRIs to address gaps and inconsistencies. The Yogyakarta Principles, APF\u2019s 2009 Yogyakarta Workshop and the 2010 ACJ report provide the key pillars for the work of the APF and its members in this area. NHRIs across the region are at very different points of engagement in relation to SOGI issues. Religious, cultural and moral values and sensitivities arise in all countries. The communiqu\u00e9 from the 2009 workshop expressed respect for the right to religion and belief, but also affirmed that the expression of religious beliefs must not violate the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others. As an outcome of the ACJ Report, APF sought contributions from donors and provided financial support to five member institutions (the NHRIs of Australia, Indonesia, Mongolia, New Zealand and the Philippines,) to undertake SOGI activities domestically. In 2012\u20132013, the APF, the International Development Law Organization (IDLO), UNDP and SAARCLAW worked with NHRIs in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste to document their capacity on SOGI issues. The review conducted in 2012\u20132013 found that overall NHRIs have had a significant role in improving and advocating for LGBTI rights. Strong and open leadership from within NHRIs was identified as a key factor in mobilizing political will. A key element in terms of an NHRI\u2019s capacity to work on these issues is the identification of a staff member within the institution as a dedicated LGBTI focal point. Engaging with civil society and the LGBTI community is a significant factor in developing capacity of NHRIs to support and advocate for LGBTI rights. Although there is no international treaty that directly addresses LGBTI rights, interpretation of existing treaties has enabled a comprehensive understanding of SOGI rights as set out by the Yogyakarta Principles in the form of 29 principles that act as a checklist. The challenge to NHRIs is to translate these principles into programmatic actions. Key outcomes and opportunities identified Participants agreed on a Joint Programme of Action and Support on the Role of NHRIs in Promoting and Protecting Human rights in relation to SOGI for the period 2015\u20132017 (see Annex 1). The Chairman of Indonesia\u2019s National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM), Prof. Hafid Abbas, invited participants to attend a meeting in Indonesia in 2016 to review the first decade of progress in implementing the Yogyakarta Principles in Asia and the Pacific. Ms Pip Dargan, Deputy Director of APF, advised that APF is developing a manual and blended learning training programme on the role of NHRIs in addressing LGBTI human rights. Experts on issues relating to NHRIs and LGBTI will deliver the training. APF will deliver its first blended learning programme in 2016. Prof. Vitit Muntarbhorn identified the following windows of opportunity for strengthening NHRI responses to issues relating to sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression (SOGIE): \u2022 At the global level: \u010f Make use of the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals to advance the LGBTI rights agenda.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87217c8d-4928-42be-8870-88de72ec8a95": {"__data__": {"id_": "87217c8d-4928-42be-8870-88de72ec8a95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39955698065f55d913da7c8fcc098a6fc5fc88a05a58c15dbabfb2d5c547d13d"}, "2": {"node_id": "b211cb4c-b484-47a5-81bb-e2260b439640", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1374ac61c90b0dff281901767cb15ad50151ad6cea689720fc7b8cdd2f7a53a"}}, "hash": "aa26c223d7c610603f5f2b6a2febe2ccceebd3e70ac07bd836e5ccb2a40819f9", "text": "For example, ensure LGBTI issues are addressed under Goal 8 in relation to labour, and Goal 16 in relation to rule of law and access to justice;

COMELEC case on political representation and the Supreme Court of India\u2019s decision of 2014 in NALSA v. Union of India recognizing transgender rights). 6 Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific 7 Examples that demonstrate how NHRIs are using their mandate and powers include: \u2022 The Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines used its powers to intervene in a case involving a political party (Ang Ladlad) representing LGBTI rights. The Electoral Commission denied the party accreditation in 2007 because it was accused of advocating sexual immorality. The Commission on Human Rights responded with an advisory statement stressing that homosexuality was not a criminal offence in the Philippines. When the Supreme Court heard the case, the Commission was granted permission to intervene as a friend of the court. The refusal of accreditation was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2010 (Ang Ladlad v. COMELEC), setting a precedent for LGBTI rights. \u2022 The Mongolian Human Rights Commission with support from UNDP and the LGBT Centre (a national NGO) undertook a survey and analysis of the national legal framework for discriminatory provisions in relation to LGBTI rights. This was the first survey of this kind undertaken in Mongolia. In its 2013 annual report, the Commission dedicated a chapter to LGBTI rights including survey results and case studies of abuse and violence that had previously been hidden due to fear of social stigma. The Mongolian Commission translated the Yogyakarta Principles document into its national language, conducted training with police and law enforcement agencies, and urged the Mongolian Government to implement the recommendations of the Human Rights Committee on LGBTI issues. The Mongolian Commission used quantitative survey data and personal stories as qualitative data to bring the human rights issues of LGBTI to the public and government. \u2022 UNDP stressed that addressing LGBTI rights is a cross-cutting priority for the UN in the areas of health, HIV, governance, and access to justice.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf8746c1-80c7-419d-b069-48020917bb50": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf8746c1-80c7-419d-b069-48020917bb50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31d812bd45f0dfc21e5249b2fdaa20f3934e5ed318e7fcc766490bcc31660006"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d3f8bac-9586-4713-8c64-9fce16e2d1c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b887fd0aff5b2b430a672ed205ff5244232f6baeeb1b0e4d42e7afe1c05c977"}}, "hash": "0a26c36f7f5c4227901986ff48c5dcc55161e9340da3ef772fa634512885d710", "text": "Addressing LGBTI rights is important to achieve broader social goals relating to reduction of poverty, inequality, social and economic exclusion and requires particular attention in the areas of preventing violence and upholding the rights to education, employment and health care.

Some NHRIs have made significant progress over the last five years, e.g. by assigning a SOGI focal point, dedicated staff member or dedicated Commissioner. A willingness to proactively engage with LGBTI communities has been a significant key to success. NHRIs have a role to hold their governments to account and to remind governments of their international obligations and how they apply to LGBTI people, not as new or special laws for people who are LGBTI, but as existing obligations that apply universally. APCOM was founded in 2007 as a coalition of members from Asia and the Pacific comprising non-profit and community-based organizations, and technical advisors, including from UN partners. APCOM represents a diverse range of interests working together to advocate on, highlight and prioritize HIV and sexual health issues that affect the lives of gay men, other men who have sex with men and transgender people, including their rights, health and well-being. APCOM strongly believes that in order to achieve these goals, we need an enabling legal and policy environment where LGBTI people are fully accepted. Societies in this region are changing very rapidly. Conventional interpretations of faiths and laws are proving in most cases to be woefully inadequate in responding to rapid change, including previously unknown constructions of diverse genders and sexualities, new ways of expressing oneself, and of behaving and of socially identifying oneself. It is a brave new world, which calls for brave new responses from the leaders of society. LGBTI people still face stigma, discrimination and violence. The global AIDS response has set goals known as the three zeros: zero new infections, zero AIDS-related deaths and zero discrimination. All of our governments, at least on paper, acknowledge men who have sex with men and transgender people in their HIV programmes, although some bury the terms under the euphemism of \u2018key affected populations\u2019. APCOM expects more: equality, no less. LGBTI people and other people whose gender or sexual expression does not conform to the dominant culture\u2019s idea of acceptability, demand a place at the table as equals. NHRIs in Asia and the Pacific have walked at the front of the journey against prejudice, bigotry, tyranny and discrimination based on ethnicity, gender, religious affiliation, political ideology, disability and other aspects that are now accepted as legitimate grounds for the demand for equality. SOGIE are additional dimensions of our humanity that need NHRI protection. The challenge to NHRIs is to provide leadership by acting as the moral conscience of our nations, thereby offering a beacon of hope for LGBTI communities. A recent court case from China indicates that views are changing. A clinic was ordered to pay compensation to a gay man for electric shocks intended as therapy to \u2018convert\u2019 the gay man into a heterosexual.1 The court\u2019s acceptance that conversion therapy is wrong indicates that diversity in sexual orientation was understood as a normal feature of human diversity rather than a medical \u2018defect\u2019 or \u2018disorder\u2019. However, in many countries and even at the international level, diverse gender identities and expressions are yet to be accepted as normal. WHO still refers to transgender status as a gender identity \u2018disorder\u2019. The medical profession in India has also been very slow to modernize its position on sexuality and gender identity. Some countries are beginning to explore models for legal recognition of same-sex relationships. The governments of Thailand and Viet Nam have discussed proposals for law reform in the areas of civil unions and registration of partnerships. Viet Nam has removed penalties for conducting same-sex marriage ceremonies, although it has not taken the further step of legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Proposals have been developed in Thailand for inclusion of sexual orientation in the non-discrimination clause of the Constitution. However, some jurisdictions are moving backwards and have introduced laws restricting the rights of LGBTI persons (e.g. Aceh Province of Indonesia), and some court cases have been damaging to LGBTI rights (e.g. the Supreme Court of India\u2019s decision in 2013 recriminalizing homosexual conduct as an offence under section 377 of the Indian Penal Code). While religion, moralistic familial and community responses, and legal conservatism can make it very difficult for law reform to occur, progress can still be achieved through focusing at the level of soft policy, e.g. guidelines and protocols, and promoting a broad and inclusive interpretation of religious principles that appeal to our common humanity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f957eca3-97ab-43f3-ac01-e5c3cec5e67a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f957eca3-97ab-43f3-ac01-e5c3cec5e67a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7aa2c0db42b9c1934dd7d29f2df08d5d061f006ba0aaeb9f3388774eab702c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "45f6bab4-1bbd-4087-ba2a-fb6f459f4133", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad260624bb7a39af712f4d58c32e98581b1883b852db3ad61346b80cc1ede6c8"}}, "hash": "9b007ccb10b44dc4de3a0fe02dcc15f51efa0c61000023f698b461c7a29007eb", "text": "There is often ambivalence or inconsistency in legislative responses to SOGI issues.

However, this provision was successfully challenged in court and ultimately removed with the help of the National Human Rights Commission. The UN Human Rights Council and its mechanisms including the UPR have been increasingly used to promote LGBTI rights at the international level. The Human Rights Council adopted its first resolution on SOGI in 2011. In 2012, 2013 and 2014, NHRIs issued a joint statement to the Human Rights Council on discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence based on sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status. NHRIs are also raising LGBTI issues in their submission to the UPR process, e.g. in Bangladesh. Support to SOGI rights has been evidenced from the highest level of leadership within the UN including statements from the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay and UNDP Administrator, Helen Clark. 1 The Associated Press 2014, 'Victory for Plaintiff in China Gay Conversion Case', The New York Times 19 December.

UNDP provided an update on progress against these recommendations to the workshop. No specific mechanism has been established for monitoring and evaluation of implementation of these 60 recommendations. However, APF has been tasked with conducting regular reviews of NHRI progress including through the current workshop. The most comprehensive review of progress to date was the review conducted in 2012\u20132013 covering progress of NHRIs in addressing human rights in the context of SOGI and HIV in eight Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste. The 2013 review was conducted by UNDP, APF and IDLO in partnership with NGOs, community organizations and NHRIs. It highlighted many achievements, including: \u2022 Appointment of SOGI focal points within NHRIs (e.g. in Indonesia, Nepal and the Philippines). \u2022 Active engagement of NHRIs with community-based LGBTI groups, and involvement of those groups in initiatives to improve the capacity of NHRIs and other stakeholders to address SOGI human rights issues. Central to capacity-building is strengthening the relationships between NHRIs and LGBTI communities, so that LGBTI communities can participate in capacity-building efforts as has been effective in Indonesia, Nepal and the Philippines. \u2022 In many of the countries reviewed, there appeared to be a high level of awareness of the role of NHRIs among LGBTI people. Capacity-building and research \u2022 Nepal appointed a SOGI focal point within the National Human Rights Commission; developed a relationship with the leading national community-based LGBTI organization, the Blue Diamond Society, including providing LGBTI internships within the Commission; and has included SOGI issues as a priority in the Commission\u2019s Strategic Plan. \u2022 Indonesia\u2019s Human Rights Commission has established a sub-committee with a mandate to address SOGI rights issues and has invested in capacity-building of its staff on SOGI issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebba8085-12d1-47d5-9673-6b5c5e8eb7ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "ebba8085-12d1-47d5-9673-6b5c5e8eb7ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32bad9eff6e7a38e5046ced3aebbb7842ff98771717016aa6c32c2ba6dddfb16"}, "2": {"node_id": "f5a601db-ed3e-4935-9d6b-27049573223b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dff67dd8becf786cae92d6a9db70f7a5a7c109c287c601fb4c0798e2e9433136"}}, "hash": "9daf0bb8c2cc37e28c4cab17d429ed41cc89a74f4adf58206ee21b2f34843d1a", "text": "\u2022 The Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines has identified HIV and LGBTI-related rights as a priority and engaged in capacity-building of staff on HIV and SOGI issues.

Monitoring \u2022 489 LGBTI community representatives in eight countries were surveyed as part of the 2013 review process. The survey gathered LGBTI community perspectives on NHRIs and the process of reporting rights violations through a peer-administered survey questionnaire. \u2022 Nepal\u2019s National Human Rights Commission conducted eight investigations both following complaints and suo moto (where the government acted on its own accord). The Commission is able to engage with police directly if an LGBTI person is arrested. \u2022 Indonesia\u2019s Human Rights Commission handled 24 complaints from 2010\u20132012. Advocacy \u2022 The National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh specifically addressed SOGI issues in its stakeholder report to the UPR on Bangladesh. \u2022 The National Human Rights Commission of Nepal has supported advocacy for legalizing same-sex marriage through membership of the Committee established at the direction of the Supreme Court. The Commission has also advocated to government bodies including the Ministry of Finance and the Electoral Commission. \u2022 The Human Rights Commissions of Indonesia and the Philippines have acted as amicus curiae in court cases. The case in Indonesia related to a transgender man who was arrested for marrying a woman. The case in the Philippines related to refusal of registration of an LGBTI political party (Ang Ladlad v. COMELEC). Challenges identified: \u2022 Very few rights violations were reported to NHRIs. Reasons for the low levels of complaints of violations lodged by LGBTI people include lack of knowledge of NHRI complaint procedures, concerns about confidentiality and safety, and the availability of alternative means of resolution of complaints such as the intervention of a community organization. \u2022 NHRI activity has been disappointingly low in the areas of advocacy on law reform and education of duty-bearers. \u2022 In the area of research, NHRIs would benefit from more information about the different types of violations prevalent in their countries, and the impacts of these violations on human rights and health. This includes the direct and indirect impacts of criminal laws and police abuses, such as the conditions experienced by LGBTI when in police custody or prison, and whether LGBTI communities are deterred from accessing health and social services. Integration of LGBTI rights issues into HIV responses The Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) described the approaches it has used in Asia and the Pacific to integrate SOGI and LGBTI rights issues into HIV responses. This work has been supported by the setting of the global goal of \u2018zero discrimination\u2019 by UNAIDS. NHRIs should look for opportunities to leverage support for LBGTI rights from the public health and social justice agendas of national HIV responses. HIV has been a strategic entry point for addressing SOGI and LGBTI rights. Men who have sex with men and transgender people are recognized as key populations at higher risk of HIV in Asia and the Pacific and therefore are priorities for most national HIV programmes. HIV prevalence in these populations is much higher than the general population (e.g. 30 percent HIV prevalence in some transgender communities in Asia). Discrimination against LGBTI communities increases HIV vulnerability. Discrimination hinders access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. Eliminating HIV-related discrimination extends to eliminating discrimination on the grounds of SOGI. Discrimination also affects LGBTI people who are at increased risk of HIV because they are engaged in sex work and/or use drugs. 10 Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific 11 Support from UNAIDS to NHRIs to address SOGI and LGBTI rights issues has included: \u2022 Political commitment to address SOGI and LGBTI human rights from the UN system and advocacy for political commitment for NHRI engagement; \u2022 Strategic information provided by UNAIDS including epidemiological data and analysis of epidemiological trends and the impacts of laws and policies; \u2022 Recognition of the mandate of NHRIs in policy advocacy including the critical role of NHRIs in achieving social justice; \u2022 Technical support to NHRIs to address HIV-related stigma and discrimination; \u2022 Supporting partnerships between NHRIs and communities and others, and engagement with the UN and international human rights mechanisms such as the UPR; and \u2022 Financial support.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f95d3f94-9c93-4269-98be-00ac835d787c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f95d3f94-9c93-4269-98be-00ac835d787c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "349dae0327af765a3a7e4929b7a642a1c5ce15a5179aa71df9b76d76d3fcf8f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "98f7d0c8-ad16-4332-b9c5-e814a2a3fa58", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fc6edf13641662a7fcb4db2d7db3bee3d320e6719aaf4a8e3f0ccf61ebc557b"}}, "hash": "c0e4ff7f0e29db6bdb054657de7f5c64d7f54cfaa9148676b27064b2a44f673f", "text": "Resolutions of UN ESCAP make explicit reference to men who have sex with men, opening the doors to address their rights as a priority in HIV responses in Asia and the Pacific.

The Global Commission recommended: \u2022 Countries must reform their approach towards sexual diversity. Rather than punishing consenting adults involved in same-sex activity, countries must offer such people access to effective HIV and health services and commodities. \u2022 Countries must reform their approach towards transgender people including repealing all laws that criminalize transgender identity or associated behaviours. \u2022 We have to change the laws \u2018on the books\u2019 but also the enforcement of laws \u2018on the streets\u2019. Police abuses also play a role in driving HIV vulnerability. NHRIs in the region have played a range of valuable roles in supporting rights of LGBTI to enjoy their rights including right to health.

UNDP, UNAIDS and ESCAP have supported national consultations on HIV and the law that addressed the role of NHRIs and included recommendations for capacity building and increased role for NHRIs in addressing human rights violations experienced by LGBTI (and other key populations) (e.g. Fiji, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka). NHRIs actively engaged in national HIV legal reviews by participating in planning, providing speakers, assisting with documentation, and participating in consultation meetings. UNDP, UNFPA and UNAIDS also worked together on a regional study The Right(s) Evidence: Study on Sex Work, Violence and HIV in Asia (2015), which found high levels of violence directed at sex workers, and recommended: \u2022 NHRIs should monitor and respond to incidents of violence and violations by State and non-State actors. \u2022 NHRIs should seek to ensure that all guidelines and programmes to prevent and eliminate gender-based violence expressly address the needs of male, female and transgender sex workers.

Invitations to complete the questionnaire were broadcast on electronic mailing lists (SOGI, AP Rainbow, MSM-Asia and the Coalition on Sexual and Bodily Rights in Muslim Societies (CSBR)). CSBR has emerged as a particularly important 12 Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific 13 platform for exchanging information and strategies to influence domestic debates. CSBR is a network of feminist and LGBTI activists working in Muslim countries. Constraints identified for LGBTI community-based responses include: \u2022 Some countries have no LGBTI organizations (e.g. Afghanistan, Jordan, Maldives, Oman and Qatar); \u2022 In some countries, community-based organizations are funded by HIV programmes and therefore their work is oriented to HIV prevention rather than a broader equality agenda; \u2022 In some countries, organizations may engage in relevant activities but may be reluctant to name or identify their actions publicly because LGBTI and SOGI rights and terminology such as \u2018gay\u2019 are too sensitive (e.g. Afghanistan); \u2022 In some countries, the LGBTI movement is nascent and advocacy organizations have not been formalized or are fragile (e.g. Kazakhstan, Samoa and Timor Leste); and \u2022 Rural and remote LGBTI populations are seldom reached. Some countries have a strong history of organized LGBTI movements (e.g. Australia, India, New Zealand and the Philippines). In other countries, engagement with NHRIs and human rights advocacy often depends on personalities, and as a result is ad hoc in nature. It is important to ensure that responsiveness to LGBTI issues is institutionalized within NHRIs so that the strength of the response is not personality dependent. Political change requires political acumen and a creative approach to identifying entry points for advocacy including HIV, sexual and reproductive health rights, youth policy, and debates on faith and culture. Recognition of the dynamic nature of culture is important, including the capacity for religious views to evolve to reflect progressive social values. While there is recognition among LGBTI groups of the role of NHRIs in handling complaints, there is also appreciation that sometimes it is more effective to advocate to government directly, including through the court system. Some recent advocacy successes include: \u2022 The Delhi High Court judgement in the Naz Foundation Case in 2009, which remains an important milestone because of the quality of the judgement, even though it was subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court in 2013; \u2022 Recognition of a third gender in the laws and policies of Nepal and Bangladesh; \u2022 In Nepal, the recommendation of the Committee to the National Assembly in favour of marriage equality for same-sex couples; \u2022 The introduction of anti-discrimination ordinances in several cities of the Philippines; and \u2022 Development of formal proposals for civil unions of same-sex couples and for constitutional reform to recognize SOGI rights in Thailand. It should be recognized that NHRIs are at different stages in their commitment to addressing LGBTI rights. There can be a lack of engagement from those who perceive SOGI rights to be a claim for \u2018special\u2019 rights rather than equal rights. APCOM strongly recommends that NHRIs be proactive in building relationships with LGBTI communities. For example, NHRI staff members should visit the premises of LGBTI community organizations to build trust, make themselves known and gain a better understanding of their communities. Viet Nam, a country that does not have an NHRI, removed a legal ban on same-sex marriage in 2014. In 2015, a lesbian couple held a marriage celebration on board a Vietnamese airline, documented in a video clip. The Workshop viewed a video produced on this event as an awareness-raising tool. Discussion points NHRI participants indicated that they are at varying levels in their understanding and experience of LGBTI and SOGI issues. Some NHRIs have little or no prior experience in addressing SOGI issues (e.g. Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Maldives, Samoa and Sri Lanka) but staff members are interested in strengthening their capacity in this area.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdb32ff0-910b-45a3-a715-4cf29aff0a80": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdb32ff0-910b-45a3-a715-4cf29aff0a80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71d05f20da8327d01059c41832b6bdb124cfe35cd178e023290e41eae29d9166"}, "2": {"node_id": "8818d7d8-4076-4b68-965b-788daac11247", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d862e54dd5300efc567ac35c55faa65d70a4a6ab3b8246e6c50750092721392"}}, "hash": "e23d6ce682b353409dbbab2bbd44973cfe6fd11ffaa7e687b8d56120d6dbc119", "text": "For other countries, initial steps have been taken by NHRIs to engage with local communities but SOGI rights are viewed as a new and challenging area of work, and competing with many other pressing issues, such as in.

Partnerships between LGBTI groups in the Philippines and the National Human Rights Commission have increased ownership of the agenda. Ideally, NHRIs should appoint a staff member with a work plan dedicated to SOGI issues. Progress has been slow at the sub-regional level. The representative of the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) pointed out that it is very difficult politically to make regional progress on SOGI issues given the divergent domestic positions of ASEAN states. Progress is likely to be incremental but opportunities may arise in the drafting of ASEAN\u2019s post-2015 vision. AICHR\u2019s focus will be on inserting soft non-political language in its five-year work plan to enable future work in this area to expand. A number of countries in the region do not have strong human rights cultures or institutions. Although the ASEAN Declaration on Human Rights has its limitations, any progress on human rights at the sub-regional progress is a welcome opportunity. The representative of SAARCLAW emphasized the role of the legal and medical professions. NHRIs can benefit from strengthening links with jurists, lawyers and medical associations. In reviewing progress, it would be useful to attempt to engage those who may not be supportive of the Yogyakarta Principles and who do not share a commitment to LGBTI rights. This would enable a dialogue engaging a variety of views from religious leaders, parliamentarians and the judiciary, rather than a monologue involving only those who are already supportive of a rights-based approach. Several NHRIs (e.g. Bangladesh, Mongolia, the Philippines and Thailand) commented on the central role of the family in LGBTI experiences of exclusion and discrimination. The heteronormative nature of many families means that families are perceived as unsafe spaces for many LGBTI people. There was general agreement that the human rights agenda would benefit from NHRI education and awareness-raising programmes that promote greater family understanding and acceptance of LGBTI people. Colonial history as well as religion influences continued discrimination in law, attitudes and policies. In many former British colonies, such as Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Singapore, the common law penal codes still criminalize homosexual conduct. Fiji and Hong Kong SAR inherited the sodomy offence from the British penal code but have decriminalized homosexual conduct. NHRIs need to focus not just on laws but also on law enforcement agencies and officials. Several NHRIs reported concerns about violations of rights of LGBTI people in police detention and prisons, including exposure to violence and lack of access to health services. It was observed that NHRIs can play a role of provision of safe spaces for LGBTI communities to raise concerns, share experiences and build a sense of community. However, it cannot automatically be assumed that all NHRIs provide safe spaces, as not all NHRIs are sensitized to LGBTI rights issues. 14 Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific 15 The language used to label LGBTI people can itself be problematic as some individuals do not identify or relate to the terms used. Culturally appropriate local terms vary across the region. Intersex status is often misunderstood and is an overarching term for several conditions. Individuals who have no words or inaccurate terms to describe their status can feel invisible and disempowered, which contributes to high suicide rates. Country updates Updates are reported below in alphabetical order by country. Bangladesh and Nepal provided detailed updates through detailed presentations. Other countries provided updates and observations through interventions from the floor. Kazakhstan and Samoa are included here, although they spoke on Day 2. In Afghanistan, LGBTI issues are extremely sensitive and generally not discussed. To describe someone as gay or homosexual is considered deeply insulting. However, there is a strong policy focus on addressing gender inequalities and there are legal protections for women relating to violence and forced marriages. Australian law protects people from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status. The Australian Human Rights Commission is conducting a national consultation to identify areas in which discriminatory or harmful attitudes and practices remain a feature of LGBTI people\u2019s lived experiences, despite the supportive legal framework.

This includes a focus on improving access to and the quality of health, education and aged care services. In Bangladesh, LGBTI people experience disadvantage in education and employment, and report incidents of violence and abusive treatment by the police including abuses that occur to people detained in jail. Same-sex sexual activity, whether in public or private, is illegal and punishable with fines and imprisonment up to life. The Penal Code section 377 criminalizes intercourse against the order of nature. In 2009 and 2013, the Bangladesh parliament refused to overturn section 377. The policymakers have decided to tread a cautious middle path such that adults engaged in consensual sex are not to be subjected to harsh punishments of prolonged imprisonment; however, same-sex relationships will not be legalized. Consequently, Bangladesh does not recognize same-sex marriage or civil unions. The National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh (JAMAKON) is mandated to provide the Government with recommendations to promote and protect the rights of the child, women and other vulnerable groups. Arguably, this encompasses sexual minorities. The Constitution guarantees equality before the law and equal opportunity to all citizens. Freedom of religion is subject to restrictions based on decency or morality. JAMAKON\u2019s Strategic Plan 2015\u20132019 includes marginalized and vulnerable populations, including LGBTI communities. JAMAKON\u2019s priorities include: civil society sensitization, public education including programmes for LGBTI communities; coalition and alliance building with the partners of LGBTI groups; economic empowerment; research on the impact of discrimination and violence; engagement of the media and entertainment industry; engagement with government officials; and sensitizing JAMAKON staff members to SOGI issues and building capacity to implement activities using the Commission\u2019s convening and advocacy powers. The government recognized transgender people\u2019s voting rights in 2009. In 2013 in a landmark decision, the government passed laws to recognize hijras (a transgender community) as a third gender, allowing them to identify themselves as a separate gender in passports and other state documents. However, implementation is slow and hijras are still unable to attain driving licences as a third gender or receive many benefits from government. In 2014, JAMAKON drafted an Anti-discrimination Act in collaboration with the Law Commission of Bangladesh, which proposes to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. It has been submitted to government but not yet enacted. In 2012, JAMAKON submitted a report under the UPR process, which stated: \u201cExcluded groups (including Dalits and transgenders) remain some of the poorest people in Bangladesh and face marginalization and discrimination. In addition the NHRC notes that the Government of Bangladesh did not respect the recommendation with respect to sexual minorities. The NHRC understands the need for the law to be in harmony with the cultural and social mores of the people. Nevertheless, the NHRC believes that it is now time to ensure that all groups, including those who are transgender, intersex or sexual minority, are protected from discrimination.\u201d JAMAKON\u2019s Chairman is active in advocating for the rights of LGBTI groups in Bangladesh and was a speaker at a meeting entitled `Human Rights of the Sexual Minorities: Response and Responsibilities\u2019, organized by a community organization for LGBTI people, the Bandhu Social Welfare Society. JAMAKON uses its existing powers to handle complaints, e.g. intervening in 2014 to ensure a person dismissed because of their sexual orientation in violation of their employment rights was reinstated and provided with monetary compensation. The opposition to LGBTI rights from deeply conservative elements of the Muslim community is a major barrier. LGBTI communities sometimes experience harassment by vigilante groups supported by the issuance of local fatwas against their existence. Documenting human rights violations makes human rights challenges more visible to government. Media can also play a vital role to sensitize government and the public. A community survey on SOGI issues was conducted to increase understanding of LGBTI perspectives on access to justice, reporting of human rights violations and engagement with JAMAKON. One hundred LGBTI people took part in the survey, which was led by peers from Bandhu Social Welfare Society. Some 87 percent of respondents experienced rights violations, but only 30 percent were aware of JAMAKON. Respondents requested more information about JAMAKON including how to make a complaint.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35781891-4461-4cbd-9751-c4b6ad902cbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "35781891-4461-4cbd-9751-c4b6ad902cbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0025b51f20eb25c7812cc98a89d941572a7780dd5e3f6de83856a8abbb853f30"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd93e85b-6880-4237-97bc-b94690f871fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d23e7fb36e4ee59c9515344f314e3a8eb935a8f274c2b4c3288e588b9605d477"}}, "hash": "4c43d5bbfd5229fb039280e1415fc10bbcb2af8b264017282207dcdf6fbb8ef2", "text": "Respondents requested more information about JAMAKON including how to make a complaint.

For example, the police are often perceived to victimize, extort and blackmail gay and bisexual men caught in public areas. Clients of male sex workers can be subject to extortion.

The police also sometimes harass, beat and arrest men engaging in HIV outreach work. 16 Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific 17 A Hijra pride and henna festival was held in 2014, which issued a statement demanding a comprehensive law to address hijra rights including protection from police harassment, rights to information and education, and right to employment. It is important that government officials have an understanding of these issues. Fiji has made progress through legislative reform including decriminalization of homosexual conduct and introduction of equality and non-discrimination protections. However, there is an apparent ceiling to the tolerance of LGBTI rights. LGBTI visibility is still very difficult because of the influence of conservative Christian and cultural traditions, particularly regarding the role of the traditional family unit in society. In India, there has been a lack of action on LGBTI rights from parliament. However, there have been interesting decisions on transgender rights from the courts. The Supreme Court has issued two contrasting judgements. The Section 377 judgement in 2013 refused to apply fundamental constitutional rights to decriminalize homosexual conduct, stating that decriminalization is a question for parliament, not the courts. On the other hand, a Supreme Court judgement a few months later found that transgender people do enjoy constitutional rights and the Supreme Court required the government to implement measures in recognition of these rights. Indonesia\u2019s National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM) highlighted the challenge of working in a system in which governance is highly devolved to provincial and district levels. Many rights violations result from discriminatory local laws and practices including police abuses. Although the NHRI can review compliance with national human rights obligations, tensions arise in addressing actions of police and local authorities. Engaging local religious leaders is a challenge. Komnas HAM is pursuing research to map the need for harmonization of laws at different levels of government to be consistent with SOGI human rights. Opportunities for addressing SOGI issues include training police and religious leaders and integrating of issues into the National Action Plan on Human Rights. A research agenda on implementation of the Yogyakarta Principles would benefit from a comparative perspective that identifies lessons learned from across the Asia-Pacific region. Komnas HAM has good relationships with university-based research centres, which could be used to pursue this agenda. In Kazakhstan, the context of conservative religions means that it is challenging to raise SOGI issues. Kazakhstan is 30 percent Orthodox Christian (mostly of Russian origin) and 70 percent Muslim with both groups sharing a perception of homosexuality as wrong. Sodomy was a crime in Kazakhstan under the Soviet law until 1997. Although this prohibition has been removed, there is no law against discrimination on the grounds of SOGI. The Constitution has a general prohibition against discrimination but there is no direct mechanism for making a discrimination complaint to a court. Anti-gay laws exist in many neighbouring countries and the politics of Russia and its sphere of influence in Central Asia has an effect across the region. There is no regional human rights mechanism for central Asia. In 2014, the national parliament considered proposals (influenced by Russian legal developments) prohibiting homosexuality; however, these proposals have not progressed. In February 2015, a law was adopted to protect children from information that could harm their mental health. There is a phrase in the law about propaganda of \u2018untraditional relationships\u2019 but there is no definition of what this means. It is unclear if this will be enforced against homosexual people, but has the strong potential to be used to do so. Malaysia\u2019s Human Rights Commission is interested in increasing its internal capacity to address SOGI issues in collaboration with civil society. Mindful that these are very sensitive issues domestically, the Commission addresses these issues with extra cautious. Although the Commission has not established a programme to address SOGI issues there have been some initial discussions with religious groups. Malaysia has a dual legal system, in which the common law system operates alongside Islamic laws that apply to Muslim", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f602b2db-a357-496d-8017-1765c782c816": {"__data__": {"id_": "f602b2db-a357-496d-8017-1765c782c816", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8265f66cd461c4583b0641ad7523c0d08c879ea4f406c7db81de5c62c1ae5e9f"}}, "hash": "8265f66cd461c4583b0641ad7523c0d08c879ea4f406c7db81de5c62c1ae5e9f", "text": "citizens. Homosexuality is criminalized by both systems. The Sharia law punishes sodomy. The dual legal system recognised by the Federal Constitution of Malaysia entitled each state to develop their own sharia laws that often include offences for homosexual conduct and cross-dressing. There have been recent high profile court cases including the decriminalization of cross-dressing, although this case remains on appeal. Cultural and religious norms are dominant considerations that impact on the role of the Commission. Despite these considerable constraints there is still room to engage with the community in a dialogue and raise awareness in relation to specific issues such as LGBTI rights in education, health and employment. The National Unity Council included sexuality and gender identity among protected groups in a draft anti-discrimination bill developed in 2014. However, this draft bill was not well received by the authorities and the general public due to many disputed provisions contained therein. Malaysia is keen to look to other Asian nations with majority Muslim populations such as Bangladesh and Pakistan for lessons in how to engage sensitively and constructively on SOGI issues. The Myanmar National Human Rights Commission participates in a legal committee established under the national HIV programme that reviews legislation affecting the HIV vulnerability of key populations. It has received proposals for amendment of Section 377 of the Myanmar Penal Code to decriminalize homosexuality. However, the government is concerned to ensure that protection against sexual assaults is not undermined by amendments, so is reviewing proposals carefully. The Myanmar National Human Rights Commission is sensitive to the need to improve internal capacity and has appointed a lesbian staff member. In Nepal, it has been important for the National Human Rights Commission to work in close partnership with the leading LGBTI organization, the Blue Diamond Society, in community education and practical measures such as introducing a hotline for reporting violations. For Nepalese LGBTI people, discrimination is experienced from families and local communities (e.g. exclusion from social activities and gatherings), schools, housing and in legal rights in relation to family or ancestral property, marriage and relationships. Police abuses such as unnecessary interrogation are reported including human rights violations perpetrated against LGBTI people when they are in police detention, including extortion, violence and sexual assaults. There are examples of LGBTI people experiencing inhuman and degrading treatment. The Blue Diamond Society supported a test case on legal equality rights in the Supreme Court, which resulted in the Court issuing a declaration in 2007 that the government is responsible for implementing SOGI equality rights. The Supreme Court order directed the government: \u2022 To identify LGBTI populations and recognize them as a marginalized group; \u2022 To respect their dignified life according to their gender recognition with the issuance of third gender identity; and \u2022 To conduct research to determine what kind of practices and jurisprudence have been developed in South Asian countries and at the global level in relation to equality rights and to develop recommendations based on the research. However, implementation of the Court order relies on government actions and progress has been delayed due to the volatile political situation. LGBTI issues are not yet included in the equality provisions in the new Constitution although the constitutional prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of gender provides an entry point. Government policy assigns rights to protection from discrimination according to the status of a social group as a \u2018minority\u2019. However, there is no accurate and universal definition of a sexual minority. There is some recognition of \u2018third gender\u2019 people in policies and programmes although progress is very slow. A positive development has been the report of the group that was convened to conduct comparative research on international practices and jurisprudence on marriage equality for same-sex couples. The Study Committee for Same-Sex marriage included a medical expert assigned by the Ministry of Health; a representative from National Human Rights Commission; a representative of the Ministry of Law; a sociologist as assigned by the Government of Nepal; a representative of Nepal Police; and a representative of the Ministry of Population and Environment. The report from the Committee recommends legislative action to enshrine LGBTI equality and has recently been submitted to government. A key challenge is the capacity development of government officials, e.g. in relation to LGBTI inclusion in the census and responding in a timely way to complaints made to government by LGBTI people and their organizations. Education of the judiciary is also important in relation to the 2007 Supreme Court decision. 18 Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6eb03179-52e2-4138-9e2f-08950b27509e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6eb03179-52e2-4138-9e2f-08950b27509e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8b96fd56fb413fa710be8a217e263d12b7f2ea846cdd386434d2aa07384350d"}, "3": {"node_id": "af357d6c-c886-440a-853b-56250712daa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f8bfd639e95ce8889201bda2968ff5544e67616c309641d2f1d0ea85ecd37b6"}}, "hash": "a079c6839cae1dfd994355b74ab60721188214c49f6c64de86a0f9eab6e743f1", "text": "Asia and the Pacific Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific 19 The response of the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines has benefited from research on LGBTI issues being conducted by civil society organizations, including two surveys on gender-based violence and evidence of hate crimes. It is important to collect quantitative and qualitative data to illustrate stories of discrimination. The Commission is interested in developing a protocol for addressing hate crimes, and a handbook to educate agencies based on the research. An important opportunity for addressing transgender issues is presented by the national law known as the Magna Carta for Women, which applies obligations arising under the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) domestically. The NHRIs in the Philippines and Timor-Leste work within social contexts in which the Catholic Church plays a dominant role. This can lead to social rejection and exclusion of LGBTI people from families and communities, e.g. the refusal to allow LGBTI people to participate in religious services on the basis of their non-conforming dress or appearance. Therefore, working with religious leaders is an important strategy if NHRIs are to gain community support in expanding their roles on these issues. In Timor-Leste there is some recognition of diversity in sexual orientation but limited understanding in relation to transgender and intersex issues. In the Republic of Korea, the response to LGBTI issues is ambivalent. There has been progress in the legal recognition of transgender status as a result of a court decision enabling a transgender person to change their legal registration of gender. However, military laws still discriminate against homosexual men in the context of compulsory national service requirements. LGBTI issues are becoming more mainstreamed within the human rights community and there have been efforts to engage religious communities. There was an extensive process to draft an anti-discrimination law. However, this was defeated, partly as a result of pressure from evangelical Christians. In Samoa, human rights are dealt with by the Ombudsman\u2019s Office, which has not done any work on LGBTI rights issues as yet because the NHRI is very new. The NHRI was established in 2013 within the Office of the Ombudsman, which recruited three staff with a human rights background in 2014. The focus at this stage is building internal capacity to learn how to address SOGI issues. The Constitution includes a general prohibition on discrimination in legislation based on gender. LGBTI rights are a very sensitive issue because of the dominant role in society of Christian religion and traditional culture. Government and NGOs (particularly the Fa\u2019afafine Association) have had a role in SOGI rights issues. A review of the criminal law led to a new Crimes Act of 2013, which removed the offences of impersonating females (although sodomy remains an offence). Lesbians and gay men are not visible but the transgender community is active and organized through the association representing transgender people, the Fa\u2019afafine Association. The Prime Minister is Chair of the Fa\u2019afafine Association. Equal rights are enjoyed to employment and freedom of association. However, same-sex marriage is controversial. In Sri Lanka, the criminal law is based on the British penal code and remains discriminatory. A review of the law intended to update its provisions resulted instead in criminalization of lesbian sexual conduct as well as male- to-male sex, rather than decriminalization of male-to-male sex. The situation regressed rather than improved. A focus on changing attitudes is required before further law reform will be supported. Engaging the duty-bearers as well as the society will be required. 3 Summary of proceedings: Day 2 South\u2013South learning The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights The Inter-American Human Rights System comprises the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and the Inter-American Court on Human Rights.

The 2013\u20132014 resolutions encompassed gender expression as well as sexual orientation and gender identity. Further, States were urged to afford protection to intersex people, to implement policies and procedures to ensure medical practices consistent with human rights standards, and to produce data on homophobic and transphobic violence.

Activities of the Rapporteurship in 2013\u20132014 included convening over 30 hearings, petitions and cases, thematic reports, monitoring and visibility (e.g. use of social media including reaching over 900,000 people on Facebook), and technical advice to States. A formal dialogue with OAS Representatives and Ambassadors on Sexuality and Diversity was held in 2014. Activities of NHRIs in Latin America and the Caribbean have included: \u2022 Provision of information to the IACHR on human rights violations; \u2022 Convening or participating in public hearings; \u2022 Establishing specialized units or offices for the protection of LGBTI persons (Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela); \u2022 Training of police and law enforcement agents on LGBTI rights (Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Venezuela); \u2022 Inclusion of SOGI as an indicator for data collection purposes in complaint forms for NHRIs (Guatemala and Venezuela); \u2022 Press releases or public statements about LGBTI discrimination cases (Colombia, Ecuador and Peru); \u2022 Documentation of LGBTI rights violations in several reports (Mexico); \u2022 Monitoring of ministries of education, health and families regarding discrimination against LGBTI persons (Nicaragua); and \u2022 Awareness campaigns and initiatives (Costa Rica, Mexico, Nicaragua and Venezuela). The ASEAN SOGIE Caucus The non-government organisation, the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC), presented on advocacy to the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) through the \u2018SOGIE Caucus\u2019. The ASEAN SOGIE Caucus is a network of human rights activists that aims for the inclusion of SOGIE in ASEAN human rights mechanisms in order to promote and protect the human rights of people regardless of 20 Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific 21 SOGIE in the Southeast Asian region. The SOGIE Caucus was formed in 2011 in response to the inclusion of LGBTI issues in the ASEAN People\u2019s Forum in Viet Nam in 2010 and in response to the events in Surabaya in 2010 when fundamentalist Muslims disrupted the International Lesbian and Gay Association Asia conference, resulting in the cancellation of the event. AICHR was established in 2009 covering the ten ASEAN member states (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam). Five ASEAN member states have NHRIs (Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Thailand). AICHR has a promotion mandate and was mandated to develop the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration, agreed in 2012. SOGIE issues were raised by civil society in the AICHR consultations on the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration. The SOGIE Caucus produced a video as part of a campaign to have SOGIE issues included in the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration; however, the campaign was not successful. SOGIE issues were not included in the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration, ASEAN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women and Violence Against Children, or the ASEAN Declaration on the Rights of Migrant Workers. In 2012, Malaysia\u2019s representative to the AICHR declined to support inclusion of SOGIE issues.

The SOGIE Caucus is advocating for greater AICHR transparency, government policies to depathologize SOGIE, and the provision of full and equal access to health and social services. The Caucus has been strengthening alliances with advocates for other issues such as children and women\u2019s rights, disability rights and migrant rights. The SOGIE Caucus also opposes discriminatory government actions, e.g. the Malaysian Government\u2019s publication of guidance on how to identify LGBTI students according to their dress or appearance. At the regional level, the governments of Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and Singapore mount strong opposition to the recognition of LGBTI rights. Indonesia and Thailand have been allies, and the Philippines is sometimes also supportive. The SOGIE Caucus is advocating for AICHR to be more transparent and to strengthen its engagement and consultations with LGBTI civil society organizations. SOGIE issues are highly dependent on the country representative who sits on AICHR. The SOGIE Caucus is looking to NHRIs to advocate to AICHR for inclusion of SOGIE issues in their work. Potential entry points for advocacy include the ASEAN Civil Society Conference/ASEAN People\u2019s Forum 2015 (inclusion of SOGIE in the formal meeting statement), the ASEAN Secretariat and ASEAN Commission on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and Children (ACWC), inclusion on the agendas of the broader ASEAN meetings that include other countries, e.g. ASEAN+3 or ASEAN+6, and the corporate social responsibility agenda of the private sector, which is a focus of AICHR. ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights The Indonesian representative to AICHR noted that Timor-Leste is applying to become an ASEAN /AICHR member. The Commission comprises member governments. In the case of the Inter-American system there is a separate political body (Organization of American States) and human rights body (IACHR). AICHR is both a political body and human rights body, and decisions are reached by political negotiation, consultation and consensus rather than voting. ASEAN Foreign Ministers first proposed a regional human rights mechanism when the Vienna Declaration of Human Rights was issued in 1993. When the ASEAN Charter was agreed in 2006, ASEAN states agreed to establish a regional human rights body. Following on from this decision, two ASEAN commissions were established in 2009\u20132010 on human rights and in relation to women and children. ASEAN comprises three areas of cooperation: the political and security community, the economic and investment community, and the social and cultural community. Human rights are a cross-cutting theme for these pillars of cooperation. Human rights issues are being incrementally mainstreamed into the three pillars of cooperation and the language of ASEAN. Member states have not given AICHR a mandate to receive and investigate complaints, conduct visits or inquire into or investigate country situations. Rather, it has the functions of setting standards and building the capacity of officials of ASEAN and ASEAN member states. AICHR addresses \u2018vulnerable groups\u2019 in the context of standard setting. Monitoring focuses on thematic issues, which currently are defined as migrants\u2019 rights, trafficked people, women and children, and vulnerable groups. Indonesia has proposed that SOGIE populations be addressed as an \u2018other\u2019 population within the concept of \u2018vulnerable groups\u2019 in the ASEAN Declaration on Human Rights; however, this has not yet been agreed.

Until 2011, SAARCLAW\u2019s human rights priorities were primarily children\u2019s rights and women\u2019s rights. In 2011, the SAARC Secretariat introduced SAARCLAW to the UNAIDS Secretariat and a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with UNAIDS, UNDP, IDLO and the World Bank with a focus on legal and policy barriers to HIV responses and how these barriers impact LGBTI rights. As a result, SAARCLAW has engaged in a series of initiatives on HIV and the rights of men who have sex with men and transgender people. 22 Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific 23 Within SAARC, Maldives and Pakistan have voted against SOGI resolutions and India has abstained. This contradicts the SAARC Guidelines, which talk about protection of LGBTI rights. This indicates the need for education. SAARCLAW seeks to influence the mindsets of judges in the area of LGBTI rights. Human rights as enshrined in national constitutions can be interpreted to protect LGBTI rights. Office bearers of SAARCLAW are influential in the governments and the judiciary of the member states. Parliamentarians of South Asian States have generally not legislated to protect LGBTI rights, so SAARCLAW has focused on educating the judiciary. The annual SAARCLAW Conference was organized to coincide with the Chief Justices Conference so that all Chief Justices could listen to the voices of the vulnerable including LGBTI people. The judiciary can be powerful lawmakers in South Asia as they are able to change the law through declaratory orders. The initial judgement of the Delhi High Court in the case on section 377 of the Penal Code is an example of the potential role of the courts in changing laws. The Delhi High Court in effect decriminalized homosexual conduct by reading down section 377 to be consistent with the Constitution of India. The decision of the Supreme Court that subsequently overturned the Delhi High Court decision was a setback. Monitoring human rights situations Successes and challenges faced by LGBTI communities: New Zealand3 The New Zealand Human Rights Commission conducted an Inquiry into discrimination against transgender people in 2008. The process of obtaining community submissions created an extensive evidence base and built relationships with and between transgender communities. The Inquiry looked at experiences of violence and discrimination in health, education and other areas of life for male and female transgender people from diverse ethnic and social backgrounds. Some intersex issues were also addressed. At the early stages of the Inquiry, transgender people did not want to be public about their status, but by the time the Inquiry was finished most were comfortable to be identified. Meetings were held with indigenous Maori in their traditional meeting spaces. The Commission placed an emphasis on media visibility and public education accompanying the Inquiry process. The Commission was concerned about the sensitivity of addressing transgender children\u2019s rights, but the media coverage of transgender children was actually very positive. Implementation of the recommendations of the Inquiry included: \u2022 A change in policies relating to gender identity on drivers licences and passports (allowing a choice of M, F or X). The Yogyakarta Principles were included in advice from officials to inform the decision on drivers licences; \u2022 A public education programme and an exhibition in five public galleries around New Zealand to raise the profile of the Inquiry; \u2022 Human rights training for transgender people including treaty reporting; and \u2022 Introduction of a gender identity standard in gathering official statistics. The number of complaints received by the Commission increased after the Inquiry, indicating greater awareness of rights and redress mechanisms in the community. Challenges included maintaining political commitment in the context of changes in government, and the demand on staff resources of the Human Rights Commission as the workload increased, due to greater awareness of the issues in government and the community. 3 This section is based on a presentation made by Mr. Jack Byrne, former Senior Human Rights Specialist at the New Zealand Human Rights Commission, in which he reflected in his capacity as a community expert on achievements made by the New Zealand Human Rights Commission through their work with civil society and government agencies. The Commission is mainstreaming sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex (SOGII) rights into its work, e.g. pre-employment guidelines for employers and employees.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac25ea54-111d-4a8a-a7d5-e2cbd9a14f8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac25ea54-111d-4a8a-a7d5-e2cbd9a14f8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2989748090d906c023b30e770f4be00a44c07395bf341f1fa55b71b233f659be"}, "3": {"node_id": "86912d9c-8533-412a-aee2-7b75b3a92ec3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f051efac42ff0acaf0b1c5bfd76b9327ff2d187164aa23088a826c42b1f2331"}}, "hash": "a03c5a502a8f142657d5d05cf7d92a8312fb3066f06ba8f3be6881f77784e3f0", "text": "The Commission supported government agencies to produce resources, e.g. the Department of Labour\u2019s policy on Transgender People at Work; created dialogues and wrote submissions on systemic issues, e.g. transgender people in prison; trained policy staff in government agencies on SOGII issues, e.g. people who assess refugee applications; and supported transgender people\u2019s participation in guidance for health professionals. The Commission has had limited engagement on intersex issues. The role has mainly been to provide neutral spaces for intersex people to raise issues through two roundtable discussions. Neutral spaces are important because there can be tension between intersex adults, parents and health professionals. The Commission also played a role in marriage equality debates by engaging in dialogue with gay community and faith-based organizations regarding the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of religion and freedom from discrimination. The Commission works closely with gay, transgender and intersex communities and arranges meetings between these communities and government agencies. Resources have been developed to support the work of SOGII community-based organizations in schools. The Commission does not have investigative powers but does conduct mediation to resolve complaints, which is seen as a less costly option than litigation. The Commission could benefit by being linked to regional projects and shared interests, e.g. through the \u2018Being LGBT in Asia\u2019 regional initiative, and the Asia and Pacific Trans Health Blueprint. Community outreach is focused on the issues and events that are important to SOGII communities, e.g. Transgender Day of Remembrance and Pink Shirt Day. The Government of New Zealand made the following statement at the adoption of its UPR report at the Human Rights Council in 2014: \u201cThe New Zealand Government is aware that some issues raised by the Human Rights Commission and NGOs in their UPR submissions were not reflected in the interactive dialogue and Working Group recommendations, for example issues around legal abortion and the rights relating to sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex people. We intend to follow up on these issues separately as part of our commitment to ongoing engagement with civil society on the UPR.\u201d The low level of knowledge by States about transgender and intersex issues is a challenge in using the UPR or treaty processes for advocacy. The UPR process provides opportunities for linking SOGII organizations with other civil society organizations, e.g. children\u2019s rights organizations interested in intersex issues. The Commission is exploring intersections between SOGII and other human rights issues, e.g. children\u2019s rights and forced sterilization for people with disabilities. Treaty bodies and Special Rapporteurs are helping to make the links, e.g. between the Convention Against Torture and sterilization of intersex people or as a requirement for gender recognition. The Human Rights Commission supported SOGII groups to come together through a videoconference and a Facebook page. The SOGII Coalition\u2019s online video was used to summarize their UPR submission including a video presentation to the UN Human Rights Council. 24 Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific 25 Success and challenges in monitoring SOGI human rights: Indonesia Indonesia has been transformed from an authoritarian system to a democracy. Governance has been decentralized to 600 districts and municipalities. Economic development goes hand in hand with improvements in social acceptance and tolerance. The National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) receives 7,000 human rights complaints per year and it is stated that 75 percent of complaints are resolved. Police abuses give rise to many complaints. Businesses and local authorities are also key perpetrators of abuses. The Yogyakarta Principles include integration of SOGI. In Indonesia, this means considering the applicability of the Human Rights Law 39/1999, the Law on Human Rights Court 26/2000, the Law Against Ethnic and Racial Discrimination 40/2008 and the Law on Social Conflict Management 7/2012.

The Yogyakarta Principles are supportive of high social cohesion, which is characterized by inclusion, rule of law, democratic values, access and equal opportunity, an efficient and non-corrupt bureaucracy, and an open society. Success and challenges in monitoring SOGI human rights: Australia The Australian Human Rights Commission Act requires the Commission to adhere to and observe international human rights treaties that guide its research, policy and conciliation functions. The Commission has the power to resolve individual human rights and discrimination complaints through conciliation. Complainants do not have to go through formal court hearings and can access the alternative dispute resolution mechanism of conciliation provided by the Commission at no cost. This function of receiving and conciliating complaints links to the Commission\u2019s monitoring function, as the Commission keeps records of the number and type of complaints received on SOGI and other issues. This enables the Commission to report to Parliament and the public on the human rights issues regularly faced by communities. Australia\u2019s Sex Discrimination Act was amended in 2013 to cover sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status. The Commission has engaged in public education to raise awareness of these new provisions. As it is a new law, as yet there have been few formal complaints received. Similar laws have existed at the sub-national state level for many years, but relatively few complaints have been received under those laws as well. It is unclear if the low level of SOGI complaints indicates that people are unaware of the law or that discrimination is not occurring. It remains unclear to what extent these laws have a positive impact in preventing discrimination. The Commission has the power to intervene in court cases, which it has used in relation to some SOGI issues, e.g. intervening in a High Court case on the interpretation of the Gender Reassignment Act of the state of Western Australia so that a person could be recognized as a particular gender. The Commission can propose improvements to laws relating to human rights through submissions to the parliament or the courts. The Human Rights Commissioner has an amicus power that can be used to assist the courts to interpret new laws such as these SOGI provisions, and thereby inform jurisprudence on these issues as complaints not settled by conciliation come before the courts in the future. The Commission also promotes improved policies and standards, and conducts research to inform policies and programmes. For example, it published the Sex Files: The Legal Recognition of Sex in Documents and Government Records report in 2009, which addressed how sex and gender are addressed in official documents. This led to amendments to federal and state law. The Commission also conducts national advocacy on public policy issues that draws attention to SOGI rights issues. The Commission has power to conduct national inquiries to bring attention to issues of concern. In 2007, the \u2018Same-Sex: Same Entitlements\u2019 Inquiry addressed the equal treatment of same-sex couples in relation to employment and financial entitlements. This resulted in changes to 100 areas of law to ensure equality in these areas. NHRIs have a special function in providing a link between civil society and the state. Many people from SOGI communities are wary of the state and do not trust government or the police. At the state level, there are attempts to expunge past criminal records relating to homosexuality. LGBTI people are diverse in their class, cultures, geography and age. It is important when designing consultations that differences within communities are recognized. The Commission\u2019s current national consultation on SOGI issues is examining laws, policies and practices of government that unduly restrict SOGI rights. The Commission is gathering qualitative information to determine what more can be done to protect SOGI rights. The Commission is making a particular effort to consult with rural, regional and remote communities who often do not have the support services they need to be open about who they are and to be safe. Data has been collected through an online survey completed by 1,500 people and written submissions as well as consultation meetings. A discussion paper is available and a report will be issued in April 2015.

The Commission has worked with different arms of the medical community in drawing attention to the ability of young transgender people to access hormone therapy as part of their gender affirmation process. The Commission has also been working with business, civil society and sporting groups on strategies to bring about change. The Human Rights Commissioner engages in dialogue with Australia\u2019s diverse religious communities on controversial issues such as marriage for same-sex couples and transgender rights issues. This has required engaging with Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities in a respectful dialogue. Experience demonstrates that it is not very successful to appeal to religious scripture as a basis for argument, but rather it is more effective to appeal to common humanity, to make it clear that we are talking about law not religion, and to engage in a 26 Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific 27 conversation about the appropriate role of religion in a pluralist society. A free and open society is necessary if people are to exercise moral judgements. The Commission also works with UN bodies such as treaty bodies and the UPR in the Human Rights Council, which allows it to report on its monitoring function to the international community. Discussion points Myanmar raised concern about segregation of prisoners on the grounds of sexual orientation, which can potentially be a violation of rights but may be required to ensure protection from violence. Participants observed that if segregation for LGBTI prisoners is essential for safety and security, it may be justified. This can require balancing the right to safety and the right to rehabilitation in prisons. Segregation can be used in illegitimate ways and may in effect reduce rehabilitation options and, as a result, may delay access to parole. It is important in any consideration of segregation to talk to the LGBTI prisoners to hear their views. It may be helpful for NHRIs to assist in providing input to standards or guidelines for prison departments and police. There are also concerns regarding the impact on transgender people of segregation of patients in hospitals according to gender. Civil society partners are currently drafting the Asia Pacific Trans Health Blueprint. It will address health care issues and NHRI roles. Indonesia\u2019s Commission on Violence Against Women uses the CEDAW framework to guide its work. CEDAW General Recommendation 28 refers to SOGI as an intersectional issue. It is a crucial step for NHRIs to link SOGI issues to CEDAW. The format of case documentation focuses on sexual and gender-based violence. Indonesia\u2019s Commission on Violence Against Women works with nine different LGBTI groups to inform this work. Opportunities for transgender women to use national gender equality laws for protection could be explored. UNDP worked with UN Women to support civil society groups representing lesbian, transgender and bisexual women in China to submit a shadow report to the CEDAW Committee. Civil society made oral statements to the CEDAW Committee. The formal written observations did not include mention of SOGI issues. However, as a result of the shadow report, for the first time a Chinese Government official stated in public that the Government of China recognizes the rights of all citizens regardless of SOGI and that there will be support to LBGTI NGOs to be registered. The Government of the United States has human rights officers in its embassies and since 2011, these officers are required to report annually on progress towards achievement of the human rights of LGBT people. Therefore, it is important for embassies to hear from NHRIs and civil society about progress on these issues. Monitoring is required to ensure evidence-based responses to the human rights situation of diverse SOGI people. Amicable visits can be an important monitoring strategy. It could be useful for the Southeast Asia National Human Rights Institutions Forum to prepare a collective report to reflect the situation of SOGI rights and this could be a source of dialogue to be proposed to AICHR or discussed in a roundtable. At the Inter-American level, there is a regional convention on violence against women. IACHR had made it clear that lesbian, bisexual and transgender women are able to seek protection under this convention.

On the issue of prisoner\u2019s rights, a recent case at the Inter-American Commission on lack of compliance by the Government of Colombia to ensure intimate partner visits for a lesbian prisoner may be a useful precedent. Advocacy Community assessment of NHRI\u2019s role in advocacy: the Philippines LGBT groups such as the TLF Sexuality, Health and Rights Educators Collective Inc. (TLF SHARE) have partnered with the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines (CHRP) in supporting the Anti-Discrimination Bill. LGBTI groups played a central role in advocating for an Anti-Discrimination Bill since a first draft was developed in 1999. A comprehensive version of the Bill includes LGBT issues as well as other considerations such as age, disability and gender. The Bill includes punitive and preventive measures and support to diversity programmes. The Bill has met with firm opposition from religious groups. Although there is strong resistance to the Bill, the situation is evolving and some progress is occurring. The Philippines is a very religious society, but a recent survey by a national polling firm found 85 percent of Filipinos support equality rights for LGBTI people. There is generally a good relationship between CHRP and LGBTI groups and there has been collaboration in areas such as developing SOGI indicators, improvement of documentation processes and sensitization of staff members. Identification of SOGI focal persons for case referrals has been important. The CHRP is not a monolithic body and sometimes difficulties occur. It is an ongoing process of engagement and future changes in leadership of the Commission may prove challenging. LGBTI organizations have provided training to the Commission\u2019s staff and are hoping to institutionalize reforms so that good practice in relation to SOGI issues is not personality dependent. The CHRP has a special policy on HIV and human rights and it is hoped a special policy can also be developed for SOGI. Use of an HIV framework can be limiting in advocacy. HIV should not be the only measure by which to define the relationships of LGBTI people with the state. The agenda for LGBTI people is one of full citizenship rights, not just health rights. The HIV focus tends to limit the role of the state to mitigating behavioural risks rather than supporting full citizenship entitlements. At the regional level, it would be useful if decriminalization could be tackled by APF members collectively, given the large number of countries covered by APF that still criminalize homosexual conduct. Structural issues such as culture and religion should not paralyse NHRIs in addressing SOGI rights issues. Civil society participants expressed their hope that NHRIs will feel pressured to action. Barriers to action such as religion have been repeatedly identified at prior APF meetings. Civil society is willing to collaborate, but NHRIs are called on to take the lead. Advocacy for creating an enabling legal environment: the Philippines The Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines works closely with civil society to document cases and advocate for an enabling legal environment for LGBTI people. In the Philippines, 85 percent of the population is Christian and religion affects how sexuality is addressed in laws and policies. The Constitution enshrines the role of the family as a central social institution. It has been difficult to pass laws on reproductive health and discrimination. Religious bodies oppose the Anti-Discrimination Bill because of the concern that it will be an entry point for marriage equality for same-sex couples, which religious bodies do not accept. The Philippines has been rated high compared to other countries in the gender equality index and was among the most \u2018gay friendly\u2019 of Asian countries in a recent survey. However, there are many reports of hate crimes, stigma and gender-based violence against LGBTI people, acts of discrimination in the workplace and education 28 Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific 29 settings, bullying, harassment, and restriction of gender expression. Requirements to wear a school uniform can be an issue for lesbian women. LGBTI people are also excluded from social protection policies. CHRP has formally documented only sixteen LGBTI cases so far, although anecdotally discrimination is thought to be common.

Several active LGBTI organizations have conducted research on violations of rights. ACHIEVE, TLF SHARE and Rainbow Rights have conducted research on gender-based violence.

Policy changes still needs to happen in these areas to promote equality and reduce discrimination. TLF SHARE has provided training and capacity-building on SOGI and HIV issues for CHRP investigators, lawyers and information officers. The CHRP acted as amicus curiae in the Supreme Court case that upheld the right of Ang Ladlad to be registered as a political party. It should be noted that although the party won the case, it has recently been delisted by the Commission on Elections due to the party unable to obtain sufficient voter support to be listed as an official party. CHRP works with the Department of Interior and Local Government to develop gender and SOGI modules and to conduct trainings of trainers. Local leaders are resistant to addressing LGBTI issues and gender equality between males and females, so education is required. Gender Ombud Guidelines are under development based on the Magna Carta of Women passed in 2009, which designates the Commission as the Gender and Development Ombud. CHRP is seeking to address the rights of women, children and SOGI diverse populations in these Guidelines. Consultations on how to address SOGI and other gender issues are being held with civil society, the Department of Education, the Department of Employment, the Commission on Women, local government, the Office of the Ombudsman and the Civil Service Commission. Investigation protocols are also being drafted for sensitive handling of cases. The current Chair of the CHRP, Etta Rosales, was the proponent of the 1999 Anti-Discrimination Bill when she was in Congress. There are now two versions of the Bill. A version of the Bill addressing only SOGI issues has recently passed the Women\u2019s Committee. A version of the Bill covering all grounds (SOGI, gender, disability, ethnicity, age etc.) is awaiting approval from the Human Rights Committee. CHRP supports both versions of the Bill and has conducted dialogues bringing together different disadvantaged groups to develop alliances and share experiences of marginalization. CHRP has supported the establishment of a working group as a coalition to push and strategize for the passage of the bill. Parallel to national efforts, the CHRP works with local government units to engage in dialogue with local leaders and community members to support passage of local or municipal Anti-Discrimination Ordinances. Challenges include the changing membership of the CHRP as new Commissioners are appointed, trying to mainstream SOGI across the work of CHRP and its commissioners, lack of knowledge and engagement of other national government agencies on SOGI and LGBTI issues, and opposition from religious leaders and some members of Congress. There is a lack of unity among different proponents of the Comprehensive Anti- Discrimination Bill, with some ethnic minorities wanting to exclude SOGI from the Bill so that the Bill can pass in Congress. Legal barriers include court decisions preventing change in registration for transgender people and uncertainty on the applicability of the Magna Carta on Women and CEDAW provisions to transgender issues. For example, the Philippine Commission on Women has argued that the Magna Carta on Women is restricted to biological women. Advocacy for creating an enabling legal environment: Republic of Korea The National Human Rights Commission of Korea has legal responsibilities in relation to gender equality and responding to discrimination based on sexual orientation, and is active in monitoring LGBTI rights. Article 2(3) of the National Human Rights Commission Act states that the Commission has a role in relation to discriminatory acts based on gender, sexual orientation and numerous other grounds. The Commission identifies laws and regulations that need to be amended to comply with non-discrimination requirements. A challenge that urgently needs to be addressed is the military offence of homosexual conduct. Men are required to serve two years of compulsory military service. Article 92(6) of the Military Criminal Law defines consensual sexual activities among persons of the same sex in the military as indecent sexual assault with prison penalties. In 2011, the Constitutional Court upheld the legal validity of this Article on the grounds of ensuring discipline and morale in the military, but the Commission remains concerned about its discriminatory impact. The Commission includes LGBTI issues in human rights education courses provided for public officials, teachers, police and journalists. The Commission has made recommendations in the following areas to remove discriminatory provisions: \u2022 Human rights violations and discrimination in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "805425ff-1580-4a2b-9469-a4c7ef13834b": {"__data__": {"id_": "805425ff-1580-4a2b-9469-a4c7ef13834b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-workshop-role-national-human-rights-institutions-promoting-and-protecting-rights-including-health-lgbti-people-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a816b6bf0d50ed548650e33a54aa58810c4931f166d2495b472463a65e62c821"}}, "hash": "a816b6bf0d50ed548650e33a54aa58810c4931f166d2495b472463a65e62c821", "text": "the military (2006). \u2022 Discrimination against sexual minority groups in using local government facilities (2012). Local authorities provide information to the community by displaying banners or placards with news about local events. An LGBT group requested that these banners include reference to the 10 percent of local residents belonging to sexual minority groups. Officials in local government refused the request. Their decision was based on prejudice and a misunderstanding of SOGI issues, and the Commission opposed it. Human rights experts and citizens assisted drafting the Seoul City Human Rights Convention in 2014. The draft Charter included the right to not to be discriminated against based on sexual orientation or identity. However, under pressure from religious groups, the Mayor rejected the Charter. LGBTI groups then conducted a high profile sit-in protest event in the city to bring publicity to LGBTI rights issues. Another recent issue was the withdrawal of budget support of USD$55,000 in 2014 to an LGBTI community project, the Youth Rainbow Support Centre. It was intended to provide counselling and support, but the local government withdrew support, based on complaints. The evangelical churches also played a leading role in preventing progressive human rights laws from being enacted that would have supported LGBTI rights. The draft Anti-Discrimination Law was withdrawn in 2013 and the Human Rights Education Law was withdrawn in 2014. The Commission\u2019s education and awareness raising activities are used to address SOGI-related discrimination. In 2014, the Commission met with LGBTI communities and activists to identify their priority concerns to incorporate in the Commission\u2019s fact- finding research to be published in 2015. Positive changes are possible and new bills have been drafted to modify the discriminatory article in the Military Criminal Law and to introduce a Student Human Rights Ordinance. Courts have ruled in recent years to prioritize psychological and social factors over biological in addressing the rights of transgender people to reassign their documented sex in official documents. Data from the Pew Research Centre on public attitudes to same-sex marriage confirm a rapid change in views, with support rising from 18 percent in 2007 to 39 percent in 2013. It is thought that a significant factor is the impact of a TV drama aired in 2010 that covered the rights of homosexual people and the impact of discrimination. The Commission surveys newspaper and TV coverage of issues of sexual minorities and their discrimination to determine their role. Attitudes are changing and evolving, so the Commission is hopeful for progress despite obstacles. 30 Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific 31 Discussion points Experience of court decisions across Asia has been extremely varied. For example, in the Republic of Korea there was tension around the case that challenged the actions of government in censoring all gay and lesbian websites. The court found that the censorship was not unlawful. However, the Human Rights Commission issued an opinion stating there had been overreach by government in the censorship of websites. The Government of the Republic of Korea subsequently accepted the NHRI position, in effect overruling the court decision. The judgement of the case of the Supreme Court of the Philippines that denied transgender people the right to change their identity in documents began with quotations from the Bible and the Koran. This raises the question of whether courts and governments are secular. When the Ang Ladlad case was considered by the Supreme Court, there was concern that the Court would again base its decision on religious grounds following the transgender case. However, the Court\u2019s decision in the Ang Ladlad case was among the strongest pro-LGBTI decisions in Asia. In India, health was the entry point for the Delhi High Court decision (which decriminalized homosexuality until the decision was later overturned by the Supreme Court). There had been a split between the Ministry of Justice seeking to uphold the sodomy offences and the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) that opposed the criminal law on the grounds that it made HIV prevention and delivery of health services more difficult. The Supreme Court judgement made the surprising statement that the sodomy law only affects a \u201cminiscule section\u201d of the population. Many of the provisions of human rights laws enable NHRIs to intervene in cases as amicus curiae to help courts to interpret the law.

Programme of Action and Support Over the course of the workshop, participants broke into groups and devised actions that NHRIs could consider undertaking in relation to capacity-building, research, education, promotion, dialogue, monitoring and advocacy that are consistent with their human rights mandates. UNDP and APF also offered practical support to NHRIs. These actions and offers of support are captured in the following Programme of Action and Support by NHRIs in relation to promoting and protecting the rights of people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex. Annex 1 Programme of Action and Support On 24 and 25 February 2015, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (APF) organized and co-sponsored a Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) People in Asia and the Pacific. The workshop was convened with support from the \u2018Being LGBT in Asia\u2019 programme \u2013 funded by UNDP, USAID, the Embassy of Sweden in Bangkok and the Multi- Country South Asia Regional HIV Programme funded by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The workshop was organized in cooperation with the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health (APCOM), and held at the United Nations Convention Centre in Bangkok, Thailand. The workshop included: \u2022 Representatives of APF members including the NHRIs of Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Samoa, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste; \u2022 Representatives of UNDP and UNAIDS; \u2022 Representatives of civil society including APCOM, ASEAN SOGIE Caucus (ASC), TLF Share Collective, the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC), Transaction and South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation in Law (SAARCLAW); \u2022 Representatives of Komnas Perempuan, Indonesia; \u2022 Representatives of governments including the United States of America and Sweden; \u2022 Representatives of regional bodies including the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights; \u2022 Expert individuals; and \u2022 Representatives of the APF secretariat. The workshop was facilitated by two Co-Chairpersons: \u2022 Professor Vitit Muntarbhorn, International Human Rights Expert and Professor of Law, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand; \u2022 Adjunct Professor Chris Sidoti, International Human Rights Expert, Australia. The objectives of the workshop were: 1. To discuss the engagement of NHRIs in the region in the promotion and protection of the human rights of people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity in light of the Yogyakarta Principles and the progress achieved in implementing the recommendations of the APF\u2019s 2009 Yogyakarta Principles Meeting and the Advisory Council of Jurists Report of December 2010, as well as recommendations from the Regional Report on the Capacity of National Human Rights Institutions to Address Human Rights in Relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity (SOGI) and HIV. 2. In the light of that review, to agree on priorities for strengthened engagement by NHRIs on human rights and health issues in relation to SOGI in the period 2015\u20132017. 3. To identify needs for capacity-building, training, regional exchanges of experiences and other support that may be included in forthcoming regional development programming, and to make recommendations to UN bodies and other development partners accordingly. The following actions were recommended for careful consideration by NHRIs, recognizing that NHRIs operate in varying cultural, political, social and religious contexts, and that the implementation of recommendations in each country will reflect domestic considerations. UNDP and APF will carefully consider the recommendations directed to them in accordance with their organizational strategic plans and financial resources. 32 Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific Report of the Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific 33 Capacity-building 1.

Their roles include the provision of basic services such as primary education, health, water and sanitation; participating in local planning and budgeting; advocating for human rights and the needs and priorities of their constituency especially the marginalised groups; providing shelter, counseling and support services to disadvantaged groups and victims of violence; monitoring the performance of government and other stakeholders in the provision of services; and more generally, progress towards the MDGs. It is widely recognised that an active and vibrant civil society is an important factor in the democratisation process. By mediating between the state and citizenry, civil society provides the mechanism to enhance citizens\u2019 voice and the engagement of citizens in various democratic processes that contributes to deepening democracy. While CSOs are expected to perform these varied functions, they face a range of capacity constraints and challenges. The challenges vary from organization to organization and are different in each country. They include: constraints relating to the overall external environment within which civil society operates; specific internal organizational capacity deficits that affect their ability to perform effectively and efficiently; and for many, a lack of financial resources and stability for funding their programmes or projects. This capacity assessment of civil society organizations in the Pacific is an attempt to undertake a systematic assessment to understand and document the capacity constraints that civil society organizations face in this region. Mindful of the sensitivity of such an exercise, the capacity assessment was conducted in a participatory manner in the development of the questionnaire, in the conduct of the assessment itself, and in the validation of the results. This Report of the capacity assessment is a synthesis of main findings and an overall picture of the capacity development challenges in five priority areas. It also identifies strengths and weaknesses, and specifically focuses on capacity gaps. We hope this publication will provide readers with an understanding of the capacity development issues that affect civil society organizations in the Pacific region, and shed light on how they could be better supported and strengthened to advance and achieve better development outcomes for the region as a whole.

Like much of the rest of the world, they are experiencing the impacts of globalisation, non-sustainable development policies and, more recently, increased focus on the threat of terrorism. The proportion of the population under the basic need poverty line is rising1 and rural-urban migration is leading to urbanisation and squatter settlement growth. Civil unrest and political instability in some PICs highlight the importance of urgent governance issues. These challenges are compounded by PICs\u2019 limited geographical size and location, their dependence on narrow resource bases, limited international trade opportunities, and their particular vulnerability to natural and environmental disasters. While work is being done to develop the capacity of governments in the region to achieve the MDGs, the engagement of Pacific civil society organizations (CSOs) in this process is equally critical. UNDP has long recognized that sustainable human development, with people at the centre, cannot be achieved without the robust engagement of civil society and its organizations.2 CSOs are uniquely positioned to connect with people, create awareness of people\u2019s needs, and advocate for solutions. They have the comparative advantage of non- bureaucratised and responsive structures, and a willingness to address sensitive issues. They have first hand information about \u2018on the ground\u2019 issues, constraints and local challenges, and the actions and commitment needed to address them. In the Pacific region, CSOs represent a critical constituency and development partner for advancing towards the MDGs. There are currently more than 1,000 CSOs operating in the region at different levels, covering a wide spectrum of issues. This ranges from disabilities, youth, gender, trade, health, environment, culture and governance. Over 85 percent of CSOs in the Pacific are involved in activities that are aimed at promoting or achieving the MDGs.3 The CSO community therefore potentially represents a force to be reckoned with for creating positive change in the region. The reality, however, is that this potential is constrained by the numerous challenges that CSOs face. Their legitimacy is frequently questioned by governments, with many governments viewing them with skepticism and distrust, and vice versa. There is a lack of structured mechanisms to ensure that civil society priorities are given serious consideration. Dialogue between CSOs and governments are often ad hoc, unsupported by any institutional legal frameworks. In addition, CSOs face various capacity challenges. Many of them do not have stable funding sources and rely on unpredictable, donor-driven project funding. Chronic limited human resource capacity, the inability to recruit and retain high quality staff, and high staff turnover are other areas where CSOs face urgent capacity challenges. These deficits impact their effectiveness and credibility to provide citizens with a voice, and also engage with governments and stakeholders in substantive dialogues on key development issues. UNDP\u2019s Pacific Centre is focused on bringing about change in the region \u201cwhile reflecting on the need to build capacity and local ownership.\u201d4 Given the challenges required to foster higher levels of human development in the region, and the constraints encountered by CSOs in contributing to development, the Centre identified the need to conduct an extensive regional study aimed at assessing capacity development challenges of CSOs. While CSOs have undergone disparate self- assessment initiatives with external facilitators, there has not been a systematic region-wide effort to map out and examine their capacity development A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 2 3 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific needs.

The study also assessed the socio-economic, politico-cultural and legal environment in which CSOs operate. The overall environment, which includes the country\u2019s policy and legal framework and state-society relation, can fundamentally impact the functioning of civil society. The \u2018rules of the game\u2019 influence the manner in which CSOs interact with citizens and with their governments. A proper understanding of the enabling environment is critical to understanding the factors that influence capacity development, and therefore, the design of capacity development strategies and activities. The study was carried out during 2008-2009. Field work was conducted in six PICs: \u2022\ufffd Cook\ufffdIslands\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Federated\ufffdStates\ufffdof\ufffdMicronesia\ufffd(FSM) \u2022\ufffd Fiji\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Solomon\ufffdIslands\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Tonga\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Tuvalu\ufffd The study also included Pacific Regional NGOs (PRNGOs), which represent networks of national CSOs at the regional level. While the in-country visits and one-one-interaction with participants occurred in the six countries, information and data were also obtained via email from CSOs in Pacific countries other than the six. This Integrated Report presents the results of the capacity assessment study, and an overall picture of capacity development challenges in five priority areas. It covers a broad spectrum of issues within these five areas, ranging from CSO capacity for strategic planning and their infrastructural and internal management systems, to resource mobilisation issues and current capacity development activities. While both strengths and capacity assets are highlighted, the Report\u2019s focus is on capacity deficits (areas of weaknesses). Systemic inadequacies which challenge and impede the overall development and functioning of CSOs are also highlighted. The Report is presented in sections. Section 2 presents the methodological approach used in the capacity assessment exercise, including a discussion on a Clearing House Framework which provided the framework for the assessment exercise. It presents the scale that was used to measure and rank the capacity levels of CSOs along five priority areas of the Framework. Section 3 provides an overview of CSOs in the region, exploring their areas of work and programmatic foci. The results of the capacity assessment in the five priority areas are separately explored in Sections 4 to 8. Each section presents the ranking of CSOs in the five areas, and includes discussions on both existing capacities and strengths. The main focus, however, is on identifying the capacity gaps of CSOs. Data variability across countries is highlighted whenever relevant. Section 9 moves on to a more in-depth discussion of capacity strengths and weaknesses, which are not confined to a single area but rather, overlap, interlink, and span across axes. This section here also focuses more on the capacity gaps since understanding how these gaps play out requires greater attention. It highlights relevant examples of successful capacity building initiatives in the region which may inform and assist in the planning of future capacity development initiatives. The conclusion of Section 10 calls for a comprehensive approach to capacity development within the Pacific CSO community, and suggests building upon existing or past initiatives which have met with success. It presents key principles that must underline capacity development initiatives, including adapting training approaches to the specific regional context in order to create maximum value and sustainability.

The capacity assessment exercise of this study built upon the Framework, and thus adopted an endogenously-endorsed, legitimate instrument for evaluating capacity of CSOs, instead of utilising a framework developed externally. Box 2.1. What is the Clearing House Framework? In order to ensure that the capacity assessment exercise of this study involved an inside-out process, it was constructed around the Clearing House Framework\u2014a capacity development framework created by and for Pacific CSOs to strengthen civil society capacity in the region. The Framework is the end result of a three-year participatory process based on a series of stakeholder workshops, which were borne out of common concerns on capacity building needs and priorities of Pacific regional NGOs. In 2000, a regional stakeholder workshop identified five priority areas requiring joint actions for NGOs, donors, governments: organizational development; information sharing and communication; NGO sustainability and funding; stakeholder relations; legal and regulatory frameworks. These action areas provided a broad framework upon which to build future endeavours. A second work in 2001 modified the original agenda to ensure that PRNGOs could meet independently with their stakeholders to discuss any concerns arising out of the consultation processes and formulate collective priorities. The Pacific Islands Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (PIANGO) was also unanimously endorsed in this meeting as the lead agency in coordinating efforts to strengthen civil society in the Pacific. At the third multi-stakeholder workshop in 2005, NGO participants committed to the implementation of a Clearing House Framework which outlined a collaborative plan of action. The Framework consisted of six areas of NGO collaboration for capacity building efforts in the Pacific: \u2022 Organizational development \u2022 Information sharing and communication \u2022 NGO sustainability and funding \u2022 Stakeholder relations \u2022 Legal and regulatory frameworks \u2022 Advocacy.

A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 6 7 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific The assessment exercise adapted priority areas identified by the Framework into five axes of CSO \u2018capacity\u2019.

Field Work The assessment exercise was based on a detailed questionnaire which collected baseline data on each of the axes, and included training-needs assessments and internal-focused and external-focused SWOT analyses. A preliminary version of the questionnaire was first presented to CSO representatives at a forum held in Suva, Fiji in July 2008. Feedback from the forum restructured the questionnaire around the Clearing House Framework. The re- worked questionnairei was presented to PRNGOs in December 2008. A final draft of the questionnaire was completed after feedback from this meeting. The table below presents a summary of the areas assessed under the five axes (Table 2.1). Criteria for selecting countries included those with a large and active domestic CSO community, at least one micro-state, examples of countries with wide and geographically dispersed islands, those with a relatively localised spread, and a minimal spread across the three socio-cultural regions of the Pacific\u2014Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. PRNGOs were included in the study group because of their unique nature and regional spread. This Report will henceforth refer to the Pacific CSOs of this study as \u2018CSOs\u2019. In cases, when there is need to distinguish between domestic and PRNGOs, the former is identified as \u2018national CSOs\u2019. Fieldwork began in January 2009. Prior to the start of the field work, researchers liaised with the National Liaison Unit (NLU), the national peak body CSO in each of the PIC, to arrange for a comprehensive sector-wide representation of CSOs to participate in the study.

While the questionnaire was the main instrument for data collection, the in-country field work also included CSO group consultations which included the presence of a PRNGO representative to ensure the participation of PRNGOs, and to ensure that the processes of consultation were properly observed. Furthermore, after the completion of the draft of the country assessment, a workshop was organized to discuss the findings and obtain further clarifications and inputs from CSOs. Rating Scale The capacity of each CSO in the five axes was measured on a four-point scale involving four incremental stages of development. This scale is based on a Stage of Organizational Development Model which has been adapted by those used by international development agencies to measure organizational development.5 The tool uses a four- point scale (see Table 2.2). The four-point scale provides a clear picture of the specific developmental stage of CSOs as well as their path of progress into the next. Table 2.3 further presents the descriptors for each level and their relation to one another in the context of this study. The instrument was developed to be relatively generic in order to ensure utilisation across the entire CSO community in the Pacific. Various text boxes throughout the instrument provided areas where information specific to each CSO\u2019s particular context could be provided. The four-point scale was then applied to the five axes of capacity, provided in Table 2.1, along which each organization was measured. It should be noted that this tool can only identify relative, not absolute, values of organizational performance and capacity. Moreover, while they provide a clear division of the four levels, the ratings, being dependent on the research team\u2019s interpretation of the capacity needs of each organization, are also best taken as indicative. The analysis of the data from the field work was done in the following manner. The individual scores for each CSO in each country were summed arithmetically. Then, based on the average score of each of the six countries, the average of all the six countries was taken as the rough measure of their level of capacity development as a whole on the four- point scale. These data tabulated was used as the basis of this study\u2019s analyses, in conjunction with the other data gathered during the assessment processii. The rankings, overall and per axis, are presented in various sections of this Report. A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 8 9 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific Table 2.2.

Stakeholder relations and its relationship with the legal and regulatory environment are in place, and at times may be functioning inconsistently. Expanding The CSO has a track record of achievement. Its work is recognised by community stakeholders, government and other CSOs in the same sector.

Section 3 Overview of Pacific CSOs A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 10 11 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific The architecture of the CSO community in the Pacific region is a two-tier structure. One consists of national CSOs at the country level, while the other consists of PRNGOs, composed of regional CSOs whose members are national umbrella organizations (Box 3.1). Established as informal groupings in 2002 to advance the process of regionalisation in the Pacific, PRNGOs serve as the mechanism for CSOs\u2019 engagement with inter-governmental regional organizations or agencies. Box 3.1. The Work of Pacific Regional NGOs (PRNGOs) There are several constituency-based civil society bodies working at the regional level in the Pacific region. They form a regional platform known as the Pacific Regional NGOs Alliance (PRNGO Alliance). These regional bodies span range of size and mission, and are involved in varied sectors, ranging from service provision to women, disability, faith based social services and human rights to democracy and NGO capacity building. There are currently 13 organizations within the Alliance: \u2022 Council of Pacific Education (COPE) \u2022 Pacific Disability Forum (PDF) \u2022 Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Centre (FWCC) \u2022 Foundations of the People of the South Pacific (FSPI) \u2022 Greenpeace \u2022 Pacific Foundation for the Advancement", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5230d54c-4f45-4bc6-a878-b730b095bf31": {"__data__": {"id_": "5230d54c-4f45-4bc6-a878-b730b095bf31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a19d23bcf601f8bc1fd7ee0d0c667142428cf1fa0684847705ea02d60544d07"}, "3": {"node_id": "a4bbb11d-8bc9-4e39-8a27-24900aa3792a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54d48b59c6dbed6c6219a27f181d7c162212f2d04b5e8c7c4c4309787b2881b3"}}, "hash": "c34a132709c8ed3eb8537d316aab05a814490d457a42d44625ee806ec50fef03", "text": "of Women (PACFAW) \u2022 Pacific Concerns Resource Centre (PCRC) \u2022 Pacific Islands Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (PIANGO) \u2022 Pacific Islands News Association (PINA) \u2022 South Pacific Oceania Council of Trade Unions (SPOCTU) \u2022 Pacific Council of Churches (PCC) \u2022 World Wide Fund (WWF) \u2022 Pacific Network on Globalization (PANG) These regional organizations have heavy responsibilities, but varied levels of buy-in and mandate from their constituents. They are a mixed group in terms of capacity, and can be placed in two categories: i) those with a long history of delivery, strong leadership, high profile and well resourced; ii) those that have experienced uncertainty and constant change, weak leadership, and poor organizational capacity. A majority of PRNGOs do have the potential to influence that the collective voice of the Pacific is heard at the highest levels. Like their domestic counterparts, however, they face concerns about their legitimacy and accountability. Moreover, they have to facilitate the complex act of \u2018building partnerships\u2019 and coordinating with local, national, regional and international CSOs, governments and the private sector. A number of PRNGOs are also currently experiencing significant changes including mergers, senior staff replacements, shifts in donor priorities, and resulting withdrawal of traditional funding sources. During the consultation process of this study, the option of sharing resources between regional organizations was strongly supported, as was the development of templates and tools to assist with technical issues such as financial management, business planning, human resource processes and funding. Sharing of human resources was also another suggestion (for example, PRNGOs with UN/ AusAID volunteers could share this resource with other PRNGOs). All these suggestions require a high level of coordination among the regional bodies before they can be operationalised however. Building management capabilities and good governance are urgently required in this sector. \u2022\ufffd Charitable\ufffdActivities\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Sustainable\ufffdAgriculture/Food\ufffdSecurity\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Disability\ufffdAdvocacy\ufffd The consultation processes of this study revealed two reasons behind the considerable range in the activities of national CSOs. The first was that the holistic nature of activities meant that CSOs often worked across sectors. For example, the work in the youth sector naturally overlapped with education, gender and HIV/AIDS. The other reason had to do with a more troubling aspect in the CSO community. The dependency on donor funding and the uncertainty of funding sources meant that CSOs were often engaged in a \u2018race to the middle\u2019 for funding sources. Their focus thus shifted according to donor priorities, resulting in varying and diverse work programmes. This important issue is discussed in detail in Section 4. In the context of linkage to the MDGs, a number of national CSOs consulted in the study had not heard of the MDGs. A larger number, while being aware of the MDGs, did not explicitly base their programming around them. Despite this, their diverse programmatic areas meant that there was overlap with various MDG sectors (Table 3.2). The highest degree of overlap was in the gender and environment fields (particularly in the case of Tuvalu).v At the country level, CSOs consist of various network and stand-alone organizations operating at the national and or sub-national levels, including various community-based and faith based organizations. CSOs in the Pacific region work on diverse and broad ranging issues. While some focus on the MDGs, a number of them work on other sectors, ranging from education to disability advocacy (Table 3.1). Youth and health are focus areas of many CSOs in the region across countries. Many national CSOs also have secondary areas of programmatic focus. PRNGOs, on the other hand, are more focused on specific areas of expertise, as are CSOs which are the local counterparts of international CSOs such as the WWF. NLUs also focus exclusively on their primary work programme, which is the coordination and promotion of the CSOs within their countries. Besides the issues listed in Table 3.1, other areas of operation for CSOs are: \u2022\ufffd Research\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Employee\ufffdRights\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Disaster\ufffdPreparedness\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Community\ufffdDevelopment\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Disarmament\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Media\ufffdFreedom\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Good\ufffdGovernance\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Social\ufffdJustice\ufffd iii These are specifically CSOs consulted in the capacity assessment study.

A number of CSOs noted multiple MDGs in which they worked. Where this was the case all responses are noted in this table. This key below provides a colour breakdown of the number of CSOs that reported working on various MDGs. V Given Tuvalu\u2019s perilous environmental situation in the wake of global warming, it is not surprising that a very large percentage of Tuvalu CSOs in the assessment process felt that their work positively contributed to the environmental MDG. It is less certain why Tuvalu scored so highly in terms of the gender field. The rationale may simply be that a high number of Tuvaluan CSOs see much value in supporting gender issues. Table 3.2.

The global partnerships MDG, perceived as something outside their sphere of expertise, was also not an area of focus for many CSOs. A notable point that emerged during the consultation process, and which is not made clear in Table 3.2, is that CSOs that were affiliated to PRNGOs tended to have a greater awareness of the MDGs than those that were not affiliated. In terms of approaches, while most CSOs in the study indicated that their work adopted both a human-rights based approach and gender mainstreaming focus, it was never clear exactly how these approaches were articulated in their activities. Participants indicated, rather, that human rights and gender issues necessarily and implicitly underpinned their work. There was however no clear apparent linkage in their programming to explicit protocols, or to the general principles on issues of human rights or gender articulated by agencies like the United Nations. Some gender-focused CSOs, like the National Councils of Women, did utilise as reference specific international instruments such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in their activities. Section 4 Organizational Development A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 14 15 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific Capacity development is more than the development of individual skills. A truly comprehensive capacity- development approach enables the embedding of individual gains and learning into organizational structures and processes (rather than resting solely with the individual). Institutional arrangements which enable this, in terms of strategic planning, monitoring processes, and encouraging knowledge building at broader organizational levels, are such key capacities. CSOs in the Pacific region as a whole, including PRNGOs, scored only reasonably well in this area of organizational development. With an overall section rating of 2.91 in the four-point scale, CSOs possess an emerging level of capacity in this axis, except for those in Tonga and Cook Islands (Table 4.1). There are some areas where CSOs have a strong record. CSOs appear to have good linkages with their end-users, and have a solid reputation, within their own sector and among stakeholders, of being able to deliver outputs. It must be noted, however, that in some countries tensions have begun to emerge in recent years due to the presence of international NGOs with substantial resources and the capacity to drive greater levels of change. This has led to raised expectations about the kind of changes national CSOs can also initiate. Consequently, there has been decline in the legitimacy of national CSOs in the eyes of their end users in some countries.

On the other hand, the organizational set- up for exchanging information internally among staff about work activities, or even about employment and personnel practices, is not very strong. This could partly be attributed to the high workload of staff which does not leave them with much time to keep one another updated on their respective activities. vi At the same time, respondents of the study claimed that the same high levels of dedication and intensity of individuals working in CSOs were occasionally turned against each other due to intense competition between them for funding, particularly within countries.

It plays a valuable role in the success of CSOs, and is a major strength.

The first is the realm of strategy (the ability to strategically plan and implement organizational change). The data shows that CSOs are unable to adequately plan at a strategic level, and even in cases when it done, to transform this planning into concrete operational goals. The second is in terms of the formal systems and processes within organizations (internal operating processes and systems). The weaknesses in this area are wide-ranging, from inadequate monitoring and evaluation systems to a lack of maintenance of formal policies and procedures for day-to-day operations. Strategy A key capacity gap of CSOs in the region is their lack of ability to undertake strategic planning processes and break them down into operational plans. While many CSOs in the study had strategic plans in place, these plans, besides being outdated, did not always match available resources and existing capacity. Even in cases where a relatively robust strategic plan was in place, there were no clear ways by which it could be transferred to an operational level on the ground. Strategic planning thus had little real value for CSOs that were consulted in this study. One reason behind this breakdown is internal. CSO staff members generally lack the skills to plan strategically and transfer them into associated operational activities. The gap is further compounded by weaknesses in the set-up and operations of organizational boards. CSO organizational boards across the region, which have the mandate to provide solid strategic advice across a range of functions, are ill equipped to do so. As indicated in Table 4.1, a majority of questions on the organizational boards show scores only in the \u2018emerging\u2019 range. Almost all CSOs in the study had governing boards in place, in some basic form, but almost no CSOs had formal induction processes for their board members, or formal training on the roles and responsibilities required of them. Clearly defined roles or policies on the boards\u2019 operation did not exist. Thus, a lack of formal protocols in areas such as conflict resolution between board and management, for example, impeded timely resolution of problems whenever they arose. A lack of measures in place for the boards to manage senior staff performance made it difficult during the consultation process to assess whether such processes were in accordance with the broader strategic plan of the organization. Such gaps make apparent the lack of continuity between strategic planning and operation planning. Board members also did not have appropriate mix of skills to effectively govern their organizations. They were composed of constituent stakeholders (who often had very low levels of formal education) and local individuals who occupied prominent positions in vii At the same time, respondents of the study claimed that the same high levels of dedication and intensity of individuals working in CSOs were occasionally turned against each other due to intense competition between them for funding, particularly within countries. Agencies, such as National Liaison Units, may be able to play a strong role in reducing this conflict, and help local CSOs work more closely in a cooperative manner. wider society. While constituent stakeholders played a useful role in ensuring that programming reflected needs of their communities, they could not effectively contribute to technical aspects, such as financial planning. On the other hand, the latter group of socially prominent board members, who were able to contribute with technical skills, were unable able to provide required time as board members due to numerous demands on their schedules. A second key reason for the breakdown in strategic planning and processes is external. The main funders of CSOs are external donors who, more often than not, have \u2018ready-made ideas\u2019 of the types of programmes and projects that want to fund. Given the tight nature of funding regimes in the Pacific region, only a very small number of CSOs are able to pick and choose the types of funding they will accept. The result of this is that the operational activities of a majority of CSOs rarely match strategic plans, even if they have them in place. A more detailed discussion of this issue follows in Section 5. Systems and Processes While the majority of CSOs have established some degree of systems and processes, their effectiveness is in question. Many of the systems and processes are informal without written administrative procedures. This looseness may lie in the fact that many CSOs begin as volunteer organizations, functioning on the basis of personal relations and implicit rather than explicit rules (Box 4.1). This flexibility impacts CSOs in a number of ways. It makes them particularly vulnerable to loss of institutional memory when key", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b8a9b04-a684-45a2-9e33-c3f3c308dee0": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b8a9b04-a684-45a2-9e33-c3f3c308dee0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2283d6a42ffcb130d062b08dd0849921c15fde7873c4367d5715a0e824ce81b"}}, "hash": "e2283d6a42ffcb130d062b08dd0849921c15fde7873c4367d5715a0e824ce81b", "text": "individuals leave, and also makes difficult the process of succession planning. That CSOs, in general, did not score well in terms of having clearly defined recruitment, employment and personnel practices, can also be attributed to gaps in formal systems and processes. The area under this axis that stands out as one with extremely low capacity is that of reporting, monitoring, and evaluation. During the consultation processes, there was consensus among CSOs that their lack of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and skills was a major systemic gap across the region. As Table 4.1 informs, only PRNGOs and CSOs of Tuvalu, with a score of 3.00, seem to possess monitoring and evaluation mechanisms that are built into organizational plans. Solomon Island, on the other hand, scored one of the lowest capacity scores in the entire assessment exercise\u20141.62\u2014 in terms of having the capacity to use information gained from such systems to inform their operations. Box 4.1. Volunteerism And Pacific CSOS: \u2018Just Get Down and do the Work\u2019 While the number of volunteer staff in CSOs vary, there are very few national CSOs without volunteers on staff (only about 30 percent), and these are mainly the domestic counterparts of international CSOs such as Red Cross and WWF. About 20 percent of the CSOs consulted for this study were entirely staffed by volunteers. Volunteers come from two main sources: interested locals and overseas agencies (iPeace Corp, Japanese International Cooperation Agency, United Nations Volunteers, Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development, Australian Volunteers International). Many CSOs in the Pacific region begin as volunteer organizations. This could partly be the reason why many of them do not possess formal operational structures and processes. Instead they function on the basis of loose, implicit, de facto rules. For the locals, working as volunteers is a way for them to transition into paid work. A number of CSOs reported that many of their employees begin as volunteers and then transitioned to paid staff as and when funds become available. CSOs also utilise community volunteers for particular projects on an \u2018as-needed\u2019 basis. A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 18 19 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific This flexible manner of operation lends itself to organizational development in a number of ways. During the consultation for this study, some staff members claimed that the lack of a strict formal structure actually helped in their performance since it made them more flexible and open to change. They attested to a just \u2018get down and do the work\u2019 spirit in their approach, without a need for formal organizational structures. At the same time, absence of formal structures and systems leave CSOs vulnerable to a host of \u2018deficiencies\u2019 that impact their overall development, not least of which is a loss of institutional memory when individuals leave. A case in point comes from the Solomon Islands, where a major national CSO with a solid record of results and achievements almost collapsed during a change in senior leadership. When the two founders of the organization left, the remaining staff, who were only focused on their particular roles, did not know how the organization\u2019s various activities came together. Due to a lack of formal documented processes to ensure transfer of institutional knowledge, the organization almost went under, and recovered only after a new CEO put in a great amount of work. This case shows that even large, effective CSOs in the region are vulnerable to problems emerging out of the capacity gaps in the area of systems and processes. This weakness has wide-ranging impacts in the functioning of CSOs. They are unable to adequately capture data and measure effectiveness vis-\u00e0-vis inputs, outputs, outcomes and impacts. Thus CSOs have no comprehensive knowledge of what is working and what is not, and why. (The lack of reporting data also lead CSOs to spend a disproportionate amount of time attempting to satisfy donors\u2019 accountability requirements for fund disbursement). This lack of data also means that CSOs remain uninformed on whether they are using their limited resources in the most effective ways. For example, while many of the CSOs under consultation were able to provide data on the disbursement of funds for their programmes and advocacy work, it was only a very few that were able to provide comparable data on the actual impact of their work. An inability to effectively monitor impact implies that they may not be optimizing their financial resources. While there is no need for CSOs to possess extraordinarily complex monitoring and evaluation systems, there is certainly a need for them to possess a rudimentary knowledge of, and ability to utilise, reporting, monitoring,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "664d3574-e809-4ca8-b2d1-6a995b8fbbc2": {"__data__": {"id_": "664d3574-e809-4ca8-b2d1-6a995b8fbbc2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a14dc2e4e486535ead295f44ac18c708e8f77d87df674e63c735ef5cffcc0489"}, "3": {"node_id": "035f9892-8353-42ae-b333-f37cbbe34cc6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2ff00b62f489d68ddd7a98a7d14e7eed0efd3d1b8d8034e355ac0c557bb70a9"}}, "hash": "7efcf7c2429fcb3c622cee419ef13f85067752b13d3bf4bc522468a609546f0d", "text": "and evaluating systems. The lack of capabilities and opportunities to train staff in technical skills in this area is clearly a factor to be considered here, and this is an issue explored further in Section 5. Besides monitoring and evaluation, there are no other areas of specific strengths or weaknesses in the CSO community as a whole under \u2018systems and processes\u2019. CSO capacity varies across region depending on factors such as staff capabilities, experience and training. In other words, organizational capacity under systems and processes is linked to the strengths and capabilities of staff members. In the area of financial planning systems, for example, some CSOs in the study had weak financial systems while others had very strong ones. Factors that impacted the strength of such systems were budget discipline, monitoring abilities, and effective management of cash transfers, expenditures and acquittals by the staff. Organizations where staff members possessed good financial skills often had strong financial systems in place. Similarly, some CSOs had weak human resource management systems while others had strong ones, depending on factors such as training and staff management. Section 5 Sustainability and Resourcing A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 20 21 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific The overall capacity of CSOs in the Pacific region in the area \u2018sustainability and resourcing\u2019 is low. The CSOs in this study, with an aggregate score of 2.89, are only at an emerging level. Only Cook Islands and Tuvalu consistently scored highly in this axis (Table 5.1). Issues such as poor human resources management, lack of available appropriate training opportunities, and lack of skills in areas such as financial management are key reasons behind capacity weaknesses in this axis. CSOs are not without strengths however. As the earlier discussion on volunteerism made clear, CSOs in the region have a substantive resource in the volunteerism that pervades their organizational culture. They scored particularly well in their ability to use local capacities in their work, in terms of financial and human resources. In fact, every single country scored in the expanding range in this area, with Tuvalu even scoring a mature level with a score of 4 in the four-point scale. CSOs on the whole are also equipped with some form of infrastructure and internal management structures, albeit the capacity for this varies across countries. A few CSOs of FSM, Tonga and Fiji have structures as good as similarly-sized CSOs in Australia and New Zealand, but they are exceptions. At the other end of the spectrum are small national CSOs, which operate out of private homes utilising only basic filing systems, with no ICT capacity except private computers. With little monetary resource or the capabilities to aid the design of internal management systems that would optimise their operations, many CSOs continually operate to shore up \u2018leaks\u2019 in the system. Their operations are unable to move beyond a point. The ability of CSOs to effectively plan for procuring and maintaining equipment is also relatively weak. There is a lack of skilled technical staff who can manage time between \u2018working on\u2019 and \u2018working in\u2019 the organization to make requisite changes or upgrades in infrastructural and managements structures. Key challenges thus exist in the area of sustainability and resourcing for CSOs. Funding is the root capacity gap, which interlinks with and impact development of many other areas. Low levels of funding mean that CSOs are unable to recruit skilled staff who can take care of technical issues (which then results in its own set of challenges), and that they face constraints in basic areas such as effectively planning for, procuring, and maintaining goods and services for day-to-day operations. The other major capacity gaps in this axis are the low level of human resources, and a lack of training opportunities to upskill staff members on technical issues such as financial management.

Resource Mobilisation: Constraints and Implications CSOs in the region\u2014with a few exceptions of a few well-established ones in Fiji, Tonga, and FSM\u2014are largely dependent on funding from external donors. Without this support, many of them would not be able to operate at the levels at which they currently operate, and some may even cease to exist. Such a level of dependency impacts the sustainability and resourcing of CSOs in a number of ways. They have to attune their work areas to the funding focus of donors out of necessity. They also have to be reactive and adapt their work areas to the changing funding priorities of donors, if and when they arise, in order to maintain their funding sources over the long term (Box 5.1). The impact of this nature of funding on CSOs is wide ranging: from the areas of strategy planning and human resources, to procuring and maintaining equipment. For example, since a majority of donor funding is linked to specific projects, which rarely make explicit provisions, it is difficult for CSOs to produce adequate levels of overhead expenses so that they can plan for procurement of new equipment as well as pay for the expenses to maintain the old. Being vulnerable to the funding whims of external donors also limits the possibility of engaging in the kind of programmes CSOs see as best suiting their strategic intent.

This factor must be acknowledged as a key capacity constraint in their functioning, both in the short and long term, and is a major reason why, as highlighted in Section 4, planning strategically has little real value for CSOs in the region. Uncertainty in their funding makes it difficult for CSOs to create appropriate resource mobilization strategies. While Table 5.1 shows that CSOs possess adequate levels of capacity for creating project Box 5.1. Funding Priorities Of Donors Encourage A \u2018Race To The Middle\u2019 In an attempt to ensure their competitiveness for donor funding, many CSOs in the Pacific are increasingly spreading their areas of \u2018expertise\u2019 and programmatic focus. A recent example of this from the region is the increased importance of climate change to donors, and an increased availability of funds in this area. As a result, many CSOs across the region are attempting to align their work programmes to climate change. While this realignment makes sense in terms of obtaining funding, it also detracts CSOs from developing the sectoral expertise upon which they were first established. A possible outcome of this \u2018race to the middle\u2019 is that larger organizations, with better internal capacity, may begin to edge out smaller CSOs in obtaining funds. This shift has already been noted, with smaller organizations feeling negative impacts. During the consultation process, a number of the specialised and smaller CSOs reported that they were increasingly competing for funds in their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e86ee05c-ca2c-4f51-84dd-39cec5e30315": {"__data__": {"id_": "e86ee05c-ca2c-4f51-84dd-39cec5e30315", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b393cbff8bc0260ef3bd11ce7732c2a775adc6e40bd3083491f88376d1aee88"}}, "hash": "7b393cbff8bc0260ef3bd11ce7732c2a775adc6e40bd3083491f88376d1aee88", "text": "respective countries with larger, better equipped CSOs which present a more attractive package for donors. In sum, the current scenario in the area of funding is that: \u2022 due to the ongoing need for external funding, there continues to be a high degree of competition within the CSO sector \u2022 the funding tendency of donors is that they look for groups to carry out programmes they have identified (and prioritised), rather than funding projects which national CSOs consider as being worthwhile. budgets and having regular budget cycles\u2014some scoring in the higher end of emerging range\u2014it belies the fact that the actual process of carrying this out varies considerably year-to-year due to funding volatility. A general lack of staff with financial management skills for accounts and budgeting compound the challenges in this area. CSOs, by and large, do possess some form of financial accounting systems, as indicated by their scoring in the high- end emerging range or low-end of the expanding range. A majority of CSOs consulted in this study had manual accounting systems, although increasing numbers were either moving or planning to shift to computerised systems. During the consultation processes, however, it was apparent that many CSOs had only limited ability to present complete sets of audited accounts for a period of longer than 3-5 years. The fault lay not with the financial systems as much as with a lack of staff members who possessed adequate financial knowledge to properly operate and update financial systems. This gap meant that the data collection on fund disbursements was not always adequate for the CSOs\u2019 external reporting or internal information needs. Unfortunately, limited resources also meant that options for additional training to upgrade skills of staff members were not always possible. In addition, delays in the disbursements of funds by donors, which commonly occur, make day-to-day operations difficult for CSOs since they generally do not have large cash reserves. Although delays are mainly due to internal blockages within donor agencies,viii they do dramatically impact the daily functioning of CSOs. The only way this risk can be managed is if donors shift towards more timely disbursement of funds, or a wider range of funding alternatives become available for CSOs. It must be said, however, that in light of the low levels of funding as well as the uncertainty of their sources, CSOs have become especially efficient in using available funds. In the case of the procurement and maintenance of equipment, for example, CSOs have become adept at maximizing their resources so that they can at least provide for the overheads necessary to maintain basic infrastructure. This does not necessarily mean that they are able to procure and maintain their equipment as effectively as they would like. (Table 5.1 shows that relatively weak scores in this area). Instead, it highlights the fact that CSOs are doing as well as could be expected given their limited resources and the severe constraints under which they function. Manpower and Human Resource Management CSOs face major challenges when it comes to manpower and human resource management. It is difficult for them to attract and retain skilled staff, especially in the face of major competition by donors or international NGOs which offer better employment packages. CSOs have high staff turnover rates. Their low levels of funding means that CSOs are chronically under- staffed, even with the use of volunteers. Apart from the largest CSOs, for example, it is often the case that the director of the organization has to also operate as the de facto human resources manager. Given the overstretched nature of these key positions, human resources management may thus not be receiving the attention it deserves. viii The other major risk associated with disbursement of funds from donors is misallocation of funds received by CSOs. No concrete examples of this occurring in the Pacific CSO community were forthcoming from the CSOs consulted in this assessment exercise. However, there was acknowledgement that this did occur in some places. Tighter financial regulation systems may help overcome this issue. Tighter monitoring by donors at an early stage is also probably a good deterrent. Increased training in monitoring and evaluation within CSOs may also help assuage this concern. A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 24 25 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific It is also common across the region for CSO staff members to fill a range of roles for which they do not possess appropriate skills. During the consultation process, staff members indicated that they were willing to take on these additional responsibilities (despite lack of remuneration), although they did do without appropriate training.

The pervasive problem of poorly trained or lack of skilled staff marks the issue of training as a priority action area. On the whole, with the exception of Tuvalu, a majority of CSOs in the region only have an emerging level of capacity in possessing capabilities to train their staff. The Solomon Islands, with a score of 1.87, is in the nascent category. Opportunities for engaging in external training and other capacity building activities are sporadic. An important point of concern CSOs highlighted during the consultation process, and which must be duly noted, was that training opportunities were available only in the same countries, the \u201cusual suspects\u201d as it were, and that these opportunities were not \u201cfairly\u201d dispersed (Box 5.2). Moreover, given their high staff turnover, there was little institutional memory on which individuals had received training and from whom, and a general lack of accessible written records detailing the forms of training staff members had undergone. Another issue highlighted during the consultation process was that sporadic training seminars by external providers did not necessarily best suit the needs of CSOs. While some CSOs may have received one-off training through initiatives from the donor or the larger CSO community, participants of this study noted that these sessions, while useful, did not help them gain the broader skills they required and desired for professional development. There was no ongoing support to ensure that the training received was translated into concrete changes in people\u2019s work practices on the ground. Participants strongly indicated that it was workplace \u2018on-the-job\u2019 training and learning that they needed to ensure the development and sustainability of skills. Box 5.2. Opportunities For Training And Capacity Development Activities: Snapshot Assessment Of Pacific CSOS Training is the key component for building capacity in Pacific CSOs across the five axes of the Clearing House Framework. This issue was identified as priority not only by CSOs themselves during the capacity assessment process, but also in the collective analytical findings of the study. A point of concern, however, is that training opportunities for CSOs is not fairly dispersed in the region. The Training Needs Assessment (TNA), which was part of the assessment exercise, broke down participants on the basis of the formal training they had received after joining their organizations. The results varied along country lines. Those working in Fiji and Tonga, for example, made up a far larger number of those who had received additional training than those working in Solomon Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. The overall assessment that emerges from this study is that training for CSOs in the region has been country specific, short-term, and focused on particular sectors or skill deficits. Very little training occurs \u2018in-house\u2019. The majority of training initiative is largely conducted on an ad hoc basis, and provided by a limited number of external donors. These donors include: \u2022 AusAID \u2022 CIDA \u2022 Commonwealth \u2022 NZ Aid Programme \u2022 Various United Nations agencies A number of other NGOs active in the region have also provided, and continue to provide, capacity building training. The format of the training provided by NGOs, however, is to focus on the one particular CSO with whom they are working. The NGOs involved in such capacity building initiatives include: \u2022 OXFAM-Aus \u2022 OXFAM-NZ \u2022 The Nature Conservancy \u2022 WWF The approach to training CSOs should be considered in light of all these factors. An issue that was repeatedly highlighted during the consultation process was the desire by participants for a mentoring approach, where individuals would receive \u2018on-the-job\u2019 training, of putting to practice skills they have picked up in workshops or training seminars. The most immediate need seems to be for competency- based skills training starting at a sub-tertiary education level, and delivered in-country, which allows the use of on-the-job training and peer-to-peer learning networks. The pursuance of a more localised format designed to be interactive and on the ground, appears to be the need of the hour. The only coherent training program in existence for a sustained period of time for CSOs in the region seems to be the Graduate Diploma Programme in Non Profit Management offered by the New Zealand- based Unitec Institute of Technology. Participants of the consultation process viewed this programme very favorably. However, it was considered expensive, especially in light of the fact that CSO participants had to travel overseas to receive the training. The programme also does not possess any on-the-job training components, which means that participants are unable to engage in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8f0bce1-c5e7-48bd-b6fd-e42a7441b07b": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8f0bce1-c5e7-48bd-b6fd-e42a7441b07b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dce5b295328f745c849504d1dff8dbb4f8043419e4fb39cc533967209316c0df"}, "3": {"node_id": "e4793db7-2d3c-4b18-a1cb-a9c6914dc032", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2727e8094705b05fb085ca56c8c2f2eb8dd0d7d05def4accb25885c74d132a7"}}, "hash": "927a0c3ddf889f0e09df11e35024a028d5fb2087fb58668167ead9ac44842ec0", "text": "their regular work activities while undergoing training, adversely affecting those organizations with limited human resources. Moreover, as a graduate diploma, it is aimed at those with higher academic levels, and effectively outside the reach of the majority of CSO staff in the region. A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 26 27 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific Section 6 Information Sharing, Cooperation and Advocacy CSOs scored relatively well as a group in terms of information sharing, cooperation and advocacy. The region as a whole scored in the expanding range at 3.08 (Table 6.1). A majority of countries scored between high end of the emerging and mid-level of the expanding range. Cook Islands with a score of 3.45, and Tonga with a score of 3.32, returned particularly strong scores. CSO capacity in this sector is relatively homogenous across the region (with the exception of Solomon Islands which consistently scored a level below the other countries). A key finding is that while CSOs are very good at sharing information, it does not necessary transfer into the domain of cooperation. This, despite the fact that all the CSOs in the study agreed that increased cooperation would positively impact their work. The reason behind this appears the lack of existing formal processes for cooperation which can translate into shared programmes. The competitive nature of funding for CSOs in the region also reduces incentive for cooperation. In the area of advocacy, while CSOs have a clear advocacy component in their work activities, they are unable to assess effectiveness due to their lack of monitoring and evaluation strategies. Information Sharing CSOs appear to have relatively well-developed capacities to share information and maintain communication with their constituents. Table 6.1 shows scores in the expanding range of the scale for a majority of the countries for these capacities. CSOs clearly keep their constituents informed about their activities. The ability of CSOs to effectively utilise a range of information-sharing modalities, including informal meetings, plays a key role. E-mail, considered the cheapest with the most effective spread, is the main channel for information sharing (Box 6.1). Other modalities include the radio, newspapers, newsletters and meetings. Another noteworthy point is that the majority of countries, apart from Tuvalu and Solomon Islands, returned high scores in terms of their linkage to organizational networks in specific sectors. This suggests that CSOs are able to effectively share information with other CSOs working in similar focus areas.

2.47 Overall Section Rating 3.45 2.68 2.99 3.32 2.59 2.56 3.04 3.15 3.08 The capacity to share information however weakened as CSOs moved away from engagement with national CSOs communities to the regional and international levels. The strong score of 3.27 for CSOs maintaining regular communication with other national CSOs drops to 2.94 when communication extends to the regional level. The score drops even further at the international level (2.65). CSOs are clearly not as strongly linked to their regional and international CSO communities, irrespective of their strong communication ties at the national level. Cooperation Their strong capacity to share information does not necessarily lead CSOs to cooperate with one another. As Table 6.1 shows, the scoring in this section was mainly in the emerging range, although some countries did score in the expanding range. During the consultation process, many CSOs indicated that they could improve their cooperation with other national CSOs, but were constrained by a lack of time and easily available channels for cooperation. They also suggested that NLUs, who were already fulfilling this role to some degree, could do more to bring about increased coordination in their sector. Many agreed that increased cooperation would improve not only their functioning, but also help overcome internal capacity issues. Another obstacle to increased cooperation is the competitive nature of the funding environment. Cooperation is difficult to foster when all are \u201cfighting for the same dollar\u201d. A related finding from the quantitative data is that when CSOs did cooperate with other organizations, these partnerships did not involve funding-related aspects, such as providing or pooling funds. Box 6.1. Using Icts To Inform: \u2018No One Answers Their Phones But At Least They Check Their E-Mails\u2019 There is a relatively high degree of ICT usage among CSOs to communicate with their domestic stakeholders and external partners, although this is done at a low technical level and is based mainly on the use of e-mail. Indeed, many CSOs said that email was their main day-to-day form of communication. The justification here\u2014that \u201cno one answers their phones but at least they check their e-mails\u201d\u2014explains the relatively high level of information sharing among national CSOs. CSOs do not possess much capacity in terms of more advanced uses of ICT such as web pages, blogs and other Web 2.0 technologies. The two reasons behind this are the lack of physical computing infrastructure (including the high replacement and repair costs of infrastructure) and the low levels of band width in the Pacific, which restrict the use of ICT for information gathering and of high-tech forms of communication such as face-to-face video conferencing. These are however not serious constraints. A strong tradition of internet forums has developed over the last decade in the region, and so there are models available on which CSOs could build ICT-related capacities. A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 30 31 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific Advocacy CSOs, on the whole, have a clear advocacy focus linked into their strategies and long-term community development visions. However, given their capacity weaknesses in the area of internal monitoring and evaluation, it is difficult for CSOs to comprehensively assess the impact and effectiveness of their campaigns. This gap can also be attributed to the weak linkages between strategic planning and operational activities discussed in Section 4. CSOs\u2019 engagement with media in their advocacy work is weak. Except for a few well-established CSOs, interaction with media seems to be on a case-by-case occurrence, and the internal capacity of CSOs to take forward media-related activities is relatively low. Many CSOs do not have designated media contacts, and there are few formal protocols in place, if at all, on dealing with the media. Whenever media outreach is conducted, it is generally through established networks with their end-users or through external partners, and preferably via email. Traditional media sources such as newspapers, radio and television are rarely used for advocacy campaigns due to related expenses. While a few larger CSOs may be relatively well developed in their strategic use of the media, smaller organizations have no clear understanding of how they can use the media in their advocacy or general programming. The general capacity gap in human resources can be linked to this problem, since finding technical expertise in specific areas like media and communications is the major challenge.

Their capacity for this is fairly strong, with an overall regional score of 3.15 in the region (Table 7.1). A particular strength of CSOs is the involvement of their constituents in the design and review of their programming. Stakeholders\u2019 views are actively included, and as such, they can be said to play a role in the governance of CSOs. There are a number of weaknesses as well. The outstanding one is the low capacity of CSOs to gather baseline information about their constituents. While the involvement of constituents in the design and review of programming is a valuable approach, without \u2018hard\u2019 data on constituents\u2019 needs, it is difficult to ensure that CSOs\u2019 programming and advocacy work is appropriately responsive. External Relations (donors, government counterparts, partners, networks, CROPix agencies and end users) Many CSOs in the consultation process claimed that the close connection with their end-users was their key strength. Since CSOs actively consider their constituents views in programming and involve them in governance boards (irrespective of the members\u2019 lack of skills), they have legitimacy in the eyes of their stakeholders. CSOs are considered the \u2018voice of the community\u2019 by both their constituents and donors. Sector-specific CSOs appear to have cordial relations with their government counterparts, and CSOs as a whole rated relations with donors positively (although this is expected given that the majority of their funding comes from donors). A number of CSOs maintain contact with the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific (CROP) agencies, but this contact is irregular (often only once a year) and focused only on a small range of agencies.

At the moment, there appears to be a low level of awareness of PRNGOs and their role by national CSOs unless they are affiliated with a specific PRNGO. PRNGOs, which are all located in Fiji except for one, have relatively well developed communication systems with their internal stakeholders (their member CSOs) and with external stakeholders, such as bi-lateral and multi- lateral donors and other international and regional agencies. CSOs, like other agencies in the region, have difficulty in gathering baseline information about their constituents. There are few official data sources in their countries, and CSOs have very limited knowledge of reliable mechanisms for data gathering and analysis. CSOs also scored low in the area of organizing events or platforms for their constituents to provide feedback on their work. This means that the mechanisms for CSOs receiving feedback on the effectiveness of their programmes are weak, and by way of this, they could stand to lose the legitimacy that they gained with constituents and donors.

In general, all countries in the Pacific region make allowances for non-profit enterprise. With a regional score of 3.38, the highest in the five axes, CSOs scored particularly well in terms of their legal and regulatory environment (Table 8.1). The only exception was Solomon Islands with a score of 2.87. The majority of CSOs in the Pacific are registered as some form of non-profit body. The registration process is not seen as being particularly arduous, except in Fiji, where it could take longer to obtain registration if a non-Fijian is at the helm of the organization. (Participants in the study indicated that this was due to parochialism in the Fijian civil service where agencies based in the country were best seen as operating under Fijian heads). Table 8.2 shows that almost all the CSOs that were consulted in the study have been formally incorporated.x The overall high score for this axis can be attributed to the general lack of opposition by political actors to CSOs, and the realisation by governments of the important role that CSOs play in service delivery. At the same time, the high rankings belie the general consensus among CSOs, across region, that they operate under a form of benign neglect by their governments. While it may not be difficult to establish organizational status and begin operations, there is little active support from governments to CSOs. That governments do not go out of their way to aid CSO activities was identified as a major weakness during the consultation process. There is also weak financial support from governments for CSOs activities. Very little money comes to CSOs from domestic donations and almost no money from local governments. There is little that can be done regarding this, however, without substantial growth in domestic economic sectors at the macro level. Exceptions to the benign neglect exist, namely in two countries. During the consultations, Fijian CSOs claimed that if a CSO was overly \u2018political\u2019 it could be punished by the current regime. The other was Tonga, where CSOs that worked in politically-sensitive sectors, such as human rights and the pro-democracy movements, came across some degree of low-level opposition and were marginalised by government agencies. At the same time, specific government agencies in Tonga appeared to have good connections to CSOs working in their sectors, such as health and education (as long as the organizations were not seen as being overly political). A number of the CSOs indicated that a degree of competitiveness existed between them and their governments as the latter saw them as competitors for funds. The CSOs from Solomon Islands, for example, reported jealousies from some of their government agencies because of their ability to directly access donor funds. This factor may well explain why the country ranked in the emerging range for this axis, far below the other countries. x The exceptions were one FSM CSO and seven Tuvaluan CSOs, which had no legal status. A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 36 37 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific xi Some CSOs consulted in the study were not charitable trusts or incorporated societies. They were: religious bodies (2); school; Memorandum of Understanding with government (WWF-Fiji); operation under the Ministry of Youth (Fiji). xii This CSO was planning on formerly incorporating but had not yet got around to it.

This spread is relatively evenly across the six key capacity gaps, showing uniformity. A relatively equal spread also occurs across the Information Sharing, Cooperation and Advocacy axis. There is a more uneven spread of capacity needs in the areas of Stakeholder Relations and Legal and Regulatory Environment. These two axes were consistently scored the highest during the consultation process. However, as indicated by the table, even with high scoring there are still areas within the axes which demand attention. Funding Funding constraints relate not only to low levels of available monetary resources but also the uncertainty associated with ongoing sources of funding. As discussed in preceding chapters, the CSOs consulted in the study, as a group, are dependent on foreign donors for ongoing financial support for their programming. Small CSOs are particularly vulnerable to funding shortfalls. While it is largely outside the scope of UNDP\u2019s work to determine how CSOs use funding from donors, the vulnerability of CSOs to the funding whims of donors is an acknowledged capacity constraint. One means of addressing this issue is through small grants schemes, such as the Global Environmental Facility\u2019s Small Grants Programme (SGP). SPG, which is implemented by UNDP in 63 developing countries, including Papua New Guinea (PNG), supports CSO activities that work on conserving biodiversity, mitigating climate change, and A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 40 41 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific protecting international waters, while generating sustainable livelihoods. It recognises the importance of small grassroots projects and their difficulty in securing funding. It offers grants that average around USD 20,000 directly to CSOs. The programme features decentralised decision-making about grant awards, with strategic directions being provided by a voluntary national steering committee in each participating country. All SGP-supported projects include capacity-building, communications, and experience-sharing elements. 6 An initiative in the Pacific region along the line of SGP is the Micronesia Conservation Trust (MCT), a regional organization chartered under FSM laws to support biodiversity conservation and related sustainable development for the people of Micronesia. The Trust was established in 2002 to provide long-term sustained funding to community- based organizations and other NGOs through a grants programme.

In the end, the project, which delivered solid capacity building outcomes, was considered an overall success (Box 9.1). Box 9.1. The Pacific Skills Links Project In 2000, the British volunteer sending organization (VSO) funded a volunteer adviser to review opportunities to develop the CSO sector in Tuvalu. This enabled a review of CSO capacity to identify areas requiring development, and a proposal for a capacity building project resulted. The project, known as the Pacific Skills Link, had as its overall goal, the strengthening of CSO capacity to alleviate poverty and improve livelihoods of disadvantaged communities in Kiribati, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. It was overseen by National Liaison Units (NLUs): the Tuvalu Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (TANGO) in Tuvalu, the Vanuatu Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (VANGO) in Vanuatu, and the Kiribati Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (KANGO) in Kiribati. The project was wide-ranging. It was designed to address the limited power of CSOs to access resources, their lack of technical skills for planning and analysing their needs, and the lack of government recognition of CSOs. It conducted CSO profiling and needs assessments, and capacity building activities including training and coaching. It not only supported CSO umbrella organizations and civil society in networking, information exchange and advocacy work, but also in the implementation of small projects through a small grants scheme. Specific capacity building approaches of the Programme included the provision of overseas development workers, formal workshops and one-to-one training, inter country staff exchanges, IT service provision through umbrella bodies, and legal advice for constitutions. During the course of the project, PSL was the facilitator for the umbrella organizations. The PSL project was evaluated as a success. An evaluation report found that its capacity building activities had not only strengthened individual skills, but led to improvement in day-to-day functioning of recipient CSOs. Another longitudinal study of the PSL project interventions in Tuvalu also found that the project had been generally successful. The resulting shifts in resource, expert and personal power had enabled CSOs to develop and progress to a point where they had achieved greater legitimisation by the government. This study however cautioned that it was not clear if the NGOs were sufficiently capacitated to ensure the delivery of projects following the withdrawal of project support in 2006. No data is currently available on follow-up to this study; however fieldwork for this project indicated that a lack of coordination, problems with resourcing and staff, and the cumbersome nature of the funding system in Tuvalu remained issues for CSOs in Tuvalu. Sources: Tappin 2005; Cox 2006. Human Resources Not only do CSOs struggle to find technically qualified staff, but they also find it difficult to retain them, particularly in light of the larger salary packages offered by donors or international CSOs. The lack of technical staff impact many areas, not least the efficient use of CSOs\u2019 limited resources. During the consultation process, it was clear that many CSOs had difficulty maintaining financial systems due to lack of trained staff even if funds were available and accessible. There is indeed much room to upgrade skills of staff in technical areas through coordinated training processes. Although sporadic training initiatives take place, there is little or no coordination in the delivery of training. Donors have attempted to address the issue of training through projects such as the Pacific Skills Link, which included training workshops and one-to-one assistance for local staff.7 Volunteerism, as earlier discussed, has been one way to meet the challenge of staff shortage in CSOs. The practice of using national volunteers through a formal volunteer system is not widespread, although it is not unknown. The Papua New Guinea National Volunteer Service (NVS) is a particularly well-regarded indigenous volunteer agency.8 The philosophy behind NVS is about reinforcing a traditional idea of people supporting and assisting one another within their communities. Indigenous volunteers from NVS have helped community organizations to understand the application of planning, mentoring and evaluation from a Melanesian perspective. There is also a role for international volunteers in the region.

Indeed, it is also a practical example of the kind of \u2018on the job\u2019 mentoring identified by CSOs to ensure the effectiveness of training programmes. A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 42 43 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific Leadership and Governance \u2018Governance,\u2019 in the context of this study, refers to the manner in which power is exercised by an individual, group or entity in the management of things, including exercise of powers by chief executive or operating officers, boards and members of an NGO.9 Section 4 has discussed how the general low levels of human resources in CSOs reflect in their governance boards. The gaps lead to a number of negative consequences, one of which is slippage between the roles of governance and management. Clearly, key capacity gaps must be addressed in this area. It is difficult to locate data on projects focused solely on improving governance in the Pacific region. However, Haley (2008) provides an example from Fiji. In 2000, following the Fijian coup, the Suva-based NGO, Ecumenical Centre for Research, Education and Advocacy coup (ECREA) developed a programme, supported by Oxfam Australia, to work with local Fijian communities to promote community-level engagement. This programme, known as the Social Empowerment and Education Programme (SEEP), identified leadership as one of two issues that affected community governance. The core aim of xiii This refers to individuals or companies leasing lands. About 85% of lands in Fiji are community owned and leased out through long term leases. SEEP was therefore to strengthen the capacity of local leaders, particularly focusing on dealing with external agents (land leasing unitsxiii), and on improving community consultation in their decision- making processes. As a result of participating in this programme, village leaders adopted a more consultative approach towards decision-making, and women began to present their views in village- level meetings where previously they had been entirely excluded. SEEP also recruited and trained community facilitators from target communities, recognising that such representatives are better placed to negotiate effectively with their communities due to communal ties. Such an approach ensured longer-term commitment to development in specific communities, encouraging sustainability. After six months in the programme, community facilitators returned to their communities ensuring that the leadership capacity built by SEEP was injected back into the communities.10 Another programme that addresses governance and leadership issues in the management of CSOs is the Pacific NGO Capacity Building Initiative initiated by CIDA and UNDP (Box 9.2). Box 9.2. The Pacific Capacity Building Initiative The Pacific Capacity Building Initiative was a collaborative project between CIDA and the UNDP to strengthen CSO capacity to initiate, manage and influence development processes in Pacific Island societies. The project strategies were comprehensive. It involved the Pacific Islands Association of Non-Governmental Organisations (PIANGO); built a regional network of capacity building practitioners; and established multi- stakeholder mechanisms and processes for coordinating CSO capability building activities at regional and national levels. It also included an institutionalisation of the New Zealand-based Unitec Institute of Technology\u2019s Graduate Diploma Programme in NGO Management. New Zealand provided PIANGO with funding to support CSO enrolment in the programme. The Project was undertaken in two stages. First, it made efforts to raise awareness about the role CSOs play in the region, highlighting the opportunities and challenges they faced. During this stage, strategic links were forged between groups working on strengthening civil society. Crucial points of exchange were established at national, regional and international levels for and amongst CSOs, governments and international development agencies. PIANGO received intensive technical and managerial support throughout the project. The project was successful in strengthening PIANGO, and the agency completed phase one better positioned to operate more effectively. The second stage aimed to consolidate and sustain outcomes already achieved, and to work towards an exit strategy for CIDA. It built on previous capacity building efforts and provided intensive \u2018hands-on\u2019 technical assistance in the implementation of PIANGO\u2019s five year strategic plan, particularly in the area of mobilising financial and human resources. The project facilitated workshops for leaders, round-table discussions, and helped country-level umbrella organizations with strategic planning. It became apparent that there was a growing number of skilled and experienced Pacific Islanders to facilitate capacity building activities, but that their availability was limited by resource constraints and demands of their own organizations and networks. A regional network of mobile \u2018capacity building practitioners\u2019 was established to address this, and to serve as a nucleus for a region-wide network of sector support workers. As a means of promoting cross-regional learning and grassroots capacity building, the Project Coordinator also assisted", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "898a5588-17a9-4e2f-a0ed-02074a12a938": {"__data__": {"id_": "898a5588-17a9-4e2f-a0ed-02074a12a938", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b26a99a8a155f3fc10b1131bfd14fbe9acb897b3c97f0714902c2b22eaa3768"}}, "hash": "6b26a99a8a155f3fc10b1131bfd14fbe9acb897b3c97f0714902c2b22eaa3768", "text": "in establishing exchange programmes for community development practitioners. For example, the project connected Community Facilitators from the Bismark Ramu Group in PNG with Community Facilitators from the Ecumenical Centre for Research, Education and Advocacy coup (ECREA) in Fiji to explore participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and community engagement techniques in rural communities. The Pacific NGO Capacity Building Initiative was the first project in the Pacific to target the institutional development of the NGO sector as a whole. Certainly, it seemed that the capacity of CSOs to operate more effectively in a range of areas\u2014 human and financial management, programme planning and monitoring, public education, social analysis, advocacy and stakeholder relations\u2014had strengthened as a result. It operated across nations, sectors, institutional boundaries, and demonstrated what could be achieved when capacity development is approached in a truly comprehensive manner. Source: Taylor 2005 As part of the initiative, a regional NGO specialist co- facilitated a seven day workshop attended by 14 people for NGO leaders from four provinces and Honiara in the Solomon Islands. The workshop utilised a holistic approach of teaching NGO management on an array of topics: resource mobilisation, administrative systems and procedures, public relations, project design, policy analysis and formulation, advocacy, governance and strategy development. Following the workshop, participants themselves identified the need for ongoing formal training in managing NGOs. They asked the Development Services Exchange (DSE)\u2014a national NGO umbrella body which facilitates and coordinates development services for NGOs and their partners\u2014to explore the possibility of bringing Unitec\u2019s Graduate Diploma Programme in NGO Management to the Solomon Islands.11 While a few CSO managers from Solomon Islands were able to attend the Programme, its impact was minimal due to the high cost of attending. A more targeted locally-based approach to training may be more appropriate in the region. Strategic Planning and Collaboration A lack of in-house capacity to undertake strategic planning affects a number of organizational capacities. As Section 4 makes clear, while CSOs may possess strategic plans, they are either out of date or do not match existing resources and capacities. A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 44 45 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific Related to this is the inability to transfer such planning, whenever they occur, into operational plans. These capacity weaknesses not only impact CSOs\u2019 ability to engage with government on broader development strategies but also their ability to collaborate and coordinate amongst themselves. There are some cases which serve as encouraging examples of initiatives that have led to greater coordination between the CSO community and the wider community. One such example is the Oxfam- Solomon Islands\u2019 HIV and AIDS Programme. The initiative involves civil society (Oxfam-SI, local NGOs and programme partners) and the Solomon Islands Government. As part of the programme, Oxfam-SI initiated an informal working group\u2014comprising of international NGO\u2019s working on HIV and AIDS programme development in Solomon Islands\u2014 which meets intermittently to network, discuss key issues, and identifies ways to collaborate and share resources. Due to these interactions, stakeholder roles have been clarified, communication greatly improved, and members better able to complement each other\u2019s activities. It has resulted in improved programme effectiveness and more efficient use of resources at the national level.12 This example is an exception, however, and more work needs to be done to enable CSOs, which have relatively well developed capacity, to share information and closely coordinate activities and collaborate. Monitoring and Evaluation The lack of monitoring and evaluation expertise within CSOs has been highlighted throughout this report. Monitoring and evaluation is an area that has traditionally been donor-led. At the grassroots level, however, monitoring and evaluation programmes that utilise donor-driven structures are often unsuccessful. It is increasingly being recognised that monitoring in the area of development is more successful if it is undertaken in manner that is culturally and contextually appropriate.13 In PNG, the aforementioned NVS programme utilised such an approach with volunteers, assisting some CSOs to understand the value of and ideas behind planning, monitoring and evaluation using everyday contexts. Adopting such an interactive approach helped CSO communities to become familiar with the processes of planning, monitoring and evaluation, instead of seeing them as alien concepts.14 Another example comes from the Pacific Provider Development Fund (PPDF), which ran from 2000-2005 through the Child Youth and Family (CYF) agency in New Zealand. It aimed to build the organizational capacity of Pacific service providers through a culturally appropriate evaluation process. This project focused on the development of a \u2018Capacity Self Assessment\u2019 tool for Pacific providers, based on a New Zealand Maori capacity assessment tool.

Mentoring was particularly important to the process. The PPDF funded 20 key Pacific providers, selected by CYF, who completed training in the Capacity Self Assessment tool supported by a mentor of their choice. The providers submitted a two- year development plan for funding consideration after the training. This programme enabled Pacific providers in New Zealand to strengthen core infrastructure and gave direction to planning. It also highlighted the importance of culture as the context for delivery, while emphasizing the need to re-contextualize generic tools in a more humanistic manner for a Pacific context.15 Such innovative and contextualized programmes will go a long way to not only build capacity in the crucial area of monitoring and evaluation, but also in the sectors which are directly affected by its capacity gaps. Coordination and Communication Although CSOs maintain good communications with their local counterparts and stakeholders, there is room for much improvement. Geographical isolation and dispersed populations make connection with others a challenge for CSOs in the region. A lack of awareness about what others are doing, or of available funding and networking opportunities, can considerably impact the capacity development of CSOs. The current consensus is that there is a negative overlap in coordination strategies among groups due to this lack of communication. Improved communication not only among themselves but also with regional and international agencies would optimise coordination among groups, both in terms of information sharing and taking action in their programmes. CSOs, donors and governments are utilising a range of strategies in order to improve communication and coordination among CSOs and with the wider community. At a grassroots level, HELP Resources Inc, a local NGO in East Sepik province in PNG, has a different but highly effective approach to assist with local communication strategies in the area of HIV/AIDS prevention and care. Through a community multi-purpose telecenter, HELP facilitates access for local organizations to multimedia information sources and communication options about HIV and AIDS. They are able to borrow resources such as videos for training, and HELP assists with the dissemination of related publications and training manuals. HELP has also assisted the East Sepik Provincial AIDS Committee to form a community- owned approach to combating HIV and AIDS-related challenges in the province. By becoming involved in the local committee, sharing resources, and collaborating on projects with other NGOs, it has successfully helped decentralized local response to HIV and AIDS in the region.16 Communication and coordination between CSOs across the Pacific has been assisted by the rapid spread of new information and communication technologies. There are increasing numbers of formal and informal civil society networks addressing communication and coordination needs throughout the Pacific. However, while the internet may facilitate capacity development, their impact in the Pacific region is significantly constrained by infrastructural issues. Access is a challenge for a number of CSOs. This gap is becoming a priority issue, not only for donors but also for CSOs. In the Solomon Islands, the People First Network is an initiative to provide email access through innovation, and low-cost technology, including simple computers, short-wave radio, and solar power. It has set up a network of email stations across the islands which facilitate information exchange between NGOs, government offices, media and businesses. It also provides distance and vocational education.17 Another note-worthy example comes from The University of the South Pacific, which has developed USPNet, a communication technology system that uses ICT networks for education and training.18 In addition to providing a means of distance education for those students who are unable to travel to or live in Suva, the network broadcasts public lectures and plans to provide more services to CSOs. It was successfully used by CSO leadership in Nauru to communicate with its members on the development of the CSO constitution, which was an important step in the governance of CSOs. The use of such communication tools can meet challenges posed by the geographical spread and dispersed locations of CSOs, such as those related to attending training activities and workshops at distant training centres. A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific 46 47 A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific Section 10 Conclusion: Moving Forward CSOs in the Pacific region, with an overall score of 3.08, have not fared too poorly in terms of the capacity measures of the Clearing House Framework (Table 10.1). Of the five axes, CSOs scored in the expanding range for three and at the top end of the emerging range for the remaining two. The spread of capacity across the region is not homogenous", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb978683-2080-4834-b801-f5202fab73c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb978683-2080-4834-b801-f5202fab73c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "98fd1fff9793d21ea690a11d5cf5773428430a721b7219f39cb67694bfa8fe3a"}}, "hash": "98fd1fff9793d21ea690a11d5cf5773428430a721b7219f39cb67694bfa8fe3a", "text": "however. For example, countries like the Cook Islands and Fiji consistently scored better across the entire range of axes as compared to Solomon Islands. The disparity can be attributed to a number of factors, including lower levels of absolute deprivation and poverty. As the preceding analyses show, many capacity gaps of CSOs are interlinked and span across axes. The ability to undertake appropriate strategic planning, for example, is hampered by the lack of monitoring and evaluation expertise, which in turn can be linked to the issue of poor monetary and human resources. Sustainable and effective capacity development is far more complex than what earlier capacity building or technical assistance models assumed. It needs to take into account the long-term time frame. It is a process that can also be easily derailed by a lack of human and financial resources. If an organization does not have the resources to maintain their services following the end of the capacity development input, however good the results achieved, all may be lost. Its complex process can also be hampered by facilitators who lack knowledge of the context in which they are working, and/or who are inadequately prepared or unwilling to listen to the needs of the target or recipient groups. Given the interconnected web of capacity gaps, the sustainable approach for meeting these challenges is to adopt a comprehensive approach, which focuses on building upon synergies in existing capacity building initiatives in the region. Building upon programmes such as the Pacific Skills Link and the Pacific Capacity Building Initiative, and improving upon their weaknesses in a coordinated and step- wise manner, would allow for a more effective use of scarce resources and ensure that future activities improve upon preceding ones that have already been met with a modicum of success. The application of such a comprehensive capacity development approach in the Pacific region, however, must be underpinned by key principles. As discussed in the beginning of this Report, for capacity development initiatives to truly respond to the needs of local communities, the process must be an endogenous inside-out one, ensuring real ownership by the participants. Ideally, it should be initiated by the recipient organization, and involve a range of strategies at individual, organizational and societal level. It must assess \u201cthe capabilities and potential of individuals, institutions and the society as a whole\u2026working out ways to build on these incrementally.\u201d19 Table 10.1.

The findings of this study make clear that most CSOs do not see a time when they can conceivably become financially self-sustaining, even where they are seen to be effective. Thus, finding alternative channels of funding is key to responding to the capacity gaps in this area. This perspective has been supported by previous studies on CSO capacity building in the region. In their report on NGO capacity building in the Pacific, Low and Davenport (2002) noted that a number of organizations are currently working on aspects of \u2018sustainability planning\u2019 through accessing alternative forms of funding.20 Some of these, such as the Micronesia Trust Fund, have been already discussed. Capacity development initiatives in the region must also take into account the broader national context, specifically the enabling environment, in which organizations function. This includes not only networks between and among CSOs (particularly in a small island context where it has been traditionally difficult to communicate and provide services to a widely dispersed population21), but also the general legal and regulatory environment. The growth and development of CSOs require suitable legal and regulatory frameworks, which are lacking in some Pacific nations.22 Addressing capacity needs by strengthening skills, processes and systems, will not hold the promise of sustainable results if it does not take into account the inherently political and complex environmental realities in which they evolve.23 Without clear and fairly enforced legal structures, rights of CSOs remain unprotected and organizations cannot function at optimal levels. While it is not common in the Pacific region as a whole, the examples of Fiji and Tonga show that it can be difficult for some CSOs to operate in the region. At a more micro-level, training is clearly the fundamental modality", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26244a78-c611-45f8-9e60-05d6c7050fff": {"__data__": {"id_": "26244a78-c611-45f8-9e60-05d6c7050fff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af3c778439520fbe41fc2047c90dd303dcf983295b1474c044957b0e54d83d6c"}}, "hash": "af3c778439520fbe41fc2047c90dd303dcf983295b1474c044957b0e54d83d6c", "text": "by which outstanding challenges in the region can the met. In this case again, context must be considered. Formal training is important, but conventional management procedures are often complex and may not be readily adaptable to the needs of CSOs in this region. A UN report on the delivery of social services in small island countries notes that systematic training and education of personnel in social services in this context requires training beyond traditional management skills. The report claims that the most valuable skills for individuals and organizations may be the ability to innovate, experiment, improvise and lead.24 Thus, besides technical assistance on development of hard skills (in areas of financial management or monitoring and evaluation, for example), training must also consider the development of \u2018soft skills\u2019 for which CSOs in the region seem to have great potential. Ramirez (2005) defines a \u2018soft\u2019 system as the process of negotiation that people need in order to work and co-create together. Such a system involves several skills, including the ability to negotiate, to create a feeling of trust, to network and partner, and to facilitate process or change management. It is now recognised that unless attention is paid to these \u2018soft\u2019 capacities, investments in the \u2018hard\u2019 capacities seldom lead to improvements in organizational performance.25 Developing this kind of capacity is not easy, however, and facilitation is required in order to develop soft skills in target groups.26 Developing specific competencies focusing on these types of soft skills could create opportunities for transferring them to a broader scale. The use of peer- to-peer learning groups within CSOs and between staff from different CSOs with similar functions can aid in creating an environment in which these soft skills (not to mention the hard technical skills) can be effectively transferred. The use of \u2018train- the-trainers\u2019 forums\u2014where specific pedagogical skills required to effectively transfer these skills are taught\u2014is another tool that can be utilised in these types of capacity development processes. A Capacity Development Plan formulated as part of this study, and an accompanying publication to this Report,xvi identifies skill-specific competencies that need to be developed in the context of the Pacific CSO sector. These competencies are a combination of both hard and soft skills. The Plan also identifies the key learning groups the training would target, as well as the modalities of delivery. Capacity building goes beyond mere skills training of individuals however. A comprehensive approach must also involve mechanisms which inject quality input into organizational structures through a process oriented approach. In short, it must ensure that individual learning is embedded within the organization itself. This is where the use of peer- to-peer learning networks, ideally, can be linked to building capacity in areas such as strategic planning and monitoring so that the gains of individual training\u2014of both soft and hard skills\u2014is embedded within the organization. Taking this into consideration, the aforementioned Capacity Plan includes a framework of activities that specifies interventions/activities aimed at building capacity development at a systemic level. It includes a monitoring and evaluation framework to enable CSOs to monitor their own progress and verify their achievements. The ability of agencies such as UNDP to provide a platform, which connects the various capacity gaps identified in this study and appropriate interventions to fill the gaps in a coordinated manner, will play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of comprehensive capacity development in the Pacific CSO community. The discourse on capacity development is still a fairly new field, but there are already important lessons that need to be learned and taken into account when planning future capacity development initiatives. It is hoped that this Report will not only be an additional contribution to our growing understanding of the field, but also, in particular, become a resource to aid CSOs in the Pacific region to meet their overall development objectives. xiv UNDP Pacific Centre. 2011.

Their roles include the provision of basic services such as primary education, health, water and sanitation; participating in local planning and budgeting; advocating for human rights and the needs and priorities of their constituency especially the marginalised groups; providing shelter, counseling and support services to disadvantaged groups and victims of violence; monitoring the performance of government and other stakeholders in the provision of services; and more generally, progress towards the MDGs. It is widely recognised that an active and vibrant civil society is an important factor in the democratisation process. By mediating between the state and citizenry, civil society provides the mechanism to enhance citizens\u2019 voice and the engagement of citizens in various democratic processes that contributes to deepening democracy. While CSOs are expected to perform these varied functions, they face a range of capacity constraints and challenges. The challenges vary from organization to organization and are different in each country. They include: constraints relating to the overall external environment within which civil society operates; specific internal organizational capacity deficits that affect their ability to perform effectively and efficiently; and for many, a lack of financial resources and stability for funding their programmes or projects. This capacity assessment of civil society organizations in the Pacific is an attempt to undertake a systematic assessment to understand and document the capacity constraints that civil society organizations face in this region. Mindful of the sensitivity of such an exercise, the capacity assessment was conducted in a participatory manner in the development of the questionnaire, in the conduct of the assessment itself, and in the validation of the results. This Report presents in-depth capacity assessments of the six Pacific Island Countries where the assessment exercise was conducted. We hope this publication will provide readers with an understanding of the capacity development issues that affect civil society organizations in the Pacific region, and shed light on how they could be better supported and strengthened to advance and achieve better development outcomes for the region as a whole. Garry Wiseman UNDP Pacific Centre Suva, Fiji Acknowledgements The completion of the capacity assessment and preparation of this Report would not have been possible without the support and valuable contribution of our CSO partners and colleagues at the UNDP Pacific Centre. The UNDP Pacific Centre is grateful to our Pacific Regional NGO partners and national NGOs who participated in the capacity assessment at the national level, and CSO partners who provided comments during the various stages of the assessment as well as at the Nadi Workshop in May 2009. We are particularly indebted to Mr. Lionel Gibson, formerly of the Foundation of the People of the South Pacific International (FSPI), who actively provided substantive guidance and support throughout the duration of the project. The Centre is also indebted to Ms. Amelia Siamomua, the project coordinator for managing the completion of the capacity assessment undertaken by Synexe Consulting. The formulation of the overall project and its subsequent management was undertaken under the leadership and guidance of Ernesto Bautista, the UNDP Pacific Centre Regional Governance Advisor.

Like much of the rest of the world, they are experiencing the impacts of globalisation, non-sustainable development policies and, more recently, increased focus on the threat of terrorism. The proportion of the population under the basic need poverty line is rising, and rural-urban migration is leading to urbanisation and squatter settlement growth. Civil unrest and political instability in some PICs highlight the importance of urgent governance issues. These challenges are compounded by PICs\u2019 limited geographical size and location, their dependence on narrow resource bases, limited international trade opportunities, and their particular vulnerability to natural and environmental disasters. In the Pacific region, civil society organizations (CSOs) represent a critical constituency and development partner for advancing towards the MDGs. There are currently more than 1,000 CSOs operating in the region at different levels, covering a wide spectrum of issues. This ranges from disabilities, youth, gender, trade, health, environment, culture and governance. Over 85 percent of CSOs in the Pacific are involved in activities that are aimed at promoting or achieving the MDGs. The CSO community therefore potentially represents a force to be reckoned with for creating positive change in the region. The reality, however, is that this potential is constrained by the numerous challenges CSOs face. Their legitimacy is frequently questioned by governments, with many governments viewing them with skepticism and distrust, and vice versa. Dialogue between CSOs and governments are often ad-hoc, unsupported by any institutional legal frameworks. In addition, CSOs face various capacity challenges. Many of them do not have stable funding sources and rely on unpredictable, donor-driven project funding. Chronic limited human resource capacity, the inability to recruit and retain high quality staff, and high staff turnover are other areas where CSOs face urgent capacity challenges. While CSOs have undergone disparate self- assessment initiatives with external facilitators, there has not been a systematic region-wide effort to map out and examine their capacity development needs. What are the existing capacity levels within the CSO community in the Pacific? What are the specific capacity gaps of CSOs? What are the constraints they encounter while working towards their goals and priorities? How are they supported in their activities by their socio-economic, political and legal environments? Underpinned by these key questions, UNDP\u2019s Pacific Centre facilitated an extensive regional study in 2008-2009 aimed at assessing capacity development challenges of CSOs in the region. This study was undertaken with the following objectives: \u2022\ufffd assess\ufffdexisting\ufffdcapacity\ufffdand\ufffdneeds\ufffdof\ufffdselected\ufffd CSOs operating at the regional and national levels (identifying strengths and weakness); \u2022\ufffd identify\ufffd and\ufffd develop\ufffd realistic,\ufffd feasible\ufffd and\ufffd time-bound capacity development strategies (based on the capacity assessment); \u2022\ufffd document\ufffdlessons\ufffdlearned\ufffdduring\ufffdthe\ufffdcourse\ufffd of facilitating this initiative; and \u2022\ufffd assess\ufffd the\ufffd socio-economic,\ufffd politico-cultural\ufffd and legal environment in which CSOs operate.

It is important to note that while the Report refers to them simply as \u2018CSOs\u2019 they specifically represent only the views of the CSO participants from the sample group, and those consulted during the research process. Fieldwork CSOs in the Pacific region work on diverse and broad ranging issues. While some focus on the MDGs, a number of them work on other sectors, ranging from religion to disability advocacy. Youth and health are focus areas of many CSOs in the region across countries. The architecture of the CSO community in the Pacific region is a two-tier structure. One consists of national CSOs at the country level, while the other consists of PRNGOs, which serve as the mechanism for CSOs\u2019 engagement with inter-governmental regional organizations or agencies. At the country level, CSOs consist of various network and stand- alone organizations operating at the national and or sub-national levels, including various community- based and faith-based organizations. Many national CSOs also have secondary areas of programmatic focus. PRNGOs, on the other hand, are more focused on specific areas of expertise, as are CSOs which are the local counterparts of international CSOs such as the WWF. Fieldwork for this study began in January 2009. Prior to the start of the field work, researchers liaised with the National Liaison Units (NLUs), the national peak body CSO in each of the PICs, to arrange for a comprehensive sector-wide representation of CSOs to participate in the assessment. Given the length of the questionnaire, it was decided that eight CSOs from each country would participate in the exercise. (Due to issues such as cancelation of assessment appointments, however, a full eight interviews were not conducted in all of the countries). During the interview process, the researcher worked one-to-one with CSO representatives to complete the assessment questionnaire and provided supporting material when possible. The researchers also took notes of conversations with CSO members and examined relevant documents to gather additional data.

Despite the fact that CSOs have been operating in the Cook Islands for a long time (the youngest CSO in the study was established over eight years ago), none consulted in this study can be classified as being in a \u2018mature\u2019 stage of organizational development. The capacity assessment indicates that while CSOs are generally satisfied with the outcomes of their modest goals, they have not achieved as much as they would like. Some participants in the study clearly indicated that there were projects they wanted to undertake but could not due to their lack of infrastructure. Lack of funding is the biggest capacity gap for CSOs. It hinders their plans for expansion and impacts other areas such as obtaining skilled labor or even basic office equipment. CSOs also face problems that stem from specific societal factors in the country. One such factor is migration, which has a diminutive impact on CSO membership and undermines continuity in key areas such as leadership. Another factor is the conflict between the traditional rootedness of Cook Islanders in a church culture and certain aspects of modernity. Aspects of secular culture, along with tourism, are drawing away youth from their affiliation with religion-based CSOs, leading them to disengage with such organizations and their programmes (Box 2.1). It is only in the past few years that Cook Islands\u2019 CSOs have made concerted efforts to establish themselves. A few of them can be classified as being in the \u2018expanding\u2019 stage of organizational development, efficiently and effectively carrying out their work programmes. Some demonstrate a high level of professionalism. They have clear focus areas for their operations, with gender issues at the centre. They have managed to solicit sustained financial assistance from donors such as the NZ Aid Programme for activities that have been ongoing for a number of years.

Women ostensibly play a very dominant role in CSO operations. The governing bodies of a majority of the CSOs interviewed for this study comprised of women. Of all the participants, less than a quarter were male. In fact, they indicated they were trying to include more males in their operations. The CEO of one of the CSOs consulted was female. Cook Islands\u2019 broader societal culture markedly impacts the workings of CSOs in number of positive ways. They are aided by a local culture that encourages strong community ties, nurturing good relations, and a spirit of lending assistance among members. Their organizational culture is thus underpinned by close personal relationships A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles 8 9 A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles and one-one contacts. CSOs have benefited from these interactions by getting sponsorships from local businesses, obtaining financial assistance from their members, and even soliciting resources through help of family and friends. It has also helped in facilitating good working relations with government.4 A number of CSO staff members are government employees. The strong sense of community and the country\u2019s small population size have become instruments by which CSOs achieve their organizational goals. The area of human resources, for example, is managed by social relationships, rather than through established formal procedures or contracts. Their strategy to share and dissemination information also occurs through face-to-face sessions and personal meetings. In the face of resource scarcity in so many areas, from basic infrastructure to funding and manpower, the greatest resource for Cook Island CSOs are people.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "235f5cd3-2b81-472a-863b-bcb2c5c95c80": {"__data__": {"id_": "235f5cd3-2b81-472a-863b-bcb2c5c95c80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d62ca87154c7d0a9a8b8f81ddf5fa4df4385581702a8d86b3eb5727ebacc29df"}, "2": {"node_id": "298c2534-844b-46ef-8872-cb1816e18061", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c78d0457f826e38dd6b56dfa7c4c8127a94f661368d271de22b82e8ca6085ef"}}, "hash": "155d9bff30a1686dc408ac491de7be57105b7186a52297c0511e1a61f5cadf54", "text": "Maintaining amicable relations with one another is necessary in order to continue functioning, and in achieving their goals. Capacity Gaps CSO capacity deficits in the Cook Islands start at the level of basic internal infrastructure (Box 2.2). Most of the CSOs interviewed for the study did not have office space or equipment such as computers and printers. The fact that CSOs have managed to continue their operations despite these constraints is a testament to their resourcefulness and commitment. 4 CSOs have noted that the flow of information from government to civil society, which currently occurs through relationships of familiarity and relatively easy access, may be hampered by its Official Information Act 2008. Although the Act is likely to benefit media, a number of participants in the study said that they are unlikely to benefit from it. In fact, it can be an impediment for civil society because it will bureaucratise the process for accessing government information, and restrict flow of information between themselves and their contacts in governments. Box 2.1. The Youth And The Church Many religion-based CSOs in Cook Islands feel the impact of the divergence of ideals between the traditional local church culture, and the local youth, one of their target groups. Cook Island\u2019s secular culture, which is prominent in nightclubs, and strongly supported by tourism, is increasingly attracting youth away from CSO programmes that are religion-based. Participants in the study noted that the values, ideals, and general interest of many Cook Island youth are not being reflected in the conservative nature of the church culture and its youth programmes. For example, many of the younger church members prefer more modern styles of worship. They want to address issues through contemporary forms of worship, such as more upbeat styled music, and the use of theatre-styled worship programmes such as plays and creative expression. These preferences conflict with older members, who prefer to maintain worship styles in line with what they perceive to be traditional church culture.

Thus the attraction of nightlife entertainment scene, along with the conservative church culture, is drawing away younger church members from CSO-affiliated activities. Even if these CSOs are able to obtain resources from church funding sources, an increasing number of their intended recipients will remain disengaged from their programmes unless the divergence in ideals is addressed. This scenario presents a long term capacity problem many Cook Islands CSOs are attempting to address. In such situations, additional funding is unlikely to provide any solutions. Box 2.2. What we Need: Desired Capacities Of Cook Island CSOS The following are areas of concern for Cook Islands CSOs: \u2022 CSOs in the study identified staff training as priority for capacity development. \u2022 There is especially need for training in areas of information and technology where skills update is a necessity. CSO staff members reported during the consultations that they need upskilling in the use of software such as MYOB and Microsoft Office. These are constantly being updated and many CSOs employ them in their work. \u2022 For many CSOs functioning at minimal sustenance levels, achievement of modest capacity goals, such as procuring infrastructure (office space and equipment) and establishing management structures is the more realistic option. \u2022 Foreign aid donors can have a larger impact by increasing their financial assistance to CSOs in areas such as salaries and office expenses. This would address weaknesses such as the inability of CSOs to retain staff, in particular well-qualified staff, and lessen their reliance on volunteers. It would also lessen their dependence on using equipment and facilities from other organizations. Foreign assistance makes up the bulk of funding for CSO projects (although assistance also comes from local governments and small businesses and organizations). The only two CSOs in the study with full-time paid staff positions were funded by the NZ Aid Programme. Foreign aid donors can have a large impact on the capacity levels of CSOs by increasing financial assistance in areas such as salaries and office expenses. This would address the challenge of organizations retaining staff, in particular well- qualified staff. It would also lessen their reliance on volunteers, who are important but not always available, as well as their dependence on facilities from other organizations. One CSO in the study which fits into the \u2018expanding\u2019 stage of organizational development has been able to receive sustained funding from the NZ Aid Programme. This indicates success of its operations and its ability to carry out a wide range of programmes since the Programme\u2019s core funding is normally given on the basis of CSOs demonstrating their capacity to effectively carry out programmes that fit with its core goals. Despite this, the CEO of the organization admitted that it could do more, and that its desire for expansion was restricted by lack of financial resources. The CSOs funded by the Programme noted that its funding was sufficient only for funding one full-time position in their organizations. Since the single salaried staff member was inundated with clerical work and activities such as maintaining the office and equipment, other important areas, such as sourcing funds for programmes and monitoring and evaluation, remain ignored. Another capacity deficit is the inability of organizations to retain qualified staff due to the lack of funds. An example of this comes from a CSO which was formed in 2000, but was able to get start operations only in the last couple of years due to constraints in funding and manpower. The operations finally took off because of the experience and commitment of its staff members (who were highly qualified academic individuals), and because its work was academic in nature (such as developing a research database), which could be achieved without much financial resources and full-time paid employees. If a full-time employee was in place, the project activities would have taken off with greater ease and in a timelier manner. This case represents the challenges Cook Islands CSOs face in light of financial constraints and shortage of qualified staff. For this reason, CSOs rely on volunteers who work solely on the basis of their commitment to the \u2018cause\u2019 and the organization. A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles 10 11 A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles The volunteer staff is the most obvious capacity asset CSOs possess. Without substantial funding, people\u2019s greatest resources are themselves. At the same time, volunteerism, no matter how commendable, brings its own set of challenges.

The possibility of volunteers leaving to respond to better employment opportunities is ever present. The constant flow of people moving in and out of organizations also makes it difficult for CSOs to maintain a stable infrastructure. Staff members often have to cover multiple duties when others leave. In addition, when there is a sudden influx of new workers, the mix of skills may change regardless of its suitability for the organization. There is no guarantee therefore that CSOs will have a stable workforce. Cook Island CSOs can also benefit from greater engagement with regional and international organizations working in these fields. Although most of their work is focused locally, there are key issues they address, such as climate change and gender equity, which are also being addressed by CSOs in the region and globally. A greater engagement at the regional and international level would greatly help Cook Islands CSOs in terms of knowledge building. Existing Approaches to Capacity Development Only a few CSOs in Cook Islands can be classified as being in a stage of organizational development where they are able to effectively carry out their activities. The remaining fluctuates between the earliest stages of nascent development and a level where they are developing capacity in specific areas, such as internal structures and processes. Within this framework, most staff members seem to have adequate training for their current roles in their respective organizations. In other words, their skills match the requirements of the programmes with which they are currently engaged. Capacity development, particularly in staff training, is likely to become necessary if CSOs expand their operations. Developments in knowledge and technical skills, particularly in the areas of computer technology and use of software, would be helpful (Box 2.3). Given the circumstances in which they operate, Cook Island CSOs exhibit a resourcefulness to achieve their goals through alternative means. They adopt approaches that fit their circumstances, and in accordance with their societal and organizational culture. The commitment of CSOs staff members is praise-worthy. They also clearly make use of the \u2018resource\u2019 they have by means of their social relations and personal connections, which enable them to call on special favors whenever required. For example, the alternative arrangement to meet the challenge of ICT access is for staff to use equipment at their other places of paid employment, or through their contacts in private businesses and government. Such arrangements, however, cannot support the long-term sustainability of CSOs. Improving their capacity from the basic levels of infrastructure is urgently required. Box 2.3. CSO Capacity Development Activities: Highlights \u2022 Most CSOs do not have staff who are formally trained for the positions they hold. Only one out of the seven CSOs interviewed provided in-house training for its board members. \u2022 Staff members in many CSOs acquire skills pertinent to their positions from the work they do elsewhere.

Only few of them have clear visions, missions and goals. The other group consists of a small number of large CSOs which are well funded and equipped with trained professional staff working in specific sectors. These CSOs have clear missions and goals as part of their strategic plans, and can even match large CSOs in Australia or New Zealand in terms of their capacities for action. They focus primarily on environmental issues5 and receive strong support and mentoring by external NGOs like The Nature Conservancy that have their bases in FSM. This support has been instrumental in local environmental CSOs receiving assistance from external agencies such as governments and philanthropic agencies. There is extreme variability in capacity between these two groups of CSOs in almost every axis of the study (Table 3.1). The smaller CSOs are barely equipped with office infrastructure, and have very low levels of funding. Their members, who are 5 The one major exception to this is the Micronesian Seminar which is a Jesuit-funded research organization. volunteers, do not possess the skills to develop systems and processes that will optimise the functioning of their organizations. Even in the realm of strategy and planning, the split between the two groups is obvious. While the larger ones have well designed strategic plans, the smaller CSOs tend not to have strategic or operational plans. This variability in capacity leads to wide ranging impacts. The large CSOs, with their higher levels of performance and outputs, have attained a degree of public recognition. This ensures that they receive funds from external agencies, including donors, which, in turn, sustains their ongoing development. On the other hand, the majority of CSOs operating under constrained circumstances can only deliver at basic levels. Thus they receive very little external support. During the consultation process, donor representatives made it clear that as a general rule of thumb, they do not provide either \u2018start-up funds\u2019 for CSOs, or monies for salaries. The low level of support by external funders has been identified by CSOs as a key reason for their low levels of capacity. The lack of funds means smaller CSOs have no recourse to make necessary investments in their physical or human resources. Many are unable to develop and grow beyond being volunteer organizations.

There is no real duplication of efforts either. While a number of the smaller CSOs have similar mandates (such as alleviating poverty), their limited reach means that their operations do not negatively impact one another. Capacity Gaps A number of small CSOs during the consultation process repeatedly raised the question of how they could break out of the negative cycle between low capacity levels and external funding from donors. Their perspective was that the selection processes of donors disproportionately singled them out because they have not developed basic capacity in key areas in the first place, including a modest level of infrastructure and internal governance structures. If they could receive initial disbursement of funds from donors through grants, it would assist in kicking start the process of developing capacity in various areas. To this end, they argued, donors need to utilise different assessment levels when making decisions on funding. Otherwise, the cycle of funding only \u2018winners\u2019 will continue, while many \u2018worthy\u2019 CSOs with potential to develop and grow would miss out on much needed resources. Developing the capacity to access funds, including skills to write grant applications, is a priority for them (Box 3.1). Another key weakness identified during the consultation process was the lack of effective coordination within the CSOs community. There was general feeling of discontent with the coordination system of the NLU. CSOs argued that without an effective coordination mechanism within the country, CSOs would lose out on the potential positive benefits associated with collectively lobbying with government or donors. They identified this gap as a key reason behind the community\u2019s state of disarray. A strengthened NLU system would allow them to work more effectively as a network. Existing Approaches to Capacity Development Currently there are very few opportunities for capacity development in the FSM CSO community (Box 3.2). Apart from the larger CSOs whose members receive regular on-the-job training, staff members of the smaller CSOs have not received any formal training through external or internal opportunities.

An approach towards capacity development suggested by larger CSOs (local CSOs and the local branches of international CSOs) during the Box 3.2. CSO Capacity Development Activities: Highlights \u2022 There is very little occurring in the way of capacity development activities within the FSM CSO community. \u2022 Some funding for capacity development activities had been provided by the NZ Aid Programme over the years, which focused on the country\u2019s National Liaison Unit (NLU) and a few key CSOs. \u2022 A small number of individuals are also enrolled in the programme for Graduate Diploma in Not-for-Profit Management conducted by UNITEC. \u2022 Large CSOs undertake capacity development activities for their own staff, in an internal process of \u2018on- the-job\u2019 training. \u2022 The larger CSOs suggested during the consultations that they would be able to provide similar training for the smaller CSOs. Box 3.1. What we Need: Desired Capacities of FSM CSOS The capacities FSM CSOs highlight as key to their development are: \u2022 Increased ability to access funds, including assistance for smaller CSOs to write grant applications \u2022 Increased financial literacy \u2022 Better coordination within the FSM CSO community consultations was for them to mentor smaller CSOs through the use of peer-learning networks. This opportunity appears potentially promising, particularly given that such a form of engagement does need not require expensive travel outside FSM. It would also ensure the applicability of the training to the FSM environment since the mentoring would be delivered by organizations already operating in-country.

The areas of health, education, gender, youth, disability, and environment, human rights, trade and poverty alleviation are all well represented in the CSO community. All of the Fijian CSOs consulted in this study were established as charitable trusts.6 A majority of them possessed organizational vision and mission statements, and organizational goals, ranging from the very sophisticated to the basic (Table 4.1). They also indicated that a human rights-based approach (HBRA) and gender were integrated into their work programmes. Women were significantly represented on boards and in managerial roles, and their strategic documents had references to HRBA as a core foundation for programming decisions. Fijian CSOs belong either to a group that is urban, large, well established, and well resourced with a mix of paid educated staff and volunteers, or to one that is small, rural, poorly resourced, and staffed by local volunteers. Respectively, they range from those with sophisticated infrastructure on par with small, successful CSOs in Australia or New Zealand, to those with little or minimal infrastructure and internal management structures. The national CSO sector is relatively well connected and coordinated, and a high level of cooperation exists amongst CSOs. The broader cross-sectoral social service delivery seems to be distributed predominantly through the NLU. Its nine provincial arms also play a significant role, particularly in the areas of youth, health and environment.

This membership is a 6 The principal legislation governing CSOs and non-governmental organizations in Fiji is the Charitable Trusts Act (1945, Chapter 67), which offers CSOs an opportunity to be incorporated as a charitable trust and be recognized as a voluntary organization. In late 2001, the State de-registered a human rights CSO for challenging the legality of the government and has since threatened to de-register CSOs that oppose the government. At the time the research for this study was carried out, CSOs informed that the government had announced that no more NGOs would be registered within Fiji. source for providing them with regular up-skilling and workshop/networking opportunities. The dissemination of information by the NLU is a source of capacity building for CSOs. A key strength of Fijian CSOs is their ability to implement positive change in their constituencies. Discussions with the public, government and donor agencies during the consultation process supported statements by CSOs that they were strong advocates for their communities. Advocacy work is very much an active part of the CSO community\u2019s philosophy and strategic vision. All the CSOs interviewed had a clear advocacy focus, and demonstrated high levels of awareness about building long-term support in country to increase community awareness about their causes. The ability of CSOs to raise public awareness and influence decision making level is further demonstrated by their increased inclusion at local and national governmental platforms, and regional and international fora. Many Fijian CSOs operate well in spite of a lack of formal infrastructure. They quietly get the job done, staffed by volunteers, including governance boards that meet regularly and keep reasonably good records, and in many cases, funded at very low levels by the government. One national CSO, for example, has been operating successfully for over 30 years with minimal infrastructure and a tiny volunteer staff and board. A considerable resource of CSOs is their impressive spirit of volunteering. CSO staff members are predominantly fulltime volunteers who fall into two categories: \u2022\ufffd Older/retired\ufffd men\ufffd and\ufffd women\ufffd who\ufffd have\ufffd personal stake in the cause; and \u2022\ufffd Young\ufffdgraduates\ufffdlooking\ufffdfor\ufffda\ufffdfirst\ufffdjob. This volunteerism must been seen in the context of the country\u2019s demography, particular for the latter group. Unlike most of the Pacific, Fiji does not face chronic staff shortages. A high number of educated young people join the workforce every year. Faced with work shortage in the formal sector, they join the CSO sector where they gain valuable work experience, which can later lead to paid employment with larger PRNGOs, international CSOs, or multi or bilateral agencies in Suva. This is an opportunity that does not readily exist in other Pacific nations, and can be viewed as a win-win situation. Another advantage that Fijian CSOs have over other Pacific countries is that their close proximity to PRNGOs and international agencies in Suva results in their inclusion in regional and international fora, and provides a platform for advocacy that may otherwise not be present. It also provides the aforementioned access to well-paid jobs in regional and international agencies for the volunteers working in national CSOs. Table 4.1.

During the interviews, national CSOs expressed concern about feeling \u2018used and abused\u2019 through theft of their intellectual property, and the belief that they are continually passed over (in terms of funding and programme delivery) in favor of the larger, better- resourced PRNGOs. Even the smallest national CSOs struggled to understand the value international organizations bring to their work and their people. The impact of this is serious. The greater ability of international and regional CSOs to deliver vis-\u00e0-vis national CSOs is not necessarily conducive to the empowerment of local communities, or to building effective relationships and capacity in the CSO community as a whole. This is an issue that is clearly important to the national CSO community which is experiencing ongoing volatility and instability within both its own community and its larger political environment. Capacity Gaps CSOs in Fiji achieve a lot on miniscule budgets, but their service delivery can further improve with access to more resources, training, and technical assistance to develop capacity in a range of priority areas (Box 4.1). Presently, most of the support they receive is channeled through the NLU, or in the case of some, their international parent bodies. CSOs are highly aware of the decreasing availability of funds from government, private sector and donors, particularly in light of the current global financial crisis. Many are caught in the age old \u2018catch 22\u2019 position, where they need funding to build their infrastructure and internal governance systems, but are not being eligible for funding unless a minimum level of capacity and accountability are in place. Generally speaking, Fijian CSOs appear to be more reactive than proactive in terms of seeking funding opportunities. They seek funding on a project by project basis rather than through an annual planning process. Part of this can be attributed to the funding environment, where little domestic funding is available, and partly to the informal structures of CSOs. With very few overheads, the majority of funding sought is for programmes and projects that are developed in an ad hoc manner. Box 4.1. What we Need: Desired Capacities Of Fijian CSOS Fijian CSOs highlight the following as priority areas in their capacity development process: \u2022 All CSOs can benefit from improved structures and processes, including updating infrastructure and equipment. \u2022 Majority of CSOs desire technical assistance in accessing funding (including writing funding proposals). \u2022 Training/technical assistance is also needed in the areas of strategic planning, general management (including setting up systems and processes), financial management and media training. \u2022 Group training is preferable since they can learn from each other. During the consultations, some CSOs particularly requested training which is specific to their line of work. This included: \u2022 technical training, in particular GIS mapping, marine survey and design, and climate change assessment with the Pacific Island Applied Geosciences Commission (SOPAC). \u2022 disabled care giving workshop at the Fiji School of Medicine A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles 24 25 A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles Associated with funding scarcity is the pervasive insecurity about ongoing sources of funding. A key issue highlighted during the consultation process was the vulnerability of CSOs to the funding whims of donors. (This particular predicament, however, is not limited to Fiji, and given the relatively \u2018independent\u2019 nature of many Fijian CSOs, it would be fair to say that they are less at risk than CSOs in other Pacific countries). For some large CSOs, the risk is that donors\u2019 funding priorities are subject to change from one financial year to another, depending on a range of external factors. An example of this is the uncertainty around NZ Aid Programme funding in wake of the change of government in late 2008. Even if organizations possess concrete and robust strategic plans, money from donor sources for a particular year may not align with these stated targets or goals. Therefore, for continual funding, they may have to move away from their strategic plans, and adopt programmes targeted by donors. Many CSOs feel pressured to deliver what they see as the latest \u2018trend\u2019 of foreign governments. Another area that needs capacity development is management in general and financial management in particular. During the consultation process, CSOs repeatedly requested assistance in these areas. Participants also highlighted reporting as an area of weakness, emphasizing the difficulties of reporting in different formats to different stakeholders. The lack of staff with necessary skills for report writing and writing donor funding requests is the key gap here.

The issue of governance of CSOs, which has significant potential to make or break an organization, is another priority area in Fiji. Organizational boards lack appropriately skilled people, and there exists a general ignorance about the requirement of board members. All CSOs in the study indicated a greater need for management training and civic education in communities. Their perspective was that upskilling community leaders can have widespread benefit for the broader community, including that of CSOs. Existing Approaches to Capacity Development There is a vast amount of work going on in Fiji on capacity building in the CSO community (Box 4.2). Every international aid agency has some training programme underway or proposed. These, however, do not appear to be coordinated in any way and seem limited to the Suva CSOs. The lack of coordination and access to these opportunities is resulting in frustration in the wider CSO community in Fiji. Smaller CSOs which are not privy to large levels of funding from donors find very limited training opportunities, with most of it being facilitated by the Fiji Council for Social Service (FCOSS). There is little access for them to the initiatives provided through PRNGOs or international agencies. Some participants in the consultation process raised the point that it was always the same people who were picked to undergo training, and that the learning gained in the training sessions was seldom shared.

While a clear majority of the CSOs consulted in the study possessed basic visions and mission statements, and goals, their practical transition to implementation was limited only to the largest and most well-resourced organizations. In spite of this, a clear strength of Solomon Island CSOs was their ability to implement positive change in their end- user communities. The CSOs reported as a group that their connection to the communities they served was their key strength. A major challenge facing national CSOs in Solomon Islands lies in that its post-conflict \u2018failed\u2019 country status has made it increasingly attractive for \u2018foreign\u2019 NGOs in recent years. The country provides ample opportunities to do high-visibility \u2018good\u2019 works, and thus their presence is strong in the country. This scenario impacts national CSOs in two ways. First, they cannot compete with external NGOs which have more funds and greater levels of capacity. This difference in the capacity to deliver services has led local communities to question the value created by national NGOs, and consequently, there has been decline in the latter\u2019s legitimacy in the eyes of stakeholders. Second, it has also meant loss of their staff to international agencies that offer better", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f518947-7bf6-4be0-9d5d-ffa974def5be": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f518947-7bf6-4be0-9d5d-ffa974def5be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c848f472ea10f12b3353c6df5cba5e5e23ed6b9aace2814b228b121ed52c7fac"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba18a1fd-42ed-4fdd-8b90-8b9f1bfb900f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d08661259e7e7c45025f56ba40d2c581168a3150352cfbb2b9a544353fa9369"}}, "hash": "7c73deedf9241e4d812dcef18d4201cd4f69203f94a777233e92bc366b9ba441", "text": "employment packages. International agencies, including bi-lateral agencies such as NZ Aid Programme and AusAID, and multi-laterals such as the UNDP, recruit staff directly from the local CSO ranks, depleting their manpower. During the individual capacity assessment exercise and at the consultation forum, these challenges presented by \u2018foreign\u2019 agencies were key concerns raised by Solomon Islands CSOs. There is also a degree of competition among national CSOs, particularly over funding (Table 5.1). This is present not only among those working in the same sector, but within the entire CSO community since there are only finite funding sources for the community as a whole. The majority of CSOs in Solomon Islands are starved of funds. Apart from a few which have a solid platform of donor support, CSOs are constantly on the lookout for new funding sources. They are also consistently confronted with uncertainty in the tenure of staff positions due to the uncertainty of funding sources. Table 5.1. Solomon Island CSOS: Capacity Assessment In Five Areas 1.

A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles 30 31 A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles Solomon Islands CSOs are not proactive in seeking funding opportunities, partly because there is little available domestic funding. Even for an organization such as the Development Services Exchange (DSE), the peak national NGO body to facilitate development services for NGOs, which is able to utilise a subscription fee from members to complement its external funds, the funding from domestic sources is negligible. The only real sources of funding for CSOs are external donors, whether they are multi-laterals like UNDP, bi-laterals like AusAID or the NZ Aid Programme, or other foreign donors such as OXFAM- NZ. CSOs are thus greatly vulnerable to the whims of the donor community, and this impacts their organizational development in many areas\u2014from strategic planning to their programme operations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "806f0c03-cb0f-47b3-b6a5-9150fc59bc40": {"__data__": {"id_": "806f0c03-cb0f-47b3-b6a5-9150fc59bc40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1bd67f4b3ab08534748fded5fd3b187992599499e0a7f5c1ad2c797cafb79e66"}, "2": {"node_id": "eedba4db-869d-4e80-ab3a-ad1c4fd7e03d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb3e2dd7e44228fd7a5510c7f628120a40a68dea2019fce3a5c951a70b12e508"}}, "hash": "7fbe4b382d47734a5e33edc8ffdaf71e6143b2a7661127e9a952156b5e3eebf9", "text": "Even in the area of basic infrastructure and management systems, national CSOs face the uncomfortable \u2018chicken and egg\u2019 position of needing funding to build their basic infrastructure and internal systems, but being ineligible for it under donor requirements until these very structures are in place. When duplication in work programmes occurs, it is likely a result of the pressure for CSOs to take on programmes necessary for continued funding, irrespective of whether the programmatic focus is within their area of expertise. Capacity Gaps There are several capacity challenges which CSOs, as a group, face in Solomon Islands. Some of these, such as the gaps in internal systems and processes, are systemic and exist irrespective of the size and effectiveness of the organization. A telling example comes from a successful national CSO, which has programmes across the country and a strong record of positive outcomes. When the two founders of the organization retired, it went through rapid decline. The organization almost fell apart because the remaining staff did not possess knowledge of how the organization worked as a whole. They had only been focusing on their particular roles. The downfall of the CSO was halted only after a great deal of work by a new CEO. A lack of formally documented written systems and processes, combined with a lack of succession planning, contributed to its absence of institutional memory at the organizational level. This example demonstrates how the lack of written systems and processes can be a critical weakness for CSOs, even for those that have a record for effectiveness and achievements. Another key weakness of Solomon Island CSOs is their lack of knowledge and skill in the field of monitoring and evaluation. In order to comply with the accountability requirements of funders, CSOs are required to regularly report on progress. Funders only provide limited support to CSOs for fulfilling these requirements so the process requires a great deal of effort on the part of CSOs. Their lack of skills means CSOs spend a substantial amount of time working on compliance forms, taking their focus away from important operational management issues. CSOs are also aware of their lack of capacity in evaluating their own operations.

During the consultation, all CSOs strongly indicated that upskilling in the field of monitoring and evaluation was an important need. Another area of capacity deficit is that of strategic planning. As highlighted in Table 5.1, while a number of CSOs have strategic plans, these are either outdated or have no provisions for transforming into operational plans. Strategic plans that are in place are also generally ill-suited to organizational capacity. They are written more as inspirational documents. While strategic plans can be drafted at inspirational levels, this needs to be done within a realistic framework of the organization\u2019s capacity. In addition, members of governance boards clearly lack skills to carry out their responsibilities and provide strategic inputs. They do not regularly attend meetings, and since there is no training available for them, are uninformed about their roles and the expectations out of them. In order to make strategic planning truly useful and meaningful for CSOs, donors will also have to be more open and informed about how to increase the effectiveness of local CSOs, rather than then superimposing their priorities on them. Solomon Island CSOs face a lack of coordination and communication within its own community, and with their regional partners and the broader international community. During the consultations, CSOs identified this as a priority area for action (Box 5.1). While the NLU is able to help overcome some of these communication issues, recent events within the Unit (such as the organization losing almost all of their staff in the past four years) mean that it does not currently possess the capacity to solely fulfill this function. One approach to cover communication and coordination gaps that was raised during the consultation process was the possibility of establishing a centralised web page, where national CSOs could log data about their activities as a way of information dissemination. Existing Approaches to Capacity Development There are limited opportunities for capacity development in the CSO community, especially in light of the fact that CSO staff members often have to take on additional duties outside their area of expertise due to high staff turnover (Table 5.2). Many of them are working in jobs for which they received little or no formal training. Focused training for existing staff can go a long way in helping staff upskill for additional responsibilities. So far, such opportunities have been very limited. The majority of staff members who participated in this study had not undergone formal training of any sort. Some had taken part in sporadic training sessions provided by donors, while a few had participated in UNITEC\u2019s Graduate Diploma Programme in Not-for-Profit Management. These numbers compared to the total number of staff members, however, was low. Moreover, the UNITEC programme, while being beneficial and useful, was found to be too expensive by participants. Attending the programme also meant relocation out of their jobs, which was a problem for organizations facing chronic understaffing. There are cases where training in CSOs occurs informally and at a peer-to-peer level. It is a form of interaction where the more experienced staffer mentors others within the organization whenever time permits. In some organizations, overseas volunteers are also actively working to increase capacity, but this is on an ad hoc basis and unsustainable. The role of peer-peer networks is the area that needs further examination in the context of developing CSO capacity in Cook Islands. It could provide an important platform for up-skilling in different priority areas.

What We Need: Desired Capacities Of Solomon Island CSOS Key internal capacities identified as priority for Solomon Island CSOs are: \u2022 Improvement in infrastructure (computers, office equipment) \u2022 Development of technical skill levels of staff (especially financial management and monitoring and evaluation) \u2022 Development of general skills through training (in internal staff management and leadership) \u2022 Development of planning skills (to link strategic planning to operational planning) \u2022 Improvement in governance via selection of better board members and their training \u2022 Better coordination within the Solomon Islands CSO community \u2022 Better communication with external stakeholders Box 5.2. CSO Capacity Development Activities: Highlights \u2022 Only the largest CSOs are able to address issues on capacity gaps through capacity development activities. Lack of funding and capable staff to conduct internal training are main reasons. \u2022 A degree of informal peer-mentoring occurs in a few CSOs, among staff and among senior members of various CSOs.

Tongan CSOs seem to have a good understanding and awareness of the MDGs. While they may not explicitly base their work around the MDGs, they are an intrinsic part of CSO programming. The majority of Tongan CSOs in the study fell in the emerging stage of organizational development, where they are developing some capacity in specific areas (Table 6.1). Four large CSOs fell in the expanding range of capacity development, with a track record of achievements. All of them possessed organizational visions and mission statements, and associated goals. The national CSO sector is well connected. Although duplication exists, there is also a higher than usual level of cooperation among CSOs. CSOs are generally aware of what other organizations are doing and they work in a collaborative way to maximise impact on their communities. Tongan CSOs identified their dedicated staff and their strong networks as major strengths. Many of the organizations expressed the importance of their membership with the NLU, which seems to benefit them considerably in terms of accessing opportunities for regular up-skilling, attending workshop/networking opportunities, and information dissemination. The broader cross- sectoral social service delivery is distributed predominantly through the NLU and its members. Areas such as health, education, gender, youth, disability, and environment, human rights, trade and poverty alleviation are all well represented. The ability of CSOs to raise public awareness on matters of importance to their constituents was acknowledged by public, government and donor agencies during the consultation process of this study. There is a degree of competition among Tongan CSOs over the very limited available funding. However, CSOs in the country have an impressive ability to get the job done despite constraints. This is not to say that their service delivery could not further improve with access to additional resource, training and technical assistance. Presently most of the support they receive is channeled through their NLU, or in the case of some CSOs, through their international parent bodies.

Capacity Gaps One of the key issues that came out in the consultation process was the vulnerability of CSOs to the funding whims of the donors. The uncertain funding environment plays a large part in the operation modality of CSOs. Generally speaking, CSOs are reactive rather than proactive in terms of looking for funding opportunities, and in terms of planning how they can make the kinds of changes they want to see in Tongan society. They tend to look for funding on a project by project basis rather than through an annual planning process. With very few overheads, the majority of funding sought is for programmes and projects, which are developed in an ad hoc manner. These challenges contribute to staff insecurity and high staff turnover. During the consultations, CSOs stressed on the importance of seeking diversity of funding sources, as well as on the need of staying informed about changes in national government and on the international front (such as the current global financial situation). Financial management and management in general are areas that need major capacity development. CSOs reported that while they", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35e0a8c7-fd64-4f87-a6fa-932dc27c12a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "35e0a8c7-fd64-4f87-a6fa-932dc27c12a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92264c7c281658b4dbb230a3c9ec979f66a7ca3f86da0f571357e01015a5d09f"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c8f9931-50cd-436b-b6e3-8cdd72ec16a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27d9dd378ce885b6f942d74ee3170e87ea1592ee2382f67cd5865c6962ea3ca8"}}, "hash": "b6e3069ede640f1272b8de8bfd4e20659b0a3a029207cfe778a1aa7b14ae89b0", "text": "are knowledgeable about their issue areas or work sectors, learning how to run an organization was where they most needed assistance. CSOs repeatedly requested technical assistance in this area during the consultations (Box 6.1). Reporting is a weakness for many CSOs, particularly since it is difficult and time consuming to report in different formats to different stakeholders. This problem is compounded by the lack of staff with skills in both report writing and writing donor funding requests. Monitoring and evaluating for donors is limited to the larger CSOs, and they have frameworks in place for this. Smaller CSOs considered monitoring and evaluation frameworks as desirable but not a priority. Box 6.1. What We Need: Desired Capacities Of Tongan CSOS The desired capacities of Tongan CSOs are: \u2022 More coordination among agencies delivering training initiatives and access to these opportunities. \u2022 Technical assistance in strategic planning and proposal writing. During the consultations, many CSOs expressed concern that proposal writing and reporting took up a substantial amount of time due to their lack of skills. \u2022 Technical assistance in financial management and general management training (including setting up systems and processes). Group training is preferred to individual training in order to learn from each other. The issue of governance, particularly relating to organizational boards, is a significant capacity weakness for Tongan CSOs. The lack of appropriately skilled people for board memberships and information deficit about the requirements of board members add to this problem. CSO boards are generally made up of volunteers who do not understand the requirements of the post or possess knowledge to provide advice and direction to CSO managers. In some cases, some CSO boards were identified as being too \u201cnice\u201d while others were identified as \u201cruling with an iron fist\u201d. At the consultations, CSOs emphasised on a greater need for governance training and civic education. They all identified training for governance boards as a priority. Existing Approaches to Capacity Development While there seems to be ongoing capacity development activities for CSOs, there is a lack of coordination among agencies so that the recipients who need them most do not necessarily receive them (Box 6.2). Tongan CSOs are innovative when it came to seeking proactive ways of pursuing opportunities to upskill staff members. They approach opportunities with a perspective to maximise the benefits of every engagement in a practical and cost effective way. During the consultations, for example, some suggested that if they were in Fiji for a workshop an opportunity, they would stay on an extra week and attach themselves to a PRNGO to make use of the latter\u2019s broad network of connections. The lack of coordination and access in training delivery, however, is resulting in increasing frustration in the Tongan CSO community. Some CSOs commented during the consultations that it was always the same people who were picked to undergo training and that this learning was not widely shared. For the smaller CSOs which do not have access to donor funding, training opportunities are limited to those facilitated by the NLU. They have little or no access to the training provided through international agencies. Box 6.2. CSO Capacity Development Activities: Highlights \u2022 The majority of CSOs interviewed had undergone training from national, regional, and in some cases, international organizations. \u2022 Capacity development activities are however not conducted in a coordinated manner. \u2022 It was evident from the interviews that the National Liaison Unit (NLU) possessed the skills and knowledge to aid local CSOs upskill at a moderate level. It however lacks funding to undertake such activities.

Given the small size and closeness of Tuvaluan society, \u2018everyone basically knows everyone\u2019 and people are inclined to help one another. These close community ties aid CSOs in mobilising resources, particularly labour, in times of need. A telling example comes from a small CSO with only three female staff members. The CSO needed to remove a large tree in order to make a pathway to its building entrance. Since the activity was labour intensive they appealed for help from their local community members whose response was quick and effective. They not only removed the tree but laid a stone path in a very short time span, without any remuneration. Poorly-resourced CSOs, many of whose activities are limited to basic programmes, receive such support from their larger community. CSOs in Tuvalu have strong local networks through which they obtain financial assistance. The large CSOs in Tuvalu also have strong networks with organizations abroad, largely enabled by ICT infrastructure. This keeps them up to date on the latest knowledge developments in their field, and provides information about funding opportunities. Although tension in relations with government does exist in certain cases, there have also been instances where contact with the government in advocacy work has yielded fruitful results. A CSO that lobbied the government on NGO and tobacco issues considers its efforts being influential in the passing of the Incorporation of NGO Act 2007, and the Tobacco Control Act 2008. Tuvaluan CSOs show diversity in their programmatic work areas, ranging from youth and health to 8 Four other CSOs listed a number of MDGs as being important considerations, but did not set their objectives around them. Two CSOs did not find any commonalities between their operations and the MDGs, and one other had not even heard of them. 9 Only one organization could clearly state what these were, while the heads of two others could highlight some components; others were at various states on drafting at the time of the in-country interviews. Two CSOs did not have statements of vision, mission and goals. poverty and spiritual development. In general, the MDGs do not seem to be a determining factor in CSO programming. Only one CSO in the study appears to have consciously made an effort to incorporate the MDGs into its operations.8 CSOs also did not have clear statements of visions, missions, and goals, except for one. While some were at drafting stage, they were clearly absent in a few organizations.9 A reason behind the gap in written statements and documented goals is that urgent capacity needs\u2014 such as office space or electricity\u2014is the primary focus of CSOs. Drafting or documenting specific organizational information seems irrelevant, at least to them, in the light of such basic capacity gaps. Another key factor behind this gap is cultural. One of the CSOs in the study without a mission statement or documented goals was a kinship organization whose members traced their roots to a common ancestor, and which met at irregular intervals for family get-togethers. As a kinship organization, its purpose was primarily to keep the family together. Translating this into a statement of vision, missions, and goals is not particularly relevant in this context, and probably not desirable. This case conveys the complex cultural dynamics that are present in the Tuvaluan CSO community. The issue of context\u2014both cultural and otherwise\u2014 is an important factor to consider when assessing Tuvaluan CSOs (Table 7.1). It is not only relevant in terms of the broader environment in which CSOs operate, but also in the manner in which CSOs assess themselves. Planning activities of CSOs, for example, can sometimes be influenced by Tuvaluan customary practices which tend to give more opportunities to male discussions. When there are meetings, the A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles 42 43 A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles key decision-making group sits in an inner circle surrounded by other participants and observers. Often, this inner circle is reserved for leading males, and although women are present, they do not have the same representation as males. At the same time, this aspect needs to be seen in light of kinship ties present in most Pacific island cultures, where an absence of physical female representation does not mean necessary imply lack of their inputs. Such inputs are often achieved through alternate means, such as through advice given by sisters to their brothers, and/or wives to their husbands. In some cases, the brothers hold their sisters in such high respect, in particular their older sisters, that they convey what their sisters\u2019 viewpoints even if", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4ce89de-0860-4327-bebb-ef6c6d0e530d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4ce89de-0860-4327-bebb-ef6c6d0e530d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cdb96a93ba076020acee455a5c080917765e793ffca0fd5ea527cb89f522759c"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2b8a67c-d58c-40cb-9349-44476f28e0cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18bec09fd07e904f64e860a45229648bbfe513b83b002b89a193e3ed1989c4db"}}, "hash": "793a82fce3cc250bf95190d8db01863151090a80581632ec00f4ec7a5afdd956", "text": "it differs from their own.

If funding is approved, it is channeled back into Tuvalu through the government to the umbrella body, which passes it to the CSO.

These ministries include the Ministry of Youth, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Home Affairs, the Environment Department, Ministry of Natural Resources, and the Fisheries Department. Contextual observation also applies in the area of linking strategic planning to operational activities on which Tuvaluan CSOs, from the largest and most well-resourced CSOs to the smallest ones, rated themselves highly. This assessment has to take into account the kinds of strategic plans each organization formulates. The smallest CSO in the study, for example, set very basic strategies, such as keeping a safe and clean environment or acquiring items such as electricity, a computer, pens, pencils, books, in order to provide services to their members. Their strategies did not go beyond this level, and were thus easily translated into operational activities.

Even in the case of obtaining baseline data, CSOs in Tuvalu\u2014whether those with good infrastructure or without\u2014were confident they had systems in place to obtain relevant baseline data for their operations. (The only CSO that rated itself poorly in this capacity measure was one that was recently established). This uniformity in self-assessment is again likely due to the kind of baseline data each CSO requires. A large CSO in the country, for example, which has over 95 percent of the population as its members, gathers data on diverse issues such as the social, economic, spiritual needs of members both locally and internationally, the capacity of institutions to meet them, and the extent of assistance from overseas", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e9582a6-984a-48c1-847d-2796285bd1a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e9582a6-984a-48c1-847d-2796285bd1a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "013ec577c5447ce4b8ef0246ffbebf14aad4764745eab56c0ed4368b12d3e735"}}, "hash": "013ec577c5447ce4b8ef0246ffbebf14aad4764745eab56c0ed4368b12d3e735", "text": "members and donor agencies. The CSO\u2019s support structure includes well-equipped buildings, ample staff, property in Tuvalu and abroad, and technical communication networks. At the other of the spectrum is a CSO with three staff members (who are paid by community donations), which operate out of a building without electricity. Being a learning institution, the kind of baseline data it requires is minimal\u2014the age and basic educational needs of members, which they obtain by members simply filling out an information sheet. Most CSOs relying on donations and funds from community members or governments also consider themselves to have sufficient resources for their operations, which are minimalist by nature in the first place. Even in terms of outputs and performances, CSOs appear satisfied in terms of what they can produce with the resources on hand. For the most part, they base their operating systems and programmes according to their organizational structure and capacity. Thus their self-assessment is satisfactory when viewed from this contextual perspective. If some of these CSOs are to expand or diversify their programmes, however, adoption of more formalised mechanisms and systems will become necessary. During the consultations, there was undoubtedly a sentiment among the less-resourced CSOs that they could set more ambitious goals if they had additional resources. For example, a CSO which works on environmental issues does so without a proper office space or equipment and staffed entirely by volunteers. Although its members would like to address the myriad of environmental problems in Tuvalu, including rising sea levels, severe weather and related social and economic problems, they settle for identifying a few tasks that they can realistically achieve in the absence of basic organizational resources. Capacity Gaps A key weakness identified by most CSOs in the study was their lack of and uncertainty about funding. For some smaller CSOs, funds to acquiring basic office equipment, and in some cases, office space, are urgent needs. Others are concerned about what will happen to their operations when current funding ceases. Funding constraints impact developing capacity in other areas such as human resources, the lack of which is another key capacity weakness. Most Tuvaluans undertake post-secondary school training overseas. (Although there is a local University of South Pacific training centre, it does not offer the full range of courses in the same capacity as that of the USP in Fiji and other overseas training and educational institutions). Qualified Tuvaluans who are trained overseas can find employment abroad, or are likely to end up working for government or other local enterprise that provides paid employment if or when they return. They are not likely to take on voluntary and unpaid work. Access to funds could provide opportunities for CSOs to train and upskill their current staff, or, opportunities for training could also open up through strengthened networks with donor agencies (Box 7.1). Shortage of qualified staff is compounded by the issue of migration, which is an area of concern for CSOs. With job opportunities not be as abundant in Tuvalu as in other parts in the region such as Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia, many Tuvaluans are migrating. Funafuti, where many jobs are located, shows clear signs of population congestion and land shortages. Rising sea levels exacerbate the problem, fuelling local desire to migrate overseas. While most CSOs in the study considered the area of strategic planning as one that needed development, at the same time, they did not appear to initiate activities towards this goal. Because they had to survive on low levels of funding and the services of volunteers, their focus was on more immediate tasks. Governance issues, which are handled very informally, will demand greater attention if CSOs expand operation. Currently, meetings among staff members and between staff and boards are sufficient to establish governance and management procedures. While some well-developed CSOs have formal procedures documented, this is absent in smaller and/or less-developed CSOs. Documentation on governance structures and systems will become necessary in case of expansion, especially if or when they seek donor funding. The weakness in ICT infrastructure of the country as a whole impacts the capacity of CSOs to fully make use of ICT. The main issue with communication and coordination is whether the country can install a broader telecommunication and ICT infrastructure at all. Not only is the ICT infrastructure in Tuvalu often unreliable, its usage is restricted because of overall uneven infrastructural development in the country. In the urban areas, particularly in the island of Funafuti, there is developing ICT infrastructure. Many people have personal computers with access to emails and online avenues for communications.

CSOs cannot reap the advantages of having email, internet, and telephones when the people they want to contact do not have the same degree of access. Existing Approaches to Capacity Development An unclear picture emerges from the assessment on existing approaches to capacity development in Tuvaluan CSOs. While CSOs clearly engage in various kinds of capacity development activities, they are neither coordinated nor systematic (Box 7.2). Some CSOs seek financial assistance from the government or from the larger community to initiate such activities, while others seek help from CSOs working in similar fields. Some focus on maintaining strong networks with their members whom they call upon in times of financial need. CSOs are also able to benefit through information-sharing from Box 7.1. What We Need: Desired Capacities Of Tuvaluan CSOS Tuvaluan CSOs identify the following as priority areas for developing capacity: \u2022 Training opportunities, particularly technical training in areas of their expertise/work programmes. \u2022 Enhancement of ICT skills. CSOs want training on the use of internet and software such as Microsoft Office and MYOB. Currently, staff members of less-developed CSOs have significantly less access to training opportunities or computer facilities. \u2022 Management training, in terms of marketing, financial, and organizational development. A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles 48 49 A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles Box 7.2. CSO Capacity Building Activities: Highlights \u2022 Assessment on capacity building initiatives in Tuvaluan CSOs presents an unclear picture. Such activities occur in various ways, but are not coordinated or systematic. \u2022 What is clear is that better developed organizations are able to provide greater access to training opportunities for staff. The systems and processes for training staff correlates with the level of organizational development. \u2022 In some exceptional cases, staff training has occurred at a very high level, and has included educational training abroad for staff members. international organizations, and occasionally these relations bring training opportunities or result in joint-projects. There are exceptional instances where staff training, specifically, has been conducted at a very high level in CSOs which can afford them. One CSO in the study where paid employees formed the bulk of its staff had strict training systems for staff members, which included educational training that could be undertaken in Tuvalu or abroad. Through these training opportunities, staff members acquired prerequisite qualifications for their positions. As a result, its staff members were very well qualified. One member had several publications under his name and was working on another publication at the time of the interviews. Another was working on a film documentary on climate change in Tuvalu with a Fijian-based filmmaker, and travelling to a United Nations meeting in Geneva to give a presentation on climate change issues. Yet another staff member was recently awarded an honorary PhD by an Asian based university. On the whole, however, approaches to capacity building in the CSO sector need to be more clearly defined and developed. Tuvaluan CSOs indicate a very strong desire to acquire further training in areas that are pertinent to their current work programmes. During the consultations, a staff member from a CSO that works on environmental issues highlighted a university degree in the field of environment as a desired capacity. Another project staff member who works at a CSO that focuses on ecological and environmental issues identified training of \u2018Geographic Information Systems\u2019 and eco-tourism as desired areas of training. CSOs are also concerned with obtaining further training in the area of ICT. For a number of well- equipped CSOs, the acquisition of new ICT has propelled their level of technological advancement. In addition to computer hardware and software, this group is equipped with faxes and PowerPoint projectors. A project staff member at one CSO even possessed an underwater camera, sonar equipment, and the satellite-based navigation system known as the Global Positioning System (GPS). At the same time, there are Tuvaluan CSOs that function with bare minimum ICT equipment and software. During the consultations, staff members notably wanted to undertake training in ICT and software usage such as Microsoft Office, the most popular software, and MYOB. A number of CSOs have MYOB but it is underutilised due to lack of knowledge. Apart from wanting to enhance their skills in these areas, staff members appeared to believe that developing their ICT skills would benefit in their engagement with aid donors. Donors could attempt to strike a balance by providing basic ICT equipment and software to the less developed CSOs which lack them, and target", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d33cf77c-161d-4730-b866-a18998538545": {"__data__": {"id_": "d33cf77c-161d-4730-b866-a18998538545", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43c4097c8859071e551c13539b689dd1076f15a3f634c49d87dd0b64eabd3bc9"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce84802d-5d39-4846-bea3-cd19e6e652c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c51ea5b0b2a003147a0fb143beba11e3dddab455dc673c9fd733622ad1abd7fa"}}, "hash": "9823628ac66389d906953a2e570e01dec91abc62b1f3e70014323c92fb922b17", "text": "on providing training to those which do not possess the knowledge capacity to use them. It is also worth considering providing more overseas training arrangements for CSOs that have progressed to using more sophisticated technology. Another area of considerable interest to Tuvaluan CSOS is management training in marketing, financial, and organizational development. This is not only an indication of commitment by staff to their professional growth, but also represents their personal desire to upskill. Since CSOs in Tuvalu keenly exhibited their enthusiasm for such learning opportunities during the consultations, this could be a key area where donors could target their assistance.
