Appendix: Development Log Frame 29 Table of Contents Section 1 Introduction A Capacity Development Plan for CSOs in the Pacific 2 3 A Capacity Development Plan for CSOs in the Pacific Introduction This Capacity Development Plan is a result of a capacity assessment study, conducted under the facilitation of the UNDP Pacific Centre, to assess existing capacity and needs of the civil society organizations (CSOs) in the Pacific. Recognising that the civil society community represents a critical constituency and development partner for advancing the MDGs in the region, UNDP initiated the study of selected CSOs in the region to assess existing capacity and needs (identifying strengths and weakness). The study also included developing realistic and time-bound strategies to address the capacity deficits of CSOs, based on the results of the assessment. Field work was conducted in six Pacific Island Countries (PICs) in 2008- 2009. Besides national CSOs, the study included Pacific Regional NGOs (PRNGOs), which represent networks of national CSOs at the regional level. The overall study considers capacity development for Pacific CSOs as the process by which individuals, organizations and societies obtain, strengthen and maintain capabilities to set and achieve their own development objectives over time. Three publications resulted from the study. An integrated report, A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific, presents the overall findings of the study. It also presents an overview of the CSO community in the Pacific and a detailed presentation of the methodology that was used in the assessment exercise. A second report, A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles, presents country-specific reports of the six countries of study. This Capacity Development Plan is the third Report. It responds to the second objective of the study that is to develop a feasible action-oriented \u2018plan\u2019 aimed at addressing the capacity challenges delineated by the assessment exercise. The overall capacity assessment exercise was based on an endogenously created framework known as the Clearing House Framework1 , a collaborative plan of action initiated by PRNGOs for strengthening NGO capacity in key priority areas. The study assessed five priority areas for \u2018CSO capacity\u2019 and covered a broad spectrum of issues under each axis (Table 1.1). Its basis was a detailed questionnaire which collected baseline data on each of the axes, and included training-needs assessments and internal- focused and external-focused SWOT analyses. While the questionnaire was the main instrument for data collection, in-country field work included group consultations and workshops. The consultation processes provided ample opportunities for CSOs to discuss the capacity issues that were most seriously inhibiting their ability to act effectively. Since this Capacity Development Plan is underpinned by the same framework, it ensures that the Plan is also aligned with the actual needs of CSOs. 1 For a more detailed report on the Clearing House Framework, see the publication A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific Region. The Capacity Plan: Structure In light of the study\u2019s collective data, a number of cross-cutting gaps in CSO capacities, spanning the five axes, emerged. The recurring capacity gaps, which interlink or overlap, can be grouped into six discrete categories (Table 1.2). The Plan is a response to address the key capacity deficits identified in Table 1.2. Its core components consist of i) a range of concrete capacity developing activities to improve CSO capacity and ii) a competency framework to develop specific CSO competencies. At the same time, to make its approach more comprehensive, other components which build upon the core and contribute to its sustainability are also presented.

These are divided into three key learning groups, grouped on the basis of their skill and knowledge requirements. Section 3 also presents the priority competencies that need to be developed in CSOs across the board, in the context of capacity needs listed in Table 1.2. Section 4 clusters the competencies, per target group and combined target groups, which need to be developed or built through training. It identifies the training components of each relevant competency. Section 5 briefly discusses the modalities of delivery for the training programmes, and the contents of training modules/learning materials that need to be developed. The final component of the Plan is a capacity assessment questionnaire\u2014modified from the one utilised in the original capacity assessment exercise. This questionnaire, to be used by Pacific CSOs themselves to monitor the ongoing development of specific capacities, is integral to monitoring the effectiveness of this Plan and the sustainability of its activities. This should be one of the first outputs of the Plan when it is put into action. The Appendix of the Plan is a development log frame which provides an outline of how the Plan could be put into effect. Section 2 Capacity Development Plan: Priority Activities A Capacity Development Plan for CSOs in the Pacific 6 7 A Capacity Development Plan for CSOs in the Pacific Capacity Development Plan: Priority Activities The proposed activities in this section are aimed to meet key capacity gaps of the CSO community in the Pacific, as identified in the capacity assessment study. They specifically respond to the six categories of capacity challenges identified in the Introduction, and aim to strengthen the foundation in these six areas. The activities address a range of issues, from that of funding, monitoring and evaluation to communication and coordination within the CSO community. They call upon the National Liaison Unit (NLU), the national peak body CSO in each of the PIC, to play a central role in the initiation and in building support and momentum for these activities. It should be noted that the activities also complement and build on various activities already carried out by former CSO capacity development initiatives in the Pacific which have met with a degree of success. These are namely the Pacific Capacity Building Initiative run by CIDA and the UNDP and the Pacific Skills Link Project run by VSO2. For Pacific CSOs \u2018hard\u2019 capacities such as infrastructure, technology and finances (the gaps of which are often related to funding) are key capacities that need development on a broader organizational level. This Plan incorporates, in a manner as feasible as possible, strategies to aid the development of these capacities. At the same time, the Plan recognises that developing capacities of CSOs requires more than conventional skills and management procedures. Besides hard capacities, developing soft capacities, such as skills for negotiating, communication and networking, are equally important. While these types of skills may not necessarily be easily transferred, the development of specific soft skill competencies can aid in the transfer of hard skills. Soft capacities are also important to organizational or institutional capacity development, which refers to the process of building up organizations and embedding learning into the organization (rather than solely the individual). Given the high attrition rate of skilled personnel in Pacific CSOs, this component is specifically important. The connection between individual training and embedding that learning into the organization is crucial, and capacity development processes must necessarily consider this factor in the Pacific context. The Plan therefore includes components such as peer-to-peer networks across different CSOs, within different countries, where members of CSOs are able to connect with others with functionally similar roles to learn from one another. The use of peer-to-peer learning groups can help provide an environment in which these soft-skills (not to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e3490ac-48dd-4898-9c35-c98c2f4614a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e3490ac-48dd-4898-9c35-c98c2f4614a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-development-plan-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Capacity Development Plan for CSOs in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-development-plan-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f028d67ae1182619c2d2091069ee721054b0894dffc135f2d3df99d7fc80fa57"}, "3": {"node_id": "682c8515-7bc7-4a30-8081-63c25aad98a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-development-plan-csos-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "295aa8091e10f8d168021f0b94eb620a646df425f9d3acc131e788e4f1fddb14"}}, "hash": "2f1b14603e52e1d20273e9c6c0dee97617774428b9f9f042b763d3bc36ec466f", "text": "mention hard technical skills) can be more effectively acquired by CSO staff members. These peer networks ought to be facilitated by the NLUs within each country. The use of such networks, and well as other networking techniques, such as the use of communities of practice through the operation of blogs, for example, will provide opportunities for development of soft types of skills at both an organizational level and individual level. The Plan also includes a \u2018train-the-trainers\u2019 programme/network to develop the ability in CSOs to work within the CSO community and provide training for its members. In order to maximise capacity 2 A detailed report on these initiatives is present in the publication A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific Region. development initiatives, they should, to the extent possible, be led by the CSOs themselves to ensure their relevance and uptake. The train-the-trainers\u2019 programme is therefore intended to initiate the process of developing CSO capacity to work within the CSO community itself. The component of on-the- job mentoring, which was an issue raised by CSOs across the board during the consultations, can also be achieved through the use of a \u2018train-the-trainers\u2019 network. (The specific competencies required for this learning system, and its target groups for training, are discussed in the Section 3). At the same time, it is important to mention that there will also be an ongoing need for vocational education institutions, along with tertiary education providers, to continue to provide competency- based training. These types of internal and external training situations will help build on one another, while intra-organizational training will help embed the skills learnt in other learning environments. The capacity development activities in Table 2.1 are broken down into high and low priority areas, and into short (1 year), medium (1-3 years) and long term (more than 3 years) targets. They approach capacity building at three analytical levels\u2014individual, organizational, and enabling environment\u2014with particular reference to the gaps identified in the capacity assessment process \u2022\ufffd The training competencies for this are provided in Sections 3 and 4. \u2022 The training competencies for this are provided in Section 3 and 4.

A Capacity Development Plan for CSOs in the Pacific 10 11 A Capacity Development Plan for CSOs in the Pacific Section 3 A Competency - based Learning System The framework of activities in Section 2 essentially creates the space for CSOs members to learn a range of skills to effectively meet the challenges identified by the capacity assessment exercise. While some of these skills have been and can be acquired through formal training and education (such as UNITEC\u2019s Graduate Diploma Programme in NGO Management), the findings of the assessment exercise show that formal learning modalities for Pacific CSOs involve high costs and time (including long-distance travel) which many CSOs simply cannot afford. Existing formal training modalities, such as the graduate diploma programme, is effectively outside the reach of the majority of CSO staff since they are aimed at a high academic level. Moreover, they do not possess any on-the-job training components which CSOs have identified as necessary during the consultation processes of this study. Central to the Capacity Development Plan Activities of Section 2 is therefore the development of a range of competencies that includes a combination of hard/technical as well as and soft/interpersonal skills which are appropriate to the needs and constraints of the target CSOs. This entails a new competency-based learning system, with training, relevant specifically to the Pacific CSO context, as the key focus. This section first identifies the target learning groups in CSOs which the competency-based learning would address. As the capacity assessment process demonstrated, there is a general lack of management and leadership skills, especially at the senior levels.4 Moreover, besides the need for training for existing managers, the issue of second- generation leadership in Pacific CSOs is also a critical factor for their sustainability. Therefore developing competencies to respond to the needs of different target groups is crucial. This is followed by an outline of the key competencies that need to be developed across the board in Pacific CSOs that are a priority for upgrading, and which are to be used as the basis of the capacity development training (Table 4.1). Learning Groups The consultation process identified three key learning groups because of their internal coherence as learning groups in terms of skill and knowledge requirements. Regarding the specific needs of the target groups, on aggregate, there is a need to highlight certain key considerations, and work on a number of parallel tracks. \u2022\ufffd First,\ufffdthere\ufffdis\ufffdneed\ufffdto\ufffdbring\ufffdtogether\ufffdposition- category groups, for example, executive directors.

Since the training they undergo may vary, a clustering of competencies for each group is necessary. Table 4.1 presents an outline of the priority competencies for each learning group. Developing Competencies for Combined Groups At the same time, many sets of competencies are relevant across target groups. The following tables present the breakdown of competencies which target two or more learning groups.

A sustainable cost effective training programme for a large number of CSOs in the Pacific will require delivery modes different from those conventionally used, bound by time and space, and face-to-face training workshops which are also costly. While open and distance learning has been gaining global popularity, this option is limited for Pacific CSOs because of the low level of infrastructure and limited ICT access in much of the Pacific region. For the time being, developing modules on print mode or stand-alone CD-ROMs and tapes, seem to be viable options. Modules should be developed in such a way that they will be enhanced by adding ICT components such as interactive CDs when facilities are available. The creation of peer-to-peer networks to enable CSO staff from different organizations to come together and learn from one another has been included in the activities framework of Section 2. Such a modality could play a key role in ensuring that relevant skills are transferred among those who hold similar functional roles. Where possible, organizations should enable staff members who have undertaken training to work with their colleagues who have not, in order facilitate transfer of information between these peer networks. The \u2018train-the-trainers\u2019 course also suggested in Section 2, which aim to aid the embedding of capacities within organizations, should help enable this process. Self \u2013instructional Materials Instructional materials will facilitate self-directed learning as well as peer group interactions. Use of appropriate languages is very important so that the learner finds the materials easy to read and understand, and is able to maintain sustained interest. Materials should take into consideration the best practice in the development of self-instructional learning materials. Some of these include: \u2022\ufffd having\ufffd clear\ufffd set\ufffd of\ufffd learning\ufffd objectives/ outcomes at the beginning of each unit of the course \u2022\ufffd clear\ufffdintroduction \u2022\ufffd keeping\ufffd sentences\ufffd short,\ufffd simple\ufffd and\ufffd structured \u2022\ufffd consistency \u2022\ufffd local\ufffdcontext \u2022\ufffd relevant\ufffdexamples \u2022\ufffd logical\ufffdstructuring\ufffdof\ufffdinformation\ufffd \u2022\ufffd user-friendly\ufffdmaterial\ufffd Workplace Learning The course material should be developed to facilitate learning at the workplace. The problem-solving exercises, case studies, assignments, group works contained in the learning material should be relevant to the work place. These materials should provide opportunities for learners to demonstrate their ability to apply skills to improve their performance. Trainers Manual Development of materials should include a trainer\u2019s manual, which includes facilitation techniques for mentoring and coaching learners, presentations and small group activities. Trainers should act more in the role of mentors to alleviate learning difficulties of learners, and as motivators to encourage learners\u2019 self esteem and incite active participation in the training programmes.

The four-point scale provides a clear picture of the specific developmental stage of CSOs as well as their path of progress into the next (Table 2.1).

For a more detailed report, see A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific Region. Table 5.1. CSO Development Scale Points Stages Descriptors 1. Nascent The CSO is in the earliest stages of development. All the components measured are in its earliest stages or non-existent. 2. Emerging The CSO is developing some capacity in structures and processes around the issues of organizational development; sustainability and resourcing; information sharing, cooperation and advocacy. Stakeholder relations and its relationship with the legal and regulatory environment are in place, and at times may be functioning inconsistently. 3. Expanding The CSO has a track record of achievement. Its work is recognized by community stakeholders, government and other CSOs in the same sector. 4. Mature The CSO is fully functioning and sustainable, with a diversified resource base and partnership relationships with local communities with active national and international networks.

Their roles include the provision of basic services such as primary education, health, water and sanitation; participating in local planning and budgeting; advocating for human rights and the needs and priorities of their constituency especially the marginalised groups; providing shelter, counseling and support services to disadvantaged groups and victims of violence; monitoring the performance of government and other stakeholders in the provision of services; and more generally, progress towards the MDGs. It is widely recognised that an active and vibrant civil society is an important factor in the democratisation process. By mediating between the state and citizenry, civil society provides the mechanism to enhance citizens\u2019 voice and the engagement of citizens in various democratic processes that contributes to deepening democracy. While CSOs are expected to perform these varied functions, they face a range of capacity constraints and challenges. The challenges vary from organization to organization and are different in each country. They include: constraints relating to the overall external environment within which civil society operates; specific internal organizational capacity deficits that affect their ability to perform effectively and efficiently; and for many, a lack of financial resources and stability for funding their programmes or projects. This capacity assessment of civil society organizations in the Pacific is an attempt to undertake a systematic assessment to understand and document the capacity constraints that civil society organizations face in this region. Mindful of the sensitivity of such an exercise, the capacity assessment was conducted in a participatory manner in the development of the questionnaire, in the conduct of the assessment itself, and in the validation of the results. This Report presents in-depth capacity assessments of the six Pacific Island Countries where the assessment exercise was conducted. We hope this publication will provide readers with an understanding of the capacity development issues that affect civil society organizations in the Pacific region, and shed light on how they could be better supported and strengthened to advance and achieve better development outcomes for the region as a whole.

Like much of the rest of the world, they are experiencing the impacts of globalisation, non-sustainable development policies and, more recently, increased focus on the threat of terrorism. The proportion of the population under the basic need poverty line is rising, and rural-urban migration is leading to urbanisation and squatter settlement growth. Civil unrest and political instability in some PICs highlight the importance of urgent governance issues. These challenges are compounded by PICs\u2019 limited geographical size and location, their dependence on narrow resource bases, limited international trade opportunities, and their particular vulnerability to natural and environmental disasters. In the Pacific region, civil society organizations (CSOs) represent a critical constituency and development partner for advancing towards the MDGs. There are currently more than 1,000 CSOs operating in the region at different levels, covering a wide spectrum of issues. This ranges from disabilities, youth, gender, trade, health, environment, culture and governance. Over 85 percent of CSOs in the Pacific are involved in activities that are aimed at promoting or achieving the MDGs. The CSO community therefore potentially represents a force to be reckoned with for creating positive change in the region. The reality, however, is that this potential is constrained by the numerous challenges CSOs face. Their legitimacy is frequently questioned by governments, with many governments viewing them with skepticism and distrust, and vice versa. Dialogue between CSOs and governments are often ad-hoc, unsupported by any institutional legal frameworks. In addition, CSOs face various capacity challenges. Many of them do not have stable funding sources and rely on unpredictable, donor-driven project funding. Chronic limited human resource capacity, the inability to recruit and retain high quality staff, and high staff turnover are other areas where CSOs face urgent capacity challenges. While CSOs have undergone disparate self- assessment initiatives with external facilitators, there has not been a systematic region-wide effort to map out and examine their capacity development needs. What are the existing capacity levels within the CSO community in the Pacific? What are the specific capacity gaps of CSOs? What are the constraints they encounter while working towards their goals and priorities? How are they supported in their activities by their socio-economic, political and legal environments? Underpinned by these key questions, UNDP\u2019s Pacific Centre facilitated an extensive regional study in 2008-2009 aimed at assessing capacity development challenges of CSOs in the region. This study was undertaken with the following objectives: \u2022\ufffd assess\ufffdexisting\ufffdcapacity\ufffdand\ufffdneeds\ufffdof\ufffdselected\ufffd CSOs operating at the regional and national levels (identifying strengths and weakness); \u2022\ufffd identify\ufffd and\ufffd develop\ufffd realistic,\ufffd feasible\ufffd and\ufffd time-bound capacity development strategies (based on the capacity assessment); \u2022\ufffd document\ufffdlessons\ufffdlearned\ufffdduring\ufffdthe\ufffdcourse\ufffd of facilitating this initiative; and \u2022\ufffd assess\ufffd the\ufffd socio-economic,\ufffd politico-cultural\ufffd and legal environment in which CSOs operate.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT The findings in the profile tables and the accompanying analyses emerge from the in-country field work with selected CSOs. It is important to note that while the Report refers to them simply as \u2018CSOs\u2019 they specifically represent only the views of the CSO participants from the sample group, and those consulted during the research process. Fieldwork CSOs in the Pacific region work on diverse and broad ranging issues. While some focus on the MDGs, a number of them work on other sectors, ranging from religion to disability advocacy. Youth and health are focus areas of many CSOs in the region across countries. The architecture of the CSO community in the Pacific region is a two-tier structure. One consists of national CSOs at the country level, while the other consists of PRNGOs, which serve as the mechanism for CSOs\u2019 engagement with inter-governmental regional organizations or agencies. At the country level, CSOs consist of various network and stand- alone organizations operating at the national and or sub-national levels, including various community- based and faith-based organizations. Many national CSOs also have secondary areas of programmatic focus. PRNGOs, on the other hand, are more focused on specific areas of expertise, as are CSOs which are the local counterparts of international CSOs such as the WWF. Fieldwork for this study began in January 2009. Prior to the start of the field work, researchers liaised with the National Liaison Units (NLUs), the national peak body CSO in each of the PICs, to arrange for a comprehensive sector-wide representation of CSOs to participate in the assessment. Given the length of the questionnaire, it was decided that eight CSOs from each country would participate in the exercise. (Due to issues such as cancelation of assessment appointments, however, a full eight interviews were not conducted in all of the countries). During the interview process, the researcher worked one-to-one with CSO representatives to complete the assessment questionnaire and provided supporting material when possible. The researchers also took notes of conversations with CSO members and examined relevant documents to gather additional data. They contacted donors where ever possible to ensure that their views were taken into account as well.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "659bf3ff-2f6d-4777-868b-a6aafb1e1165": {"__data__": {"id_": "659bf3ff-2f6d-4777-868b-a6aafb1e1165", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Country Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf6b6e54676017903ac56b9daaf361a58d2215c542f6dd5a7258765d58a29c8f"}, "2": {"node_id": "35ec6bfb-a338-4ac3-b510-8cc1bff057b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "38d4ce812d29d3989024e88a9f94a3a68406cec0fd8d5995cfa1ecef47dfb03b"}}, "hash": "cbe559af9e804ba0f4aa49ffef3a681375f51132f8023afbc56a6a9b008cd4ae", "text": "They contacted donors where ever possible to ensure that their views were taken into account as well.

Despite the fact that CSOs have been operating in the Cook Islands for a long time (the youngest CSO in the study was established over eight years ago), none consulted in this study can be classified as being in a \u2018mature\u2019 stage of organizational development. The capacity assessment indicates that while CSOs are generally satisfied with the outcomes of their modest goals, they have not achieved as much as they would like. Some participants in the study clearly indicated that there were projects they wanted to undertake but could not due to their lack of infrastructure. Lack of funding is the biggest capacity gap for CSOs. It hinders their plans for expansion and impacts other areas such as obtaining skilled labor or even basic office equipment. CSOs also face problems that stem from specific societal factors in the country. One such factor is migration, which has a diminutive impact on CSO membership and undermines continuity in key areas such as leadership. Another factor is the conflict between the traditional rootedness of Cook Islanders in a church culture and certain aspects of modernity. Aspects of secular culture, along with tourism, are drawing away youth from their affiliation with religion-based CSOs, leading them to disengage with such organizations and their programmes (Box 2.1). It is only in the past few years that Cook Islands\u2019 CSOs have made concerted efforts to establish themselves. A few of them can be classified as being in the \u2018expanding\u2019 stage of organizational development, efficiently and effectively carrying out their work programmes. Some demonstrate a high level of professionalism. They have clear focus areas for their operations, with gender issues at the centre. They have managed to solicit sustained financial assistance from donors such as the NZ Aid Programme for activities that have been ongoing for a number of years.

Women ostensibly play a very dominant role in CSO operations. The governing bodies of a majority of the CSOs interviewed for this study comprised of women. Of all the participants, less than a quarter were male. In fact, they indicated they were trying to include more males in their operations. The CEO of one of the CSOs consulted was female. Cook Islands\u2019 broader societal culture markedly impacts the workings of CSOs in number of positive ways. They are aided by a local culture that encourages strong community ties, nurturing good relations, and a spirit of lending assistance among members. Their organizational culture is thus underpinned by close personal relationships A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles 8 9 A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles and one-one contacts. CSOs have benefited from these interactions by getting sponsorships from local businesses, obtaining financial assistance from their members, and even soliciting resources through help of family and friends. It has also helped in facilitating good working relations with government.4 A number of CSO staff members are government employees. The strong sense of community and the country\u2019s small population size have become instruments by which CSOs achieve their organizational goals. The area of human resources, for example, is managed by social relationships, rather than through established formal procedures or contracts. Their strategy to share and dissemination information also occurs through face-to-face sessions and personal meetings. In the face of resource scarcity in so many areas, from basic infrastructure to funding and manpower, the greatest resource for Cook Island CSOs are people.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "527345da-ddaa-42f8-b454-cd3b21bc8352": {"__data__": {"id_": "527345da-ddaa-42f8-b454-cd3b21bc8352", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Country Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8dbb38ffe71d7fa07f1e87111c35d2c547e83672b903eea41a29864309abca62"}, "2": {"node_id": "16d31f4b-e8f8-413d-9e86-1db66cee15d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab9000ef19ec383b894b8af6b940c274f87e22909c9ea7593042f42145a6e681"}}, "hash": "2de5aae3f6a96395547d6b5f04b85e9dbd83d470afbe8b28a41ffef8d92016df", "text": "Maintaining amicable relations with one another is necessary in order to continue functioning, and in achieving their goals. Capacity Gaps CSO capacity deficits in the Cook Islands start at the level of basic internal infrastructure (Box 2.2). Most of the CSOs interviewed for the study did not have office space or equipment such as computers and printers. The fact that CSOs have managed to continue their operations despite these constraints is a testament to their resourcefulness and commitment. 4 CSOs have noted that the flow of information from government to civil society, which currently occurs through relationships of familiarity and relatively easy access, may be hampered by its Official Information Act 2008. Although the Act is likely to benefit media, a number of participants in the study said that they are unlikely to benefit from it. In fact, it can be an impediment for civil society because it will bureaucratise the process for accessing government information, and restrict flow of information between themselves and their contacts in governments. Box 2.1. The Youth And The Church Many religion-based CSOs in Cook Islands feel the impact of the divergence of ideals between the traditional local church culture, and the local youth, one of their target groups. Cook Island\u2019s secular culture, which is prominent in nightclubs, and strongly supported by tourism, is increasingly attracting youth away from CSO programmes that are religion-based. Participants in the study noted that the values, ideals, and general interest of many Cook Island youth are not being reflected in the conservative nature of the church culture and its youth programmes. For example, many of the younger church members prefer more modern styles of worship. They want to address issues through contemporary forms of worship, such as more upbeat styled music, and the use of theatre-styled worship programmes such as plays and creative expression. These preferences conflict with older members, who prefer to maintain worship styles in line with what they perceive to be traditional church culture.

Thus the attraction of nightlife entertainment scene, along with the conservative church culture, is drawing away younger church members from CSO-affiliated activities. Even if these CSOs are able to obtain resources from church funding sources, an increasing number of their intended recipients will remain disengaged from their programmes unless the divergence in ideals is addressed. This scenario presents a long term capacity problem many Cook Islands CSOs are attempting to address. In such situations, additional funding is unlikely to provide any solutions. Box 2.2. What we Need: Desired Capacities Of Cook Island CSOS The following are areas of concern for Cook Islands CSOs: \u2022 CSOs in the study identified staff training as priority for capacity development. \u2022 There is especially need for training in areas of information and technology where skills update is a necessity. CSO staff members reported during the consultations that they need upskilling in the use of software such as MYOB and Microsoft Office. These are constantly being updated and many CSOs employ them in their work. \u2022 For many CSOs functioning at minimal sustenance levels, achievement of modest capacity goals, such as procuring infrastructure (office space and equipment) and establishing management structures is the more realistic option. \u2022 Foreign aid donors can have a larger impact by increasing their financial assistance to CSOs in areas such as salaries and office expenses. This would address weaknesses such as the inability of CSOs to retain staff, in particular well-qualified staff, and lessen their reliance on volunteers. It would also lessen their dependence on using equipment and facilities from other organizations. Foreign assistance makes up the bulk of funding for CSO projects (although assistance also comes from local governments and small businesses and organizations). The only two CSOs in the study with full-time paid staff positions were funded by the NZ Aid Programme. Foreign aid donors can have a large impact on the capacity levels of CSOs by increasing financial assistance in areas such as salaries and office expenses. This would address the challenge of organizations retaining staff, in particular well- qualified staff. It would also lessen their reliance on volunteers, who are important but not always available, as well as their dependence on facilities from other organizations. One CSO in the study which fits into the \u2018expanding\u2019 stage of organizational development has been able to receive sustained funding from the NZ Aid Programme. This indicates success of its operations and its ability to carry out a wide range of programmes since the Programme\u2019s core funding is normally given on the basis of CSOs demonstrating their capacity to effectively carry out programmes that fit with its core goals. Despite this, the CEO of the organization admitted that it could do more, and that its desire for expansion was restricted by lack of financial resources. The CSOs funded by the Programme noted that its funding was sufficient only for funding one full-time position in their organizations. Since the single salaried staff member was inundated with clerical work and activities such as maintaining the office and equipment, other important areas, such as sourcing funds for programmes and monitoring and evaluation, remain ignored. Another capacity deficit is the inability of organizations to retain qualified staff due to the lack of funds. An example of this comes from a CSO which was formed in 2000, but was able to get start operations only in the last couple of years due to constraints in funding and manpower. The operations finally took off because of the experience and commitment of its staff members (who were highly qualified academic individuals), and because its work was academic in nature (such as developing a research database), which could be achieved without much financial resources and full-time paid employees. If a full-time employee was in place, the project activities would have taken off with greater ease and in a timelier manner. This case represents the challenges Cook Islands CSOs face in light of financial constraints and shortage of qualified staff. For this reason, CSOs rely on volunteers who work solely on the basis of their commitment to the \u2018cause\u2019 and the organization.

The possibility of volunteers leaving to respond to better employment opportunities is ever present. The constant flow of people moving in and out of organizations also makes it difficult for CSOs to maintain a stable infrastructure. Staff members often have to cover multiple duties when others leave. In addition, when there is a sudden influx of new workers, the mix of skills may change regardless of its suitability for the organization. There is no guarantee therefore that CSOs will have a stable workforce. Cook Island CSOs can also benefit from greater engagement with regional and international organizations working in these fields. Although most of their work is focused locally, there are key issues they address, such as climate change and gender equity, which are also being addressed by CSOs in the region and globally. A greater engagement at the regional and international level would greatly help Cook Islands CSOs in terms of knowledge building. Existing Approaches to Capacity Development Only a few CSOs in Cook Islands can be classified as being in a stage of organizational development where they are able to effectively carry out their activities. The remaining fluctuates between the earliest stages of nascent development and a level where they are developing capacity in specific areas, such as internal structures and processes. Within this framework, most staff members seem to have adequate training for their current roles in their respective organizations. In other words, their skills match the requirements of the programmes with which they are currently engaged. Capacity development, particularly in staff training, is likely to become necessary if CSOs expand their operations. Developments in knowledge and technical skills, particularly in the areas of computer technology and use of software, would be helpful (Box 2.3). Given the circumstances in which they operate, Cook Island CSOs exhibit a resourcefulness to achieve their goals through alternative means. They adopt approaches that fit their circumstances, and in accordance with their societal and organizational culture. The commitment of CSOs staff members is praise-worthy. They also clearly make use of the \u2018resource\u2019 they have by means of their social relations and personal connections, which enable them to call on special favors whenever required. For example, the alternative arrangement to meet the challenge of ICT access is for staff to use equipment at their other places of paid employment, or through their contacts in private businesses and government. Such arrangements, however, cannot support the long-term sustainability of CSOs. Improving their capacity from the basic levels of infrastructure is urgently required. Box 2.3. CSO Capacity Development Activities: Highlights \u2022 Most CSOs do not have staff who are formally trained for the positions they hold. Only one out of the seven CSOs interviewed provided in-house training for its board members. \u2022 Staff members in many CSOs acquire skills pertinent to their positions from the work they do elsewhere.

Only few of them have clear visions, missions and goals. The other group consists of a small number of large CSOs which are well funded and equipped with trained professional staff working in specific sectors. These CSOs have clear missions and goals as part of their strategic plans, and can even match large CSOs in Australia or New Zealand in terms of their capacities for action. They focus primarily on environmental issues5 and receive strong support and mentoring by external NGOs like The Nature Conservancy that have their bases in FSM. This support has been instrumental in local environmental CSOs receiving assistance from external agencies such as governments and philanthropic agencies. There is extreme variability in capacity between these two groups of CSOs in almost every axis of the study (Table 3.1). The smaller CSOs are barely equipped with office infrastructure, and have very low levels of funding. Their members, who are 5 The one major exception to this is the Micronesian Seminar which is a Jesuit-funded research organization. volunteers, do not possess the skills to develop systems and processes that will optimise the functioning of their organizations. Even in the realm of strategy and planning, the split between the two groups is obvious. While the larger ones have well designed strategic plans, the smaller CSOs tend not to have strategic or operational plans. This variability in capacity leads to wide ranging impacts. The large CSOs, with their higher levels of performance and outputs, have attained a degree of public recognition. This ensures that they receive funds from external agencies, including donors, which, in turn, sustains their ongoing development. On the other hand, the majority of CSOs operating under constrained circumstances can only deliver at basic levels. Thus they receive very little external support. During the consultation process, donor representatives made it clear that as a general rule of thumb, they do not provide either \u2018start-up funds\u2019 for CSOs, or monies for salaries. The low level of support by external funders has been identified by CSOs as a key reason for their low levels of capacity. The lack of funds means smaller CSOs have no recourse to make necessary investments in their physical or human resources. Many are unable to develop and grow beyond being volunteer organizations.

There is no real duplication of efforts either. While a number of the smaller CSOs have similar mandates (such as alleviating poverty), their limited reach means that their operations do not negatively impact one another. Capacity Gaps A number of small CSOs during the consultation process repeatedly raised the question of how they could break out of the negative cycle between low capacity levels and external funding from donors. Their perspective was that the selection processes of donors disproportionately singled them out because they have not developed basic capacity in key areas in the first place, including a modest level of infrastructure and internal governance structures. If they could receive initial disbursement of funds from donors through grants, it would assist in kicking start the process of developing capacity in various areas. To this end, they argued, donors need to utilise different assessment levels when making decisions on funding. Otherwise, the cycle of funding only \u2018winners\u2019 will continue, while many \u2018worthy\u2019 CSOs with potential to develop and grow would miss out on much needed resources. Developing the capacity to access funds, including skills to write grant applications, is a priority for them (Box 3.1). Another key weakness identified during the consultation process was the lack of effective coordination within the CSOs community. There was general feeling of discontent with the coordination system of the NLU. CSOs argued that without an effective coordination mechanism within the country, CSOs would lose out on the potential positive benefits associated with collectively lobbying with government or donors. They identified this gap as a key reason behind the community\u2019s state of disarray. A strengthened NLU system would allow them to work more effectively as a network. Existing Approaches to Capacity Development Currently there are very few opportunities for capacity development in the FSM CSO community (Box 3.2). Apart from the larger CSOs whose members receive regular on-the-job training, staff members of the smaller CSOs have not received any formal training through external or internal opportunities. An exception is the Diploma Programme in Not-for- Profit Management offered by the New Zealand- A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles 16 17 A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles based UNITEC, through which some had received training.

This Programme, however, has the capacity to only deal with small numbers at a given time. It also requires expensive travel to the South Pacific from the North Pacific, which is a deterrent. An approach towards capacity development suggested by larger CSOs (local CSOs and the local branches of international CSOs) during the Box 3.2. CSO Capacity Development Activities: Highlights \u2022 There is very little occurring in the way of capacity development activities within the FSM CSO community. \u2022 Some funding for capacity development activities had been provided by the NZ Aid Programme over the years, which focused on the country\u2019s National Liaison Unit (NLU) and a few key CSOs. \u2022 A small number of individuals are also enrolled in the programme for Graduate Diploma in Not-for-Profit Management conducted by UNITEC. \u2022 Large CSOs undertake capacity development activities for their own staff, in an internal process of \u2018on- the-job\u2019 training. \u2022 The larger CSOs suggested during the consultations that they would be able to provide similar training for the smaller CSOs. Box 3.1. What we Need: Desired Capacities of FSM CSOS The capacities FSM CSOs highlight as key to their development are: \u2022 Increased ability to access funds, including assistance for smaller CSOs to write grant applications \u2022 Increased financial literacy \u2022 Better coordination within the FSM CSO community consultations was for them to mentor smaller CSOs through the use of peer-learning networks. This opportunity appears potentially promising, particularly given that such a form of engagement does need not require expensive travel outside FSM. It would also ensure the applicability of the training to the FSM environment since the mentoring would be delivered by organizations already operating in-country.

The areas of health, education, gender, youth, disability, and environment, human rights, trade and poverty alleviation are all well represented in the CSO community. All of the Fijian CSOs consulted in this study were established as charitable trusts.6 A majority of them possessed organizational vision and mission statements, and organizational goals, ranging from the very sophisticated to the basic (Table 4.1). They also indicated that a human rights-based approach (HBRA) and gender were integrated into their work programmes. Women were significantly represented on boards and in managerial roles, and their strategic documents had references to HRBA as a core foundation for programming decisions. Fijian CSOs belong either to a group that is urban, large, well established, and well resourced with a mix of paid educated staff and volunteers, or to one that is small, rural, poorly resourced, and staffed by local volunteers. Respectively, they range from those with sophisticated infrastructure on par with small, successful CSOs in Australia or New Zealand, to those with little or minimal infrastructure and internal management structures. The national CSO sector is relatively well connected and coordinated, and a high level of cooperation exists amongst CSOs. The broader cross-sectoral social service delivery seems to be distributed predominantly through the NLU. Its nine provincial arms also play a significant role, particularly in the areas of youth, health and environment.

This membership is a 6 The principal legislation governing CSOs and non-governmental organizations in Fiji is the Charitable Trusts Act (1945, Chapter 67), which offers CSOs an opportunity to be incorporated as a charitable trust and be recognized as a voluntary organization. In late 2001, the State de-registered a human rights CSO for challenging the legality of the government and has since threatened to de-register CSOs that oppose the government. At the time the research for this study was carried out, CSOs informed that the government had announced that no more NGOs would be registered within Fiji. source for providing them with regular up-skilling and workshop/networking opportunities. The dissemination of information by the NLU is a source of capacity building for CSOs. A key strength of Fijian CSOs is their ability to implement positive change in their constituencies. Discussions with the public, government and donor agencies during the consultation process supported statements by CSOs that they were strong advocates for their communities. Advocacy work is very much an active part of the CSO community\u2019s philosophy and strategic vision. All the CSOs interviewed had a clear advocacy focus, and demonstrated high levels of awareness about building long-term support in country to increase community awareness about their causes. The ability of CSOs to raise public awareness and influence decision making level is further demonstrated by their increased inclusion at local and national governmental platforms, and regional and international fora. Many Fijian CSOs operate well in spite of a lack of formal infrastructure. They quietly get the job done, staffed by volunteers, including governance boards that meet regularly and keep reasonably good records, and in many cases, funded at very low levels by the government. One national CSO, for example, has been operating successfully for over 30 years with minimal infrastructure and a tiny volunteer staff and board. A considerable resource of CSOs is their impressive spirit of volunteering. CSO staff members are predominantly fulltime volunteers who fall into two categories: \u2022\ufffd Older/retired\ufffd men\ufffd and\ufffd women\ufffd who\ufffd have\ufffd personal stake in the cause; and \u2022\ufffd Young\ufffdgraduates\ufffdlooking\ufffdfor\ufffda\ufffdfirst\ufffdjob. This volunteerism must been seen in the context of the country\u2019s demography, particular for the latter group. Unlike most of the Pacific, Fiji does not face chronic staff shortages. A high number of educated young people join the workforce every year. Faced with work shortage in the formal sector, they join the CSO sector where they gain valuable work experience, which can later lead to paid employment with larger PRNGOs, international CSOs, or multi or bilateral agencies in Suva. This is an opportunity that does not readily exist in other Pacific nations, and can be viewed as a win-win situation. Another advantage that Fijian CSOs have over other Pacific countries is that their close proximity to PRNGOs and international agencies in Suva results in their inclusion in regional and international fora, and provides a platform for advocacy that may otherwise not be present. It also provides the aforementioned access to well-paid jobs in regional and international agencies for the volunteers working in national CSOs. Table 4.1.

During the interviews, national CSOs expressed concern about feeling \u2018used and abused\u2019 through theft of their intellectual property, and the belief that they are continually passed over (in terms of funding and programme delivery) in favor of the larger, better- resourced PRNGOs. Even the smallest national CSOs struggled to understand the value international organizations bring to their work and their people. The impact of this is serious. The greater ability of international and regional CSOs to deliver vis-\u00e0-vis national CSOs is not necessarily conducive to the empowerment of local communities, or to building effective relationships and capacity in the CSO community as a whole. This is an issue that is clearly important to the national CSO community which is experiencing ongoing volatility and instability within both its own community and its larger political environment. Capacity Gaps CSOs in Fiji achieve a lot on miniscule budgets, but their service delivery can further improve with access to more resources, training, and technical assistance to develop capacity in a range of priority areas (Box 4.1). Presently, most of the support they receive is channeled through the NLU, or in the case of some, their international parent bodies. CSOs are highly aware of the decreasing availability of funds from government, private sector and donors, particularly in light of the current global financial crisis. Many are caught in the age old \u2018catch 22\u2019 position, where they need funding to build their infrastructure and internal governance systems, but are not being eligible for funding unless a minimum level of capacity and accountability are in place. Generally speaking, Fijian CSOs appear to be more reactive than proactive in terms of seeking funding opportunities. They seek funding on a project by project basis rather than through an annual planning process. Part of this can be attributed to the funding environment, where little domestic funding is available, and partly to the informal structures of CSOs. With very few overheads, the majority of funding sought is for programmes and projects that are developed in an ad hoc manner. Box 4.1. What we Need: Desired Capacities Of Fijian CSOS Fijian CSOs highlight the following as priority areas in their capacity development process: \u2022 All CSOs can benefit from improved structures and processes, including updating infrastructure and equipment. \u2022 Majority of CSOs desire technical assistance in accessing funding (including writing funding proposals). \u2022 Training/technical assistance is also needed in the areas of strategic planning, general management (including setting up systems and processes), financial management and media training. \u2022 Group training is preferable since they can learn from each other. During the consultations, some CSOs particularly requested training which is specific to their line of work. This included: \u2022 technical training, in particular GIS mapping, marine survey and design, and climate change assessment with the Pacific Island Applied Geosciences Commission (SOPAC). \u2022 disabled care giving workshop at the Fiji School of Medicine A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles 24 25 A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles Associated with funding scarcity is the pervasive insecurity about ongoing sources of funding. A key issue highlighted during the consultation process was the vulnerability of CSOs to the funding whims of donors. (This particular predicament, however, is not limited to Fiji, and given the relatively \u2018independent\u2019 nature of many Fijian CSOs, it would be fair to say that they are less at risk than CSOs in other Pacific countries). For some large CSOs, the risk is that donors\u2019 funding priorities are subject to change from one financial year to another, depending on a range of external factors. An example of this is the uncertainty around NZ Aid Programme funding in wake of the change of government in late 2008. Even if organizations possess concrete and robust strategic plans, money from donor sources for a particular year may not align with these stated targets or goals. Therefore, for continual funding, they may have to move away from their strategic plans, and adopt programmes targeted by donors. Many CSOs feel pressured to deliver what they see as the latest \u2018trend\u2019 of foreign governments. Another area that needs capacity development is management in general and financial management in particular. During the consultation process, CSOs repeatedly requested assistance in these areas. Participants also highlighted reporting as an area of weakness, emphasizing the difficulties of reporting in different formats to different stakeholders. The lack of staff with necessary skills for report writing and writing donor funding requests is the key gap here.

The issue of governance of CSOs, which has significant potential to make or break an organization, is another priority area in Fiji. Organizational boards lack appropriately skilled people, and there exists a general ignorance about the requirement of board members. All CSOs in the study indicated a greater need for management training and civic education in communities. Their perspective was that upskilling community leaders can have widespread benefit for the broader community, including that of CSOs. Existing Approaches to Capacity Development There is a vast amount of work going on in Fiji on capacity building in the CSO community (Box 4.2). Every international aid agency has some training programme underway or proposed. These, however, do not appear to be coordinated in any way and seem limited to the Suva CSOs. The lack of coordination and access to these opportunities is resulting in frustration in the wider CSO community in Fiji. Smaller CSOs which are not privy to large levels of funding from donors find very limited training opportunities, with most of it being facilitated by the Fiji Council for Social Service (FCOSS). There is little access for them to the initiatives provided through PRNGOs or international agencies. Some participants in the consultation process raised the point that it was always the same people who were picked to undergo training, and that the learning gained in the training sessions was seldom shared. Box 4.2. CSO Capacity Development Activities: Highlights \u2022 A majority of the Fijian CSOs consulted in the study has experienced staff training from national, regional, or international organizations, but these were not coordinated in any way. \u2022 The National Liaison Unit (NLU) is the Fijian counterpart for the CIVICUS capacity building project. \u2022 The NLU clearly possesses the necessary skills, knowledge and staff to up skill local CSOs, but the lack of funding is a key hurdle to undertaking such initiatives.

While a clear majority of the CSOs consulted in the study possessed basic visions and mission statements, and goals, their practical transition to implementation was limited only to the largest and most well-resourced organizations. In spite of this, a clear strength of Solomon Island CSOs was their ability to implement positive change in their end- user communities. The CSOs reported as a group that their connection to the communities they served was their key strength. A major challenge facing national CSOs in Solomon Islands lies in that its post-conflict \u2018failed\u2019 country status has made it increasingly attractive for \u2018foreign\u2019 NGOs in recent years. The country provides ample opportunities to do high-visibility \u2018good\u2019 works, and thus their presence is strong in the country. This scenario impacts national CSOs in two ways. First, they cannot compete with external NGOs which have more funds and greater levels of capacity. This difference in the capacity to deliver services has led local communities to question the value created by national NGOs, and consequently, there has been decline in the latter\u2019s legitimacy in the eyes of stakeholders.

During the individual capacity assessment exercise and at the consultation forum, these challenges presented by \u2018foreign\u2019 agencies were key concerns raised by Solomon Islands CSOs. There is also a degree of competition among national CSOs, particularly over funding (Table 5.1). This is present not only among those working in the same sector, but within the entire CSO community since there are only finite funding sources for the community as a whole. The majority of CSOs in Solomon Islands are starved of funds. Apart from a few which have a solid platform of donor support, CSOs are constantly on the lookout for new funding sources. They are also consistently confronted with uncertainty in the tenure of staff positions due to the uncertainty of funding sources. Table 5.1. Solomon Island CSOS: Capacity Assessment In Five Areas 1.

A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles 30 31 A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles Solomon Islands CSOs are not proactive in seeking funding opportunities, partly because there is little available domestic funding. Even for an organization such as the Development Services Exchange (DSE), the peak national NGO body to facilitate development services for NGOs, which is able to utilise a subscription fee from members to complement its external funds, the funding from domestic sources is negligible. The only real sources of funding for CSOs are external donors, whether they are multi-laterals like UNDP, bi-laterals like AusAID or the NZ Aid Programme, or other foreign donors such as OXFAM- NZ. CSOs are thus greatly vulnerable to the whims of the donor community, and this impacts their organizational development in many areas\u2014from strategic planning to their programme operations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c06ee342-f390-4ad4-b938-d8fc90d0ac67": {"__data__": {"id_": "c06ee342-f390-4ad4-b938-d8fc90d0ac67", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Country Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5cc48ce83ab7d22c106be30b9f18b20a3517e91aa036e4d4edd000e30097742"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d964ba4-a889-450b-bbda-4f40ca6b155d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85210296abe08d818321d891f3791a4fd2499f361682d4a43af87e38e8f3a299"}}, "hash": "110a801a4f67eeaa30cf4aa7d4b1125c3989db4b60b6d864819d57250b6a2d24", "text": "Even in the area of basic infrastructure and management systems, national CSOs face the uncomfortable \u2018chicken and egg\u2019 position of needing funding to build their basic infrastructure and internal systems, but being ineligible for it under donor requirements until these very structures are in place. When duplication in work programmes occurs, it is likely a result of the pressure for CSOs to take on programmes necessary for continued funding, irrespective of whether the programmatic focus is within their area of expertise. Capacity Gaps There are several capacity challenges which CSOs, as a group, face in Solomon Islands. Some of these, such as the gaps in internal systems and processes, are systemic and exist irrespective of the size and effectiveness of the organization. A telling example comes from a successful national CSO, which has programmes across the country and a strong record of positive outcomes. When the two founders of the organization retired, it went through rapid decline. The organization almost fell apart because the remaining staff did not possess knowledge of how the organization worked as a whole. They had only been focusing on their particular roles. The downfall of the CSO was halted only after a great deal of work by a new CEO. A lack of formally documented written systems and processes, combined with a lack of succession planning, contributed to its absence of institutional memory at the organizational level. This example demonstrates how the lack of written systems and processes can be a critical weakness for CSOs, even for those that have a record for effectiveness and achievements. Another key weakness of Solomon Island CSOs is their lack of knowledge and skill in the field of monitoring and evaluation. In order to comply with the accountability requirements of funders, CSOs are required to regularly report on progress. Funders only provide limited support to CSOs for fulfilling these requirements so the process requires a great deal of effort on the part of CSOs. Their lack of skills means CSOs spend a substantial amount of time working on compliance forms, taking their focus away from important operational management issues. CSOs are also aware of their lack of capacity in evaluating their own operations.

During the consultation, all CSOs strongly indicated that upskilling in the field of monitoring and evaluation was an important need. Another area of capacity deficit is that of strategic planning. As highlighted in Table 5.1, while a number of CSOs have strategic plans, these are either outdated or have no provisions for transforming into operational plans. Strategic plans that are in place are also generally ill-suited to organizational capacity. They are written more as inspirational documents. While strategic plans can be drafted at inspirational levels, this needs to be done within a realistic framework of the organization\u2019s capacity. In addition, members of governance boards clearly lack skills to carry out their responsibilities and provide strategic inputs. They do not regularly attend meetings, and since there is no training available for them, are uninformed about their roles and the expectations out of them. In order to make strategic planning truly useful and meaningful for CSOs, donors will also have to be more open and informed about how to increase the effectiveness of local CSOs, rather than then superimposing their priorities on them. Solomon Island CSOs face a lack of coordination and communication within its own community, and with their regional partners and the broader international community. During the consultations, CSOs identified this as a priority area for action (Box 5.1). While the NLU is able to help overcome some of these communication issues, recent events within the Unit (such as the organization losing almost all of their staff in the past four years) mean that it does not currently possess the capacity to solely fulfill this function. One approach to cover communication and coordination gaps that was raised during the consultation process was the possibility of establishing a centralised web page, where national CSOs could log data about their activities as a way of information dissemination. Existing Approaches to Capacity Development There are limited opportunities for capacity development in the CSO community, especially in light of the fact that CSO staff members often have to take on additional duties outside their area of expertise due to high staff turnover (Table 5.2). Many of them are working in jobs for which they received little or no formal training. Focused training for existing staff can go a long way in helping staff upskill for additional responsibilities. So far, such opportunities have been very limited. The majority of staff members who participated in this study had not undergone formal training of any sort. Some had taken part in sporadic training sessions provided by donors, while a few had participated in UNITEC\u2019s Graduate Diploma Programme in Not-for-Profit Management. These numbers compared to the total number of staff members, however, was low. Moreover, the UNITEC programme, while being beneficial and useful, was found to be too expensive by participants. Attending the programme also meant relocation out of their jobs, which was a problem for organizations facing chronic understaffing. There are cases where training in CSOs occurs informally and at a peer-to-peer level. It is a form of interaction where the more experienced staffer mentors others within the organization whenever time permits. In some organizations, overseas volunteers are also actively working to increase capacity, but this is on an ad hoc basis and unsustainable. The role of peer-peer networks is the area that needs further examination in the context of developing CSO capacity in Cook Islands. It could provide an important platform for up-skilling in different priority areas.

What We Need: Desired Capacities Of Solomon Island CSOS Key internal capacities identified as priority for Solomon Island CSOs are: \u2022 Improvement in infrastructure (computers, office equipment) \u2022 Development of technical skill levels of staff (especially financial management and monitoring and evaluation) \u2022 Development of general skills through training (in internal staff management and leadership) \u2022 Development of planning skills (to link strategic planning to operational planning) \u2022 Improvement in governance via selection of better board members and their training \u2022 Better coordination within the Solomon Islands CSO community \u2022 Better communication with external stakeholders Box 5.2. CSO Capacity Development Activities: Highlights \u2022 Only the largest CSOs are able to address issues on capacity gaps through capacity development activities. Lack of funding and capable staff to conduct internal training are main reasons. \u2022 A degree of informal peer-mentoring occurs in a few CSOs, among staff and among senior members of various CSOs.

Tongan CSOs seem to have a good understanding and awareness of the MDGs. While they may not explicitly base their work around the MDGs, they are an intrinsic part of CSO programming. The majority of Tongan CSOs in the study fell in the emerging stage of organizational development, where they are developing some capacity in specific areas (Table 6.1). Four large CSOs fell in the expanding range of capacity development, with a track record of achievements. All of them possessed organizational visions and mission statements, and associated goals. The national CSO sector is well connected. Although duplication exists, there is also a higher than usual level of cooperation among CSOs. CSOs are generally aware of what other organizations are doing and they work in a collaborative way to maximise impact on their communities. Tongan CSOs identified their dedicated staff and their strong networks as major strengths. Many of the organizations expressed the importance of their membership with the NLU, which seems to benefit them considerably in terms of accessing opportunities for regular up-skilling, attending workshop/networking opportunities, and information dissemination. The broader cross- sectoral social service delivery is distributed predominantly through the NLU and its members. Areas such as health, education, gender, youth, disability, and environment, human rights, trade and poverty alleviation are all well represented. The ability of CSOs to raise public awareness on matters of importance to their constituents was acknowledged by public, government and donor agencies during the consultation process of this study. There is a degree of competition among Tongan CSOs over the very limited available funding. However, CSOs in the country have an impressive ability to get the job done despite constraints. This is not to say that their service delivery could not further improve with access to additional resource, training and technical assistance. Presently most of the support they receive is channeled through their NLU, or in the case of some CSOs, through their international parent bodies.

Capacity Gaps One of the key issues that came out in the consultation process was the vulnerability of CSOs to the funding whims of the donors. The uncertain funding environment plays a large part in the operation modality of CSOs. Generally speaking, CSOs are reactive rather than proactive in terms of looking for funding opportunities, and in terms of planning how they can make the kinds of changes they want to see in Tongan society. They tend to look for funding on a project by project basis rather than through an annual planning process. With very few overheads, the majority of funding sought is for programmes and projects, which are developed in an ad hoc manner. These challenges contribute to staff insecurity and high staff turnover. During the consultations, CSOs stressed on the importance of seeking diversity of funding sources, as well as on the need of staying informed about changes in national government and on the international front (such as the current global financial situation). Financial management and management in general are areas that need major capacity development. CSOs reported that while they", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "def60f0e-d4b1-47e6-aa00-45e5e2859f77": {"__data__": {"id_": "def60f0e-d4b1-47e6-aa00-45e5e2859f77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Country Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d4637aa58e01f6787535f69734447daf40088373d3047bd624eb5ed1bc5977a"}, "3": {"node_id": "081030b8-ae70-45a6-a5af-3bea496af572", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "428ac75a554efee3076aa911863ac02a730391c1096e38a9ee90ee0abd31de29"}}, "hash": "b503a7fc262bdf71d70276ec540093fd739d20561b78c4a1cdbf12230b284503", "text": "are knowledgeable about their issue areas or work sectors, learning how to run an organization was where they most needed assistance. CSOs repeatedly requested technical assistance in this area during the consultations (Box 6.1). Reporting is a weakness for many CSOs, particularly since it is difficult and time consuming to report in different formats to different stakeholders. This problem is compounded by the lack of staff with skills in both report writing and writing donor funding requests. Monitoring and evaluating for donors is limited to the larger CSOs, and they have frameworks in place for this. Smaller CSOs considered monitoring and evaluation frameworks as desirable but not a priority. Box 6.1. What We Need: Desired Capacities Of Tongan CSOS The desired capacities of Tongan CSOs are: \u2022 More coordination among agencies delivering training initiatives and access to these opportunities. \u2022 Technical assistance in strategic planning and proposal writing. During the consultations, many CSOs expressed concern that proposal writing and reporting took up a substantial amount of time due to their lack of skills. \u2022 Technical assistance in financial management and general management training (including setting up systems and processes). Group training is preferred to individual training in order to learn from each other. The issue of governance, particularly relating to organizational boards, is a significant capacity weakness for Tongan CSOs. The lack of appropriately skilled people for board memberships and information deficit about the requirements of board members add to this problem. CSO boards are generally made up of volunteers who do not understand the requirements of the post or possess knowledge to provide advice and direction to CSO managers. In some cases, some CSO boards were identified as being too \u201cnice\u201d while others were identified as \u201cruling with an iron fist\u201d. At the consultations, CSOs emphasised on a greater need for governance training and civic education. They all identified training for governance boards as a priority. Existing Approaches to Capacity Development While there seems to be ongoing capacity development activities for CSOs, there is a lack of coordination among agencies so that the recipients who need them most do not necessarily receive them (Box 6.2). Tongan CSOs are innovative when it came to seeking proactive ways of pursuing opportunities to upskill staff members. They approach opportunities with a perspective to maximise the benefits of every engagement in a practical and cost effective way. During the consultations, for example, some suggested that if they were in Fiji for a workshop an opportunity, they would stay on an extra week and attach themselves to a PRNGO to make use of the latter\u2019s broad network of connections. The lack of coordination and access in training delivery, however, is resulting in increasing frustration in the Tongan CSO community. Some CSOs commented during the consultations that it was always the same people who were picked to undergo training and that this learning was not widely shared. For the smaller CSOs which do not have access to donor funding, training opportunities are limited to those facilitated by the NLU. They have little or no access to the training provided through international agencies. Box 6.2. CSO Capacity Development Activities: Highlights \u2022 The majority of CSOs interviewed had undergone training from national, regional, and in some cases, international organizations. \u2022 Capacity development activities are however not conducted in a coordinated manner. \u2022 It was evident from the interviews that the National Liaison Unit (NLU) possessed the skills and knowledge to aid local CSOs upskill at a moderate level. It however lacks funding to undertake such activities.

Given the small size and closeness of Tuvaluan society, \u2018everyone basically knows everyone\u2019 and people are inclined to help one another. These close community ties aid CSOs in mobilising resources, particularly labour, in times of need. A telling example comes from a small CSO with only three female staff members. The CSO needed to remove a large tree in order to make a pathway to its building entrance. Since the activity was labour intensive they appealed for help from their local community members whose response was quick and effective. They not only removed the tree but laid a stone path in a very short time span, without any remuneration. Poorly-resourced CSOs, many of whose activities are limited to basic programmes, receive such support from their larger community. CSOs in Tuvalu have strong local networks through which they obtain financial assistance. The large CSOs in Tuvalu also have strong networks with organizations abroad, largely enabled by ICT infrastructure. This keeps them up to date on the latest knowledge developments in their field, and provides information about funding opportunities. Although tension in relations with government does exist in certain cases, there have also been instances where contact with the government in advocacy work has yielded fruitful results. A CSO that lobbied the government on NGO and tobacco issues considers its efforts being influential in the passing of the Incorporation of NGO Act 2007, and the Tobacco Control Act 2008. Tuvaluan CSOs show diversity in their programmatic work areas, ranging from youth and health to 8 Four other CSOs listed a number of MDGs as being important considerations, but did not set their objectives around them. Two CSOs did not find any commonalities between their operations and the MDGs, and one other had not even heard of them. 9 Only one organization could clearly state what these were, while the heads of two others could highlight some components; others were at various states on drafting at the time of the in-country interviews. Two CSOs did not have statements of vision, mission and goals. poverty and spiritual development. In general, the MDGs do not seem to be a determining factor in CSO programming. Only one CSO in the study appears to have consciously made an effort to incorporate the MDGs into its operations.8 CSOs also did not have clear statements of visions, missions, and goals, except for one. While some were at drafting stage, they were clearly absent in a few organizations.9 A reason behind the gap in written statements and documented goals is that urgent capacity needs\u2014 such as office space or electricity\u2014is the primary focus of CSOs. Drafting or documenting specific organizational information seems irrelevant, at least to them, in the light of such basic capacity gaps. Another key factor behind this gap is cultural. One of the CSOs in the study without a mission statement or documented goals was a kinship organization whose members traced their roots to a common ancestor, and which met at irregular intervals for family get-togethers. As a kinship organization, its purpose was primarily to keep the family together. Translating this into a statement of vision, missions, and goals is not particularly relevant in this context, and probably not desirable. This case conveys the complex cultural dynamics that are present in the Tuvaluan CSO community. The issue of context\u2014both cultural and otherwise\u2014 is an important factor to consider when assessing Tuvaluan CSOs (Table 7.1). It is not only relevant in terms of the broader environment in which CSOs operate, but also in the manner in which CSOs assess themselves. Planning activities of CSOs, for example, can sometimes be influenced by Tuvaluan customary practices which tend to give more opportunities to male discussions. When there are meetings, the A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles 42 43 A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles key decision-making group sits in an inner circle surrounded by other participants and observers. Often, this inner circle is reserved for leading males, and although women are present, they do not have the same representation as males. At the same time, this aspect needs to be seen in light of kinship ties present in most Pacific island cultures, where an absence of physical female representation does not mean necessary imply lack of their inputs. Such inputs are often achieved through alternate means, such as through advice given by sisters to their brothers, and/or wives to their husbands. In some cases, the brothers hold their sisters in such high respect, in particular their older sisters, that they convey what their sisters\u2019 viewpoints even if", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c3cb7de-46d9-458d-8e02-9de9c197367f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c3cb7de-46d9-458d-8e02-9de9c197367f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Country Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "723cef832c9277c56a68578a3c7075547c5cb130c14466f085c19897f79b194c"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce68ef65-b3bd-4f38-b532-5170a41044d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7521aeda9e75e72502ff73d30a8692ad36f8cd9454d4b8a45977612af368bec1"}}, "hash": "9888a29c82a7097bbef8782cc0716fd8d328f356a5d78a19ce89882aae6f1f7f", "text": "it differs from their own.

These ministries include the Ministry of Youth, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Home Affairs, the Environment Department, Ministry of Natural Resources, and the Fisheries Department. Contextual observation also applies in the area of linking strategic planning to operational activities on which Tuvaluan CSOs, from the largest and most well-resourced CSOs to the smallest ones, rated themselves highly. This assessment has to take into account the kinds of strategic plans each organization formulates. The smallest CSO in the study, for example, set very basic strategies, such as keeping a safe and clean environment or acquiring items such as electricity, a computer, pens, pencils, books, in order to provide services to their members. Their strategies did not go beyond this level, and were thus easily translated into operational activities.

(The only CSO that rated itself poorly in this capacity measure was one that was recently established). This uniformity in self-assessment is again likely due to the kind of baseline data each CSO requires.

The CSO\u2019s support structure includes well-equipped buildings, ample staff, property in Tuvalu and abroad, and technical communication networks. At the other of the spectrum is a CSO with three staff members (who are paid by community donations), which operate out of a building without electricity. Being a learning institution, the kind of baseline data it requires is minimal\u2014the age and basic educational needs of members, which they obtain by members simply filling out an information sheet. Most CSOs relying on donations and funds from community members or governments also consider themselves to have sufficient resources for their operations, which are minimalist by nature in the first place. Even in terms of outputs and performances, CSOs appear satisfied in terms of what they can produce with the resources on hand. For the most part, they base their operating systems and programmes according to their organizational structure and capacity. Thus their self-assessment is satisfactory when viewed from this contextual perspective. If some of these CSOs are to expand or diversify their programmes, however, adoption of more formalised mechanisms and systems will become necessary. During the consultations, there was undoubtedly a sentiment among the less-resourced CSOs that they could set more ambitious goals if they had additional resources. For example, a CSO which works on environmental issues does so without a proper office space or equipment and staffed entirely by volunteers. Although its members would like to address the myriad of environmental problems in Tuvalu, including rising sea levels, severe weather and related social and economic problems, they settle for identifying a few tasks that they can realistically achieve in the absence of basic organizational resources. Capacity Gaps A key weakness identified by most CSOs in the study was their lack of and uncertainty about funding. For some smaller CSOs, funds to acquiring basic office equipment, and in some cases, office space, are urgent needs. Others are concerned about what will happen to their operations when current funding ceases. Funding constraints impact developing capacity in other areas such as human resources, the lack of which is another key capacity weakness. Most Tuvaluans undertake post-secondary school training overseas. (Although there is a local University of South Pacific training centre, it does not offer the full range of courses in the same capacity as that of the USP in Fiji and other overseas training and educational institutions). Qualified Tuvaluans who are trained overseas can find employment abroad, or are likely to end up working for government or other local enterprise that provides paid employment if or when they return. They are not likely to take on voluntary and unpaid work. Access to funds could provide opportunities for CSOs to train and upskill their current staff, or, opportunities for training could also open up through strengthened networks with donor agencies (Box 7.1). Shortage of qualified staff is compounded by the issue of migration, which is an area of concern for CSOs. With job opportunities not be as abundant in Tuvalu as in other parts in the region such as Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia, many Tuvaluans are migrating. Funafuti, where many jobs are located, shows clear signs of population congestion and land shortages. Rising sea levels exacerbate the problem, fuelling local desire to migrate overseas. While most CSOs in the study considered the area of strategic planning as one that needed development, at the same time, they did not appear to initiate activities towards this goal. Because they had to survive on low levels of funding and the services of volunteers, their focus was on more immediate tasks. Governance issues, which are handled very informally, will demand greater attention if CSOs expand operation. Currently, meetings among staff members and between staff and boards are sufficient to establish governance and management procedures. While some well-developed CSOs have formal procedures documented, this is absent in smaller and/or less-developed CSOs. Documentation on governance structures and systems will become necessary in case of expansion, especially if or when they seek donor funding. The weakness in ICT infrastructure of the country as a whole impacts the capacity of CSOs to fully make use of ICT. The main issue with communication and coordination is whether the country can install a broader telecommunication and ICT infrastructure at all. Not only is the ICT infrastructure in Tuvalu often unreliable, its usage is restricted because of overall uneven infrastructural development in the country. In the urban areas, particularly in the island of Funafuti, there is developing ICT infrastructure. Many people have personal computers with access to emails and online avenues for communications. Many other islands, however, do not have", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec1c6274-2b36-4981-9570-19c259baba60": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec1c6274-2b36-4981-9570-19c259baba60", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Country Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06e18026437d2d3ada7a317db30844279aa0e98295cd10bb20eff4334d953522"}}, "hash": "06e18026437d2d3ada7a317db30844279aa0e98295cd10bb20eff4334d953522", "text": "similar infrastructure and equipment, and these are the places where CSOs have members and target communities. CSOs cannot reap the advantages of having email, internet, and telephones when the people they want to contact do not have the same degree of access. Existing Approaches to Capacity Development An unclear picture emerges from the assessment on existing approaches to capacity development in Tuvaluan CSOs. While CSOs clearly engage in various kinds of capacity development activities, they are neither coordinated nor systematic (Box 7.2). Some CSOs seek financial assistance from the government or from the larger community to initiate such activities, while others seek help from CSOs working in similar fields. Some focus on maintaining strong networks with their members whom they call upon in times of financial need. CSOs are also able to benefit through information-sharing from Box 7.1. What We Need: Desired Capacities Of Tuvaluan CSOS Tuvaluan CSOs identify the following as priority areas for developing capacity: \u2022 Training opportunities, particularly technical training in areas of their expertise/work programmes. \u2022 Enhancement of ICT skills. CSOs want training on the use of internet and software such as Microsoft Office and MYOB. Currently, staff members of less-developed CSOs have significantly less access to training opportunities or computer facilities. \u2022 Management training, in terms of marketing, financial, and organizational development. A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles 48 49 A Capacity Assessment of CSO\u2019s in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles Box 7.2. CSO Capacity Building Activities: Highlights \u2022 Assessment on capacity building initiatives in Tuvaluan CSOs presents an unclear picture. Such activities occur in various ways, but are not coordinated or systematic. \u2022 What is clear is that better developed organizations are able to provide greater access to training opportunities for staff. The systems and processes for training staff correlates with the level of organizational development. \u2022 In some exceptional cases, staff training has occurred at a very high level, and has included educational training abroad for staff members. international organizations, and occasionally these relations bring training opportunities or result in joint-projects. There are exceptional instances where staff training, specifically, has been conducted at a very high level in CSOs which can afford them. One CSO in the study where paid employees formed the bulk of its staff had strict training systems for staff members, which included educational training that could be undertaken in Tuvalu or abroad. Through these training opportunities, staff members acquired prerequisite qualifications for their positions. As a result, its staff members were very well qualified. One member had several publications under his name and was working on another publication at the time of the interviews. Another was working on a film documentary on climate change in Tuvalu with a Fijian-based filmmaker, and travelling to a United Nations meeting in Geneva to give a presentation on climate change issues. Yet another staff member was recently awarded an honorary PhD by an Asian based university. On the whole, however, approaches to capacity building in the CSO sector need to be more clearly defined and developed. Tuvaluan CSOs indicate a very strong desire to acquire further training in areas that are pertinent to their current work programmes. During the consultations, a staff member from a CSO that works on environmental issues highlighted a university degree in the field of environment as a desired capacity. Another project staff member who works at a CSO that focuses on ecological and environmental issues identified training of \u2018Geographic Information Systems\u2019 and eco-tourism as desired areas of training. CSOs are also concerned with obtaining further training in the area of ICT. For a number of well- equipped CSOs, the acquisition of new ICT has propelled their level of technological advancement. In addition to computer hardware and software, this group is equipped with faxes and PowerPoint projectors. A project staff member at one CSO even possessed an underwater camera, sonar equipment, and the satellite-based navigation system known as the Global Positioning System (GPS). At the same time, there are Tuvaluan CSOs that function with bare minimum ICT equipment and software. During the consultations, staff members notably wanted to undertake training in ICT and software usage such as Microsoft Office, the most popular software, and MYOB. A number of CSOs have MYOB but it is underutilised due to lack of knowledge. Apart from wanting to enhance their skills in these areas, staff members appeared to believe that developing their ICT skills would benefit in their engagement with aid donors. Donors could attempt to strike a balance by providing basic ICT equipment and software to the less developed CSOs which lack them, and target", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "829b558d-056d-4baa-bf4b-61088607ba2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "829b558d-056d-4baa-bf4b-61088607ba2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Country Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c24d032b900c659ff473d4b3e1cd9a17155eb4819a3db2268ef60201ce8f93e"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d4f13b4-6e69-4e16-9d8e-d384a0dd0752", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/country-assessment-csos-pacific-six-country-profiles", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78451ae0fc35fdb5eee9e34c8b143d808e9973f5986c67378b20f4dfe88612fb"}}, "hash": "cdef5c3df9f9a211912ebcfb24f87d36901f4d76b4bf8924a7235e6cebf63ad1", "text": "on providing training to those which do not possess the knowledge capacity to use them. It is also worth considering providing more overseas training arrangements for CSOs that have progressed to using more sophisticated technology. Another area of considerable interest to Tuvaluan CSOS is management training in marketing, financial, and organizational development. This is not only an indication of commitment by staff to their professional growth, but also represents their personal desire to upskill. Since CSOs in Tuvalu keenly exhibited their enthusiasm for such learning opportunities during the consultations, this could be a key area where donors could target their assistance.

I believe that all parliaments and each of our communities need to hear the voices of women. Democratic processes work best when both women and men are full participants. It is only when our interdependent voices are represented and heard, that a society\u2019s policies effectively reflect the needs of all its citizens. If you love your country and your community, and want to see it well run for the benefit of all the people, you need to participate actively in politics. Whether or not you are successful in your election campaigns, I encourage you to raise issues, shape popular debate, and create a benchmark of political engagement to inspire future generations of Pacific women. While Australia also has a history of women being underrepresented in political leadership roles, recent improvements are promising. Australian women now hold a marginal seat advantage (a woman is more likely than a man to be elected in a marginal seat), there are four women in federal Cabinet, seven in the Ministry, and for the first time in Australia\u2019s history, the Deputy Prime Minister is a woman. To a large extent, the representation of these women in Australia\u2019s federal Parliament has come about as a result of the determined efforts of the many generations of women before them. Notwithstanding these positive advancements, Australia continues to share your challenge of improving women\u2019s representation in political leadership. With women constituting half the population, an equal balance of men and women in politics and leadership remains our ongoing challenge. I wish you well in raising your voice, leading the debate, and running your country. The Hon. Tanya Plibersek MP Minister for Status of Women Australia ii Acknowledgements The Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat would like to express our sincere appreciation to the Australia Government Office for Women and the UNDP Pacific Centre for supporting the advancement of women in national legislatures and for making funding available for this booklet. We are especially grateful to the women whose experiences are reflected in the content and case studies of this booklet, Minister Fiame Mata\u2019afa, Hilda Lini, Taufa Vakatale, Alisi Fotu, Janet Sape, Imelda Nakamura and Priscilla Singh; who agreed to participate at the consultation meeting in Nadi, Fiji in October 2008, to talk about their personal experiences. Their insights contributed immensely to this booklet. Without their experiences, generosity and knowledge, this booklet would have lacked a personal touch and Pacific realism. We also thank Emele Duituturaga for facilitating the consultation meeting and George Rubine, Brendan Yee and Graham Taylor for capturing this experience on video. A big vinaka as well to the team at Pacific Reach. This booklet has been a collective effort and sincere collaboration between the Forum Secretariat and the UNDP Pacific Centre: we wish to also thank Charmaine Rodrigues, the Pacific Centre Legislative Strengthening Expert, for support provided. A message of Encouragement Dear Pacific Sisters, I am writing this contribution for this booklet from Jakarta, Indonesia, where I am attending a meeting of the International Council of Women on the theme: \u2018The Challenge of Achieving Gender Equality. The challenge of getting more of us into our Parliaments, Legislative Assemblies and local government bodies is enormous. We in the Pacific Islands have the lowest rate of representation by women in the world. Decisions made at the national and local levels of government impact on all aspects of our lives. If we women are not involved at this level of decision making, then I believe the life of our society is diminished. We women are half the human resource that can be brought to bear on any issue. We women know the issues that require urgent and priority responses from our governments. We women have our own perspectives and approaches. All issues should have the benefit of our input. All our governments espouse democratic principles as foundations to our respective polities, yet the low rate of representation by women questions the integrity of those principles. This booklet is a practical tool to assist women running for election to public office.

Mataafa Minister for Women, Community and Social Development SAMOA iii 1 Introduction Throughout the Pacific, women are active and respected members of their communities. However, representation of women in Pacific parliaments and congresses is still very low. Pacific Island legislatures have only on average 3% of their members who are women. Ten Pacific Islands countries have less than 5% women members. Five of these countries have no women in their legislature at all. Many women have little opportunity to seriously think of standing for parliament, due to their busy lives. Even when women do take the big step of standing for election, they have reported that they get very little support and have to take a \u201ctrial and error\u201d approach to the process, trying to work out what to do along the way. This booklet aims to help women who want to get involved in their own local, national and regional governance to get STARTed to take on the challenge of elections. The START strategy has been developed as a quick reference point, to help women remember some of the key issues they will need to consider and key activities they need to undertake when running for elections. It is based on the experiences of Pacific women themselves who have stood for election, drawing on their successes and the lessons they learned along the way. This booklet has been designed to help individual women work through the issues in a systematic way. At the same time, it is important to remember that there are many individuals and organisations around the Pacific working to support women standing for election. Drawing on the diversity of experiences in our region, we can all work together to ensure that women are able to be properly represented in their own legislatures. 3 Before you take the plunge and decide to run for elections, it is understandable if you have some doubts. Women throughout the Pacific have highlighted a range of worries they have about running for elections: Discriminatory attitudes towards women. Some people think women are not capable of acting in leadership positions. Others argue they are too young or too old, if they are single, that they are unstable, or if they are divorced, that they are unfit to hold public office. No support from immediate and extended family. The need to put the welfare of the family first. Bickering, jealousies and infighting with other women. No support from churches and other religious bodies. Women\u2019s involvement in politics is seen as \u2018ungodly\u2019. Imelda Nakamura, 1991 Palau National Elections Candidate Corruption makes politics a \u201cdirty game\u201d that it should only be played by men. Lack of money to contest the election (and the problem of \u201cgifts\u201d to voters in many countries). The attitude that Parliament and decision making is a \u2018man\u2019s domain\u2019. The belief that women are not eligible because they do not hold a chiefly title or because their culture says they should stay in the home. Low esteem among women, who feel inferior to men. It is to be expected that you will face obstacles when you run for a seat in the legislature. In many Pacific countries, the election of women to positions of leadership in the legislature represents a major change in the way things have been done in the past. Change often brings resistance. \u201cIt is not about why I ran for elections but why women [in general] need to run.\u201d \u201cAs an attorney, every two weeks there were domestic violence cases and I realized that since 1994, even though our government had ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, there was still no implementation. It is not about why I ran for elections but why women [in general] need to run. It is not about personal gain. Women need to be there to represent the needs of women and children.\u201d 4 I find it particularly interesting that people focus heavily on reasons why women should not", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c6dc83f-50c6-44cd-a05c-458f86516c25": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c6dc83f-50c6-44cd-a05c-458f86516c25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guide-campaigning-pacific-women", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Guide to Campaigning for Pacific Women", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guide-campaigning-pacific-women", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d7b148676eabb937c24f08b93038209460e6c168009674f067fcde3176eddbd"}}, "hash": "0d7b148676eabb937c24f08b93038209460e6c168009674f067fcde3176eddbd", "text": "stand for elections rather than why they should. However, women throughout the Pacific have proven for decades their ability to tackle complex challenges. Women have considerable expertise to contribute in the service of the public, not only drawing on their experiences as wives and mothers and daughters, but through their experiences as government officials, business-people, teachers, doctors, lawyers, accountants, and the like. Preparation and a readiness to face problems energetically and innovatively can help to make sure you are in a good position to overcome any obstacles you might come across. Prepare yourself mentally. It also helps to prepare your family, as the stress of a campaign can have an effect on them too. With commitment, courage and a willingness to try and try again, Pacific women can break through any and all barriers to leadership and reach the centres of power. Hon Mathew Batsiua, Minister for Justice, Nauru 5 W hen you make the decision to run for election you will need to sign up and nominate yourself. Think long and hard about why you want to stand for elections. In discussions with women, one of the biggest problems identified is that women often sign up to run for election very late and have not fully considered WHY they want to run. Before you nominate yourself, you may want to talk to your family and friends about your ideas and see what they think. As a member of a community, you also may want to discuss your plans with those close to you, before you actually take the step to nominate. Before signing up to run, consider whether you are really prepared. Have you been active in your community? Do you think people know you \u2013 or will you have to start from scratch? People often ask nominees, what have you done for the community to demonstrate your commitment to the community rather than just being hungry for power? Read the Electoral Act. Every country has legislation and regulations that govern all aspects of elections, from nomination, to campaign financing and disclosures, to polling day to vote counting and so on. To ensure that you are not tripped up by small procedural mistakes, it is smart to get a copy of all the relevant electoral laws from your Electoral Commission as soon as you decide you want to run in the elections. Read the documents carefully to make sure you follow the right processes. If you do not understand anything, feel free to contact the Electoral Commission and ask them for guidance. Decide which constituency you wish to represent. Electoral laws usually determine where you are allowed to run for election. However, if you have a choice of constituency, to be most effective, you should consider running in an electorate that you either have grown up in or where you are well known. You may want to take into account the following issues: How well do the people know you? What have you done for the community for which they will support you? Do you attend church, temple, mosque or another faith based organisation in the area? What are your traditional, family and/or business ties to the area? How well do you know and identify with community needs of the area? What previous leadership roles have you played in your community? ign Up! 6 Consider whether to stand as an independent candidate or to join a political party. There are advantages and disadvantages of joining a political party or running as an independent candidate. Advantages: Freedom to develop strategies and policies and not be restricted by party policies or practices No need for negotiations with party officials You could end up holding the balance of power in government if the numbers are tied If you are popular and have a reputation that helps, then you are not stuck with a party that might be unpopular Disadvantages: You have to build your support from scratch as there is no support base Could be very expensive running a campaign on your own The probability of losing is higher except in a non-party system You can find yourself ineffective if elected, in countries where parties are dominant in the legislature Running as an independent Disadvantages: Selection process can take too long or may not happen Disagreements about party policies can lead to conflict and resignation Male dominated party politics You may have to compromise your own views/policies to fit into the party platform Running with a political party Advantages: Support from the party for campaigning Party support for fundraising Ready made supporters who will work and vote for the party", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f18d780-bb77-4735-8208-0c5e261a8ca8": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f18d780-bb77-4735-8208-0c5e261a8ca8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guide-campaigning-pacific-women", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Guide to Campaigning for Pacific Women", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guide-campaigning-pacific-women", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d03d6a619e6fe6e7cdb2856c64108976487ee7f705aacdc5addb7f4936c0d4c0"}}, "hash": "d03d6a619e6fe6e7cdb2856c64108976487ee7f705aacdc5addb7f4936c0d4c0", "text": "regardless of who is the candidate (in most cases) Professional media support and advertising If you are considering joining a party, then you need to learn all that you can about what the party stands for and decide if you agree with their views.

If you decide you want to join up, then you need Excerpt: UNIFEM Women and Political Empowerment Manual for the Pacific, p.67 7 Even if you can\u2019t get a party to nominate you, you can always run as an independent candidate. In any case, this is what many women choose to do. It may be harder \u2013 because you won\u2019t have the party machinery and funds to help you \u2013 but in many Pacific countries, parties are weak. You may prefer the freedom of running on your own and being able to say what you want and talk about ideas and issues that are important to you personally. If you get selected to join a party, play a role in the development of its manifesto. Ensure your party commitments are gender sensitive and address issues concerning women and children. Lobby your party members on the benefits of being inclusive and addressing the needs of 50% your voters. Taufa Vakatale, Former Deputy Prime Minister and Cabinet Minister, Fiji. \u201cYou could say the timing was right for me to run for parliament\u2026I had reached the highest level within the civil service and therefore running for parliament was a natural progression. So when I was approached by a chief to actually run \u2013 I decided to go for it!\u201d Ms Vakatale goes on to say however, that one does not necessarily have to reach the top of the civil service. It really is about how prepared you are and making that decision to run. \u201cI knew I possessed the relevant skills to run for parliament. My time with the Young Women\u2019s Christian Association (YWCA) prepared me for my role in politics. It taught me to open my eyes to the injustice happening around me and more importantly to be pro- active,\u201d she says. When I decided to run for parliament I had already made in-roads into the party system. I was involved with political parties whilst I was in the civil service and even when still a teacher, I took part in helping out in elections. As a result I learnt about electoral processes and party politics.\u201d to become a member of the party. You should also find out what they look for when choosing candidates to run for election. Many women who have run for election observe that if you want to run as a member of a political party, it\u2019s important to be involved in a party well before elections. You cannot expect the election to be called and to then simply ask a party to endorse you. If you hope to be selected by a party then the party needs to know who you are. At the time of the elections, you will need to convince the party that you are the right person to be selected. It is more likely that a party will nominate a loyal party supporter, who has been working for the party for a number of years, than a newcomer that they do not know. \u201cIt really is about how prepared you are and making that decision to run.\u201d 8 Case study: Fiji - Harnessing the political party system Priscilla Singh, Suva Councillor & 2006 Fiji Elections Candidate Priscilla Singh is not new to campaigning and standing for elections. She has stood for the local government elections since 1996 and is now serving her third term. More recently she stood for national elections in 2006. Prior to this she was involved with the National Federation Party for 15 years. Priscilla says \u201cThe biggest hurdle can be party politics, the male dominance and a total disregard for a woman\u2019s perspective. This obstacle is not something you just get over but something you have to work through. Dialoguing and listening to how men work, what they do and really just listening to the male perspective and using this opportunity to talk to them and for them to hear a woman\u2019s perspective. Take time to have a bowl of grog (kava \u2013 traditional Fijian drink) with them.\u201d \u201cI had to make inroads into the party structure itself.

You have got to get inside and get involved in the party structures by attending meetings conventions, rallies, campaigns and even working in the sheds and crossing off names from the voters rolls.\u201d Although Priscilla was unsuccessful in 2006, she continues to be actively involved in her party. \u201cFor me, the biggest joy came on a day when I was not actually campaigning. I was attending the \u2018reguregu\u2019 (funeral gathering) of a Fijian colleague. When I got to the house I heard the Fijian women who were there busy preparing the food for people, whispering, \u201cPriscilla Singh, Priscilla Singh the NFP lady that stood for elections.\u201d I was welcomed and women discussed their issues with me again.\u201d The fact that Priscilla did not win was not the issue. What was important was that she made herself known by speaking up and advocating for her party\u2019s issues and people remembered this. There will be another election and with that another opportunity. 9 Y ou need to talk about your ideas with the people around you and really get started planning and preparing to run a campaign. Know your voters. Women who have run for elections before have observed that it is essential to really understand the needs of the constituency. You can start by collecting some basic information: What is their social and economic situation? How are their households made up \u2013 size, age, sex, occupation? How many registered voters are there? Who won the last election and what was their platform? How have they performed during their term? If you really want to be a good representative of the people when you get to parliament, you need to know who they are and what they are most concerned about. Take the time to talk to voters and find out more about them: What are their concerns? What are their key priorities? How do your policies fit in with their aspirations and their hopes for the future? Hilda Lini, Former Parliamentarian, Vanuatu. alk about it! \u201cI won because by this time women were committed to having a woman in parliament and there was a lot of support from the Women\u2019s Wing of the Liberation Movement.\u201d \u201cFor me, it was many years of build up before I won the elections. For eight years we strategised. I won because by this time women were committed to having a woman in parliament and there was a lot of support from the Women\u2019s Wing of the Liberation Movement. For me, my key was having a very influential person behind me. She was the late Grace Molisa. She was the private secretary to the then Prime Minister. This helped me strategise my campaign. In addition to this, I had a very strong NGO background and was able to articulate my issues clearly.\u201d 10 Talk through your campaign strategy and plan. Preparation and planning are essential when you are campaigning, to maximise your resources. Talk to your family members \u2013 they can help you. Talk to your friends, associates, church members, work colleagues and professional associates who can be counted on for support and find out what they can offer to your campaign. Is there someone who can be trusted to take on the role of campaign manager? What possible difficulties may arise and how can you deal with them? Is there someone (like an experienced politician) whose advice will be valuable?

This person will also help you profile your constituency and your competitors. Getting to know my constituency was important.

Elections are usually held within 4-6 weeks of being called. You don\u2019t want to waste time that you could be using to get out into the community talking to voters.

Remember that in the Pacific, there are lots of opportunities to talk to people about your ideas and why they should vote for you. You can meet people at local sporting events, at village meetings, at music concerts, at church or even at meetings you organise yourself. Make the most of these opportunities. Get comfortable speaking in public. Be active in introducing yourself to people at meetings so everyone gets to know you. Develop confidence but do not be boastful or over-confident \u2013 that can be off putting. Learn to be gracious, listen to others and take note of what people are saying. Prepare yourself for public speaking and making speeches. If you get nervous speaking in public, prepare notes from which you can speak so that you are clear, coherent and what you say is meaningful. When preparing your speaking notes, ensure you have some good solid facts and prepare yourself mentally for questions from voters. Develop communication materials to distribute when you are talking to people. Any materials you produce need to be in simple language so that ordinary people can understand what you stand for. If you are proposing policies, describe your ideas clearly but simply. Keep written documents short because voters often do not have a lot of time to spend reading campaign materials. Short flyers and posters can be very effective. Work with the media. It is important to increase your public profile. Try to tap the media so that your policies are communicated to as many voters as possible. Get to know reporters and some key people in the media - they can help with your media profile. Your community needs to see that you are active. ct now! 12 12 You may wish to issue press releases the media can use in their stories. These should usually be no more than one page long and could include quotes from you which the press can use. This assists the press with their own work load and means they are more likely to print your story. Try to arrange to speak on radio, as radio in the Pacific has a very extensive reach. Talkback shows are popular. Profile the candidates running against you. Who else is contesting the same seat as you? What are their strengths and weaknesses? What are their policies? What is the difference between you and them? Will this difference make people vote for you or for them? It is useful to help voters understand what is different about you and your policies because this will help them decide on why they should choose you and not someone else. Make sure to highlight what you think the strengths of your campaign are. Stay active. It is important to keep your campaign constantly moving forward. Campaigning will be stressful and tiring but you need to stay active so that people remember who you are and why they should vote for you. Throughout your campaign, it is important to take time to reflect on your actions, strategies, progress and problems encountered. Your campaign strategy should be constantly reviewed and revised to take account of any new developments. Do not be discouraged or be distracted by unexpected or negative situations, this is all part and parcel of politics and campaigning. Have regular debriefing meetings with your support team. It is almost survival of the fittest \u2013 so make sure you are fit and healthy enough to handle the stress, pressures and physical exhaustion.

Melanesian society is based on relationships and if this is expanded on and utilized and treasured, it can beat bribe money,\u201d says Minister Carol Kidu, three times election winner and Moresby South candidate. For Minister Kidu, her decision to stand was borne not only out of anger over the sudden death of her husband, former Chief Justice Sir Buri, but also for her life long concern for issues of social injustice. Nor was her decision to enter politics a flippant one. On the contrary, Dame Carol (as she is affectionately known) got a job as a Research Officer for a then Minister to \u2018survey the scene\u2019 and learn more about the intricacies of being in government before deciding to run for the first time in 1997. According to Dame Carol, there is no one style when it comes to campaigning. \u201cCampaigning and being a politician is about leading. As a leader, there is a need to develop various strategies, whether it is leading from the front, the back or in circles. As a woman it is important not to try to campaign like men. We need to develop our own style and stick to it in principle but adapt where necessary.\u201d For Dame Carol, the message was clear \u2013 in outlining what her platforms were, she promised nothing but honesty, hard work and consistency. No stranger now to campaigning and elections, Dame Carol says that campaigning in PNG is not cheap. Whilst money is good to have, your people support is very important. \u201cDuring the 2007 campaign, I faced a very tough battle again two candidates with lots and lots of money. I had to get smart. I used five different styles of campaign strategies. Open rallies, general community campaigns, coffee and cordial campaigns with special target groups, power point presentation nights, house to house campaigning with \u201cbag of knowledge\u201d. We literally took around bags filled with leaflets and awareness materials to give to people. I even involved people in my electorate and support team to make the bags. When you have a good support team, you CAN win, even if other candidates have so much more money.\u201d During every election, Dame Carol moves into the village house with her extended family a month before voting to manage the campaign from there. She eats, sleeps and moves with her team as much as possible, always ensuring that at least one of the family elders slept on the mat beside her to give her moral support and strength. Her message to other women, \u201c Work hard, stay as focused as possible under the pressure. Remember elections are about numbers \u2013 check the rolls, keep consolidating your bases but also cast your net wider and wider for more numbers. Use every opportunity for public exposure and media but be careful and manage this well and above all, be genuine.\u201d 14 esource yourself! R unning a campaign requires resources. Not just money but also people. Harness your \u201cpeople power\u201d. You can\u2019t be everywhere all the time and you can\u2019t try to do everything yourself. You need to think about who you know that you can rely on to help you. Even if you don\u2019t have a lot of financial capital, use your \u201chuman capital\u201d. Rely on your personal networks - your family, your friends, your fellow church-goers, people you know who are in community groups and sporting mates. Mobilise women and communities at the grassroots level. Many women candidates have been heavily involved in the church, their children\u2019s school and/or NGOs. Get in touch with people you know from these groups and see if they would be willing to help you out \u2013 by handing out fliers, helping to organise meetings or inviting you to speak to their own networks.

Start fundraising as early as possible. When you know you have support and have identified those who can help, your other big challenge will be campaign finance. Having funds to run a successful campaign is critical. Campaigns are quite expensive but if you prepare well and manage carefully, you can keep your costs to a minimum. Fundraising should begin as soon as possible after you decide to run. Do not wait for the election to be announced. Funds are needed for: Registering your nomination Transport Communications Food and refreshments Traditional protocol Stationery Paying allowances to your campaign team and volunteers Many women who have run for election have noted that their campaign budget is smaller than that of male candidates. Women often do not have access to loans and donations because they may not have a secure independent income or the same network as men. This means you will need to be even more active in trying to get donations from people. This is also one of the reasons why some women join a political party. You can take advantage of political party fundraising and the party outreach machinery. 15 W hen you are campaigning, it is essential to always remember that the end result you want is for voters to actually get out on voting day and tick your box on the ballot. Make sure your supporters get out and vote! In the Pacific, it is generally not compulsory to vote. This means that it is up to you to make sure that your supporters feel committed enough to you to make the effort on voting day to go to the polling booths, wait in line and then cast their vote for you. Even if people like you and agree with what you stand for, in today\u2019s Pacific, experience has shown that many people instinctively think they should vote for a man. Culture, tradition and habit all contribute to this. You need to be aware of this and make sure that people are reassured that if they vote for you, they will get a representative who understands them and will represent their interests effectively. Target male voters as well. It is very important that women candidates don\u2019t forget to work with men too. It doesn\u2019t mean that because you are a woman you won\u2019t also represent the men in the community if you get elected. Men make up half of the voting population. If you want to get elected, you need men as well as women to vote for you! Youth have significant voting power. They can be prompted to take part in elections if you respond to their needs. Get involved in major youth concerns such as the environment and youth unemployment. Ensure your messages support a more inclusive society which respects diversity. Target universities and youth groups in faith based organisations to get your message across. Know the laws governing casting and counting of votes. Unfortunately, in the Pacific, one of the problems women have reported is that despite people voting for them, vote buying or vote rigging occurs and they still don\u2019t win. You need to be aware of the electoral laws and regulations that govern voting day and vote counting. Although such regulations can be complicated, make the effort to read them, and make sure you comply with the law and also protect your interests on voting day. Most election laws in the Pacific let a candidate appoint someone to observe the voting and counting on their behalf to make sure that it\u2019s all done properly. These people are usually called \u201cscrutineers\u201d. If scrutineers can be appointed in your country, make sure you nominate someone to do this job because in small countries, elections can be won or lost by only a handful of votes. If you feel that something has not been done right by election officials, make sure to let the Election Commissioner know. You can always lodge a complaint. Be sure to carefully read the elections manual or rule book that also contains important dates. ick the box! 16 Getting through the campaigning and election process is only the first step in reaching the goal of making a difference \u2013 to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e76f799-263e-417f-afb9-9f1003f394d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e76f799-263e-417f-afb9-9f1003f394d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guide-campaigning-pacific-women", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Guide to Campaigning for Pacific Women", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guide-campaigning-pacific-women", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27df2bfedd16e47aae6dfe698e2b9d9ae1827c81354e75648fcb50535564b745"}}, "hash": "27df2bfedd16e47aae6dfe698e2b9d9ae1827c81354e75648fcb50535564b745", "text": "your community, your province and your country. Once you get elected, you must live up to all the promises you made and the policies you said you would pursue. Although daunting, it is an honor and a challenge to be elected as your people\u2019s representative and this is why the burden of such leadership can feel heavy. One of the first things you will have to do when you are elected is to make an inaugural speech at the first sitting of parliament or congress. This is a big opportunity for you to tell your other legislative colleagues as well as your constituents what you plan to do during your term in office. Plan your speech carefully. Think back to the policies you proposed and the issues you told voters you would pursue when you were campaigning. Increasingly, Pacific legislatures are running training workshops for new members of the legislature, called Induction Workshops. Look out for such opportunities, as this training could be helpful in clarifying for you how the legislature works, how you can engage in debates, what rules apply in the legislature, how Bills are passed, how parliamentary committees operate and how you can more effectively use legislative processes to make a difference. Once you are elected as a member of parliament or congress, there are people around who can help you achieve your goals. The parliamentary staff, your party, community groups and your local supporters are good sources of assistance and advice. Use your networks for support and information. Ask them to help research issues and provide their opinions. Keep them informed of upcoming issues. Working in parliament can be tricky. Trying to improve and enact legislation and making sure that money is spent efficiently and effectively can be a complicated process. But if you attack these challenges as systematically as your campaign, you will be successful in making a contribution to the welfare of your constituents and your country. Your effort, engagement and accomplishments will be an inspiration to women throughout the Pacific. Best of luck!

Sudarshan, Marcus Brand and Johanna Cunningham This publication is the result of more than a year of discussions and exchanges on a variety of themes centered on what UNDP regards as its core mandate: the human development agenda. As the 2015 target date for the MDGs is rapidly approaching, and as efforts are underway to \u201caccelerate\u201d progress on various targets and indicators around the world, the debate about global development goals has already moved towards looking beyond 2015. The Millennium Declaration, from which the MDGs were later developed, sets out a set of values and principles to guide global development cooperation for at least the 21st century. The core values of human rights, the rule of law and democratic governance will thus remain as valid as ever, both as fundamental for defining a life in dignity for all human beings, and as an enabling framework for efforts to expand the benefits of human progress to all. This collection of essays is aimed at offering insights into innovative and practical ways and means of realizing human rights, linked as they are to the MDGs primarily through social and economic rights, but also through the broader human rights context where the Millennium Declaration set development goals which later became known as the MDGs. The idea was to contribute to the debates among those thinking ahead of a future set of development goals in capitals and headquarters and to also offer concrete guidance and inspiration to development practitioners in the field, in particular those working in areas related to the MDGs. The document is targeted at national government and non- governmental development experts equally as to those working in UN agencies, or other governmental or non-governmental organizations. In UNDP, there have been recurring discussions on the relationship between democratic governance, the rule of law, human rights and economic and social development for at least two decades. It has long been understood that the apparent dichotomy exists only at the surface and a comprehensive concept of rights and economic dimensions has been encapsulated in the human development paradigm.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b43aca45-128e-4c08-a49f-90ea0723b6df": {"__data__": {"id_": "b43aca45-128e-4c08-a49f-90ea0723b6df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5fbe3355a4ac76f0e64d663d74d5c9bdc0d26b2005e4acdcbf7d5fc6b4128e33"}, "2": {"node_id": "652b23f3-8e06-4e7c-99ec-d836ce349418", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "980e19c83816b8c95c36d5fed020ba120fd3c4d94f4cd4739697bd88f6d2d666"}}, "hash": "277019e978bab95ad18e2a795c81ec62365e2b480a55a469875bf0cb673cca83", "text": "Nevertheless, it is worth revisiting some of the arguments leading to these insights, if only to avoid getting pulled into compartmentalized thinking as a result of administrative convenience.

More than a decade after the MDGs were laid out, the discourse has shifted to stressing a reduction of inequalities, sustainability and inclusion. These are also cross-cutting issues, certain to be incorporated into any future development agenda, such as the one to be formulated at the Rio plus 20 and other agenda-setting world meetings in the coming years. A human rights approach to development naturally implies focus on the situation of 2 Introduction the most marginalized, most deprived and most disadvantaged. Efforts to dig through the often deceptive veneer of aggregate data and analysis make it possible to appreciate stark and growing inequalities within societies. This, notably, is the case for both developed and developing societies alike. The MDGs remain relevant, even if the context in which they are considered may have changed significantly over the past ten years. We still aim at MDG acceleration, and a specially designed programme helping countries to roll out MDG Acceleration Plans has been designed. It leaves it open to countries and communities to decide which goals to concentrate on, and what targets and indicators to choose. However, it emphasizes the pursuit of equality, sustainability and inclusion as per the guidelines emanating from the 2010 review summit. The debate between human rights and the MDGs, between democratic governance and economic development will continue to interest academics and is likely to be put on the table at the macro-political level at times, but from a practical and pragmatic perspective, there is no contradiction. UNDP has been at the forefront of advocating a broad-based, comprehensive understanding of the challenges of our time, and is well-placed to continue to do so in the coming years. This publication aims to offer a number of concrete suggestions to the development practitioner, whether in government, civil society or with an international organization. The task of the contributors was to go beyond the often normative, general and high-minded approach taken by human rights advocates when addressing development practitioners often perceived as abstract lecturing. Instead, the authors wish to suggest innovative and practical ways and means to make a difference in terms of the MDGs and other development goals by promoting changes in the constitutional or legislative framework, legal empowerment, introducing affirmative action, applying a human development approach to social protection, disaggregating data and identifying, for instance, the special needs of indigenous communities, mobilizing public action through focused advocacy or campaigns, or leveraging the powers of the judiciary wherever possible in order to overcome \u201cbottlenecks\u201d that may hold up progress on human development indicators. Authors of the chapters were selected on the basis of previous academic contributions in the field, but also demonstrated track-record in implementing relevant projects in the field, be that through advocacy, legal assistance or campaigning. The focus of this publication and of the examples highlighted herein is on the Asia-Pacific region, the vast and mind-bogglingly diverse space covered by the Asia Pacific Regional Centre of UNDP who sponsored this publication. Yet, it is of value to people in other parts of the world, as the constellations under which development and human rights issues converge are similar around the globe. In the first chapter entitled, Constitutionalising Socio-economic Rights: a Lifeline for the Millennium Spirit, Yash Ghai and Jill Cottrell look upon constitutions as an instrument to eradicate poverty, as a charter of social justice and as a basis of national unity, without which it may be hard to develop social solidarity. This is an essential understanding for Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 3 achieving the MDGs. For a constitution to come to life it must be observed, used, and enforced. On one hand, Ghai and Cottrell argue institutions and procedures must ensure the constitution is usable \u2013 and these institutions and procedures can be provided by the constitution itself. On the other hand, people \u2013 the citizens, the people affected by denial of their rights, the people for whom the constitution is designed\u2014must be motivated and able to make use of it. The authors make the case for incorporating the spirit of the MDGs in a nation\u2019s constitution. Notably, it is not the Goals or Targets, but rather the underlying spirit of the Goals, expressed in the Millennium Declaration, that can and should be constitutionalised. Fundamentally, Ghai and Contrell stress that implementation of a constitution is not about this or that provision, or even the totality of the constitution, important as these are.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8024a5e3-c5df-400e-a6d8-c60c35124652": {"__data__": {"id_": "8024a5e3-c5df-400e-a6d8-c60c35124652", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd16265fe62667452ad74fc16f839880927f112519c2604fccfa5c936655aabd"}}, "hash": "cd16265fe62667452ad74fc16f839880927f112519c2604fccfa5c936655aabd", "text": "The Constitution is about inculcating a culture of respect for and discipline of the law, acceptance of rulings by courts and other bodies authorized to interpret the law, giving effect to judicial decisions, acceptance of the limits on government, respecting and promoting human and collective rights as well as participation and empowerment of the people. In Chapter II, Ways and means of ensuring that social protection helps realize economic and social rights and achieve the MDGs, Alison Graham addresses the role of social protection in mitigating the impact of risks and help realize the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This role is already well acknowledged, particularly in light of the recent financial, food and fuel crises coupled with environmental degradation exacerbated by climate change, all of which have impeded or slowed down the realization of the MDGs in many parts of the world. In fact the World Bank asserts, \u2018without appropriate social protection mechanisms, the MDG targets for 2015 will not be achieved.\u2019 Moreover, as repeatedly emphasized by the UN\u2019s human rights institutions, guaranteeing social protection is not a charity gesture but an obligation of States under international human rights law. Despite this consensus, however, there remains considerable controversy about what this means in practice with debate continuing to focus on implementation of protection programmes, i.e. whether they should be universal or targeted, the risk of possible stigmatization, the role of conditionalities and the question of financial affordability and ensuring sustainability. In answering some of these questions, this chapter draws significantly from the various reports and recommendations of the Independent Expert/Special Rapporteur on human rights and extreme poverty. Chapter III Access to a Legal Remedy: Alternative Pathways to MDG Implementation, by Tiernan Mennen, underlines how accessing legal remedies is an important structural component for enforcing the spectrum of rights and benefits corresponding to the MDGs. Ensuring access to a legal remedy is an important component to any comprehensive strategy ensuring individual people can effectively challenge denial of their economic, social and cultural rights. This chapter examines the most effective approaches for providing access to a legal remedy and details how remedies can be better oriented to address economic and social rights and other legal issues that directly impact the MDGs. The preferred approach expands upon traditional criminal justice-focused legal aid programs to incorporate legal empowerment methodologies, such as paralegals, increasing the agency of individuals to use the law as a tool and promote integration of legal solutions to a wider swath of development issues such as health, education, and public services. 4 Introduction Chapter IV, written by Timothy Dolan entitled, Methods of Identifying Regulatory and Legislative Barriers to Empowering the Poor, is based on various initiatives on legal empowerment undertaken by countries around the world, including members of the Legal Empowerment Asia Partnership (LEAP). Given these countries\u2019 common aspirations, a guidance note on methods of identifying regulatory and legislative barriers to empowering the poor was commissioned by UNDP Mongolia to better equip practitioners and policymakers involved in legal empowerment of the poor (LEP) programming. The guidance note is targeted towards government officials, development practitioners and programme staff involved in programme/project design, management and monitoring. This chapter, based on the guidance note, presents a review and analysis of a selection of existing methods in the field to assist LEAP member countries and others in adopting their own methodology to identify potential laws and regulations presenting themselves as obstacles to empowering the poor. In Chapter V entitled, The Importance of Public Action in Realizing Social and Economic Rights: The Example of the Right to Food Campaign in India, A.K. Shiva Kumar provides the example of India\u2019s Right to Food Campaign, which began in 2001 and continues to this date. It is an informal network of organizations and individuals committed to the realization of the right to food in India. The civil society driven campaign believes the primary responsibility for guaranteeing basic entitlements rests with the state and aims at partnering with and enabling state institutions to achieve this realization. In order for this to occur, the right to food requires not only equitable and sustainable food systems, but also entitlements relating to livelihood security such as the right to work, land reform and social security. One of the major achievements that can be at least partially attributed to the Campaign is the introduction of hot cooked meals for school-going children across the country. Prior to 2005, school-going children received \u2018dry rations\u2019 (or 3 kilograms of rice or wheat) every month. Today, more than 100 million children receive hot-cooked meals in school. This has had a significant impact in terms of ending", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00b3db45-5636-49a7-a237-c8d97dea439a": {"__data__": {"id_": "00b3db45-5636-49a7-a237-c8d97dea439a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "617c723b4ebd478031afc7fe8e1ea1269a53f9bc47151662836bf766916f426d"}}, "hash": "617c723b4ebd478031afc7fe8e1ea1269a53f9bc47151662836bf766916f426d", "text": "classroom hunger, enhancing attentiveness in the classroom, boosting school enrolment and bridging social distances. It has thus contributed not only to attaining the MDGs on poverty, hunger and school attendance, but has also indirectly contributed to increased gender equality and better health of children across India. India\u2019s recent experience with the \u2018right to food\u2019 campaign underscores the importance of strong and effective public action within a democratic framework to end human poverty. It points to the need for building a broad coalition of support and forging partnerships with and beyond government to include multiple stakeholders who can design, refine and evolve a policy consensus. It also highlights the significance of putting in place constructive pre-legislative (and policy) processes to create public awareness, utilize evidence, dispel misconceptions, generate options and stimulate public discussions \u2013 as necessary inputs into the formulation of laws and policies. Chapter VI, Affirmative Action as a Way and Means of Achieving Economic and Social Rights and the MDGs by Alison Graham, analyses how affirmative action (also known as special measures) such as preferential regimes in areas of employment, housing, education can be crucial in complementing development strategies to secure people\u2019s human rights and ensure that progress towards achieving the MDGs benefits everyone Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 5 and not just the privileged elites. Unless specific measures are taken to address such structural and systematic discrimination, development planning and implementation cannot benefit all. Equal treatment will only reinforce power asymmetries, contribute to further marginalisation, and skew the realisation of the MDGs with policies and programmes benefitting the elites. Although widely used, affirmative action is still subject to misconceptions about its use and legal dimensions. This chapter also clarifies its legal ramifications and specifically details what a rights-based approach to affirmative action entails and what conditions affirmative action measures must fulfill to comply with human rights standards and principles. Allison Corkery, in Chapter VII on National Human Rights Institutions, recalls national human rights institutions (NHRIs) as being recognized with increased frequency as a key element in a human rights based approach to the MDGs. She looks at the evolution of NHRIs in the Asia Pacific region and goes on to examine how NHRIs in the region have exercised their mandated functions on economic, social and cultural rights in ways that contribute to implementing a human rights based approach; concluding the potential added value that NHRIs bring to the MDGs is a series of \u2018bridging\u2019 roles they play that can help strengthen the mutually reinforcing aspects of the MDGs and human rights. It has been suggested the recommendations of NHRIs can help the strategy of governments in prioritizing development objectives to meet the MDGs. In some cases, an institution will be given an explicit mandate to do this. In some countries, a Human Rights Commission is the convener of committee on implementing the country\u2019s development plan. In other cases, policy guidance can come from a country\u2019s human rights action plan. Several countries in the Asia-Pacific have adopted such plans, with NHRIs playing a key role in their development. Recommendations made in the context of specific investigations can also guide policy. Nevertheless, expectations on NHRIs need to be realistic and the final part of the chapter therefore identifies some of the challenges facing NHRIs in addressing economic, social and cultural rights, before suggesting ways development partners can support NHRIs to address these. Rajat Khosla, in Chapter VIII entitled, The MDGs and Human Rights: An Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Perspective, notes that globally, indigenous peoples remain severely affected by poverty and have not been given ample attention in MDG-related processes. Indigenous peoples have the right to benefit from the MDGs and fulfill the aspirations contained in the UN Millennium Declaration to the same extent as others. However, in a majority of countries where indigenous peoples live, they are lagging behind other parts of the population in the achievement of these goals. Indigenous peoples have distinct and unique cultures and world views, and their development needs and aspirations may differ from the mainstream population. The indigenous peoples\u2019 approach to development is based on the principles of respect for and preservation of land, natural resources and all elements of the natural environment; consensus in decision-making; mutual respect for peoples\u2019 values and ideology, including sovereignty over land, resources and the environment under natural law. The emphasis is on recognition as distinct peoples, and development has to encompass the social, cultural, political and institutional dimensions of their identity and rights.

Chapter IX, Legal Identity and MDG Implementation by Tiernan Mennen, lays out how possession of legal identity is a fundamental threshold for gaining access to a range of goods and services that have the potential to improve people\u2019s lives and help countries achieve the MDGs. Legal identity establishes citizenship and/or residency and can provide access to education, health care and social welfare, registration of title to land, receipt of pension or social security, obtaining utility connections, enforcing inheritance rights, and even registration and protection of small businesses. Legal identity also protects human rights such as freedom of movement, property rights, and the right to vote; helps limit crimes against minors such as trafficking and child labor; and improves government databases for better development planning and the adequate and equitable distribution of public resources to those who need it most. Despite the fact that legal identity is a cornerstone for access to justice and legal identity is an unequivocal provision in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, tens of millions of people still lack formally documented legal identity. As legal identity affects development objectives pertaining to virtually all of the MDGs, and as its causes and ramifications are often not readily apparent upon initial program design, development organizations should anticipate legal identity barriers and consider potential interventions. Chapter X, Legal Empowerment and Organization of Vulnerable Groups by Madhu Kishwar is a personal account of three decades of advocacy on behalf of India\u2019s rural and urban poor. Kishwar describes the various insights she and her organization, Manushi, have gained over three decades working on reforming inheritance legislation in rural Bihar, the successful use of mythology-based community mobilization to enhance women\u2019s economic rights, and years of campaigning for a more sensible pro-poor approach to regulating rickshaw pulling and street hawking in Delhi. She concludes that potential of legislation as an instrument for strengthening the rights of vulnerable groups can be realized only if such efforts recognize inherent limitations, especially when dealing with groups positioned so precariously in the social, economic and political hierarchy that any assertion of legal rights endangers their very lives at the hands of powerful groups at whose mercy they currently survive; Create an effective, non-partisan and accountable machinery for its implementation; Ensure the law-and-order machinery\u2014notably the police and judiciary\u2014is willing and capable of offering protection and redress to those whose legal rights are being violated; Have the ability to create a broad-based social consensus on the desirability of empowering vulnerable groups through specific legal measures; and rely more on enabling legislation instead of enacting draconian, punitive laws that inevitably lend themselves to easy abuse and sabotage if the law and order machinery is not designed and geared towards protecting the rights of vulnerable groups. The final chapter, Relinking the MDG Acceleration Framework with human rights and democratic governance \u2013 proposals for widening the scope of the MDG agenda in Asia- Pacific by Marcus Brand, is based on a paper written in the context of discussions Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 7 within UNDP and the wider development community in Asia-Pacific on how to structure programmes aimed at meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. As per UNDP\u2019s 2010 MDG Breakthrough Strategy, renewed and concerted efforts are to be made to help developing countries accelerate progress towards reaching the Goals, but also to ensure longer term sustainability of the progress made, and to ascertain that the overall progress made by countries also reaches the poorest of the poor, marginalized people and those otherwise left behind. The Chapter discusses the MDGs within the context of the Millennium Declaration and revisits debates of the past decade on the complex relationship between the Millennium Declaration, the MDGs and Human Rights. It briefly summarizes actual progress made in the context of the MDGs a decade into the new Millennium and offers an interim view on the MDGs\u2019 effectiveness to implement the Millennium Declaration\u2019s aspirations. It captures the main features of the 2010 review, and various efforts aimed at breakthroughs and acceleration. In doing so, the article finds that while the relationship between human rights, governance and the MDGs has been dealt with exhaustively at the conceptual level, in practice there has been a mixed record integrating the two frameworks. At the global level, the MDG process appears to have moved away somewhat from the language of human rights and democracy, but has nevertheless taken up an important component", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8572d097-196e-4888-8a30-0fb268623e32": {"__data__": {"id_": "8572d097-196e-4888-8a30-0fb268623e32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bfe929573c03a4d25827709e5aabbbe2fb37dc31295f49f02a9c78d283e6b7bb"}}, "hash": "bfe929573c03a4d25827709e5aabbbe2fb37dc31295f49f02a9c78d283e6b7bb", "text": "of a human rights approach, namely the identification of disparities and inequalities within countries as a main issue to be addressed within the MDG context. However, the chapter also finds linkages between human rights, governance and the MDGs were not incorporated into the MDG Acceleration Framework (MAF) to the extent that they could have been, and much of the current reporting and programming on MDGs still fails to take this connection fully into account. Finally, the chapter proposes a number of concrete steps regarding how ongoing and future MDG-related efforts could benefit from stronger linkages to human rights and democratic governance. The chapter ends with a tentative outlook and some reflections for a possible post-MDG development agenda, which needs to be fully aligned with the values and principles of the Millennium Declaration, and should integrate a human-rights-based approach, governance dimensions and human development more comprehensively from the outset. Most of the papers include recommendations to UNDP, or other development organizations to be taken into account when designing programming for MDG acceleration or human development. UNDP programmes, as well as country strategies and development plans, routinely include references to human rights, a human rights based approach or the interrelations between governance and development. However, the practical insights, case studies and innovative solutions identified herein will still provide useful additions to what has been emerging as a growing consensus among development practitioners at the country level. It is anticipated the experiences at both policy as well as project level made by UNDP and others will continue to inform academic analysis and debates in the coming years, and the future development goals to guide the world beyond 2015, will be firmly based on insights thus collected. 8 Constitutionalising Socio-economic Rights: A Lifeline for the Millennium Spirit Constitutionalising Socio-economic Rights: A Lifeline for the Millennium Spirit Jill Cottrell and Yash Ghai 1. Poverty, Development Goals and Rights Poverty Poverty constitutes the lack of qualities that facilitating a good life, defined in terms of access to conditions supporting a reasonable physical existence enabling individuals and communities to realize their spiritual and cultural potential\u2014opportunities for reflection, artistic creativity, development of and discourse on morality, and contribution to and participation in the political, social and economic life of the community. Poverty is created by societies and governments. It is about exclusion, physical and economic insecurity, fear of the future, a constant sense of vulnerability. The essential purpose of human rights, a life in dignity, is rendered impossible by extreme poverty. Not only do poor people enjoy disproportionately small measures of economic rights like education, health, and shelter, but they are equally unable to exercise civil and political rights, which require not only an understanding of the dynamics of society and access to public institutions, but also confidence in themselves. They are, for the most part, unable to use legal processes to vindicate human and legal rights. Development Goals It was in the belief that poverty could be eradicated that the Heads of States and Governments committed the UN and their states to the Millennium Declaration. It includes: \u2022\ufffd respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms \u2022\ufffd the rule of law and good governance \u2022\ufffd making the right to development a reality for everyone \u2022\ufffd more generous development assistance \u2022\ufffd sustainable development \u2022\ufffd special regard for the neediest countries and people It also allows for certain principles to guide international relations, including freedom (in the widest sense based on the will of the people), equality, solidarity (meaning costs and burdens of meeting challenges must be fairly distributed in accordance with equity and social justice), tolerance, respect for nature and shared responsibility. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 9 The Declaration carved out a series of more specific, inter-related and mutually supporting Goals. These constitute the \u201cMDGs\u201d: 1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger 2. Achieve universal primary education 3. Promote gender equality and empower women 4. Reduce child mortality 5. Improve maternal health 6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases 7. Ensure environmental sustainability 8. Develop a global partnership for development It was realised something more was needed to engage specific commitment from countries, and the imagination of their peoples, in the form of a set of specific targets by fixed dates. The targets have both kept the MDGs alive, and caused great criticism. For many targets, the year 2015 was selected \u2013 so that, taking 1990 as a baseline, 25 years was given for the achievement of the targets. More detailed \u201cindicators\u201d have been developed in order to assess whether progress is being made towards the Goals, designed as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c92405ad-f2a4-4d04-82bb-364b1db606fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "c92405ad-f2a4-4d04-82bb-364b1db606fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "08b8d0210e2eeccd03276f6506f6a6766396004a7fa70b3436c571e188f4f65a"}, "3": {"node_id": "b3f84594-7a53-46d2-9546-06133248f4a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f69960f4680d749a11e2f50d973590361c22c235a1958db9870b090d181fbf8d"}}, "hash": "a5301b0067ba2f8aef7171b9a1c9f7b073fe2d4dddf00d5e55371b96f92f05df", "text": "\u201crelevant and robust measures of progress\u201d, to be \u201cclear and straightforward to interpret and provide a basis for international comparison\u201d and \u201cconstructed from well-established data sources, be quantifiable and be consistent to enable measurement over time\u201d.1 As 2015 approaches, there is not just concern that the targets have in many countries not been achieved, but a worry that, whether they have or not, impetus and commitment will evaporate. This paper proposes renewed commitment may be stimulated by focusing on rights, especially economic, social and cultural rights. Rights \u201cWe have a right\u201d is a very special claim, implying that this has priority over others\u2019 entitlements, or perhaps even a nation\u2019s interest. One of the most remarkable developments of the twentieth century was the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948 following the Second World War and the establishment of the United Nations. The UDHR, and the Millennium Declaration share a focus on \u201chuman dignity\u201d which encapsulates various ideas, distinguishing the human person from other creatures, linking, for believers, the human person to God, or emphasising the essence of the human person who seeks acknowledgement and self-respect, and is indirectly related to community and human solidarity. It supplied a theoretical basis for the human rights movement. An 1 See http://devdata.worldbank.org/gmis/mdg/UNDG%20document_final.pdf. 10 Constitutionalising Socio-economic Rights: A Lifeline for the Millennium Spirit important way the concept of human dignity has been used2 is to highlight basic needs of all persons. The Millennium Declaration in its first value, \u201cfreedom\u201d, emphasises: \u201cMen and women have the right to live their lives and raise their children in dignity, free from hunger and from the fear of violence, oppression or injustice\u201d. The UDHR sees no conflict between various types of rights, civil and political rights, or economic and social; they are mutually supportive. The work stresses \u201csocial progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\u201d. Unfortunately, ideological and material conflicts between western capitalist and communist states obscured the unity of rights and led to the denigration of economic and social rights. Now, the Millennium Declaration has drawn fresh attention to conflicts by committing Heads of State and Government, \u201cTo respect fully and uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\u201d (para 25). The UDHR has no real legal \u201cteeth\u201d hence, two Covenants were established in 1966: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966) (ICESCR), as well as subsequent human rights treaties. Each covenant has a reporting mechanism for states which comments on performance. These are supplemented by \u201cspecial procedures\u201d of the UN, especially special rapporteurs, mainly on particular topics. Civil and political rights include the rights to life, personal liberty and security including freedom from torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, or forced labour, fair trials and treatment for the detained, freedom of movement, thought and belief, association, assembly and expression, equal rights in marriage and generally, rights to take part in public affairs and to privacy and rights of minorities \u201cto enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, or to use their own language\u201d. The ICESCR includes the rights to work, and to fair conditions in work, to organise for work purposes, to social security, adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing, to the highest attainable standard of health, to education, to cultural life, as well as the protection of the family and mothers, and of children from exploitation. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention for the Elimination for All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), on the Rights of Persons with Disability and ILO Convention and UN Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples elaborate these rights for particular groups. Often, these add clarity and detail to wider covenants for socio- economic rights. This is especially true of the CRC. However, there is sometimes a particular emphasis that might be less obvious, for example, mention of breastfeeding for children, of equal pay for work of equal value for women, or the requirement of prior informed consent for development affecting indigenous peoples.

A national system of human rights protection involves not only institutions and rules that are designed for human rights protection, but a whole range of bodies, laws, and practices, including: \u2022\ufffd The constitution and other major laws \u2022\ufffd Bodies for accountability including parliament, ombudsman bodies, human rights commissions, police complaints bodies, anti-corruption bodies and so on \u2022\ufffd The institutions of democracy, such as the electoral system, political parties, local government \u2022\ufffd Bodies for law enforcement, including the Attorney-General, police, prosecutors, the judicial or court system \u2022\ufffd Administrative policies and actual practices 3 See http://www.asean.org/22769.htm for the latter.

In poor countries, much of civil societies\u2019 funding is likely to come from overseas sources that may not understand the dynamics of the country that also have their own agendas.

The nature of the obligation has been analysed in some detail by the Committee on the Covenant and by various Special Rapporteurs. Firstly the state must achieve \u201cat the very least, minimum levels of each of the rights\u201d and to give priority to achieving this minimum level. Beyond that the duty is to \u2018respect, protect, promote and fulfil\u2019 the rights. This way of analysing the duty of the state fits perfectly well with its duty to respect civil and political rights as clearly stated in the Constitution of South Africa. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 13 \u201cRespect\u201d would mean that the state must not confiscate printing machines or television cameras or detain journalists as this would deny the freedom of information as well as the freedom of expression. A government that seized farmers\u2019 land, without providing for compensation or resettlement, so that farmers lose their livelihood, would probably be violating the right to an \u201cadequate standard of living\u201d of the farmers, of the right to work, and perhaps of the right to food more generally. \u201cProtecting\u201d would include ending discriminatory hiring or admissions policies, or prohibition of the use of one\u2019s mother tongue in private or educational institutions, or attacks on the institutions or practices of a community\u2019s religion by racial or religious bigots, trying to stop international fishing boats destroying the livelihood of local fishermen, or requiring private schools to observe standards to satisfy the right to education. \u201cPromote\u201d and \u201cfulfil\u201d both involve positive actions by the state. These may involve education and encouragement \u2013 taxation systems that stimulate fulfilment, for example. A state might ensure the right to housing by making available sufficient land, or ensure health by ensuring the supply of affordable medicines. Sometimes the state must go further, for example providing feeding programmes in case of droughts. The choice of particular methodology to achieve rights is a matter of policy for the government. Much thought has also been given to the question, \u201ca right to what?\u201d Food must be adequate in quantity, and in nutritional value, accessible and available, and culturally acceptable. The right to \u201ceducation\u201d is to accessible education, appropriate in content and quality. The right to health does not mean a right to be healthy \u2013 but would include a right to health care that is reasonably accessible (geographically and financially) and of reasonable quality, as well as culturally and in other acceptable ways.4 States are required to achieve fulfilment of rights \u201cprogressively\u201d, but to do so \u201cto the maximum of their available resources\u201d. The committee on ESCR has emphasised that lack of resources does not mean a state may postpone beginning the process of realisation of rights, though progress may be dictated partly by resources. How MDGs and Rights relate to each other National and international organisations working to support fulfilment of the MDGs and of rights, especially socio-economic rights, use similar tools to assess progress towards the fulfilment of both. However, some organisations perceive themselves as working only towards MDGs, or see themselves as human rights organisations. Here we simply intend to suggest ways for taking account of both, with the valuable common agenda of eliminating poverty. 4 For the last see General Comment No. 12 on \u201cThe right to the highest attainable standard of health\u201d, E/C.12/2000/4. 14 Constitutionalising Socio-economic Rights: A Lifeline for the Millennium Spirit MDG analysis may beneft rights work A great deal of work has managed to develop targets and indicators to achieve the MDGs.

Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 15 2. Constitutions and Constitutionalism A country\u2019s constitution, as fundamental law, provides the framework for structures and powers of the state. Generally, all laws, policies and administrative acts must be compatible with it. In \u201cdeveloping societies\u201d, the state is distanced from society, usually having its origins derived from colonial rule. Often, the constitution does not have effective links to either society or even the state. There is often no dominant social class or force in society and people may be divided by caste, tribe, religion or language, and forced together by an outside power, now departed. In this situation, the role of the constitution is significantly different in comparison with established societies. The constitution can be seen as a major symbol of the state and as creator of a sense of nationalism and national belonging. Many recent constitutions are designed to create stability through unity, even if that unity is generated by the recognition of ethnic and other differences. In more enlightened constitutions for this purpose, considerable emphasis may be placed on social justice and inclusion, as the only guarantee of peace and stability in a multi-ethnic society. Here we look upon the constitution as an instrument to eradicate poverty, as a charter of social justice, and as a basis of national unity, without which it may be hard to develop social solidarity, so essential for achieving the MDGs. For a constitution to come to life it must be observed, be used, and be enforced. There must be institutions and procedures to ensure it is usable \u2013 and these institutions and procedures can be provided by the constitution itself. On the other hand, people \u2013 the citizens, the people affected by denial of their rights, the people for whom the constitution is designed\u2014must be motivated and able to make use of it. We believe there is considerable value incorporating the spirit of the MDGs into a nation\u2019s constitution. Some may object: an important part of the appeal of the MDGs has been the idea that \u201cwe can make poverty history\u201d and \u201cin our lifetime\u201d. Some would say putting the MDGs into a national constitution is to constitutionalise poverty, when the whole thrust of the MDGs was to deny its inevitability. Some will object that a constitution is something that ought to last and should therefore be timeless. But it is not the Goals or Targets, but rather the underlying spirit of the Goals, expressed in the Millennium Declaration, can and should be constitutionalised. Even if the Goals were realised in a particular society, continued vigilance is needed to maintain that progress. The Goals are benchmarks for the journey to a just society. Constitutions should not be changed at whim, but the supposed perpetuity of the constitution should not be made an article of faith either. A constitution should respond to needs of a particular country, and reflect what citizens believe is important. One price for this is the likelihood that the constitution will be changed or even replaced. The Constitution of India, an aspirational document, has been changed 96 times. 16 Constitutionalising Socio-economic Rights: A Lifeline for the Millennium Spirit A constitution is a national document \u2013 the national document \u2013 but the MDGs were a commitment of an entire community of nations. The importance of the constitutionalisation of MDGs and socio-economic rights arises from the fact that the primary responsibility for their promotion lies with national governments and societies, despite the considerable development of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "111c7965-6e69-4cee-a458-8958f3d082fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "111c7965-6e69-4cee-a458-8958f3d082fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bddc722fd29bb4583f1a3decfb559838911a8e7f5b04eea2dadf4e1092a91b0"}}, "hash": "0bddc722fd29bb4583f1a3decfb559838911a8e7f5b04eea2dadf4e1092a91b0", "text": "international norms and institutions. Some argue a constitution should be value neutral, and its sole function is to provide rules for the formation of government and the mode of decision making in the legislature and other state organs. In reality, no constitution is neutral, even if it does not explicitly contain any values. A constitution restricted to rules on formation of, and decision making within, the government is not neutral but is directed towards maintenance of the economic and social status quo. Similarly, the argument regarding the sole purpose of a constitution is to limit and restrain the exercise of political power, is also often an ideological position ensuring that those who are already dominant in society enjoy maximum freedom, with the state only responsible for maintaining law and order. Some believe values cannot normally be stated with clarity and it is difficult for courts to interpret implications of values for state action, weakening the constitution. However, a constitution is not just a legal document but also a political and social document as well. In truth, most constitutional provisions have a degree of ambiguity and the courts are routinely asked to interpret values or abstract terms, even if they are not labelled \u201cprinciples\u201d or \u201cvalues\u201d. A further objection stipulates values and aspirations as being hard, if not impossible, to implement, and this failure diminishes the legitimacy of the constitution, disappointing those who have high expectations, and giving rise to the dangerous idea that the constitution need not be taken seriously or that some of its provisions can be ignored. This criticism implies accepting that a just society is impossible. Anyway, no constitution is without values and in truth, no constitution is fully implemented. In other words, we are not convinced by those who prefer a particular minimalist constitution. More importantly, citizens in developing states are not convinced. On one hand, citizens want justice and inclusion for themselves. However, there is often little sympathy for the poor and oppressed of other communities. \u201cNation building\u201d based on common citizenship is essential for many purposes, particularly commitment to a wider sense of social justice. A constitution is a valuable tool for this. There is often little familiarity with the modalities and morals of state power, or the true significance of democracy. Consequently it is necessary to spell these out in a constitution, to guide the exercise of power and establish new institutions of accountability, since society is unable on its own to do this effectively. The full range of human rights, as a primary component of meaningful democracy, must be fully reflected in the constitution and the design of political organizations. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 17 The very process of making or reviewing a constitution \u2013 a process which mandates articles of faith be participatory6 \u2013 can promote public contribution to its agenda, gain legitimacy among the people, respond to imperatives of justice, and ensure greater knowledge of the constitution and prospects of its implementation, including the MDG spirit. Constitution making or review is a marvellous opportunity to engage people in discourses on constitutions, human rights, democracy and social justice. People can be quite focussed on the process as much publicity is given in the media to issues of reform. The process can be used to promote knowledge as well as practice of democracy. A. Effective Protection of Rights What legal effect should be given to rights? Rights can be recognised in the constitution in at least four ways, although these are not mutually exclusive. Most preambles now refer in some form to human rights: either to recognise past violations of rights or to emphasise the commitment of the state to protect rights. A Declaration of Fundamental Principles has been a feature of constitutions in the civil law tradition but is now becoming common practice in other countries as well, such as those with a common law tradition. In some constitutions (e.g., Ireland, India, Namibia, Uganda, Ghana, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Papua New Guinea), certain rights, mostly socio-economic rights, are drafted in the form of \u201cDirective Principles of State Policy\u201d. India\u2019s Principles include, \u201ceffective provisions for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in case of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement and in other cases of undeserved want\u201d. The constitution states directive principles are \u201cnot enforceable by any court\u201d (often described as being \u201cnon-justiciable\u201d), but they are \u201cnevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country\u201d and the state is under a duty to \u201capply these principles in making laws\u201d. The Ghanaian constitution goes further when it states directive", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da4e2b7d-0f13-4aba-a433-bede83a191d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "da4e2b7d-0f13-4aba-a433-bede83a191d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82899fe1a63f883078b511294e148a7cb7e72d0918ded8bf52a178535d457d4b"}, "3": {"node_id": "8014b26d-826e-4eba-8c5b-da57a278bde1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d404a9dd03635136b42e6d14d23f5c1a60fe250dcddad913df1a6561c929dff9"}}, "hash": "1e4e86e8fe477177acbb71331fe9d25d698324878badc1e17de07a580c66a459", "text": "principles \u201cshall guide all citizens, Parliament, the President, the Judiciary, the Council of State, the Cabinet, political parties and other bodies and persons in applying or interpreting this Constitution or any other law and in taking and implementing any policy decisions, for the establishment of a just and free society\u201d. We would advise against an optimistic assumption that broad portmanteau , like the right to life, preambles or directive principles will actually protect socio-economic rights, at least in any predictable and comprehensive manner. The expansions of other rights do not comprehensively cover the socio-economic rights. There is no guarantee at all that a court will take a sufficiently creative approach. In many countries, the right to life is used to refer only to issues like the death penalty and abortion, and the clause that says Directive Principles cannot be used as the basis of a claim in court is taken very literally. 6 This is a topic we do not have space to explore here. A detailed discussion can be found in Brandt, Cottrell, Ghai and Regan, Constitution-Making and Reform: A Handbook (Geneva: Interpeace, 2011) 18 Constitutionalising Socio-economic Rights: A Lifeline for the Millennium Spirit Of the different ways of recognising rights, the most legally effective is in the form of legally enforceable, fundamental or human rights. With the agenda of the MDGs in mind, socio- economic rights should be expressed in the form of justiciable rights, as has been done in South Africa and Kenya. In this way, they will not be seen as inferior to civil and political rights, and state agencies, including courts, will have to harmonise all kinds of rights in an integrated scheme of entitlements. Basic commitment to a regime of rights through the preamble or statements of national values and principles is a useful supplement by highlighting the importance of human rights and enabling interpretations of other legal concepts and provisions in the context of human rights. These preambular statements or state principles are also a good place to indicate the objectives of human rights, such as human dignity and democracy. Some desirable objectives may be hard to turn into rights so directive principles or values would be the best place for them. Something like \u201celimination of poverty\u201d or \u201cconservation of resources\u201d is not something that can be made a right of any person or group. Using Declarations and Directive Principles Despite the reservations expressed earlier about \u201cnon-rights creating\u201d provisions in constitutions, the fact that a state does not have clear rights to food, housing, education etc in its constitution does not mean the constitution cannot be used to further these rights. Lawyerly and judicial creativity as well as different traditions of interpretation may be brought to bear for good effect. There remain a few countries where constitutions are not actually considered to be legal, as opposed to essentially political documents. This fact is evident in China. In 2001, the Supreme People\u2019s Court seemed to be moving towards recognition of rights, but a few years later it returned to orthodoxy from what some Chinese scholars regard as an \u201codd decision\u201d. The UN Committee Against Torture has included certain demolitions of houses as a violation of the Convention Against Torture\u2019s prohibition on \u201ccruel and degrading treatment\u201d, thus protecting the right to housing \u2013 a strategy that could also be used by lawyers and courts domestically. However, it is unwise to assume a court will take an expanded view of a right that is silent on a particular point. For example, the Constitutional Court in Hungary declined to hold the right to social security having a general right to housing, though it might include a right to shelter in emergency.7 Increasingly, courts are giving effect to directive principles in different ways. Courts may be used to justify qualifications on rights, such as the right to equality, which has been read to permitting affirmative action when a directive principle requires the state to redress the historic or contemporary injustices inflicted on a section of the community. In another instance, the courts used the directive principle on living wages and decent conditions of work to uphold the reasonableness of minimum legislation. The right to life has been interpreted with the help of directive principles to include the right to basic needs and a 7 Decision No. 42/2000. (XI. 8.)

The Supreme Court of Ghana held these principles as enforceable \u2013 since the Constitution does not say otherwise. In civil law countries, or areas (mostly) outside former British colonies, different traditions of legal drafting and interpretation may mean what seems to be on the surface as rather broad and aspirational provisions are actually used for a very real and concrete effect. Another difference between civil and common law countries is many of the former recognise international treaties as forming part of national law, while most of the latter require a treaty to be \u201cdomesticated\u201d or for national law to be passed introducing treaty provisions or provisions based on national law. So the Supreme Court of Argentina could decide that the State\u2019s failure to arrange the production of a vaccine for a common and endemic disease was a violation of the right to health under the ICESCR,9 and there are a number of Colombian cases based on international treaty obligations. Even some common law countries have recently adopted the direct application approach, including Nepal and Kenya, but how this will work in practice is not yet clear. In other words, the absence of constitutional provisions clearly recognising legally enforceable rights is not necessary resulting in the courts\u2019 inability to give those rights meaning. Nor are the courts the only, or even the most effective, way to protect rights. Ultimately, rights depend on governments far more than courts.

Some constitutions address social and economic rights rather generally by stating, \u201cEveryone has the right to health\u201d. Others include considerable detail. The details may be more important for some rights as opposed to others. There are two aspects of detail: (i) when one says a right to something, what is it a right to? and (ii) what must be done to achieve that right? As we have seen, there has been a good deal of elaboration internationally of the former aspect: often referring to issues like availability of resources, accessibility (meaning physical, financial and in other ways), appropriateness and acceptability (which includes cultural or religious acceptability). Some constitutions, especially in Latin America, include great detail concerning government action in terms of achieving socio-economic rights. Sometimes governments even incorporate a particular political philosophy. Many people would think this is anti- democratic because it would unduly curtail the electorate\u2019s future choices. The balance is not easy; a commitment to rights is itself the manifestation of a certain philosophy or worldview, but it is one that now has universal acceptance at least in theory. The drafting challenge is to include the core of basic rights without unjustifiably constraining legitimate political choice in the future. The drafters of the South African Constitution decided against detailed prescriptions of how to achieve rights (though they did prescribe affirmative action for the removal of historic injustices). They turned to the ICESCR for language using the following expressions: \u2022\ufffd \u201cprogressive realisation\u201d \u2022\ufffd \u201creasonable legislative and other measures\u201d \u2022\ufffd \u201cwithin its available resources\u201d Likewise, the drafters drew on developments of rights by international mechanisms using the formulation: \u2022\ufffd \u201crespect, protect and fulfil rights.\u201d Although this gives guidance pertaining to what the responsibilities are, it does not prescribe how to achieve them. It also automatically brings in international interpretations. However, the drafters were careful: they did not permit \u201cprogressive realisation\u201d for every right. The rights of free primary education, emergency health care and the freedom from arbitrary evictions were not something to be worked towards, but had immediate effect. 3.

A living constitution is one people use in their daily existence, which governs and controls the exercise of state power, and promotes the values and aspirations expressed in it. Even more importantly, a living constitution is an agreement that political leaders and senior and junior state officials understand, respect and observe\u2014if they are willing to submit their exercise of state power in accordance with constitutional values and procedures. The wide-ranging ambitions often expressed in modern constitutions (particularly as they affect class or ethnic interests, such as affirmative action, social and economic rights, and identity \u2013 often as an outcome of or putative solution to conflict) make a constitution controversial and divisive, and prevent it from becoming an unquestioned point of loyalty and focus. Indeed, it faces positive opposition from entrenched interests among the ruling classes \u2013 politically and economically. Another issue is corruption; powerful interests in or from outside a country not sympathetic to objectives of the constitution or wishing to buy illegitimate influence using corrupt means to sabotage it. This leads to the subversion of both the values and institutions of the constitution. One of the surest ways to weaken socio-economic rights is through financial or political corruption of the judiciary. Particular problems exist when implementing socio-economic rights. The wealthy have little interest in greater social justice, which they consider is at their own expense (e.g., higher taxation). The ideologically conservative oppose socio-economic rights because they believe it will distort the logic and mechanisms of the market. Both groups are politically powerful. We have suggested that universal support for MDGs provides a good opportunity to win support for goals of social justice and to consolidate them as socio- economic rights. We have tried to suggest ways in which the drafting of a constitution may approach these challenges. Other strategies may include setting up a special, independent commission to ensure implementation of socio-economic rights by offering assistance in preparing laws and regulations and on relevant standards and monitoring. However, even with these measures, there is no guarantee that socio-economic rights will be protected and promoted. The viability and success of a constitution is premised on the ideology of constitutionalism, a belief in the value of restrictions on power, expressed as substantive and institutional limitations, and the practice of the rule of law, with the emphasis on rules and modes of their enforcement. These reflect and spring from political and cultural traditions. Paradoxically, countries attempting to use the constitution for social transformation often lack formal traditions. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 23 Duties of particular other bodies to protect rights A few constitutions state the government must report on its performance on socio- economic rights. In Ghana \u201cThe President shall report to Parliament at least once a year on all the steps taken to ensure the realization of policy objectives contained in this Chapter and, in particular, the realization of basic human rights, a healthy economy, the right to work, the right to good health care and the right to education.\u201d In South Africa, the Human Rights Commission is given a particular responsibility to report on economic, social and cultural rights \u2013 and government departments must report annually to the Commission on their own performance. The Commission issues a voluminous report and it has devised various means to investigate and interrogate government departments. The value of the reports lies in the publicly available information and analysis, not in the recommendations per se. The 2010 Kenyan Constitution requires use of standards to enable measurement of progress on socio-economic rights. It would not be appropriate to have too much detail in a constitution on how to monitor, but the principle of careful monitoring could be required. Coupled with a provision requiring perhaps the Statistical or Census Office to be independent (to try to avoid political tampering), and a right to information,12 could provide useful tools for civil society and others concerned to experience realisation of rights. The special status and role of the courts Courts protect and implement the constitution and laws; in most systems they have the power, in certain circumstances, to decide whether existing laws and policies are compatible with the constitution (including human rights). More often, courts have the ability to interpret the law in a way compatible with human rights. Less dramatically, but more commonly, the courts will be faced with cases about administrative actions, rather than law making. In some countries, it may not be just the actions of the state organs that are judged by human rights standards, but even those of ordinary citizens \u2013not just", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95424699-e694-499d-81d6-3ffd8f0dac83": {"__data__": {"id_": "95424699-e694-499d-81d6-3ffd8f0dac83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8d1455739d09fa198a1f1211b9c4dfc059e7e2488439329015e0853afa49ade"}}, "hash": "c8d1455739d09fa198a1f1211b9c4dfc059e7e2488439329015e0853afa49ade", "text": "the state, but private persons and bodies also, can be obliged to respect human rights. We can also think of the courts as performing an educational function: through their decisions, citizens as well as the state and its organs, learn about human rights. The courts can only be effective in protecting the citizen against the state or the powerful persons or bodies if they are independent \u2013 not subject to state influence, not prepared to take bribes, viewing themselves as owing their duty to the constitution and the law only. Competence and integrity are as essential as independence, but are perhaps harder to ensure: much depends on ethics of the judiciary\u2014and of the profession. 12 On the importance of access to information (especially primary data) for the achievement of the MDGs see Rafael Guerreiro Osorio, \u201cFree Access to Primary Data Should Be a Right\u201d International Poverty Centre One-Page No. 72, November 2008 http://www.ipc-undp.org/pub/IPCOnePager72.pdf. 24 Constitutionalising Socio-economic Rights: A Lifeline for the Millennium Spirit The courts will craft their own role to a considerable extent, but the Constitution will lay down their jurisdiction and powers. A decision to put socio-economic rights in the Bill of Rights already suggests a role for the courts. In some countries (generally those following a common law tradition), guidance is given to courts about their task of interpreting human rights provisions and the law, generally from a human rights perspective. In Canada, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms \u201cshall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians\u201d (art. 27). The South African and Kenyan Constitutions say, more generally: the courts must \u201cpromote the values that underlie an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom\u201d when interpreting the Bill of Rights. It may be helpful to urge the courts to refer to international law and to cases in other countries to fully understand the rights. The Constitution of South Africa does this when it adds the court \u201cmust consider international law; and may consider foreign law\u201d13 as does the Constitution of the Fiji Islands. In many countries, reference to international law is common in the courts and it is becoming more common, but in some countries this sort of constitutional encouragement could be very useful. Should the courts be able to order any sort of compensation to people whose rights have been violated? In some countries, courts have ordered the state to provide compensation \u2013 notably in India. Some constitutions, as in Kenya, expressly give the courts permission to order compensations for rights violations. The Supreme Court of India has developed a whole series of modifications of traditional court procedural rules designed to enable \u201cPublic Interest Litigation\u201d for the genuinely disadvantaged. A few other countries have followed this lead, especially in South Asia, though not with the same exuberance perhaps as in India. A few constitutions have articles that refer to constitutional remedies in a way that brings in Indian innovations or their spirit. Another feature to facilitate the role of courts is to ensure wide and easy access to courts for the defence of human rights. The Constitutions of South Africa and Kenya provide, in relation to enforcement of rights, anyone acting in their own interest or on behalf of another person who cannot act in their own name, in the interest of a group or class of persons, or in the public interest can approach the court. The Kenyan Constitution requires the courts to disregard technicalities and waive fees to litigation to promote human rights. 13 It also says: Application of international law 233. When interpreting any legislation, every court must prefer any reasonable interpretation of the legislation that is consistent with international law over any alternative interpretation that is inconsistent with international law. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 25 Example for how Courts have given effect to constitutional provisions Among the large number of cases presented before national courts on issues relating to the right to health, we can identify two, from different countries. The first occurred in India, in the Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity v. State of Bengal14, where the court did not use an explicit right to health (for there is none) but instead, the right to life. The petitioner had been taken to a succession of eight state medical institutions ranging from a local health centre to two medical colleges, being refused treatment at each either because of lack of beds or lack of technical capacity.

Beyond Courts: Mobilizing Rights outside the Courtroom One of the Indian leaders of the public interest litigation movement, Justice Bhagwati, wrote We must always remember that social action litigation is a necessary and valuable ally in the cause of the poor, but it cannot be a substitute for the organisation of the poor, development of community self-reliance and establishment of effective organisational structures through which the poor can combat exploitation and injustice, protect and defend their interests, and secure their rights and entitlements. Political pressure, backed up by and made possible by transparency and participation will remain the main way to protect rights \u2013 with the exception of rights of minorities without political clout. The fear of not being re-elected will always be greater in the mind of the politician than the fear of the government of which the individual is in part being sued. 14 AIR 1996 SC 2426. 15 2002(5) SA 721, 2002 (10) BCLR 1033. 26 Constitutionalising Socio-economic Rights: A Lifeline for the Millennium Spirit How Constitutions can Ensure an Inclusive Approach to Development Policy The 2003 Human Development Report states, \u201cThe more unequal a society, the less likely it is to generate sustained political support for the Goals, because political power is usually concentrated and overlaps with economic wealth and social dominance. In unequal societies, elite-dominated progress towards the Goals is also less likely to benefit the poorest people. Moreover, national progress may still mean that large sections of the population are being left behind, as in Brazil, China, India and elsewhere\u201d.16 Can a constitution elevating social justice and egalitarianism to a high principle overcome this challenge? The MDGs and their targets deal on the whole with total populations (except to the extent that they speak of women, children or young persons). Poverty does not affect all groups within countries to the same extent or in the same way. Measures needed to bring people out of poverty will not necessarily be the same for all groups in a country. Women, indigenous peoples, and persons with disability are among groups for whom the constitution and institutions may need to make special provisions for. Suggested relevant provisions include: \u2022\ufffd Permitting or even requiring affirmative action \u2013 for without special effort true equality and inclusion will not be achieved, \u2022\ufffd Drawing particular attention to issues affecting specific groups \u2022\ufffd Carefully drafted rights, ensuring that protection against indirect discrimination is included, and corresponding duties not just to respect but to protect and fulfil rights \u2022\ufffd Provisions designed to ensure the public, including women, participate in the voting process and decision making process \u2022\ufffd Inspiration for drafting may be derived from the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights: \u201cStates Parties shall integrate a gender perspective in their policy decisions, legislation, development plans, programmes and activities and all spheres of life\u201d; similar approaches could be adopted for other groups \u2022\ufffd Provisions designed to enhance democracy within political parties, and to specifically encourage adoption of non-traditional candidates (for winnable seats) \u2022\ufffd Statements of policy raising the \u201cvisibility\u201d of special group issues, including content in the preamble and \u201cDirective Principles\u201d. \u2022\ufffd Mention of \u201cinter-sectional\u201d issues, such as the particular problems of women in indigenous society \u2022\ufffd Define \u201cdisability\u201d in a way that covers all circumstances that may impair some people\u2019s participation in society, including being HIV positive \u2022\ufffd Provide visibility to issues and rights using specific language for clearly addressing the rights of women, persons", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a4bb6f8-1ecb-4c27-b48b-a5e2ae13b930": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a4bb6f8-1ecb-4c27-b48b-a5e2ae13b930", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ed0cbaa26c70a70eca4f2f5554b714d3c403b072d2cc8c3d5b1a1d5c19a8182"}}, "hash": "0ed0cbaa26c70a70eca4f2f5554b714d3c403b072d2cc8c3d5b1a1d5c19a8182", "text": "with disabilities and minorities/indigenous groups \u2022\ufffd Highlight important steps government might take, including use of Braille or sign language for the visually or aurally impaired. 16 Millennium Development Goals: A compact among nations to end human poverty, p. 132. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 27 Beyond Rights Provisions: The Whole Constitution as a Framework for Rights In the context of human rights and social justice, the ultimate goal of a constitution must be to fulfil Article 28 of the UDHR: Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized. Since the national constitution can do little about the international order, the focus of this section is on national aspects of the constitution. Article 28 requires every provision of the constitution to be \u201chuman rights friendly\u201d. Designing an accurate, correct and inclusive Bill of Rights is undoubtedly important. However, it is equally important the whole of the constitution is \u201chuman rights friendly\u201d. Rights and social justice are unlikely to be respected or promoted if enormous powers are concentrated in the executive, if the government is not sufficiently accountable, if elections are not free and fair, and if the judges can be easily bought over or are willing to take instructions from the executive. We must examine electoral systems to assess what kind of people and from which communities these people are likely to be elected.17 We must also consider whether an emphasis on culture may jeopardise the rights of women, children, disabled or \u201clow caste\u201d persons. And we must ask whether there is too much emphasis on some rights (e.g., property, market or contract) that restrict affirmative action or other measures necessary for equity and social justice. In colonial societies, the state was exclusionary, built on racial and ethnic distinctions, with a stronger bureaucracy for this reason. The bureaucracy was rooted in the imperative of the dominance of the various societies that made up the colony, the close relationship between the colonial administration and the foreign, business community (and consequent economic disparities), and its resistance to democracy. It is this tradition rather than any adaptation to independence or democracy marking the present reality. This system was buttressed by a battery of repressive laws and a repressive legal system, which survived the colonial era and continues to constantly undermine new democratic constitutions. These characteristics ensured independence would not bring about social transformation, but merely partial replacement of the old local ruling elite, politicians as well bureaucrats, who found the colonial repressive apparatus highly functional. Restructuring the post-colonial state How far can the constitution restructure the post-colonial state (which has survived in many developing countries), eliminating its negative, destructive tendencies by introducing values and structures to promote fair and balanced development? We would suggest that, outside the formal human rights provisions, the following options can help steer the constitution and the nation in the direction of full realisation. 17 In 1997 the Indigenous Peoples of Ecuador, having previously concentrated on getting recognition of their rights moved on to include demands for institutional change in the constitution; many other groups have experienced similar frustration with rights alone. 28 Constitutionalising Socio-economic Rights: A Lifeline for the Millennium Spirit \u2022\ufffd The constitution should set out a broad framework of values and principles forming the vision of the country to be scrupulously observed in the exercise of state powers (this may be in the Preamble, and in other statements of principle) \u2022\ufffd Democracy must be viewed, and reflected in the constitution, as being more than periodic (and often rigged) elections. Relevant provisions to ensure full, inclusive, participatory and meaningful democracy may be: \u2013 an inclusive definition of citizenship \u2013 a fair electoral system \u2013 regulation of political parties for integrity, and internal democracy \u2013 separation of powers \u2013 effective accountability mechanisms, tailored to ensure all organs of the state are appropriately held to account (including the auditor-general or audit court, ombudsman and other complaints bodies, human rights commissions etc) \u2013 procedures for parliament giving people adequate opportunities to understand and comment on proposed laws and other matters \u2013 including making new trea- ties and policies \u2013 the decentralisation of government (which may mean local government or more radical systems) enabling greater participation of people in public affairs \u2013 a role for civil society organisations in public affairs \u2013 provisions ensuring inclusion of all sectors of society in public bodies, including the military.

There are many ways the constitution can prevent or mitigate conflict. Inclusive and participatory democracy as defined above is critical. We have indicated some principles for bringing about this type of democracy. Social justice (including affirmative action) is primary, since conflict is primarily about resources. Special attention should be paid to group identity, languages, and religion. There should be respect for cultural differences. The precise mechanisms would depend on circumstances and historical context. Some electoral systems are more hospitable to representation of minorities, and participation can be secured through forms of consultation, modes of decision making in government and legislature, power sharing, proportionality, and self-government, particularly through federalism or devolution. The kind of constitutions being discussed are people centred, oriented towards the MDGs and social justice. It is especially important to redress the balance between politicians or elites on one hand and people on the other. What is required is genuine empowerment of people, promoting awareness of public issues and procedures, the role of public institutions, familiarity with constitutional rights, mechanisms to protect and mobilize them, and institutions and opportunities to express views and demand accountability. We have suggested the constitution should provide effective entry points for civil society initiatives. Civil society institutions could bring legal actions on behalf of the disadvantaged and the voiceless. They could work with state institutions to establish standards and benchmarks for social progress and justice. Civil society institutions could Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 29 mobilise people to take advantage of provisions for public participation. They could inform and educate on constitutional issues or play a critical role reporting to regional and international bodies on fulfilment of a country\u2019s international obligations, particularly in regards to human rights. Ultimately, the people have to be guardians of the constitution. To perform this role the people must: \u2022\ufffd understand the constitution and know their rights \u2022\ufffd know how to use the machinery of the constitution and the law to hold public authorities accountable \u2022\ufffd be involved in the conduct of public affairs \u2022\ufffd act as agents of accountability: for example by \u2013 providing alternative budgets or analysing draft state budgets \u2013 publishing annual assessments of the record of government and corporations of human rights, social justice, environment and natural resource policies, etc \u2013 providing alternative reports (often known as \u201cshadow reports\u201d to regional and international human rights supervising bodies on the national record \u2013 undertaking constitutional litigation to prevent the state or private interests from breaching the constitution or law. Active citizenry and consciousness of civic virtues are essential for sustaining democracy. Decentralisation is an important tool \u2013 though it must be well designed or it simply decentralises the problems at the centre including corruption. Various forms of direct democracy are found \u2013 as with referendums and popular initiatives (as in Switzerland and California), which have their own problems, not least of which is expense, as well as petitions and other participatory mechanisms. Ultimately, participation is important because it transfers influence and power to groups who are often left out of traditional forms of democracy. If we believe genuine democracy is essential to diverting resources to the needs of the poor, then participation becomes central to the strategy of reaching the MDGs. The fortunes of a constitution are shaped by many factors: personalities and elites, political parties and other organisations, social structures, economic changes, and traditions of constitutionalism. Constitutionalism cannot be willed; it must be established by deep commitment and sustained activity. The constitution cannot achieve anything by itself: like Marx\u2019s commodities, it does not have arms and legs. It must be mobilized, acted upon, used, etc. A constitution does not work, it is worked. The real task of establishing constitutionalism therefore lies in other spheres: politics, the judiciary, the rise of professionalism in public affairs, civic associations, and enlightened leadership. Inadequate attention has been paid to these obstacles, as opposed to societal obstacles, because it is assumed that the constitution has the primary function of designing and structuring the state. However, as previously mentioned, it may structure institutions, but may also fail to infuse them with values and principles. The constitution tends to structure 30 Constitutionalising Socio-economic Rights: A Lifeline for the Millennium Spirit macro institutions but often says little about values and procedures of the administration of the state (which may persist from one constitution to another).

Conclusion Fundamentally, implementing a constitution is not about particular provisions, or even the totality of the constitution, important as these are. It is about the inculcation of a culture of respect for and discipline of the law, acceptance of rulings by the courts and other bodies authorised to interpret the law, giving effect to judicial decisions, acceptance of the limits on government, respecting and promoting human and collective rights as well as participation and empowerment of the people. This is a long term project, anticipated to be strengthened and sustained by the emergence of socio-economic goals, giving expression to the MDGs, bringing the domain of the constitution new constituencies hitherto excluded from its benefits.

Background: Why social protection? The Asia Pacific region has some of the fastest growing economies. Yet according to the Economic and Social Commission of the Asia and Pacific (ESCAP), the region also has nearly a billion people living in poverty whose means of livelihoods \u2018rest on a fragile economic and social foundation\u2019.18 They have \u2018uncertain income, few assets, limited social networks, no access to political processes\u201919 and are particularly vulnerable to different shocks such as illness, disability and unemployment that could quickly push them into extreme poverty. In times of stress, they fall back on coping mechanisms which in the long term significantly undermines their ability to escape poverty. Hence, this perpetuates poverty throughout generations. Such coping measures include withdrawing children from school to work, decreasing the number of meals, and selling assets including livestock and land. In the Asia Pacific, vulnerability has increased through a series of recent crises including fuel, financial and food crises and new challenges of rapid urbanization. Other crises include the HIV endemic worldwide. While the rates are lower in Asian Pacific countries (less than one percent of the adult population) it is much higher amongst those communities already discriminated against, marginalized20 and thereby likely to be living in difficult circumstances. Moreover, socio-economic impact studies by UNDP in the region show that people living with HIV and their households are chronically burdened by illnesses, loss of employment and income, rising medical expenses and depletion of savings or other resources in their efforts to cope with and mitigate the situation.21 Women have been particularly affected by these crises and are especially vulnerable to poverty. They tend to be disproportionately represented in the informal economy and thus have less access than men to many contributory social insurance benefits, 18 See The Promise of Protection: social protection and development in Asia and the Pacific, UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific 2011 P iv 19 See The Promise of Protection: social protection and development in Asia and the Pacific, UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific 2011, P iv 20 See contribution to UNDP e-discussion Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes by Pramod Kumar and Kazuyuki Uji, HIV, Health and Development Team, UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 21 September 2011. 21 See contribution to UNDP e-discussion Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes by Pramod Kumar and Kazuyuki Uji, HIV, Health and Development Team, UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 21 September 2011. 32 Ways and Means of Ensuring Social Protection Helps Realize Economic and Social Rights and Achieve the MDGs such as pensions, unemployment insurance and sickness benefits. Furthermore, due to lower levels of education, less control over productive resources and access to different supportive networks, women have weaker negotiating positions than men and fewer chances of finding other income-generating activities. An Asian Development Bank (ADB) Report notes that in the Greater Mekong Subregion (Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam), there are indications that female workers may have been better positioned to weather short term economic slowdowns. However, female workers in the region tend to be less skilled, earn lower wages and many are already coping with poor housing, limited access to health care, and having to put up with harassment both in and outside the workplace.22 This can leave them resorting to even more harmful coping strategies.

While the term social protection can be applied to many different programmes and policies, in essence it is \u2018a set of public measures that support society\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable members and helps individuals, households and communities better manage risks\u2019 across their life cycle.24 Its two main components are social insurance (contributory insurance schemes providing pre-specified support for affiliated members) and social assistance (initiatives providing both cash and in kind assistance to those living in extreme poverty).25 ESCAP notes that the Asia Pacific region has a long history implementing social protection programmes, particularly in light of the Asian financial crisis of 1998 and natural disasters. Given the diversity of States across the Asia Pacific region, there is an array of different schemes implemented with varying degrees of sophistication or success. These include cash transfer schemes, school stipends, social pensions, food vouchers, food transfers, income guarantee schemes such as public works or employment guarantee schemes, user fee exemptions for health care or education or subsidized services.26 India has used public works as a tool of social protection for many years. In 1979, following an extended drought in a semi-arid region, the Maharastra Employment Guarantee Scheme was established. It 22 See McGill, E., Gender-related Impacts of the Global Economic Slowdown in the Greater Mekong Subregion: Emerging trends and issues, Asian Development Bank Consultant\u2019s Report. 23 See McGill, E., Gender-related Impacts of the Global Economic Slowdown in the Greater Mekong Subregion: Emerging trends and issues, Asian Development Bank Consultant\u2019s Report 24 See The contribution of social protection to the Millennium Development Goals, World Bank 25 See Report of the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty to the 65th session of the General Assembly, A/65/259, 9 August 2010. In 2001 the UN Secretary General also recognises the two main sub categories of social protection as social assistance and social insurance. See Enhancing Social Protection and Reducing Vulnerability in a Globalizing World 7 December 2000 26 See Report of the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty to the 65th session of the General Assembly, A/65/259, 9 August 2010 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 33 guaranteed every adult a job provided the person was willing to do unskilled manual work on a fix piece-rate basis, amounting to the minimum wage.27 Social protection programmes can contribute to the achievement of economic, social and cultural rights as well as the MDGs. The World Bank has noted fee waivers for health and education may help achieve MDG1 by allowing families to obtain crucial services without impoverishing themselves.28 In rural Brazil old-age pensions paid to grandmothers to ensure the right to social security and an adequate standard of living have helped increase girls school attendance.29 2. Social protection: Development strategy or human rights obligation Social protection is often treated as a policy option. However, while it can be part of States\u2019 general development strategies, establishing effective social protection programmes should be first and foremost a human rights obligation of States, both as a right in itself and as a key means of realizing other rights. Article 9 of the ICESCR stipulates the right to social security. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR)30 further defines this as including social insurance and social assistance,31 both of which are main components of social protection.32 Social 27 See The Maharastra Employment Guarantee Scheme, Policy Brief 6, Overseas Development Institute, February 2006 28 See The contribution of social protection to the Millennium Development Goals, World Bank. 29 See The Promise of Protection: social protection and development in Asia and the Pacific, UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 2011. 30 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). When States ratify the ICESCR they recognise the competence of CESCR to carry out its mandate. 31 The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stipulates that everyone has the right to social security which includes social insurance and social assistance. Several International Labour Organization conventions and declarations also recognize the right to social security, including the Declaration concerning the aims and purposes of the International Labour Organization, to pursue \u201cthe extension of social security measures to provide a basic income to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0f2baad-ff65-4e4e-be50-697cb5f122a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0f2baad-ff65-4e4e-be50-697cb5f122a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "544bcfb853f6eddf4ddf04d71ca7e8d45512bd1d5e469ca71d4147d3b0cf6704"}}, "hash": "544bcfb853f6eddf4ddf04d71ca7e8d45512bd1d5e469ca71d4147d3b0cf6704", "text": "all in need of such protection and comprehensive medical care\u201d.

Convention No. 102 establishes worldwide agreed minimum standards for all nine branches of social security: medical care, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, old-age benefit, employment injury benefit, family benefit, maternity benefit, invalidity benefit and survivors\u2019 benefit. 32 As highlighted earlier both the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty and the Secretary-General recognise that social protection is made up of both social insurance and social protection See Report of the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty to the 65th session of the General Assembly, A/65/259, 9 August 2010, and the report of the UN Secretary-General Enhancing Social Protection and Reducing Vulnerability in a Globalizing World, 7 December 2000 34 Ways and Means of Ensuring Social Protection Helps Realize Economic and Social Rights and Achieve the MDGs protection is also a key means of realizing the non-derogable minimum core essential levels of other economic and social rights such as the right to education, an adequate standard of living, and health amongst others.33 While regular cash transfers can help people living in poverty access credit, promote savings and enable them to invest, they should not be operated with only that in mind. As a means of reducing poverty and realising human rights the primary focus should be on reaching the most vulnerable and marginalised who are most likely to be below a States\u2019 radar and often difficult to identify and reach. While social protection schemes must be distinguished from general development efforts by the state, they are not mutually exclusive. Social protection schemes must be complemented by better provision of basic services, such as water and sanitation, public health facilities and education systems. For example, given the likely expense for older persons on health care and medicines to account for as much as three quarters of the income of the poorest groups, the positive impact of social protection initiatives on older persons\u2019 standards of living can be nullified by the burden posed by health-care-related costs which may push them back into extreme poverty and a life without dignity.34 3. Social protection: applying a rights based approach To comply with international human rights law, social protection programmes must reach and protect those in need. Moreover, they must do no harm. Although seeking to protect, social protection programmes can often exacerbate inequalities by only being accessible to those who live in particular areas, or they can stigmatize certain groups of persons such as the unemployed or those who are HIV positive, and add to their exclusion. When implementing social protection programmes States must therefore take steps to ensure that they do not exacerbate existing insecurities, vulnerabilities and discriminatory and negative stereotyping. Social protection programmes must recognise that poverty is not just about a lack of income but interrelated and interlocking patterns of discrimination, deprivations and vulnerability that a simplistic income approach largely overlooks. Given that social protection programmes are implemented in a variety of distinct social, economic, political and cultural contexts, none more so than within the Asia Pacific region, it is impossible to provide a template for social protection policies or programmes. The 33 Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights State parties have \u2018a minimum core obligation to ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least, minimum essential levels of each of the rights. Under this minimum core obligation, a state party in which any significant number of individuals is deprived of essential foodstuffs of essential primary health care, of basic shelter and housing, or of the most basic forms of education is prima facie failing to discharge its obligations under the covenant. If State parties can\u2019t do this due to insufficient resources they must clearly demonstrate that this is the case and seek international assistance. See CESCR General Comment 3 The nature of States parties obligations (Art. 2, par.1), 14 December 1999. 34 See J. Randel et al.

A human rights approach to social protection requires: A. Ensuring an adequate legal and institutional framework for social protection Social protection programmes must be established and protected by an adequate national legal and institutional framework. This helps prevent manipulation by political and economic elites and guarantees the long-term involvement of State authorities in all stages of the programme, regardless of political change. The legal framework must also give rights-holders the possibility to claim protection of their right. The CESCR recognises the need to embed \u2018social protection into a framework of legally binding and enforceable rights and obligations\u2019 which enables beneficiaries of social protection to become \u201crights- holders\u201d who can make claims against the State. Similarly, States and development partners become \u201cduty-bearers\u201d responsible for allocating resources to social protection in a manner that reflects human rights principles.35 Clear legal and institutional frameworks also clarify the various roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders. In order for legal and institutional frameworks to comply with core human rights principles, they should spell out eligibility requirements, provide for mechanisms to ensure transparency and access to information about programmes, define the various roles and responsibilities of all those involved in implementing the programme (e.g. Governments at the national and local levels, international organizations and civil society organizations), and establish accessible complaints mechanisms. B. Respecting the principles of equality and non-discrimination Non-discrimination and equality are key principles under international human rights law. States are obligated to not only ensure equality and non-discrimination as a right but also to ensure social protection is provided and guaranteed in a manner that neither directly nor indirectly discriminates against those in need. The concept of de facto equality thus requires both human rights and development practitioners to go beyond establishing formal equality through law to examining what the causes of inequality are and how they can be remedied. For instance, practitioners need to identify what would prevent certain groups of persons such as persons with disabilities, older persons, and different racial and ethnic minorities, from being able to access qualitative social protection and take the appropriate action to remedy the situation. 35 See Presentation by Dr Magdalena Sep\u00falveda, the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty on 17-18 March In Santiago, Chile at an Expert Workshop on Conditional Cash Transfers: from a Human Rights Approach Available at http://www.rlc.fao.org/iniciativa/expertos/documentos/trabajo/ dt5.pdf. 36 Ways and Means of Ensuring Social Protection Helps Realize Economic and Social Rights and Achieve the MDGs This principle has implications for development practitioners deciding on different technicalities currently under much debate such as targeting versus universalism, the use of conditionalities, and questions of accessibility.36 Each of these requires designing social protection programmes using substantive equality and non-discrimination to ensure the approach chosen does not impede those in need from gaining necessary social protection. i) Targeting versus universalism: Ensuring nobody is unfairly excluded The question of universality versus targeting has experienced much debate with States often arguing that they lack the resources to implement a universal system. From a human rights perspective, universal systems comply with States\u2019 duty to protect persons against risks and vulnerabilities in an equal and non-discriminatory manner. They also clearly reduce opportunities for corruption and manipulation as well as possible stigmatization. However, as the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty has frequently noted in principle, human rights standards are not compromised by the use of targeted schemes providing they prioritise and reach the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups within a longer-term strategy of progressively ensuring universal protection.37 However, targeting those in need is easier said than done. The principles of substantive non-discrimination and equality require that you cannot exclude those who are in need either directly or indirectly (exclusion errors). To minimise this risk as much as possible, below are some of the interrelated questions that must be addressed when designing targeted social protection mechanisms. a) Who and how do you target? Who you target depends on the aim of the social protection programme. From a human rights perspective, social protection programmes should target the most vulnerable and disadvantaged. Going further and specifying exactly who should benefit can be more difficult. It is often difficult to identify and reach the worst off or the most vulnerable and marginalised since they are often living below the radar of the State.38 How do you measure those who are most vulnerable? How do you measure the different strata of poverty? Do you just measure income levels?

Moreover, what happens in situations of prevalent poverty when everyone is living in extreme poverty, making distinctions between different strata is somewhat futile. In these cases, targeting is not 36 This uses and builds on the work of the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty. See Presentation by Dr Magdalena Sep\u00falveda, the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty on 17-18 March in Santiago, Chile at an Expert Workshop on Conditional Cash Transfers: from a Human Rights Approach Available at http://www.rlc.fao.org/iniciativa/expertos/documentos/trabajo/dt5.pdf 37 This has also been recognised by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Committee for instance called on Jamaica in striving for universal coverage of social security system in Jamaica, to give priority to disadvantaged and marginalized groups in society See E/C.12/1/ADD.75 (CESCR, 2001) 38 See The Promise of Protection: social protection and development in Asia and the Pacific, UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific 2011 page 56 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 37 necessarily a cheap option. Complex administrative processes will be needed to identify the lowest strata and persons in need will almost certainly be excluded. Another question is whether to target households or individuals. At first glance it may seem easier and logical to target households, but gender dynamics and traditional marginalisation within households may mean that some household members are particularly marginalised and in need of assistance even if the household itself is considered fairly affluent. An example of this is the situation of women and in particular, older women and widows. People designing social protection programmes thus need to consider carefully the targeting mechanism, making sure it does not indirectly or directly screen out those in need. Using the wrong method can often create more possibilities for corruption and exclusion errors. One recommendation is to avoid overcomplication. As the Independent Expert has noted \u2018the more complicated the method of calculation (such as proxy means testing), the more opaque the eligibility criteria become and the harder it is for the intended beneficiaries to scrutinize the process\u2019.39 Moreover, the more complicated the criteria the more expensive the administrative system will be, which in turn erodes much of the \u2018lack of resources\u2019 argument for implementing a targeted system in the first place. While community targeting methods can help avoid exclusion errors by drawing on local knowledge, it risks reiterating and strengthening local power structures and asymmetries, which could include feudal structures, caste hierarchies and patriarchal societies.40 This could result in the exclusion of women, lower caste communities such as Dalits and persons with disabilities amongst others.41 To illustrate problems previously mentioned, the Primary Education Stipend Project (PESP) in Bangladesh, which provides a conditional income transfer to poor rural households for keeping children in primary education, is estimated to have only reached 40% of its target group. This is due to problems in eligibility requirements (NGO schools are not included) and corruption in the management and administration of the programme.42 b) How do you avoid stigmatisation? Where social protection programmes are targeted there is also a greater risk of stigmatisation adding further to the marginalisation and exclusion of persons living in extreme poverty. This stigmatisation could be on the grounds of poverty itself or other qualifying elements such as HIV status. One way of reducing possible stigmatisation is 39 See Presentation by Dr Magdalena Sep\u00falveda, the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty on 17-18 March In Santiago, Chile at an Expert Workshop on Conditional Cash Transfers: from a Human Rights Approach Available at http://www.rlc.fao.org/iniciativa/expertos/documentos/trabajo/dt5.pdf 40 See for instance See Davies, M., DFID Social transfers evaluation summary report, Institute of Development Studies, centre for Social Protection, July 2009, p6. 41 Davies notes that community-based targeting, as employed by social transfer schemes in Malawi, resulted in the exclusion of socially marginalised women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7627dfb3-2a9f-43f3-8e7d-2eee87a4fe73": {"__data__": {"id_": "7627dfb3-2a9f-43f3-8e7d-2eee87a4fe73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1ce455115cb10c2d333ab7508f4ab5d9593e60db8909f67b5fe2469c01feb8a"}, "2": {"node_id": "456641cf-644c-46c0-bcef-2cb10ae0dcf0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "318c1ab83ffb9c740cfe18cb8cb96db5ce34cab10e9bad6d1ee3e8175d7badb6"}}, "hash": "cb7d203f30c9f48ff50cc64449d721efdb0b5cf97e35271ab1e627a6555debbb", "text": "See Davies, M., DFID Social transfers evaluation summary report, Institute of Development Studies, centre for Social Protection, July 2009, p9 42 See Barrientos, A, Nino-Zaraxua, M., and Maitrot, M., Social Assistance in Developing Countries Database, Brooks World Poverty Institute, The University of Manchester, July 2010, P 55 38 Ways and Means of Ensuring Social Protection Helps Realize Economic and Social Rights and Achieve the MDGs avoiding the use of explicit labels when targeting and preserving confidentiality with sensitive information.

In most states in India, AIDS-widows do not qualify for benefits because of the high age ceiling. AIDS-widows tend to be much younger.43 Social protection systems designed to benefit those affected by HIV/AIDs must also ensure confidentiality since because in many countries HIV is still highly stigmatized and public disclosure of being HIV positive could result in physical violence, loss of livelihood or forced relocation.44 By lowering the age limit, Rajastan ensures HIV/AIDS widows (whether they are themselves HIV positive or not) are covered without being explicitly targeted, thus lowering the risk of stigmatization. ii) Conditionalities versus free access: Ensure that conditionalities do not exclude and further expose those who fail to comply45 Another issue experiencing considerable debate is the question of imposing conditionalities, which is predominantly done in regard to cash transfer programmes. Conditionalities usually require beneficiaries to fulfil several criteria such as sending children to school, joining nutrition programmes or making use of health services. ESCAP notes that \u2018following a number of success stories from Latin America, conditional cash transfers have become increasingly popular in Asia and the Pacific.\u201946 For example, Indonesia has a \u2018Family Hope Programme\u2019 that distributes conditional cash transfers to households living in poverty with children aged 15 years and below, children under 18 years of age who have not yet completed primary school, and pregnant or lactating mothers. To qualify for the funds, \u2018pregnant women must have four prenatal visits, take iron tablets and have their deliveries assisted by trained health professionals. They are also encouraged to make two post natal care visits\u2019. Other conditions include the growth of children being regularly monitored, children under six being fully immunized and all children aged six to 12 be enrolled in primary school with an attendance rate of at least 43 See contribution to UNDP e-discussion Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes by Pramod Kumar and Kazuyuki Uji, HIV, Health and Development Team, UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 21 September 2011. 44 See contribution to UNDP e-discussion Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes by Pramod Kumar and Kazuyuki Uji, HIV, Health and Development Team, UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 21 September 2011. 45 See Presentation by Dr Magdalena Sep\u00falveda, the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty on 17-18 March In Santiago, Chile at an Expert Workshop on Conditional Cash Transfers: from a Human Rights Approach Available at http://www.rlc.fao.org/iniciativa/expertos/documentos/trabajo/ dt5.pdf 46 See The Promise of Protection: social protection and development in Asia and the Pacific, UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific 2011 p40 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 39 85%.47 If a beneficiary fails to comply with any of these conditions, the cash transfers may be decreased and suspended after three months.48 Conditionalities are often perceived as justified and necessary by development practitioners to ensure compliance with national norms, and are also considered a useful incentive to adopt certain behaviour seen as a prerequisite for the attainment of development goals. However, the concept of conditionalities does not sit happily with a human rights approach. It can be seen as undermining the agency of a person, and can essentially condition basic entitlements on \u2018good behaviour\u2019, such as the right to an adequate standard of living, health and education. Given this, development practitioners must be extremely careful when designing conditionalities for social protection programmes. At the very least, practitioners must evaluate whether unfairaly imposed conditionalities imposed unfairly exclude or punish already disadvantaged or marginalised persons, or exacerbate existing inequalities.49 In Bangladesh, for instance, conditionalities of obtaining good school results have been observed as favouring children from wealthier families with stronger support at home.50 It is also difficult for the targeted individual to access necessary health care facilities for regular check-ups required by the programme due to remoteness or time constraints, contributing to unfair or exclusionary practices. In Indonesia given the wide disparities in the provision and accessibility of health and education service between urban and rural areas, the conditionalities imposed have been observed as disproportionately affecting those living in rural areas.51 Often conditionalities can create unnecessary additional burdens on women who, as typically the main care provider, are usually responsible for fulfilling them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1bcfc4de-ba9c-4242-8d99-7c94bb26f983": {"__data__": {"id_": "1bcfc4de-ba9c-4242-8d99-7c94bb26f983", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28cdb9f2cd19c269d1f7c31ca3d56f0801d28f82089d2d1c0bdb9e52ce5b14b0"}, "2": {"node_id": "58d1e500-1fbc-4909-a66b-45cee104bcbf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f6c4e0d65c71579756d6202516b57f691fcdb7a75d4589b9b0883e68d22c3b3"}}, "hash": "1a6ea6d7514457700ef87e8908f75bd96d23548c27eb4ac7c156c85c9e6e3afa", "text": "Another factor is the heavy time burdens of persons living in poverty.

It is not always possible for officials at the national level to understand the local context. This could stem from geographic or physical problems accessing certain public institutions, such as health clinics or schools, or from difficulties members of certain groups face when attending schools such as being made to stand at the back of the class, as is the case with Dalit children in many remote regions of south Asia. There may be other problems such as lack of separate toilets in schools for girls, which discourage girls from attending schools; a problem only local officials may be aware of. Finally, conditionalities must be accompanied by avenues and mechanisms in place to challenge any alleged non-compliance with the conditions53 both for individual redress and as a means of reviewing the programme, ensuring mistakes are not repeated thereby allowing for improvement. Such mechanisms and avenues must be culturally, financially and physically accessible54 for those in need and respect basic human core principles ensuring justice is delivered.55 In accordance with international human rights law, States are obligated to ensure a minimum core content of economic, social and cultural rights. Under no circumstances should benefits be terminated or reduced below the level necessary to ensure that a person can access the minimum essential levels of food, water, healthcare, housing and education. This is regardless of compliance with conditionalities.56 iii) Complying with the standards of accessibility The principle of substantive equality and non-discrimination requires States to ensure that qualitative social protection benefits are physically, culturally, and financially accessible and available to all, especially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups of society. Even if something is formally universal, some persons may be directly or indirectly denied access through distance, administrative reasons, a lack of awareness and/or assistance not being culturally acceptable. For example, while public works schemes have been praised for being self-targeting through design in ways that only the most poor and vulnerable are interested in, they have also been criticised for indirectly excluding certain groups through their emphasis on physical work. This has been noted regarding the public works scheme in Nepal \u2018Rural Access Programme\u2019. Concerns have also been raised that the labour requirement \u2018places unreasonable demands\u2019 on people living in poverty that are often already \u2018time constrained\u2019 or \u2018labour constrained\u2019 i.e. persons with disabilities.57 53 This has been repeatedly recognised by the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty (now Social Rapporteur) and the CESCR.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fab82e3-f2b2-4d92-9f1d-3d8ebd2ecc70": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fab82e3-f2b2-4d92-9f1d-3d8ebd2ecc70", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0cb2ac8feceb81ac109e6c7ae77c5c2995bbffd00726896ec055b7d514e78070"}, "2": {"node_id": "a965fde4-2760-474f-910e-323e77b43ef7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d8fbcc56bfbea716c80aadcfa87e287be4d2a8102793da27deb5296ff6c6ae8"}}, "hash": "a9a5d240d68b63485ac0b8200430d640d602f904d6854dfc33b4f080f3394639", "text": "54 This is dealt with more comprehensibly in the following section entitled \u2018complying with the standards of accessibility\u2019 55 This is dealt with more comprehensibly in the section entitled \u2018accountability and access to justice\u2019 56 See Human Rights Law Resource Centre, Observations on the Draft General Comment on the Right to Social Security 29 June 2006 57 See Davies, M., Department For International Development, Social transfers evaluation summary report, Institute of Development Studies, Centre for Social Protection, July 2009, p6.

Usually, the most vulnerable people live in remote areas lacking infrastructure or poorly resourced urban areas without transport links. Moreover, many groups might have limited mobility such as the disabled and older persons. Women may also face protection concerns and possibility of abuse while travelling. Particular attention should be paid to the opportunity cost (loss of earnings or caretaker time) of spending disproportionate amount of time accessing the benefit or service. States must take this into account when designing social protection programmes. The Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty recommended that \u2018States must ensure that benefits are distributed within safe physical reach and at a reasonably convenient geographic location.\u201958 This includes ensuring adequate transportation is available to communities living in extreme poverty, thereby reducing travel time to services.59 The principle of ensuring physical accessibility also requires ensuring that persons in need are covered by other social protection if they are unable to attend physical labour intensive public works programmes due to disability or any other factor. b) Are social protection programmes administratively accessible to those in need? Persons must be able to administratively access social protection. This requires designers of social protection programmes to bear in mind problems vulnerable and marginalised persons might have in, for example, understanding complicated registration processes. They must similarly be mindful of the problems of states with weak registration systems where many people may not hold birth certificates and older people, despite being in particular need, are less likely than other age groups to possess any legal records of their age or identity.60 Through discriminatory practices, women may be additionally burdened by a lack of access to land ownership, formal employment and other opportunities to obtain official documents.61 In Thailand, studies observed Muslims and people from hill 58 See Presentation by Dr Magdalena Sep\u00falveda, the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty on 17-18 March in Santiago, Chile at an Expert Workshop on Conditional Cash Transfers: from a Human Rights Approach Available at http://www.rlc.fao.org/iniciativa/expertos/documentos/trabajo/ dt5.pdf 59 See Report of the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, Magdalena Sep\u00falveda Carmona, on the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights, A/HRC/15/41, 6 August 2010 60 See The right to social security in old age: bridging the implementation gap, Helpage International, August 2011.

In some cases, the State should actively implement a registration system where people living in poverty are able to access and register. This might require innovative solutions, such as mobile registration systems available to those in need. Similarly for social pensions, innovative solutions could be used to solve problems of age verification. In Nepal for instance, the government allowed citizenship cards to be issued based on a calculation of age associated with horoscopes, which the majority of older persons had in their possession.63 c) Are those in need able to financially access social protection programmes? Social protection systems must be affordable for those in need. This includes both direct and indirect costs. While the Female Secondary/High School Stipend Program in Bangladesh has been praised for achieving gender parity in school enrolment, studies have noted that by not covering all costs (uniform, books etc) it excludes many of the most vulnerable and marginalised households.64 The question of affordability means that governments cannot solely rely on contributory systems.

People living in extreme poverty and in need of social protection are unaware of their rights and their legal entitlements which creates potential for elite capture. Through more limited access to quality education, those living in extreme poverty are more likely to have problems reading and writing and are therefore unable to gain the necessary information through newspapers or written public notices. They may also face linguistic barriers including only being able to speak local rather than national languages and/or problems understanding a more formal language. They will also undoubtedly have limited access to media such as television. To fully achieve transparency and access to information, States must understand the capabilities and resources of recipients such as limited education and economic resources, geographical remoteness and physical and mental disability. They must also use the appropriate way of reaching out to the disadvantaged. Questions to consider when designing outreach strategies include: are the images and language used in program information materials culturally sensitive and inclusive? Do language barriers exist in the available information or between staff and potential clients? Are beneficiaries able to understand the more formal language of state administrative processes? Does the program employ members of the targeted group for outreach and intake activities? Is the type of benefit culturally appropriate?67 Different outreach tools that have been effective include radio, community workshops and plays. C. Ensuring gender equality and the advancement of women Social protection programmes must take into account the fact that \u201cpoverty is not gender- neutral\u201d. Discrimination and gender inequality ensure that women and girls are more vulnerable to living in poverty and, once living in poverty, suffer disproportionate risk and vulnerability. For instance when shocks are confronted, gender bias within the household may lead to the allocation of fewer resources (such as food) to women or the selling of female-owned assets as an initial coping strategy. Moreover, women\u2019s heavy and unpaid care work load may leave them with less time to gain an income and often leads women to disproportionately suffer the impact of public spending cuts on essential services. There is evidence that social protection measures enhance the economic power of women by giving them control over resources. Income security helps women\u2019s position in communities as well. Moreover, channelling social protection to women may amplify the impact of certain schemes reaching children or older persons. In Indonesia, the Family Hope Programme of conditional cash transfers targets the woman in a household as caregiver. It is expected that the money is more likely to be spent on goods and services 67 For more information see For Protection and Promotion: the design and implementation of effective safety nets World Bank 2008. 44 Ways and Means of Ensuring Social Protection Helps Realize Economic and Social Rights and Achieve the MDGs that promote a child\u2019s wellbeing.68 Yet, rather than advancing women and contributing to gender equality, the Independent Expert warned, however, that some social protection schemes, \u2018if badly designed, can exacerbate or contribute to inequalities\u201969 by reinforcing patterns of gender discrimination and negative stereotyping. This may be the case even for social protection programmes that explicitly target women, such as cash transfers or asset transfer schemes and public works schemes. As has already been discussed, conditional cash transfers, in which women are given full responsibility for meeting conditions such as school attendance or compulsory medical check-ups, can reinforce women\u2019s care-provider roles, increase their time burden, and/or open up possibilities for abuse if conditionalities are not met.70 There is also potential for conflict and/or abuse if social protection programmes are perceived as challenging traditional roles for women and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfaf1ee0-1670-4b60-ab02-f02ae2a19c68": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfaf1ee0-1670-4b60-ab02-f02ae2a19c68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff112546776fb3a142a34dc87ce744b84fba798821906bf14b0f49600ba8482c"}, "3": {"node_id": "402fdeae-d40d-4030-8ca0-74faa140f7e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4dd637e0f2f5c4218108644b4b8f0ecb98b09bdc8774db3fd796901e6bb9fe3e"}}, "hash": "f0f01cb785ab97e94d0f681fb77e89e8a72b0f65c99ae98dc97df4d1f4bdf283", "text": "breaking up households. It has been noted that delivering benefits directly to women could lead to intra-household disputes and increase gender violence against women.71 States must conduct comprehensive and disaggregated gender analyses assessing the vulnerabilities of both genders as potential beneficiaries throughout their lifecycle taking into account urban/rural/regional/ethnic variations and design social protection schemes accordingly.72 Policymakers should invest in capacity-building to ensure individuals implementing social programmes at both the national and local level are aware of gender issues related to social protection. In recognising but not reinforcing negative stereotypes and discriminatory patterns, social protection should also be accompanied by complementary services such as child care support and/or job training. One example of this is the Employment Guarantee Scheme in the state of Maharashta, India. This not only guarantees employment within eight miles of participants\u2019 villages but also provides childcare facilities on site.73 Finally, gender sensitive social protection programmes should be accompanied by activities supporting women\u2019s organisation and awareness raising. Since access to education is usually more limited for women living in extreme poverty, women are less likely to know about their rights and usually lack adequate capacity to assert their rights. 68 See contribution to UNDP e-discussion Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes by Ms Vita Febriany from the SMERU Research Institute, Jakarta, Indonesia, 12 September 2011. 69 See Report of the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty to the 65th session of the General Assembly, A/65/259, 9 August 2010 p16. 70 Ibid 71 See Davies, M., DFID Social transfers evaluation summary report, Institute of Development Studies, Centre for Social Protection, July 2009, p9 72 See Report of the Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty to the 65th session of the General Assembly, A/65/259, 9 August 2010 73 See Thakur, S.

Accountability and access to justice According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \u2018everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted to him by the constitution or by law.\u201974 The remedy should include compensation and reparation to fully remedy harm suffered by the victim. Securing justice also includes ensuring accountability i.e. holding perpetrators accountable with a penalty proportionate to the crime and ensuring its non-repetition. The right to remedy has been formally codified in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) with Article 2(3) committing states to ensuring: \u2018that any person whose rights or freedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective remedy\u2019 This principle holds for the right to social security and protection. Under this principle, States must provide accountability and redress mechanisms that build on the legal guarantee of this right. States must also protect persons whose right to social protection (social security) has been undermined or threatened. In addition to providing individual redress, accountability systems can provide a means of \u2018correcting systematic failure to prevent future harm\u2019 by essentially determining \u2018what is working (so it can be repeated) and what is not (so it can be adjusted)\u201975 As the Independent Expert has repeatedly emphasized, \u2018without accountability and redress mechanisms social protection programmes are less likely to be understood in terms of entitlements or rights and are more likely to be viewed as instruments of clientelism that can be manipulated by political actors.\u201976 Providing accountability mechanisms is thus more than a normative requirement by human rights law, it is vital to ensure the programme meets its objectives and protects those in need. Accountability systems could include but not be excluded to formal state monitoring and legal mechanisms, informal mechanisms run by and at the community level, or wider political accountability through ensuring good governance and an active civil society. In India social audits have been established to monitor the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).

the community as a whole.\u201978 Some of the issues revealed by Social Audits include denial of registration which have been remedied by on spot registration and issuance of job cards.79 Nonetheless, the desired mechanism must be in conformity with human rights standards and in this vein, certain questions need to be raised and answered when designing accountability systems. For instance, if a crime has been committed, such as fraud, to what degree does the accountability system hold the perpetrator fully accountable? This may not always be possible with just political accountability or community informal systems. To remedy this, such accountability systems could be accompanied or complemented by links to criminal proceedings. In the example of MGNREGA system in India, perpetrators of fraud were both dismissed through the Social Audit process and had an FIR (First Information Report) filed with the police, which then launched criminal proceedings against them.80 Moreover the accountability system must be financially, physically and culturally accessible for all. Those in need must be aware of their rights and procedures for seeking legal redress. Finally, one must consider whether the mechanism can be easily manipulated by local elites and if so, implement the necessary safeguards. Without appropriate and necessary action, community mechanisms will echo and reinforce existing power asymmetries within the community and deny justice to marginalised communities and/or women. E. Ensuring meaningful and effective participation Persons living in extreme poverty are below the radar of the State and almost certainly excluded from political life. Their voices are rarely, if at all, heard in the development and implementation of legislation and policies affecting their lives. This can lead to creation and implementation of irrelevant policies, failing to account for the needs of those living in poverty. As the Independent Expert noted, \u2019extreme poverty cannot be eradicated if life experiences of persons living in extreme poverty continue to be ignored in public debates.\u201981 The design of participatory mechanisms in social protection programmes is thus not an added extra but a key part of the process from initial conception to implementation, to monitoring and finally to evaluation. The participatory mechanism must be meaningful, inclusive and penetrate rhetoric consultations accompanied by processes allowing discussions to substantively feed into decisions. It must also be inclusive of everyone, especially disadvantaged or traditionally marginalised groups, as well as economically, culturally, and physically accessible to allow for and remedy imbalanced power 78 Ibid 79 Ibid p 21` 80 Ibid 81 See Progress Report of the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, Magdalena Sep\u00falveda Carmona, on the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights A/ HRC/15/41, 6 August 2010, page 12. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 47 structures and the specific vulnerabilities of different groups such as women, lower castes, landless labourers, and sub groups such as lower caste women. The mechanism must ensure members of these vulnerable groups are able to share their views freely, without fear of reprisal from other community members. This could include individual, confidential procedures or regular meetings with one particular group or sub group of persons at a time. F. Adopting comprehensive, coherent and coordinated policies Social protection systems must recognise poverty as multi-disciplinary and the result of a number of different interrelated and interdependent deprivations and vulnerabilities. The systems must also be approached holistically and reinforced by other social policies.82 ESCAP has observed that in the Asia Pacific region, social protection programmes are often fragmented i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22e7dd24-9cf1-4a36-8ece-c061ab75a1b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "22e7dd24-9cf1-4a36-8ece-c061ab75a1b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e6cac8a0a0c01c1d63c835baebe11f855a0744bcc3aabc19b686e3d624d0128"}, "2": {"node_id": "44f94549-0e5d-4fa2-8fa9-cb80598e8699", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68f7ec9286e029e8eed9e5ae2abdd4c8f0ea7db473827b6fd7b3b8dcf9e0a005"}}, "hash": "ef9254255028a116bdd5a8001f3e751c7163af97c5d474d1749236ca69e7a49e", "text": "lacking coordination and cohesion, with governments considering such schemes as \u2018almost self-contained with their own objectives, functions, structures and budgets.\u201983 This is attributed in part to governments designing programmes in response to a specific problem or issue and then withdrawing them once the circumstances change or if the programme is perceived as unsuccessful.84 It also observes that this problem of fragmentation and lack of coherence is particularly apparent in least developed countries due to a greater donor", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b106206-61d4-47db-b4a8-fcfe7782152b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b106206-61d4-47db-b4a8-fcfe7782152b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99b873777147e60c5fe1a50927b641c0026363ba39b35c51df8697024c5427d8"}, "3": {"node_id": "4a5fede5-0df1-4773-bdb2-55e1f79add89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b8a1bcf97adb1d72cb6f576822ca92300000bd26a0c24114358d4656fdd02fcc"}}, "hash": "97890525e596f0a2721a6ac2be67a8139fbccc61e1f8431c69fc9791452f2551", "text": "presence and different donors responding to different priorities.85 ESCAP gives the examples of both China and Indonesia.

States must take a holistic view, and ensure coherence between the different programmes by keeping in mind the primary objective of reaching and protecting those in need from different contingencies. Social protection programmes must be complemented by other policies such as ensuring the supply of good quality and accessible schools. While this touches on many of the issues dealt with earlier, this is a challenge in its own right. For example, focusing on cash transfers assumes the main barrier to accessing schools is financial. While this is certainly a factor for households taking children from school to engage in paid work when crises hit, it may not be the only important factor. Persons living in extreme poverty may also be prevented from accessing school by problems with physical access, lack of quality teachers, and possibilities of abuse among other things. G. Ensuring sustainability Social protection systems must be sustainable in the long term. Any sudden withdrawal of benefits could increase persons\u2019 vulnerability. This is particularly pertinent in the current economic climate, the possibility of a repeated recession in developed countries, reduced government spending in 2011 and 2012 and the changing demographics and financial implications of an ageing population with old age dependency ratios increasing. This issue has been noticed by human rights mechanisms. On several occasions the CESCR has asked State parties whether their pension systems are financially viable and whether they are expected to remain so in the coming years.90 In the list of issues presented to the Government of Belgium, the CESCR asked the Government to provide detailed statistical information on an annual basis regarding financing of the Ageing Fund established in 2001. The CESCR commented on other measures the State party intends to take to cover such as higher pensions and health costs arising from the ageing Belgian population.91 The Committee similarly asked Italy to indicate measures being taken to deal with demographic changes, namely a decreasing overall population and an expected increase in the number of elderly persons dependent on social security.92 While CESCR focused questions on European and North American countries whose systems of social security have been well established, these questions remain pertinent for emerging economies and developing countries such as those in the Asia Pacific region. The Asia Pacific Region is home to more than half the world\u2019s population (3.45 billion people) and its population density of 127 people per square kilometre is more than twice the world average.93 There 90 See E/C.12/2007/SR.7. 91 See E/C.12/BEL/3 92 See E/C.12/Q/ITA/2 93 See Health in Asia and the Pacific, Chapter 3 Demographic Trends, World Health Organisation, 2008.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a5fede5-0df1-4773-bdb2-55e1f79add89": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a5fede5-0df1-4773-bdb2-55e1f79add89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99b873777147e60c5fe1a50927b641c0026363ba39b35c51df8697024c5427d8"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b106206-61d4-47db-b4a8-fcfe7782152b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97890525e596f0a2721a6ac2be67a8139fbccc61e1f8431c69fc9791452f2551"}}, "hash": "b8a1bcf97adb1d72cb6f576822ca92300000bd26a0c24114358d4656fdd02fcc", "text": "Available at: http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/FDE1DBDE-B905-465F-B9D4-7DC92C50D0E0/0/08_ Chapter3Demographictrends.pdf Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 49 is also a shift from low dependency ratios (both child and old age) of the late 1990s with parents having smaller families to increasing old age dependency as the fertility rate declines and life expectancy increases.94 In 1975, for example, the percentages of over 60 years", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be82b30a-9e44-4ce7-ad72-368241aa05ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "be82b30a-9e44-4ce7-ad72-368241aa05ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c25e6756c3cf7dd3c6c02a68b5fd00569adedeeb08a2d053c810d31a3dcc138"}, "3": {"node_id": "6f99791f-ce24-46e5-9504-e49291f36d68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "872775bd3770c2478ee00ae28d6625e048378ca1c2052147dad8a6018e70470e"}}, "hash": "4fe271484c483ee8e45a257d4dbddce9288cfcf0a57317581d9a85d383471701", "text": "in Bangladesh and India were 4.8% and 5.6% respectively.

The Independent Expert has repeatedly called on the the international community to ensure predictability and consistency and to implement and guarantee a long-term strategy regarding aid to developing countries for implementing social protection programmes.96 Operating a short-term project based approach with limited long-term planning contributes to a fragmented approach that can result in a lack of comprehensive protection with people falling through the cracks. A fragmented short term approach is most common in the Asia Pacific region in developing countries which have a strong donor presence.97 For example, UNDP has noted that reliance on donors for funding anti- retroviral treatment for people who are HIV positive, and subsequent questions about sustainability, could pose life threatening concerns for those who must continue receiving this treatment throughout their lives. Given the tendency of aid to be project based, there are a number of specific \u2018one-off\u2019 activities donors could support that fit within the \u2018sustainability/long term framework\u2019. Opportunities identified by the Independent Expert include building civil society\u2019s capacity for monitoring the social pension system and holding the Government accountable, assisting in the designing and implementation of effective tax systems, the initial set-up of social pension systems, especially in low-income countries, and providing technical and/ or material assistance for identifying and registering possible beneficiaries.98 Essentially, donors should work towards strengthening the capacity of the recipient country to \u2018eventually implement the social pension programme unassisted.\u201999 94 Ibid 95 Ibid p 41 96 See Report of independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, Magdalena Sep\u00falveda Carmona, Mission to Zambia A/HRC/14/31/Add.1, 11 May 2011 p 20.

UNDP and social protection UNDP is mandated to implement a Human Rights Based Approach to human development of which a rights based approach to social protection is an integral part. UNDP must therefore recognise social protection as an entitlement and commit to assisting governments to secure a rights based approach that reaches marginalized people in particular need. A. What is UNDP\u2019s added value in working on social protection? UNDP is uniquely placed to build on the work of other UN agencies and programmes on social protection due to, amongst other things, its universal presence and extensive knowledge network.100 By combining teams on Inclusive Growth, Poverty Reduction and Democratic Governance, UNDP can build bridges between the normative human rights framework and the technical implementation of projects. There are a number of practical possibilities, aside from the actual implementation of social protection programmes, for UNDP to take advantage of its unique position. However, this is by no means an exhaustive list. Instead, it is a list of ideas designed to provoke discussion within UNDP about how to ensure a rights based approach to social protection at the country level meets the needs of the most vulnerable and marginalized. i. Identifying beneficiaries: As emphasized throughout this paper, persons in need of social protection are usually below the radar of the State. UNDP can play a clear role in assisting States to identify and reach those in need by helping \u2018establish comprehensive data-collection systems that provide disaggregated data, taking into account the specific attributes of extreme poverty in each country\u2019 using data collection and processing methods that comply with \u2018internationally accepted norms to protect human rights, ensure confidentiality and respect for privacy\u2019. 101 ii.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f99791f-ce24-46e5-9504-e49291f36d68": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f99791f-ce24-46e5-9504-e49291f36d68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c25e6756c3cf7dd3c6c02a68b5fd00569adedeeb08a2d053c810d31a3dcc138"}, "2": {"node_id": "be82b30a-9e44-4ce7-ad72-368241aa05ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4fe271484c483ee8e45a257d4dbddce9288cfcf0a57317581d9a85d383471701"}}, "hash": "872775bd3770c2478ee00ae28d6625e048378ca1c2052147dad8a6018e70470e", "text": "101 ii.

Help secure sustainable funding through improving revenue collection systems in accordance with human rights principles and standards: Sustainable funding is extremely crucial. Effective national and sub-national revenue collection systems are one of the most reliable ways to ensure sustainability, giving governments the fiscal space to implement social reforms and guarantee legal entitlements. Strengthening UNDP\u2019s work in assisting governments to identify opportunities for revenue collection, supporting transparent and participatory budgetary processes and well-functioning systems of fiscal decentralization as well as strengthening the capacity of institutions to implement and enforce the fiscal policy may therefore be invaluable. 102 See UNDP strategic plan, 2008-2011; Accelerating global progress on human development, DP/2007/43/ rev.1, 22 May 2008 p 10 52 Access to a Legal Remedy: Alternative Pathways to MDG Implementation Access to a Legal Remedy: Alternative Pathways to MDG Implementation Tiernan Mennen 1. Introduction Accessing legal remedies is an important structural component for enforcing the spectrum of rights and benefits that correspond to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Ensuring access to a legal remedy is important to any comprehensive strategy in order for individual people to effectively challenge the denial of economic, social and cultural rights. Without a citizen-focused strategy and methodology, MDG achievement is limited exclusively to government policy efforts which may go unenforced at the local level. Legal challenges by citizens help refine implementation efforts by informing and improving policy. Legal remedies are not meant as a primary enforcement mechanism, but their existence and availability has proven to be a key driving force and incentive for rights protection. Ensuring access to legal remedies is not an easy task considering the large number of poor and marginalized populations in developing and conflict-affected countries. Access barriers are further compounded by large-scale denial of rights, a lack of community legal awareness, and underdeveloped systems of legal protection. UNDP, international donors and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have developed many innovative approaches to tackling these barriers. However, the problem is vast and often poorly understood. In this chapter we will examine the most effective approaches for providing access to a legal remedy and detail how they can be better oriented to address economic and social rights and other legal issues that directly impact the MDGs. The preferred approach expands upon traditional criminal justice-focused legal aid programs to incorporate legal empowerment methodologies, such as paralegals, that increase the agency of individuals to use the law as a tool and promote the integration of legal solutions to a wider swath of development issues such as health, education, and public services. 2. Access to a Legal Remedy Supporting legal services for low-income groups is a crucial \u201cdemand-side\u201d aspect of any strategy for comprehensive justice sector reform. In addition to providing judicial services, access to institutions and legal remedies, interventions increase legal literacy and empowerment, providing people with the knowledge and tools to find their own legal solutions and demand improvements in law and policy. Demand-side interventions can also expose deficiencies in law and create movements for needed reforms. The Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 53 interventions help inform governments of legal issues affecting the poor and often identify pro-poor solutions capable of being scaled up into policy reform. Ensuring access to a legal remedy is, however, a daunting objective in many countries where the majority of people cannot afford a lawyer and have little trust or interaction with the formal justice system. Courts and other aspects of the formal justice system have also proven ill-suited, inaccessible and too costly for most marginalized populations. Legal professions that are largely underdeveloped or bereft of a commitment to public interest exacerbate these challenges.

Legal remedy programs focus on accessing justice without the need to go to court and are based squarely in the reality of the poor and the use of alternative and customary forms of dispute resolution. Justice or legal aid services can be viewed as a public good similar to public health and education. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Article 2 (3) provides the right to legal recourse when their rights have been violated, even if the violator was acting in an official capacity.103 As a result, many national development and poverty reduction strategies incorporate commitments to create justice service systems aimed at the poor and marginalized based on principles of accessibility, affordability, sustainability, quality, and independence. Delivery of legal services can and should take many forms. A spectrum of interventions supported both publicly and privately and with a strong emphasis on independent civil society implementation, should form the core of legal services and access to remedy strategies. The following are descriptions of key categories of legal services and mechanisms for providing access to legal remedy for the poor and vulnerable. Legal Aid Legal aid is the provision of legal assistance and representation to those that cannot otherwise afford it. In many countries, this means the majority of the population. Legal aid can be further categorized into criminal legal aid for indigent defendants (which is often a state obligation) and civil legal aid, which tends to be more nuanced in determining eligibility and uses legal information and awareness-raising more frequently than representation. Legal aid can be provided by a combination of state attorneys, normally in the form of a Public Defenders Office, individual lawyers, either through a 103 \u201cEach State Party to the present Covenant undertakes: \u2026 To ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective remedy, notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity; to ensure that any person claiming such a remedy shall have his rights thereto determined by competent judicial, administrative or legislative authorities, or by any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the State, and to develop the possibilities of judicial remedy;\u201d 54 Access to a Legal Remedy: Alternative Pathways to MDG Implementation Judicare104 model or pro bono services, non-profit lawyers, or civil society organizations that employ lawyers, paralegals, mediators and other community workers. The ideal legal aid system employs a mixture of all. In many developing countries, support to civil society organizations has proven to be the most effective, given the enormous demand, relatively high cost of private lawyers, government disinterest, and lack of pro bono legal culture. Criminal legal aid often responds to constitutional or legislative obligations on the state to provide legal representation to all arrested and accused. In some countries, this only applies to more serious offenses. In others, there is no such formal obligation. State responses to providing criminal legal aid then take on a variety of forms, dependent in part on their level of obligation. Public Defenders Offices employ government lawyers to monitor arrests and provide legal assistance to those that cannot otherwise afford a lawyer. In other instances, a legal aid government agency of some form is established to contract with independent organizations that fulfill the public legal aid obligation. In many countries there is no system in place. Criminal legal aid for indigent defendants is provided irregularly or not at all, often despite legislative obligations. The rash of prison overcrowding and pre-trial detention rates around the world has been a direct result. Civil legal aid, as used here, can refer to a wide range of legal, judicial and dispute resolution activities, both civil and criminal. The main difference from criminal legal aid being it does not exclusively serve defendants. Most often, criminal prosecution services are the purview of the state, but in many countries crimes go unprosecuted or lie outside control of the formal system. As a result, civil legal aid services tend to be more comprehensive and nuanced and have the goal of achieving justice. In this form, legal services can also include mediation, alternative dispute resolution and community-based solutions that incorporate customary and/or restorative practices where appropriate. In many countries, civil legal aid is legally obligated for vulnerable groups such as children. Legal services are typically provided through a range of mechanisms that include legal service organizations, community justice centers (\u201cone-stop shops\u201d), community-based paralegal networks, gender-based violence", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26700a7c-330f-46ad-b8e4-115481db8388": {"__data__": {"id_": "26700a7c-330f-46ad-b8e4-115481db8388", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c1a97786936274088105e8b086935dc7dc6f09b495f7dda1598992ecb0f1a50"}}, "hash": "9c1a97786936274088105e8b086935dc7dc6f09b495f7dda1598992ecb0f1a50", "text": "support centers, or any variety of programs that place lawyers, paralegals, or even social workers in important community institutions where legal information can be easily disseminated and legal advice/representation easily accessed. Community organizations provide legal services that are often supported by pro bono support and representation by public-interest lawyers or law firms, particularly on specialized areas of law (e.g., labour, contracts, property, and family). Legal services are most effective when implemented through a network of community based organizations, specialized referral organizations, and complemented with pro bono support services.105 Legal Aid Boards are established in a number of countries to administer publicly- supported criminal and civil legal aid. The Boards supervise and coordinate organizations 104 Judicare is a legal aid model that uses private lawyers as service providers. They are remunerated on a case-by-case basis as determined by the appropriate legal aid agency. Judicare programs are often run an staffed by lawyers from Bar associations. 105 Legal Services for the Poor Best Practices Handbook, World Bank, 2003.

Boards are sometimes structured to administer a judicare model where individual lawyers are assigned cases, often in collaboration with Bar Associations, and paid for their fees. Judicare models have proven to not be cost effective where there is a large need for legal services and indigent criminal representation. Legal Aid in South Africa* Provisions of the South African Constitution requiring legal aid in criminal cases dramatically affect the ability of the Board to deliver legal aid in noncriminal cases. The vast majority of the Board\u2019s budget is earmarked for criminal legal aid. Of the 314,084 new matters taken by the Board\u2019s justice centers during the period from April 2006 to March 2007, a total of 279,691 (89 percent) were criminal cases and only 34,393 (11 percent) were civil matters. With respect to civil legal aid cases, the Constitution imposes a special duty on the state to provide legal aid to children under the age of eighteen \u201cwhere substantial injustice would otherwise result.\u201d The Constitution contains no additional provision that specifically requires legal aid in noncriminal matters. However, it does provide that \u201c[e]veryone has the right to have any dispute that can be resolved by the application of law decided in a fair public hearing in a court or, where appropriate, another independent and impartial forum.\u201d This raises the question of whether the state has a duty to provide legal aid to any person in a civil case who cannot afford representation. Unlike cases of arrested, detained, and accused individuals, there are no specific constitutional duties imposed on the South African state to provide the services of a legal practitioner to litigants in civil cases. If, however, the \u201cequality of arms\u201d (this is interesting, can you explain this a bit in a footnote, I think it might be interesting for readers in Asia what the European standard is in this regard) interpretation adopted by the European Court of Human Rights is applied, such a duty would arguably lie with the state. Paralegals Paralegals are an integral part of many legal systems around the world. The term paralegal commonly refers to non-lawyers that use a combination of tools, including legal assistance, to help clients and communities reach a legal solution to their problem. Paralegals can range from community-based volunteers that help raise awareness of human rights to professional paralegals that are trained, certified and regulated according to strict national standards. Networks of community paralegals have proven to be particularly successful providing cost-effective legal services in countries with unmet legal needs and underdeveloped legal professions. Depending on the context, paralegals can take a range of forms from certified professionals with law degrees to volunteer community members. In most developing country contexts they are drawn from local communities and trained to provide legal information, assistance and mediation to the poor and disadvantaged, lead local advocacy and community organization efforts, and assist in accessing formal legal representation. Paralegal networks seek to improve access to justice by creating local bases of knowledge that facilitate community involvement in the legal/administrative 56 Access to a Legal Remedy: Alternative Pathways to MDG Implementation processes that can resolve their problems.

A number of legal advocacy NGOs have been very successful using paralegals to affect a wide range of issues. Depending on level of training, skill and the legal rules that apply, paralegals can provide a wide range of services. In some countries, paralegals represent clients in administrative tribunals. In others, paralegals provide only basic legal information to clients, conduct investigations, serve as mediators, and/or provide legal awareness training. NGO-supported paralegals have proven effective at promoting judicial access, and have helped to demystify the law and equip communities where they live and serve with the legal capabilities to meet their own needs.106 Paralegal networks strengthen implementation of laws by applying informed pressure on government bodies and private offenders and heighten participatory development by bringing previously powerless voices into the decision-making process.107 Paralegal networks in countries such as China, Ecuador, the Philippines, South Africa, Sierra Leone and Namibia are examples of programs that have used innovative approaches to increase \u201clegal literacy\u201d and affect change in a variety of environments on topics directly and indirectly related to livelihood-based legal empowerment. Namibia\u2019s Legal Assistance Centre is a professional paralegal network who worked on apartheid issues upon inception, but now primarily helps victims of domestic violence to secure restraint orders, help workers regain jobs from which they have been unfairly dismissed, and assist disadvantaged people attempting to secure government benefits. The Sustainable Uses of Biological Resources (SUBIR) project in Ecuador developed a paralegal network in indigenous Afro-Ecuadorian and peasant communities to promote legal rights among their communities, including securing land tenure for community land previously classified as state land.108 Empowerment of communities to claim legal title to the land corresponded with greater commitment and responsibility in conserving protected areas rather than administered by State Forestry agencies. Paralegal networks are a potentially important mechanism for expanding legal aid programming to a more effective legal empowerment approach. A well-developed network has vast potential to provide a powerful combination of community-based legal literacy, legal assistance, advocacy and community organizing.

Paralegals do not just provide legal services, but also work with communities to organize and create collective solutions to common problems. Paralegals are important agents, if trained and organized properly, for working within local contexts to bridge the gap between law and the legal reality for the poor and vulnerable. Clinical Legal Education The development of law school clinics that focus on legal services and community empowerment can be effective for two reasons: it provides free services and legal information to disadvantaged communities and it fosters an appreciation for public- interest work in future lawyers, encouraging positive change in the culture of the legal profession. Post-graduate and law student intern programs address a full range of rights. Their placement within local communities necessitates covering a wide range of issues, from criminal representation to property disputes, especially where there is no other form of legal access. Law clinics allow young attorneys, law students, and paralegals to provide legal or educational services to a wide array of clients, including abused women and children, refugees, people living with HIV/AIDS, prisoners, and poor rural villagers. Clinic participants work on cases involving discrimination, housing disputes, land reform, domestic violence, divorce and child custody, and consumer rights, among other issues.

The legal empowerment approach is an alternative paradigm that focuses on the use of legal services and related development activities to increase disadvantaged populations\u2019 control over their lives.114 In its most advanced form, the approach imparts \u201ccritical consciousness\u201d or the ability of women, the poor and other marginalized groups to understand and think critically about the inequitable power relationships that affect their lives and to take action by challenging and transforming those relationships.115 The approach also incorporates community-driven, rights-based development and offers concrete mechanisms, including legal services, concentrated on alleviating poverty, advancing the rights of the disadvantaged, and making the rule of law a reality.116 Legal empowerment can also translate community-level needs into reforms of national laws and institutions.117 Golub identifies four additional, but crucial differences between rule of law efforts and legal empowerment approaches: 1) attorneys support the poor as partners, instead of dominating them as proprietors of expertise; (2) the disadvantaged play a role in setting priorities, rather than government officials and donor personnel dictating the agenda; (3) addressing these priorities frequently involves non-judicial strategies that transcend narrow notions of legal systems, justice sectors, and institution building; (4) even more broadly, the use of law is often just part of integrated strategies that include other development activities.118 112 Id. 113 Id at 358. 114 Id.

It is an approach that enhances the effectiveness of development assistance by helping citizens engage with legal and administrative institutions so they may address critical impediments that prevent them from participating in and benefiting from development assistance. Legal empowerment uses legal services through civil society groups to help the poor learn, act on and enforce their rights in pursuit of development and the goal of poverty alleviation. However, legal empowerment goes further than rights-based approaches by focusing on connections between development, freedom and power.

Too often, the international legal system is being called upon to enforce domestic obligations. Access to remedy focuses on strengthening the means for domestic enforcement. The ICESCR recognizes a range of economic-related rights, including the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to work, the right to favorable conditions of work that ensure fair wages and a decent living, and the right to social security. The ICESCR entered into force in January, 1976 as the sister-agreement to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), both of which derive from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, the ICESCR has never enjoyed the same recognition as the ICCPR and the agreement is not supported by the U.S. government, among others. The ICESCR is considerably weaker than the ICCPR and only requires that States \u201cmake steps\u201d towards protecting the enumerated rights, while also not establishing a free-standing monitoring body such as the ICCPR Human Rights Committee.120 This has created difficulty ensuring the domestic enforcement of economic and social rights and placed greater emphasis 119 Amartya Sen, Development as Freedom (2000) Alfred A. Knopf, New York. 120 Beth Lyon, \u201cSymposium: A Post-Colonial Agenda for the United Nations Committee on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights\u201d, 10 Am. U.J. Gender Soc.

At the same time, the UN and international human rights bodies have emphasized the need to consider all human rights as indivisible, interrelated and mutually reinforcing and that no hierarchy or distinction should be established between them. Access to a legal remedy for economic and social rights also relates to the issue of informality and the four pillars identified by the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor namely access to justice, property rights, labour rights and business rights. The economic rights delineated in the ICESCR do not directly refer to informality and economic regulations but are part of the spectrum of rights embodied by domestic laws such as contracts, property, trade practices and commerce. The economic rights of the ICESCR, however, are embodied in these laws and the goals of the ICESCR are advanced through their enforcement. The right to private property and freedom from government expropriation, for example, while not expressly recognized by the ICESCR is in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 17\u2013(1) Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others. (2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.) It is also a fundamental economic right recognized by constitutions throughout the world. Infringement of this principle is also a violation of ICESCR rights to adequate standard of living and to work. Labour rights (ICESCR Article 6, 7 and 8) are other important economic rights that have implications for the informal economy and pertain to various related domestic laws, policies, and regulations that enhance livelihood opportunities and protect the poor from abusive workplace conditions. Rights contained in the ICCPR also directly affect legal remedies and MDG achievement. Among others, Article 2 provides for the \u201cright to legal recourse\u201d when rights have been violated, even when the violator was acting in an official capacity; Article 3: \u201cthe right to equality between men and women in the enjoyment of their civil and political rights\u201d; Article 6: \u201cthe right to life and survival\u201d; Article 26: \u201cthe right to equality before the law and equal protection\u201d. The two conventions, namely ICESCR and ICCPR, cover the entire spectrum of rights that should be protected by domestic legal frameworks and institutions. Legal aid and other access to remedy approaches address civil and political as well as economic and social rights.

The importance of property (UDHR Article 17)\u2013the legal expression of ownership of assets\u2013in a market-based economy cannot be understated. Property rights are composed of a bundle of associated rights that include the right to possess, use, and own land, and include rights to resources on, below and above land. Property can be held individually or in common and often vary depending on country context and local culture. Numerous rule of law theorists have identified a lack of property rights as the primary cause of market access failure in developing countries and a chronic, structural barrier in the fight against global poverty.121 They have identified three important and overlapping ways that property rights premise the marketplace.122 First, property identifies and protects the set of tangible and intangible resources that can be transferred in the marketplace. Second, property secures benefits of and provides incentives for owners to seek improvement of their resources. Third, property creates security for capital borrowing and investment, turning fixed resources like land into mutable and liquid form. 121 See generally. de Soto; Reed; Bethall 122 O.

Many scholars see this as a failure of the rule of law and call for inclusion of the poor into the \u201cformal\u201d property system used by the elites. Hernando De Soto in The Mystery of Capital details how lack of access to capital, extensive government restrictions and lack of contract enforcement combine to undermine completely the capitalist economies that developing countries have been striving to create for the past half century.124 The problem for De Soto is not that developing countries do not have formal property systems, but that most citizens cannot gain access to it.

However, they have largely failed to realize property is not a primary quality of assets but the legal expression of an economically meaningful consensus about assets.125 Western nations built formal property systems by discovering the \u2018people\u2019s law\u2019 through formation of social contracts based on the practices and norms of the extralegal sector. Developing countries, in contrast (De Soto uses his native Peru as an example), have not geared their formal property systems to process extralegal proofs of ownership, which is the only kind of proof the poor have. The poor, and often indigenous in Peru, have never been given the legal mechanisms that would allow them to fix their economic rights over their assets, despite apparent legal rights. In addition to property and other economic rights, legal access and enforcement of rights has wider implications for fostering economic opportunity and creating the enabling environment for greater economic growth. Access to legal services supports small business and poor entrepreneurs by increasing confidence and security in doing business outside of local networks, beginning with advice on creating a contract sufficient for legal action and dispute resolution using legal resources from supporting NGOs. They can also provide legal advice for individual or groups of farmers to gain access to credit for purchasing seeds or construction irrigation, including perfecting security interests in future harvests, equipment or other movable property. Establishing integrity of contracts and enhancing their use is crucial to strengthening economic rights. While markets will still exist through extralegal means in the absence of economic rule of law, their capacity is greatly reduced when property and contractual 123 Thomas Bethall, The Noblest Triumph: Property and Prosperity Through the Ages, St. Martin\u2019s Press, New York, p. 3 (1998) 124 Hernando de Soto, The Mystery of Capital, Basic Books, New York (2000) 125 Id at 157. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 63 rights are not enforced or protected, a function taken for granted in wealthy nations.126 Contract enforcement is most commonly associated with judiciary reform, but efforts to increase enforcement should also integrate alternative methods of dispute resolution. Access to justice for contract enforcement, including delays caused by extremely inefficient court systems, is a crucial issue hurting the confidence of entrepreneurs at all income levels, particularly among the poor, who have even less means by which to affect a resolution of their cases. 4. Programming Solutions for Advancing the MDGs through Legal Services Governments, international institutions and foreign development agencies have struggled to bring effect to the various rights and legal reforms meant to strengthen development and improve progress toward the MDGs. The law and development approach of the 1970s first broached the subject of law reform for development aims by diagnosing problems in foreign domestic laws and then borrowing and inserting Western versions into their legal codes. This approach lost favor and the foreign legal academics behind it were criticized for not having a sufficient understanding of local law, power dynamics, and the unique characteristics of local culture. Reforms over the past two decades have largely focused on institutional strengthening, but have often been far removed from the informal legal realities of the poor. The World Bank, among other donors/institutions, has implemented a number of judicial reform programs but with only miniscule attention to the availability of legal remedies for women and other disadvantaged groups. For example, the 2002 Judicial Reform Program in Ecuador devoted less than $400,000 of its $10.6 million budget to projects providing legal services to the poor.127 Other areas of rule of law reforms\u2013courthouse construction and repair, purchase of computers, establishing management and administration systems of judiciaries, support for judicial and other training institutes, building bar associations and international exchanges for judges and court administrators\u2013continue to attract the vast majority of funding. Despite the history of rule of law efforts, greater attention is being placed on structural issues of access to justice and the role of empowerment. Greater focus on community engagement and access to legal services has the potential to both stimulate new advances and build on past reforms. Improving access to legal services can consolidate past institutional reforms by fostering citizen demand for justice reform and by equipping the poor and disadvantaged with the tools to enforce rights. Legal aid, empowerment and other rights-focused community groups have demonstrated a unique ability to navigate the complicated dynamics of local power, national law and human rights to find legal solutions from the bottom up. The international community should focus more support to these local actors. 126 See", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fadb8b5f-47a3-4a0d-a647-3ea5ad5a23a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "fadb8b5f-47a3-4a0d-a647-3ea5ad5a23a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "572e4b442bd193408e5fb97ce2191e90a75d367bc8ee5e70726d8dfccb964883"}}, "hash": "572e4b442bd193408e5fb97ce2191e90a75d367bc8ee5e70726d8dfccb964883", "text": "generally.

The most effective legal service work combines empowerment with service provision and strategic engagement. The day-to- day work of legal service organizations address fundamental economic and social rights such as access to clean water, electricity, health care, education and other basic services. Legal service organizations keep people from being unjustly evicted from their homes and farms. They protect workers from abusive work conditions and discrimination. They enable pensioners and the poor to collect benefits. Legal service organizations help protect women from domestic violence, child custody, and claims for maintenance. Through representation of individuals, legal service organizations provide important services to the communities where they work while at the same time gaining a deep understanding of the needs and aspirations of poor people themselves. They address policy issues through strategic litigation and advocacy, building on their knowledge of local legal needs and right violations. Regardless of the particular issues they work on, the most effective legal aid support also promotes systemic change. Organizations provide critical support for lasting change by helping poor groups, communities and organizations advocate for public transparency, less administrative barriers, and representation in local government decision-making. They help poor communities and community-based organizations (CBOs) devise practical solutions for problems as they arise. They recommend and advocate for law reforms to improve the equity of rights and services available to poor people and work in networks of poor people\u2019s organizations. They help create a culture of rights where both individuals and groups can assert their own interests. Generally, legal service organizations have an important role to play in strengthening community-driven development by increasing civic engagement and fostering a climate for government accountability, particularly in public service provision and poverty reduction efforts. They call attention to discrimination in the provision of benefits and expose corruption and cooptation of scarce public resources by local elites. Legal service organizations often have to adjust their objectives and increase capacity to take this more comprehensive approach of community organizing and advocacy for the poor. This often requires a shift in attention from advising and representing individuals to working on behalf of groups.128 A 2001 ADB study found that legal assistance and empowerment is most effective when used as a tool to improve people\u2019s daily lives, such as access to water, sanitation, or health care. It also found that engaging civil society organizations to work with local communities as well as government agencies and officials was an effective tool. In addition, it found that legal empowerment helps strengthen socioeconomic development efforts in a variety of 128 See. Legal Services for the Poor Best Practices Handbook, World Bank, 2003 at vi. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 65 areas, including natural resource management and conservation, rural development, land tenure, decentralization, and women\u2019s health.129 Some rule of law programs that focus on economic rights have made progress in identifying and reforming complicated and burdensome laws that affect legal remedies for small businesses and informal sector entrepreneurs. In Peru, for instance, misguided secured transaction laws were demonstrated to limit access to credit for poor farmers and rural businesses.130 Financing is limited to real estate holdings (which require an elusive, legal title) because the legal framework for creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests in movable property is overly complicated. Regulations need to be reformed to allow security interests in a greater number of goods and institutions and to allow less expensive registration and easier location of registered security interests. Strengthening property rights is another important focus for economic rights legal service programming. Most property rights programs are focused on rewriting laws or increasing funding for national titling institutes, without consideration of the local property dynamics that affect the poor. Titling programs are also expensive and often not cost effective. They can affect different segments of the poor \u2013 from working poor to the most destitute\u2013depending on the titling initiative\u2019s design.

When considering programming, it is important to differentiate between economic rights reforms that result in more efficient laws from those that address the structural access issues faced by the poor. These top-down approaches fail to link formal law with informal activities of the poor. Beneficiaries are mostly limited to established, wealthy economic actors who have the capacity or political capital to access credit and contract enforcement systems, while the economically and politically disenfranchised are unaffected and left further behind economically. It is also important to differentiate from access to justice or legal aid programs that focus on criminal defense. Many programs categorized as legal aid fill important needs for indigent defense in the criminal justice systems, often with little impact on economic and social rights. Programs that address chronic rates of pre-trial detention are an exception. Legal service programs focused specifically on economic and social rights tend to be much less developed.

Paralegals have proven to be an efficient and flexible mechanism for providing an array of services that expand legal aid beyond legal representation and criminal justice. They tend to work on legal issues relevant to the poor and employ community-focused mechanisms that organize and create collective solutions to common problems. This aspect of the work of paralegals is particularly salient for economic, social and cultural rights. Paralegals have the potential to collaborate with a wide range of economic actors in the communities they serve to demand rights and services, and to take advantage of legal opportunities. Business associations such as farmer cooperatives, women\u2019s groups, trade unions and microfinance projects abound in many poor communities. The potential of these groups is enormous for organizing and empowering themselves to affect change in economic regulations and legal reforms with the help of community paralegals. Paralegals have the capacity to work with both individuals and groups in their residing communities to help delineate and translate informal property systems into legally protected rights. Programming to improve access to legal remedies can take an array of forms and target a number of beneficiary groups. Legal aid services can be strict representation in court, community legal awareness, or advocacy support to local groups, many with direct contributions to the achievement of the MDGs. For example: \u2022\ufffd Legal service lawyers can help members of a farmers\u2019 association gain greater legal security of their land, whether through outright land titles, state recognition of traditional land arrangements or other tenurial improvements, thus increasing the farmers\u2019 assets and income. \u2022\ufffd A law and health program may enable impoverished beneficiaries to understand and act on their rights to basic medical services, thus reducing infant mortality. \u2022\ufffd A women\u2019s group could use law, organizing and advocacy to combat domestic violence by persuading police or other government personnel to take the problem seriously, thus enhancing the physical security and independence of women in their community. \u2022\ufffd Parents can learn how to register the births of their children, ensuring access to citizenship, education and government services later in life. \u2022\ufffd Paralegals within legal service organizations work with grassroots groups to gradually make traditional justice systems less gender-biased. \u2022\ufffd Market vendors, with the help of legal aid lawyers, can negotiate with local governments the right to operate legally and free of police harassment, ending fear of losing their businesses and livelihoods. \u2022\ufffd Paralegals can help indigent defendants, often jailed unjustly or for years awaiting trial, obtain fair hearings or their freedom.

Legal aid, including community paralegal programmes, can often create new dependencies and power dynamics that exacerbate the very programmatic goals of justice and empowerment. Legal aid programmes should be careful to develop robust supervision and quality control mechanisms, including strict professional codes of conduct. Programme Examples A number of organizations and donor-funded projects across Asia (and elsewhere) have pioneered the use of legal aid services to protect economic and social rights and advance the MDGs: In the mid-1990\u2019s, a coalition of local CSOs was formed in the Philippines to engage with implementation efforts of a new Agrarian Reform Law. The coalition trained over 1,000 farmers as community paralegals, conducted legal clinics across twenty-two project areas, and helped with administrative procedures for the transfer of over 100,000 hectares. The project was supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). ADB monitored impact through interviews with officials from the Department of Agrarian Reform, survey responses from approximately 400 villagers, and focus groups in local communities. Information on legal service activities was gathered both from where the program had taken place, and from control communities similar in demographics and location. The ADB study concluded that in communities where legal service projects were implemented, land reforms resulted in residents with higher levels of productivity, higher incomes, more disposable income, and more investment in their farms.132 More recently, in 2008, the Philippine coalition helped organize, advocate and file a successful class action case on behalf of hundreds of Sumilao farmers to restore land illegally expropriated by a large corporation.133 In Bangladesh, an ADB-financed study carried out by the Asia Foundation conducted a controlled comparison survey to measure the impact of NGO activities in target beneficiary communities. The three NGOs studied employed different community- driven strategies to empower local populations, some more legal than others. One of the NGOs, the Madaripur Legal Aid Association, has become well-respected for community legal service delivery. The study found that all intervention populations experienced reduced socioeconomic vulnerability compared to control populations. All scored higher in four critical areas: general knowledge of law; engagement and confidence in citizen advocacy; positive perceptions of gender equity and the role of women in governance; and confidence in the value of law and good governance. The most sizable gains in these 132 Stephen Golub and Kim McQuay, Legal Empowerment: Advancing Good Governance and Poverty Reduction, Appendix 1: The Impact of Legal Empowerment Activities on Agrarian Reform Implementation in the Philippines (Asian Development Bank, 2001).

Legal Empowerment White Paper, Haki Network, 2011, available at: http://www.hakinetwork.org/ resource-center/ 68 Access to a Legal Remedy: Alternative Pathways to MDG Implementation areas were achieved where legal service activities were conducted as part of an integrated development approach that combines legal and socioeconomic development activities; where high levels of women\u2019s leadership were sustained through the program period; and where women\u2019s direct participation was facilitated by and through community advocacy efforts. Where the strategy focused on mobilizing community advocacy initiatives and engaged public officials, those surveyed expressed greater confidence in governance and public services. They are also more likely to view advocacy for land rights as a positive action. The survey results further suggest that success in securing legally-mandated control of common lands by, or for the benefit of, the poor is facilitated by regular citizen- government engagement. The study also showed that legal empowerment efforts made measurable impacts on the status and material circumstances of women by restraining the illegal practice of paying dowry. Women\u2019s families from populations where legal empowerment projects took place paid dowries less often and in smaller amounts than families from control group communities. In the same study, researchers found that women exposed to legal empowerment projects reported having cash savings for emergencies at a much higher rate than women from control communities.134 A variety of legal service activities have been supported in Indonesia over the past five years.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8720c051-b39c-4f3c-b354-3b38a7d64420": {"__data__": {"id_": "8720c051-b39c-4f3c-b354-3b38a7d64420", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c78e6669c7d0ff27c971b7282f0c10702b9c267b7a4cb67e9baac77fd139b24c"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e475d61-bd11-4d7d-a228-9a8c7766d6d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52d65513e4a4223f14943e4db61d820a1ee9135dee487f439d8f007528814096"}}, "hash": "3e7363ca9e4fd77d3410e88db26dee5c7d09f60cbe2515eefa5ecb096b1e8a4e", "text": "UNDP, ADB and the Justice for the Poor Program at the World Bank have supported work to empower women\u2019s groups, extend paralegal counseling services to marginalized communities, and empower citizens to access and make demands for responsive public services.135 The Legal Empowerment and Assistance for the Disadvantaged (LEAD) programme in Indonesia supported civil society organizations to establish citizen complaints centers in three provinces prone to land-based conflicts.

She is the only woman leader of the sidewalk traders association Paguyuban Depan Mesjid Baiturahman (PKL) in Semarang city. In 2000, the city government executed Regional Regulation No. 11/2000, an order expelling the sidewalk traders in the area where she ran her small business. This unfair practice compelled her and her peers to establish PKL and through collective advocacy and adept negotiation successfully challenged the regulation to include exceptions for PKL and others. Mbak Rini did not stop there. She discovered that the law called for exemptions to mandatory educational payments for poor families. The practice of school officials was different. Mbak Rini organized other parents around the issue and reported the case to the Semarang City government. The school was sanctioned and payment requirements for poor families eliminated.136 The work of a local organization in Zimbabwe illustrates similar qualitative impact of legal work around issues of communal land tenure. According to Zimbabwean law, communities do not own the land and natural resources in their locality. Most communities live on communal land that has been designated as State land since independence.137 Therefore, the State has exclusive ownership and use of all resources, but grants usufructuary rights to communities through the Rural District Councils (RDCs). RDCs have management authority over all land and natural resources located in communal areas. Once they are registered as legal entities, communities can engage with the RDCs in order to obtain management authority over the natural resources within their area and challenge land laws, policies and decisions that do not promote their interests. The Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association (ZELA) worked with one such community in southern Zimbabwe to register them as a trust and formed the Chibhememe Earth Healing Association (CHIEHA). Through a long, consultative process with government ministries and the local RDC, the CHIEHA gained control over management of its natural resources within and along the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park.138 CHIEHA has now become an important voice for communities of the Chibhememe region and is able to influence and negotiate with the government in the interest of the community.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f245ce43-e5c2-4e5a-a495-3032761424f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "f245ce43-e5c2-4e5a-a495-3032761424f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79dcc7635a3b0fb10e3647635e03c5be9dd8560d31c282ad1198ba2f34d29661"}, "2": {"node_id": "59f7fbcd-c219-4e2f-86a1-4ca7d55f201d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "686d42450b9a6dbc9a961a30874c24e8c23c4167e56076f88d858164af753cc0"}}, "hash": "002f5d0e3aa96a489bb77614406c5b8100a01e1f0b5d705b6a5fbfdafd88f3d0", "text": "CHIEHA has also mobilized funding for better management and contributed to development of benefit-sharing mechanisms for the region.139 In Senegal, the domestic NGO TOSTAN employed funding from the German aid agency GTZ to undertake a two-year project geared toward reducing female genital mutilation (FGM) through problem solving initiatives and awareness on women\u2019s rights.

Even more significantly, there were also major drops in the reported prevalence of FGM for girls within project communities. In Ecuador, the World Bank funded, as part of a large loan, the creation of five small legal aid clinics in Quito, Guayaquil, and Cuenca to help poor women and their children.141 The clinics provide legal consultation, representation and dispute resolution services for over two years, helping almost 17,000 poor women. A study on impact found that not only were the clinics less expensive than private lawyers, they were also more effective. Female legal aid clients had a 10.4% increase in probability that they would receive child support and average support payments increased by 50%. In approximately half of the cases where legal aid resulted in child support payments, that payment accounted for 39% or more of what the household spent per month on feeding one individual. This, coupled with a 17% reduction in the probability of suffering from domestic violence following a divorce, results in improved economic conditions for women.142 These examples illustrate the range of legal remedy programmes and the diversity of their impact across the rights spectrum and MDGs. Despite the range of beneficiaries and legal issues, the programs take a similar demand-side approach that utilizes legal remedy as a basis from which to enforce rights at the local level and drive change from the bottom-up. 5. What can UNDP do? Conclusion and Recommendations Access to legal remedies is a critical issue addressing structural barriers for the poor often not handled by other reform efforts. Legal service programs can take a variety of forms but the best programs combine community legal awareness with legal service provision and strategic advocacy. Legal aid programming in its traditional, more reactive criminal justice focused form is not sufficient to address the wide array of legal issues that affect economic and social rights and MDG achievement. Program design often needs to be altered to specifically target economic and social rights and to incorporate empowerment and policy reform methodologies. Working with community and civil society partners on the implementation side is the most effective approach. Developing policy and independent, public-funding options with government partners ensures sustainability. UNDP has innovated access to justice approaches in countries across the Asia-Pacific region. Program design varies from working through government partners to establishing 140 Nafissatou J.

Everyone stresses the rule of law, but it matters a great deal what kind of rule of law is established. For laws can be used to ensure equality of opportunity and tolerance, or they can be used to maintain inequalities and the power of elites.\u201d Joseph E. Stiglitz143 Introduction Countries around the world, including members of the Legal Empowerment Asia Partnership (LEAP), have been undertaking various legal empowerment initiatives. Given these countries\u2019 common aspirations, a guidance note on methods of identifying regulatory and legislative barriers to empowering the poor was commissioned by UNDP Mongolia to equip practitioners and policymakers involved in legal empowerment of the poor (LEP) programming. Accordingly, this chapter is based on the guidance note targeted towards government officials, development practitioners and programme staff involved in programme/project design, management and monitoring. It presents a review and analysis of various existing methods in the field to assist LEAP member countries and others in adopting their own methodology to identify laws and regulations that may be obstacles to empowering the poor. This overview is not an exhaustive step-by-step manual on how to identify barriers to empowering the poor but rather a practical resource presenting brief descriptions of possible methods used to identify institutional bottlenecks to poverty reduction and livelihood insecurity. It also includes a focused analysis of a few, selected methods, namely the Institute for Liberty and Democracy\u2019s (ILD) Informality Diagnostics, Access to Justice Assessments, the Doing Business Report and the MDG Acceleration Framework. The overview is organized as follows. Each methodology is described briefly and discussed in terms of strengths and weaknesses, and in the contexts of, for example, effectiveness, easiness to use, cost, likelihood of adoption by Government and sustainability. This is followed, where applicable, by insights into possible reasons why a particular method was suitable for a particular local context and points to consider when developing or selecting a specific method for an individual country. 143 Stiglitz, Joseph E., \u201cThe Tunisian Catalyst,\u201d Project Syndicate, February 4, 2011, http://www.project- syndicate.org/commentary/stiglitz135/English. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 73 The methodologies use examples illustrated with experience of the poor in accessing justice through the court system and out-of-court facilities as well as public bureaucracy. Frequently through the bureaucratic system, impoverished people must battle injustices and abuses from the government, particularly in the context of regulation and service delivery144.

In 2010, the UNDP Millennium Development Goal Breakthrough Strategy recommended investing in innovations such as Legal Empowerment of the Poor (LEP) to accelerate MDG achievement147. Core components of the LEP agenda, as described by the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor, focus on poverty reduction, individual empowerment through voice and organisation, and the development of an enabling, legislative and regulatory policy environment fostering secure and sustainable livelihoods. Critical to the latter component is the repeal of legislative and regulatory obstacles to empowerment. 144 Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor.;United Nations Development Programme., Making the law work for everyone.

By addressing the structural causes of poverty and exclusion, work designed to advance legal empowerment of the poor can help to sustain MDG progress.\u2019 39 74 Methods of Identifying Regulatory and Legislative Barriers to Empowering the Poor Unsurprisingly, there is no single recipe for implementing strategies of LEP. While some characteristics may be shared across different approaches and situations, context is extremely important. Luckily, there are many entry points to begin implementing LEP activities. One approach may emphasise land or climate change (or even the nexus between the two) while another may take violence against women and women\u2019s access to justice as starting points. Likewise, there is no single all-encompassing methodology for identifying regulatory and legislative barriers to empowering the poor. Each methodology has advantages and disadvantages and may be more suitable in one context as opposed to another. In some cases, bringing together approaches that combine the salient features of several methodologies may yield the better results. However, despite differing country contexts, insights gained from various methods, even across countries, often produce broadly comparable results. This is testimony to the universal nature of the sad realities facing the poor. 1. ILD Diagnostic Reviews: Mapping transaction procedures within the \u2018extra-legal\u2019 sector and contrasting with existing regulations to identify areas for reform Description Drawing on the theories of its founder and president Hernando de Soto, the work of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD) focuses on two of pillars148 identified by the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (which de Soto co-chaired): property rights and business rights. According to the mission statement, ILD strives \u201c[t]o provide governments with the expertise and information to implement institutional reforms in property and business rights that allow citizens to be included in the market economy and thus pull themselves out of poverty and prosper.\u201d149 The ultimate objective of ILD inclusion programmes is to provide universal access to property rights and business tools which ILD considers an efficient platform for wealth creation. Significantly, ILD\u2019s multiphase approach amounts to taking necessary steps for people who are already organised (to one degree or another) to \u2018move into the rule of law\u2019, according to de Soto. ILD\u2019s methodology was generated from field work conducted by ILD teams in shantytowns in the outskirts of Lima in the 1980s. To experience the process150 of setting up the most basic garment factory from the point of view of the poor, ILD measured the amount of time needed to overcome obstacles preventing workers from becoming legal. The project took approximately 300 days six-hour working days and cost thirty two times the 148 The other two pillars are access to justice & rule of law and labour rights 149 ILD Website http://ild.org.pe/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=186&Itemid=89&lang= en accessed 4 January 2010.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a50145dd-e331-4899-a311-f76bf32a2d9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "a50145dd-e331-4899-a311-f76bf32a2d9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5934da3a1a78c59333e8ee35691ecfafec65ddf1cfe4a4011d277c28e6c30fe2"}, "2": {"node_id": "513ee1fb-8877-45e1-81f2-2671cebf08c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5d7f31c25142398764b01a3609294a22d87bf079190560036b4ba061f4b1e3e"}}, "hash": "dae421fba4f646449009086d42f650d26cf5c2df9bcbd07c0c05d4a7adb1115d", "text": "150 The World Bank\u2019s Doing Business time and motion indicator series bases itself on this methodology.

The approach combines intensive empirical research, with legal framework analysis and policy advocacy, based on gathered evidence. To date, ILD has assessed and documented informality situations in over 20 countries.152 It has identified the size and location of extralegal assets, uncovered some of the principal administrative obstacles, and proposed recommendation regarding what needs to be done to ensure that the costs of being legal are below the costs of being extralegal. The ILD Methodology153 ILD\u2019s programme for the transition to the rule of law and inclusive market economy consists of the following phases: \u2022\ufffd Training and Team Building \u2022\ufffd Diagnosis \u2022\ufffd Institutional Reform \u2022\ufffd Implementation \u2022\ufffd Capital Formation The main focus is the diagnosis phase as this is where regulatory and legal barriers to empowering the poor are being identified. ILD\u2019s diagnosis strategy is based on detailed extralegal154, legal and economic research. The main purpose of the diagnosis strategy is to lay groundwork for reform and build a convincing case for change. This is supported by analysis of the existing legal system, exposing the system\u2019s shortcomings and identifying potential for providing essential institutions with wealth creation. Next comes extensive mapping of the extralegal world and evaluation of disconnects between law on paper and reality on the ground. The following step determines whether the extralegal system already functions according to rules that could potentially become the roots of a formal law or even become the seeds of future legal and economic institutions. This is followed by an analysis of whether extralegal practices and procedures enhance or hamper the functioning of basic institutions required for economic growth. Before delving further into details of methodology, it may be useful to consider under which circumstances the programme works best and to gain insight into the scope and outcomes 151 Hernando de Soto, The mystery of capital : why capitalism triumphs in the West and fails everywhere else (New York: Basic Books, 2000), 190. 152 www.ild.org.pe 153 Based on authors participation in a UNDP-ILD capacity building session; Lima Peru Oct 2010 154 The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines extralegal as \u2018not regulated or sanctioned by law\u2019; It can be construed as the lack of normative instruments that a good legal system provides to create wealth: property rights and business tools. 76 Methods of Identifying Regulatory and Legislative Barriers to Empowering the Poor of such initiatives. In most cases, ILD perceives the first entry point for gaining buy-in for its informality diagnosis in a given country at the head of state or government level. ILD considers the president or prime minister\u2019s persistent support as a crucial determinant of success. Interaction at this level has the advantage of promoting the country\u2019s leader as a champion of reform. This can be particularly useful at the reform implementation stage, for example when pushing through difficult and sensitive administrative reforms that may threaten many vested interests. The downside is increased dependence of outcomes on the political cycle, especially when involvement of other stakeholders is limited. Furthermore, in fragile countries, such as those emerging from conflict, leadership may not be in a position to effectively act as interlocutor with the ILD team. While it is difficult to provide general figures, the cost of full-scale ILD programmes (of which the diagnostic review is only one part) is generally measured in millions of USD. This makes innovative partnerships (e.g. development partners, philanthropic organisations, private sector) for cost sharing an attractive option. One strategy is to provide an initial diagnosis free of charge, using gathered data to build a convincing case for reform and bring on board funding for a more detailed assessment to inform the reform proposal and support subsequent implementation. Outcomes of ILD programmes are wide-ranging and naturally context-specific, potentially encompassing enhancements in credit and mortgage applications; collections systems for credit, rates and taxes; housing and infrastructure; insurance and information services; identifications systems; and the use of property to enhance accountability.155 Outcome of ILD\u2019s work in the Philippines \u201cThe influence of the ILD\u2019s research and ideas has also been evident in the government\u2019s own efforts to spearhead reform.

ILD has been criticised in the past for not sufficiently building local ownership into its programmes156. By developing local capacity to carry out necessary research and analysis of the extralegal economy, ILD\u2019s training programmes now seek to provide the theoretical, technical and practical knowledge needed to conduct the diagnosis stage of the programme, organize the technical group and familiarize it on the vision, principles and objectives of the programme. Goals include transferring the ILD methodology and know-how to local national teams, building an informed shared vision, designing institutional changes and an implementation strategy as well as deploying reforms and feedback mechanisms. Research teams supporting these aims consist of a multidisciplinary group of high-ranking professionals from different fields, including economists, lawyers, public administration experts and engineers. They are responsible for executing i) the fieldwork and all other research related to diagnosing the extralegal sector of the country and ii) the related operational tasks, such as organizing and managing local working groups of consultants and subcontractors hired from the field. From inception and with initial government engagement, ILD establishes a clear picture of where national expertise lies and identifies networks of professionals and local institutions hosting specialists to be invited as participants in local teams undertaking research and analysis of the extralegal economy. The value of local expertise from civil society organisations, such as representatives of impoverished, vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or local NGOs, must not be neglected. Involving essential stakeholders meaningfully from the earliest stage onward is key to ensuring findings reveal an accurate picture of issues facing diverse groups in the population and to maximize buy-in for the findings and for subsequent reforms to be sustainable. A typical ILD programme includes a strategic team, an executive team and a technical team. Members of the strategic team are chosen to represent key sectors of society, maintain a reform based agenda, have experience resolving conflict and building consensus, and be able to influence leading opinion trends of the country. A key role of the strategic team is to ensure the political viability and sustainability of the programme. The team regularly meets and briefs the government (in this case the head of state) on the progress of the programme, and deals with public and private groups having vested interests in reform (or conversely, the status quo). The executive team is generally composed of a strategic coordinator and project manager supported by appropriate assistants/advisors on financial and communication issues. While the strategic coordinator is politically responsible for the development and results of the project, the project manager is entrusted with the recruitment process of the technical team and coordination and development at the work plan with the recruited team under 156 \u201cNorway backs out of de Soto\u2019s land rights project in Tanzania,\u201d Development Today, January 2008, 5. 78 Methods of Identifying Regulatory and Legislative Barriers to Empowering the Poor ILD supervision.

Bottlenecks in the legal framework may not affect the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in the same way as they would affect someone who, albeit poor, runs an unregistered business or lives under a roof without property title. Legal Research The legal research phase uses the concept of typology by characterizing and categorizing the causes of real estate and business assets extra legality. Firstly, it is used in counting and valuating extralegal assets, thereby generating data for economic research on how much dead capital157could potentially be brought back to life. Secondly, the typology concept informs legal research as it helps uncover problems affecting extralegal real estate and businesses. The analysis of typologies also yields information that feeding into the subsequent design of institutional reforms. 157 The total value of business and real estate assets that, while available for market transactions, are restricted to insecure and inefficient dealings that exclude these assets from the rule of law and the formal economy, leaving them undervalued with their potential value languishing in extralegality due to the absence of legal mechanisms to incorporate them under the legal framework. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 79 The legal research phase also comprises detailed analysis of procedures158 which ILD likens to an indivisible good. This phase integrates all the steps or activities an ordinary citizen must undertake to obtain specific results such as the recognition of a right, contracting, issuance of a license, permit or decree, resolution of a dispute, or registry of a right. Results generated by analysis of procedures and assessment of quality and suitability of rights help pinpoint institutional bottlenecks and obstacles affecting the system\u2019s ability to provide effective public services to citizens. In many cases, ILD has found bottlenecks existing in places where citizens have incentives to create extralegal mechanisms to circumvent or bribe to complete the procedures. Public officials, in turn, have incentives to block or multiply procedures to generate extra rents (in the form of bribes) and block attempts at administrative streamlining. This is why ILD considers buy-in by the state and strong leadership\u2013including from the highest echelons- as imperative to the success of reforms emanating from its research. Economic Research A key result of economic research is to quantify (using the typologies concept described above) the total value of business and real estate assets that, while at least available in theory for market transactions, are restricted to insecure and inefficient dealings. For example, a house built on land whose ownership is not properly recorded or an unincorporated business would be considered possessions that are not adequately documented. Therefore, the possessions be easily converted into capital or traded outside of narrow, local circles where people know and trust each other. Furthermore, the assets cannot be used as collateral for a loan or as a share against an investment.159The assets are therefore excluded from the rule of law and the formal economy, leaving them undervalued because there are no legal mechanisms for incorporation under the legal framework. In short, dead capital or assets are not fungible due to limited or absence of property rights. Reflections ILD\u2019s research is reputed as being precise and detailed yet expensive. The research involves large teams of international and national experts and thousands of interviews with individuals. However, there may be opportunities to broaden the scope of assessments to cover other areas and improve cost effectiveness. This could be achieved by embedding additional questions in ILD questionnaires to obtain information that can be used for capacity, MDG, gender or access to justice assessments. Cost effectiveness may also be 158 This is also the approach on which Doing Business team bases its time and motion indicators although ILD focuses more on the experience from a poor person\u2019s perspective (rather than the lawyer, for example, responding to the DB questionnaire) 159 de Soto, The mystery of capital. 80 Methods of Identifying Regulatory and Legislative Barriers to Empowering the Poor improved by applying appropriate sophisticated sampling techniques and accepting a narrower confidence interval.

Legislative Reviews: Working with universities to conduct legislative reviews pertaining to property, labour and \u2018business\u2019 rights and overall access to justice Background In support of its on-going and wide-ranging legal empowerment programme, the government of Thailand together with UNDP has commissioned experts at Thammasat University to undertake a comprehensive legislative review, surveying laws currently in effect relating to the four empowerment domains identified by the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor. The domains are: access to justice and the rule of law, property rights, labour rights and business rights. The aim of this research is to establish empirical evidence and better understanding of obstacles and challenges at different stages of the justice process in Thailand. Subsequently, this information can contribute to guide policymakers in making reforms resulting in improved and convenient, timely, inclusive access to justice for all people in Thailand.160 In particular, the legislative review evaluates how laws and policies impact four target groups: the poor, the underprivileged, minority and weak groups, and non-citizens living in the country. The impact of gender, age, and cultural aspects are also factored into the review. A further iteration of the study will analyse how populations in four selected regions161 (six provinces162) are able to access social services and use economic as well as other opportunities to lift themselves out of poverty. A number of research methodologies were used to inform the first phase of the study known as the legislative review. 160 Integrated ONE Annual Work Plan \u2013 Governance and Human Security Output 1.1 Support Thailand\u2019s legal reform process\u2013\u201cA Preliminary Analysis of Access to Justice Problems in Rural Areas\u201d 161 North, Central, Northeast, and South regions 162 Mae Hong Son, Chiang Mai, Pitsanulok, KhonKaen, Pattani (or Yala), and Trang Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 81 While this is an ongoing research project, some observations have already been made. Organisation Each research group is led by an expert/professor specialising in a particular legal area pertaining to one of the four pillars, such as criminal law, land law or labour law. In the recently completed desk review phase, teams analysed laws at the statutory law/\u2018Act\u2019 level. This analysis will be complemented by consultations with specialists concentrating on each of the issues composed by representatives of civil society, congressional groupings, the attorney general and provincial officers. At a subsequent stage, the work may evolve into a full-scale access to justice assessment. So far, results from the desk review have been submitted to the Thai government\u2019s reform committee and sub-committee on justice reform. Research Objectives The research objectives are threefold. First, to revise and evaluate various issues in laws and the legal process relating to existing laws, legal actions and government policy implementation which affect the poor, the underprivileged, minorities and vulnerable groups. Second, to show possibilities for improving the conditions of the four target groups within the existing legal framework. Third, to suggest ways of improving law and policy changes to empower the target groups through better protection of basic human rights and development. Another expected benefit of the research is the potential for stakeholders such as government agencies, state enterprises, private organisations and the public to realise the importance of the problem and to stimulate the implementation of solutions for these problems. Document research This phase consists of comprehensive desk reviews whereby teams gather and analyse legal and non-legal documents which may impact the four aforementioned target groups. Documents examined include laws currently in effect as well as state policies. The scope encompasses sources of law such as the constitution, acts, statutes, emergency decrees and other secondary laws, as well as state policies such as current government policies, the National Economic and Social Development Plan. Strategies such as short and long- term action plans of ministries, government departments and other state agencies are also included. 82 Methods of Identifying Regulatory and Legislative Barriers to Empowering the Poor Findings of the document research The study proposes recommendations according to which area of law within the four pillars deserve particular attention and would benefit from improvement, thereby enhancing the target populations\u2019 capacity to access justice.

Suggested solutions, in line with the recommendations of CLEP, consist of: ensuring legal identity for all; repealing or modifying laws that are biased against the poor; facilitating creation of state and civil society organisations working in the interest of the excluded; establishing a legitimate state monopoly on the means of coercion; making the formal judicial system, land administration system, and relevant public institutions more accessible by recognising and integrating customary and informal legal procedures with which the poor are already familiar; encouraging courts to give due consideration to the interests of the poor; supporting alternative dispute resolution mechanisms; fostering and institutionalising access to legal services so that the poor will know about laws and are able to take advantage of them; and supporting measures for legal empowerment of women, minorities, refugees and internally displaced persons and indigenous peoples. In the area of property rights, the study finds problems in property management systems and loss of agricultural lands which link to other rights. Suggested remedies include introduction of efficient management of property, determination of property rights, lands and building taxation and land-use zoning. Reference is also made to the concept of community title deeds and a land bank which could effectively address land systems management, land allocation and prevention from loss of land to capital. Issues identified in the area of labour rights pertain to obstacles in establishing labour unions whereby the definition of \u2018employee\u2019 is exclusive many and the promoter (or committee member) must be a Thai national. Other labour rights issues include social security coverage excluding the informal sector, precisely those who are most vulnerable to risks social security ought to address, and the problem of protection constraints which exclude agricultural labourers and home workers, among others, from potential compensation. In business rights, the research highlighted restrictions preventing aliens and stateless persons from operating certain types of businesses, restrictions of informal businesses in accessing competitive tenders, and restrictions in law for accessing domestic and international markets as well as in government support. Such restrictions are found to be symptoms of laws and regulations biased against the poor. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 83 Brainstorming sessions and in-depth interviews Several brainstorming sessions will complement the findings with ideas and opinions from stakeholders on how laws affect the four target groups. One session consists of a workshop with the various target groups, another session hears views from experts, including academics and state practitioners in areas relating to the four \u2018pillars\u2019 of LEP. Case studies The research team will collect and develop case studies on LEP to document causes of disempowerment and possible solutions, taking into account diversities of the target groups. Reflections The outcome of the legislative review is a first step towards enhancing understanding of how legal and policy frameworks impact the lives of the poor and disadvantaged. It will help pinpoint remedies to remove obstacles holding poor people back from opportunities to live a better and more equitable future and pave the way for informed decisions aimed at making the law work for everyone. In contrast to ILD methodology, this study, by its very nature (and as the term \u2018desk review\u2019 of course suggests), focuses more on the law \u2018in the books\u2019 rather than on how the application (or non-application) of laws and informal rules affect people\u2019s daily lives. Rather than sending scores of researchers to survey thousands of people on the ground, it can be conducted at a much smaller scale from the confines of an academic institution. A university\u2019s reputation, network of contacts with government and influence in the law- making process are determining factors introducing policy changes as a result of the recommendation.

Access to Justice Assessments: Seeking perspectives of claim holders and duty bearers to identify gaps and needs Access to Justice (A2J) assessments provide a natural entry point to conduct exercises that seek to uncover regulatory and legislative barriers to empowering the poor.

By integrating a human rights-based approach, access to justice assessments methodically evaluate the experiences of specific disadvantaged groups in accessing justice. To accurately reflect the true picture, access to justice assessments must base themselves on perceptions, priorities and experiences of the poor. Using a mix of qualitative and quantitative empirical research methods such as surveys, focus group discussions, interviews and stratified random sampling, access to justice assessments focuses on understanding how injustice affects the daily lives of impoverished and marginalised people. Access to justice assessments can reveal telling disaggregated data on gender and other inequities within the assessment population useful in formulating policy recommendations to improve people\u2019s lives.164The following is a synopsis of Indonesia\u2019s access to justice assessment which took a broad approach to justice from the perspective of poor and disadvantaged people. Assessment of Access to Justice in Indonesia From 2004 to 2006, UNDP and BAPPENAS, the National Development Planning Agency of Indonesia, conducted a comprehensive assessment of access to justice for the most disadvantaged populations in five post-conflict provinces165 with an aim of better understanding and promoting access to justice in Indonesia.166The access to justice assessment, methodologies applied, as well as findings and recommendations are described in the joint UNDP-BAPPENAS report, Justice for All? An Assessment of Access to Justice in Five Provinces of Indonesia. A summary follows but the main focus detailed below pertains to the methodologies used. A key finding of the assessment which is also quite relevant to the LEP context is that respondents throughout the five provinces emphasised the economic dimension of justice. The study attributes this to a reflection of the priorities of communities where the many challenges of maintaining an adequate livelihood are of paramount concern. Respondents across all provinces studied cited, \u2018equality, evenness and non-discrimination in the distribution of government services and assistance\u2019 are essential to achieving justice. In particular, interviewees and focus group discussion (FGD) participants raised concerns relating to access to government services and assistance, ownership and management of land and natural resources, gender violence and discrimination, employment and labour 163 Making Everyone Work for Legal Empowerment of the Poor\u2013Report of the Regional Dialogue on Legal Empowerment of the Poor 3-5 March 2009, Bangkok (UNDP, 2009), 5. 164 UNDP, BAPPENAS \u2018Justice for All?

Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 85 rights, criminality and inadequate law, enforcement, post-conflict security, as well as property rights and other issues.167 The assessment also found that community awareness of rights remains low, villagers in most cases preferred the informal justice system, and that legal aid and other legal services are lacking and inadequate. In relation to the formal justice system, the study found that the police was the most frequently accessed formal justice institution, prosecutors have low community profile and courts are seen as expensive and unfair. With respect to the informal justice system, the assessment showed that arbitrary decision-making and discrimination against women and minority groups are two main reasons why informal justice may fail to produce fair outcomes. It also found that women are underrepresented, if not unrepresented on village decision-making bodies and as informal decision-makers.168 A significant conclusion from the report is that most issues mentioned by respondents as persistent sources of injustice do not lend themselves well to resolution through the informal justice system. Disputes involving parties outside the village structure, such as government agencies, corporations or someone from a neighbouring village, are often beyond the effective jurisdiction of informal justice mechanisms.169 \u2018The crux of the problem for many communities therefore lies in the fundamental mismatch between citizens\u2019 relative preference for the informal justice system and the fact that the most commonly cited cases of serious injustice are largely unsuitable for resolution via this forum\u2019170 The report presented five key recommendations to government, donors and civil society. 1.

The five teams based in the Faculty of Law at the State University of each of the five provinces172displayed diversity in terms of ethnicity, religion and gender, and comprised academics as well as workers from civil society organisations.173Assessment locations were selected based on criteria developed in consultation with research teams. The criteria for assessment places took into consideration variance in terms of the intensity of conflict previously experienced, ethnic or religious homogeneity, strength of traditional adat174 justice systems, proximity to the provincial capital, and levels of poverty and development. Indonesia\u2019s access to justice assessment is grounded in qualitative and quantitative research175.On one hand, qualitative approaches, although likely to be more onerous, often produce more nuanced and complete data in an LEP context176. Quantitative data, on the other hand, can be useful in validating qualitative results and opening the possibility for data aggregation and statistical analysis (e.g. comparisons across geographical areas or with official data, or over time).On top of helping to identify bottlenecks that may prevent disadvantaged people from accessing justice, the results of both qualitative and quantitative research provide a baseline against which future progress can be measured, especially during the monitoring and evaluation phases. In the case of Indonesia, qualitative data was gathered through socio-economic mapping, focus group discussions, secondary sources, and interviews. To complement the above, quantitative research comprised a survey using a stratified random sampling method to quantify community attitudes towards the formal and informal justices systems. 171 \u201cNational Strategy on Access to Justice\u2013LEAD Fact Sheet.pdf\u201d, n.d., http://www.snap-undp.org/ lepknowledgebank/Public%20Document%20Library/National%20Strategy%20on%20Access%20to%20 Justice%20-%20LEAD%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf. 172 Selected on the basis that they were among the top ten priority provinces, ten priority provinces for UNDP in Indonesia, having low human development indices, high poverty rates and a proneness to crisis 173 Justice for All\u2013An Assessment of Access to Justice in Five Provinces of Indonesia, 33. 174 Custom and tradition; adat law is customary law 175 Crosby and Brinkerhoff (referenced in CLEP Report Vol. II) recommend using qualitative rather than quantitative approaches in monitoring the system, as they offer a more complete and nuanced set of data that are numeric and narrative. 176 Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor.;United Nations Development Programme., Making the law work for everyone.

In addition, in each village one group labelled \u2018disadvantaged group\u2019 was so defined because it was either worse off than the other groups in the village or because it was a unique type of group that had not been selected in any of the other villages.

Secondary resources analysed as part of a desk review can be useful for informing research about the formal system, however, information available on its informal counterpart is usually far scarcer. Often, the level of detail in terms of aggregate data may be insufficient for the purposes of the assessment. While courts may generate statistics on annual case filings, court documents often lack more detailed information such as the type of case or delays.182 Analysing laws and regulations on the book has merits as well but all too often, what happens in reality differs from what stands de jure. Interviews Individual interviews are onerous but can yield detailed and unique insights into people\u2019s experiences and perceptions which can lead researchers to learn about bottlenecks not previously considered. Approximately 700 in-depth interviews were conducted for the Indonesia access to justice assessment. The majority of those interviewed where ordinary villagers. However, village-level community and religious leaders, sub-district officials, police, prosecutors, lawyers, judges and other duty-bearers were also interviewed.183 Beyond the interviewee, several factors affect information obtained through interviews. Bias can result from whether the interview is structured or unstructured, who does the interviewing, what questions are asked and how they are asked. An example from a pilot study in Thailand184 illustrates the unintended consequence of having a community representative personally interview poor members of the community. In this case, the subjects were requested to disclose personal information, including their income, to someone from their village who was likely in a more powerful position than they. Their ability to refuse to provide this information would have been quite limited. Even though the community driven approach was well intended, the villager\u2019s basic right to privacy would most likely have been violated. 181 Ibid. 182 Dory Reiling, Linn Hammergren, and Adrian di Giovanni, \u201cJustice Sector Assessments\u2013A Handbook\u201d, n.d., 33, http://go.worldbank.org/IKYSX5GYX0. 183 Justice for All\u2013An Assessment of Access to Justice in Five Provinces of Indonesia, 34. 184 \u201cUndertaking a Human Rights-Based Approach: Lessons for Policy, Planning and Programming\u201d (UNESCO, 2008), 18. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 89 Stratified random sampling Stratified random sampling is a statistical technique used to improve the efficiency of sample design185. It enhances the representativeness of a sample and reduces its statistical error by dividing members of the population into homogenous subgroups, e.g. geographical areas, age groups, genders, or income. For the Indonesia assessment, a survey comprising approximately 4500 respondents was conducted across the five provinces. For each village, one group consisting of 30 men and 30 women classified as members of the chosen disadvantaged group, and another consisting of 30 men and 30 women not considered as members of the disadvantaged group for that village were surveyed.186 A key advantage of using a stratified sample is that it can be more precise than simple random sampling, given equal sample size. This often permits smaller sample sizes which saves time and money. However, this technique generally requires more effort in administering the survey and analysing the data as opposed to simple random sampling.187 Reflections By its very nature, an access to justice assessment is almost entirely based on perceptions.

Equally important is the balance between involvement of the government, NGOs, CBOs \u2013 especially groups representing the interests of the marginalised. 185 Anon., \u201cFormalizing the Concepts: STRATIFICATION\u201d (World Bank, n.d.), http://siteresources.worldbank.org/ INTPOVRES/Resources/477227-1142020443961/2311843-1142870725726/2337154-1201128554535/ JUAN_02_Stratification.ppt. 186 Justice for All\u2013An Assessment of Access to Justice in Five Provinces of Indonesia, 34. 187 \u201cStatistics Tutorial: Stratified Random Sampling\u201d, n.d., http://stattrek.com/lesson6/str.aspx. 188 \u201cBangkok\u2013Regional consultation on access to justice assessments | Governance Assessment Portal\u201d, n.d., http://www.gaportal.org/bangkok-regional-consultation-access-to-justice-assessments. 90 Methods of Identifying Regulatory and Legislative Barriers to Empowering the Poor One of the overall conclusions of the Regional Consultations on Access to Justice Assessments that took place in Bangkok in October 2010, is that access to justice assessments can only result in concrete improvement in access to justice if the specific conditions of that country and society are realistically taken into consideration within a custom-tailored plan and with direct involvement of all concerned stakeholders at the national and local level189. \u201cUNDP and the National Development Planning Agency, as well as other United Nations agencies, the World Bank and civil society organizations, collaborated closely to draft the country\u2019s National Strategy on Access to Justice. The national strategy recognizes access to justice for the poor as a critical means of eradicating poverty, focuses on society\u2019s most disadvantaged and marginalized groups and recommends that government policies across all sectors must seek explicitly to reach the most vulnerable persons and communities.\u201d Box 3\u2013Source: Report of the Secretary-General on Legal Empowerment of the Poor and Eradication of Poverty A/64/133 4. World Bank\u2019s Doing Business: Engaging the private sector for data collection and identified best practices for \u2018doing business\u2019 Description The underlying purpose of the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business (DB) report is \u2018to provide an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for businesses.190 The report analyses small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and measures operating regulations throughout their lifecycle. This gauges the impact of government rule-making on the cost of doing business. DB 2011 covers 183 countries and presents indicators measuring business regulation and the protection of property rights in the context of businesses. For instance, indicators show the number of procedures that must be completed to start a business or to register and transfer commercial property. They also measure regulatory outcomes, including the time and cost to enforce a contract, go through bankruptcy procedures or trade across borders. Moreover, they take a look at protections of property, by analysing, for example, how investors are protected against looting by company directors or the types of assets that can be used as collateral for credit. There are also indicators about tax burden on businesses and different aspects of employment regulation.191It links into the concept of legal empowerment by highlighting 189 \u201cBangkok\u2013Regional consultation on access to justice assessments | Governance Assessment Portal\u201d, n.d., http://www.gaportal.org/bangkok-regional-consultation-access-to-justice-assessments. 190 About Doing Business: measuring for impact (World Bank Doing Business, 2011), 1. 191 \u201cDoing Business 2011 Data Notes\u201d, 2011, http://www.doingbusiness.org/methodology/methodology-note.

A network of over 8000 professionals including commercial lawyers, notaries, judges, architects, trade logistics specialists and accountants contributed pro bono to DB research by submitting their responses192.DB defines respondents as \u201cprofessionals or government officials who routinely administer or advise on the legal and regulatory requirements covered in each Doing Business topic\u201d193. This has the advantage that data is gathered by professionals who regularly undertake the transactions involved. Respondents are able to gauge steps involved and the time it takes to complete administrative requirement fairly accurately.

An informal entrepreneur may have to spend considerable time finding out which procedures apply in the first place, then find a way to travel to the administrative office in the nearest town and stand in line. In the end, the entrepreneur may even end up paying or bribing the official for services that by law are supposed to be free of charge. The majority of indicators in DB are based on laws and regulations and most cost indicators are based on official fee schedules. Respondents fill out surveys and provide references to applicable laws, regulations and fee schedules. However, in many cases what happens in reality is different from what is written in the books. For indicators related to construction permits, contract enforcement and closing a business, for example, DB bases parts of the cost and time components on actual practice. This may introduce a certain amount of subjectivity194 but nevertheless provides useful insights into specific processes that closely reflect reality. 192 http://www.doingbusiness.org/contributors/doing-business/become-partner 193 About Doing Business: measuring for impact, 16. 194 Ibid., 15,16. 92 Methods of Identifying Regulatory and Legislative Barriers to Empowering the Poor Reflections DB data originates from readings of laws and regulations as well as time and motion indicators. The methodology is transparent, replicable and relatively cheap. However, DB usually assumes that companies operate under limited liability regimes as this is the most common business form in most economies. This excludes informal businesses that rarely have access to such risk sharing mechanisms let alone to the benefits that arise from legal identity. Apart from exceptional cases, DB focuses its analysis on the formal sector. Indirectly, however, this focus can also shed light on informality because where regulation is particularly onerous, levels of informality tend to be higher. Hence DB measures one set of factors that helps explain the existence of informality and guide policymakers towards potential reforms.195 Complementing DB results with the World Bank\u2019s Enterprise Surveys, which directly measure informality, provides an even clearer picture of the business environment. 5. National Consultations on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (LEP): Experiences from Bangladesh, Indonesia, and the Philippines National consultations on legal empowerment of the poor (LEP) provide an entry point for legislative and policy reform actions at the national level to help realize social and economic rights as well as achieve the MDGs. The recommendation from the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor was reiterated at the Regional Dialogue on LEP in Bangkok in March 2009. The report of the Regional Dialogue notes that national and sub- national initiatives should be defined by a national consultation on LEP196. The report also suggests creation of a national, inclusive multi-stakeholder mechanism as this will facilitate consensus building and buy-in from policymakers and other stakeholders, especially where issues are sensitive and complex. In 2006 and 2007 the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor organized national consultations by convening representatives from local governments, communities, academia, civil society, grassroots movements, the private sector and the media in over 20 countries covering five continents. The consultations helped ground the Commission\u2019s research and policy recommendations in local experiences and built national and regional ownership over the agenda. The meetings also served to galvanize regional and national attention on legal empowerment of the poor, and in a number of cases spurred national action by placing LEP issues on a country\u2019s development agenda. 195 Ibid., 13. 196 Making Everyone Work for Legal Empowerment of the Poor\u2013Report of the Regional Dialogue on Legal Empowerment of the Poor 3-5 March 2009, Bangkok, 21. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 93 Apart from building awareness, support and ownership, capturing local knowledge and experiences, setting the stages for a national platform for action and broadening the network of policymakers, technical experts and representatives of civil society contributing to LEP, a key goal of the national consultation process was to identify barriers to achieving legal empowerment within the country.197 The national consultation process was overseen by the secretariat of CLEP, organized with support from the respective UNDP country offices, but driven by a locally led partner institution. The lead-partner was chosen by the UNDP country office in consultation with the CLEP Secretariat and generally consisted of NGOs or research institutes. In some cases, the host government took on the role of the lead-partner in setting up and supporting the consultation process.

The modalities for the national conference consisted of four panels (one per \u2018pillar\u2019) and presentations followed by discussion. The lead institution and the UNDP CO selected four national authors who each drafted papers on one of the thematic areas of LEP. The working papers served to set the focus for debate in focus group meetings and at the national conference. The focus group meetings were an opportunity for a broad and representative range of national stakeholders to engage in debates about the meaning of LEP in their country context. Organizers made a special point to reflect gender balance and include representatives of indigenous peoples. Around 12-15 people participated in each of the four focus groups. Note takers drafted records that were subsequently presented to participants in the national conference. 80-100 participants ranging from local academics, NGO representatives, government officials and other relevant stakeholders attended the national conference. The following is a description of experiences and outputs from the national consultations of Bangladesh, Indonesia, and the Philippines. A brief summary of the main findings contained in the working papers or the national consultation report is provided below. The purpose is to demonstrate that national consultations can be an effective first step in mobilising stakeholders for LEP, getting an initial picture of the policy environment, identifying needs and gaps, and beginning to set the agenda for reforms. 197 National Consultations Concept Note; Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor, 2006; http://www.undp.org/legalempowerment/reports/National%20Consultation%20Reports/2.0.%20 Overview%20of%20Consultation%20Process%20Final.doc 94 Methods of Identifying Regulatory and Legislative Barriers to Empowering the Poor Bangladesh The lead-partner for national consultations in Bangladesh was the School of Law of BRAC University. Highlights from the Access to Justice working paper198 relate to a mix of systemic and psychological barriers that prevent the poor from accessing both formal and informal justice mechanisms; poor people tend to find remedies in the formal system ineffective; legal complexities, unfamiliarity, cost, delays, corruption and overemphasis on the normative aspects of the law repel the poor from the formal system; in accessing informal justice, poor people also face barriers in the form of bias, gender discrimination, corruption, change in rural social structure leading to a decline of the shaliskers199. A key recommendation is to reform the legal sector while strengthening and structuring the role of the informal justice sector and promoting NGO engagement. The Property Rights paper200 enumerates numerous difficulties with respect to poor people\u2019s access to property rights. The report notes that nearly 70% of people are landless; the poor have often been excluded from schemes aimed at providing land to the landless; there is a repressive land management and revenue collection system; the system is biased towards national and local elites; minorities, women and indigenous populations are particularly disadvantaged in accessing property rights and are frequently victims of eviction; only limited recognition of women\u2019 s right to immovable property exists in Muslim and Hindu Dayahaga201 law; there is a gap between the legal regime and its application. Recommendations include better implementation of existing laws; improvement of the Khas land distribution scheme; integrating property rights into poverty alleviation efforts; more NGO involvement; paying more attention to minorities, indigenous peoples and women. The paper on business rights202 bases some of its findings on case and field studies prepared as a result of interviewing poor entrepreneurs on their perception of threats and security issues concerning their business, factors that prevent them from expanding their business, acquiring assets and loans, problems they face selling goods and buying inputs and concerns regarding social security. The paper finds that entrepreneurs in the informal sector choose to operate informally to avoid the cost and effort of formalization (inc. incorporation, tax registration, licenses etc.) or because of lack of literacy and education in entrepreneurship.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09a8f6d2-6b7f-4917-a0d9-95f23e9b1d33": {"__data__": {"id_": "09a8f6d2-6b7f-4917-a0d9-95f23e9b1d33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9cac4cf5e1a47d2cfe15903f865b921bbb3d9437659641a78b134b43d0f0d4d"}, "2": {"node_id": "d7f37d2c-c810-4eae-b359-cb2f5a632cb6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a0d282cfe76a2790aa2ea83bb71056818b06907e81753fe16e14c894afd05b72"}}, "hash": "8c8cc4144ed40f7fadee7a21e8a1e2d4de237ddb7f426bd2730aa1561bb89a7f", "text": "or because of lack of literacy and education in entrepreneurship. 198 Ferdous Jahan, From the Rule of Law to Legal Empowerment of the Poor in Bangladesh: Towards an Agenda for Change; A2J Working Paper for the National Consultations 199 Shalish actually means- \u201cthe practice of gathering village elders for the resolution of local dispute\u201d (The Asia Foundation, 2002 cited in (see fn above); Shalishkers refers to the elders with role of mediator/adjudicators 200 Property Rights of the Poor, Working Paper for the National Consultations on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (Nijera Kori NGO, n.d.), http://www.undp.org/legalempowerment/reports/National%20 Consultation%20Reports/Country%20Files/4_Bangladesh/4_4_Property_Rights.pdf. 201 One of several schools of Hindu Law with a strong focus on inheritance procedure. 202 Legal mechanisms to empower informal business\u2013Bangladesh Perspective, Working Paper for the National Consultations on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (School of Law\u2013BRAC University, January", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "067c7f6e-8d72-4d50-8274-6b711fe5aac6": {"__data__": {"id_": "067c7f6e-8d72-4d50-8274-6b711fe5aac6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a5b279898d8ed113e51c1bae609e7bb875b6427b7ed2ea17391ca0ef83d0ffc"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d914edd-4fb5-4301-b676-a866594a81e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f127dd564739bac71c578ff9c9b2e265eea7bd771dd6fcb19cbc22be70930dd4"}}, "hash": "319cdccd08e1cd5d16a90f859140ad89da3bb13c597f83004f5685bd613924d1", "text": "2007), http://www.undp.org/legalempowerment/reports/National%20Consultation%20Reports/Country%20 Files/4_Bangladesh/4_5_%20Informal_Business_Rights.pdf. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 95 However, the document also notes that operating outside the law has considerable costs, especially in terms of lack of social protection, workers\u2019 benefits, and representation or voice. The paper recommends that business formalization initiatives take account of the interlinkages between business rights and the other three empowerment domains (access to justice, property and labour) ; that a Commission on the Informal Sector be established to coordinate research and promote business registration; that the statistical base on the subject be enhanced, that a mechanism to issue identity cards to informal entrepreneurs and a social fund for the informal sector be set up; that measure to improve working conditions and security, access to credit and financial services be implemented; that business regulations be simplified and that measures directed towards poor women entrepreneurs are put in place. Indonesia In its capacity as lead-partner, the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI) published a report on the national consultation on legal empowerment of the poor in Indonesia203 synthesizing the working papers, the results of the multi-stakeholder consultations and the national consultation itself. The report notes that many legal empowerment efforts had already been attempted in Indonesia but with mixed success. Recommendations for improving access to justice for the poor include: more sincerity in implementing the principle of justice; building the capacity of security forces; improving the efficiency of monitoring mechanisms; legal socialization for the poor, legal assistance and support services for the poor; synergizing A2J efforts; real support from the government to NGOs; dispelling stereotypes and eliminating discriminatory practices. In the area of property rights, the report underlines the need for evaluating policies that exaggerate privatization in terms of their effect on ordinary people\u2019s property rights; deriving legal documents on property rights from national culture, understanding the importance of properties\u2019 social value (e.g. farmland, forests, sea); rearranging the use of land to reduce agrarian conflict; for property policies to focus on women\u2019s rights. In the area of labour rights, recommendations include: reinforcing labour rights, providing social security for informal workers and increasing voice and representation in the informal sector, government protection of informal and formal workers according to universal principles, elimination of all policies failing to meet human rights principles or violating constitutional rights, including the rights of women and minorities, proper implementation of Law no.04/2004 on a National Social Security System, additional polices on migrant workers\u2019 rights, and concentration on fulfilling the rights of poor women labourers. 203 Legal Empowerment of the Poor: Lessons learned from Indonesia, National Consultations on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI), 2007), http://www.undp. org/legalempowerment/reports/National%20Consultation%20Reports/Country%20Files/13_ Indonesia/13_4_Legal_Empowerment_of_the_Poor_Lessons_Learned_from_Indonesia.pdf. 96 Methods of Identifying Regulatory and Legislative Barriers to Empowering the Poor Recommendations in the context of entrepreneurship, specifically the micro, small and medium enterprises call for more and better opportunities to access credit, tailored training programmes for entrepreneurs, more balanced industrial policies that are less biased against the interests of micro, small and medium enterprises; providing government protection to allow entrepreneurs to expand.

Millennium Development Goals (MDG) Acceleration Framework: UN Agencies identifying institutional bottlenecks to MDG 1 A staggering fact about poverty, which is not addressed explicitly in the MDGs, is that the vast majority of the world\u2019s poor live their daily lives in the informal or extralegal206sector, often excluded from the benefits of the rule of law. Poor women and men generally lack effective legal protection and recognition of their economic assets and transactions. They often have limited or no access to formal policy and welfare systems that make security available to all and complement informal systems of local security and care. The Millennium Development Goals Acceleration Framework provides multiple options for factoring LEP into action plans to help reach MDG targets by 2015. The Millennium Development Goals Acceleration Framework (MAF) is a tool developed by UNDP designed to assist countries in developing their own action plans to accelerate progress towards the MDGs by systematically identifying and addressing bottlenecks. A component of UNDPs MDG Breakthrough Strategy is based on the premise that if impediments hindering progress are known, these bottlenecks can be removed through the application of sound, evidence-based knowledge of what works.207 In short, the MAF suggests four methodical steps, three of which answer questions regarding what needs to happen to reach a particular MDG target; why this is not happening; how it can be made to happen, while the final step consists of formulating an action plan among all development partners to actually make it happen. In a nutshell, the MAF focuses on three dimensions: a diagnostic dimension to identify lagging MDGs and binding constraints, a prescriptive dimension where proven interventions for overcoming the constraints have been identified, and a roll-out dimension where support is provided to countries for MDG acceleration. In the diagnostic phase, lack of legal empowerment (rights and their realization) of the poor may be 206 See footnote 12 207 Unlocking progress: MDG acceleration on the road to 2015\u2013Lessons from the MDG Acceleration Framework pilot countries (UNDP, September 2010), http://content.undp.org/go/cms-service/download/asset?asset_ id=2844466. 98 Methods of Identifying Regulatory and Legislative Barriers to Empowering the Poor identified as a binding constraint in MDG achievement.

Box 4\u2013Source: Dolan &Kjorven, 2011 At the beginning of 2010, the MAF was rolled out for field testing to 10 pilot countries.

Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 99 MAF Methodology: Developing an MDG Action Plan or \u2018Acceleration Compact\u2019 Four sequential steps to drawing up an MDG action plan 1. Identification of the necessary interventions to achieve the MDG target: Identify the MDG target (i.e. the one that is off track or unlikely to be met if \u2018business as usual\u2019 prevailed) and list the key interventions that are considered necessary to reach it. In many cases, key interventions can be taken from the national development plan, sector strategies and plans, and relevant policy planning document. 2. Identification of bottlenecks that impede the effectiveness of key interventions on the ground: Identify the bottleneck \u2013 the cause of the lack of complete success of each intervention listed in step 1. Bottlenecks should then be prioritized in terms of their potential impact on the MDG target. Bottlenecks have a tendency to either be cross- cutting, affecting several MDGs simultaneously, or specific, mainly affecting the MDG in question. In addition, it is useful to classify the bottleneck into one of four categories: policy and planning, budget and financing, service delivery and service utilization. 3. Identification of high-impact and feasible solutions to prioritized bottlenecks: Review feasible solutions and rank them according to their impact (magnitude, speed, sustainability, assessment of adverse effects) and feasibility (enabling environment including governance, capacity and funding availability). Describe each solution by a set of activities to be implemented by entities best placed to do so. Solutions can come from within the country or as adaptations of other country\u2019s solutions. But it is noteworthy that solutions may need to be complemented by additional, longer term measures to improve the enabling environment and sustain gains. This is another entry point for LEP measures. 4. formulation of an action plan, with identified roles for all development partners, that will help realize the solutions: Combine activities paired with their identified implementers to constitute the MAF Action Plan (or MDG Acceleration Compact) which may engage a broad range of relevant key players, while also helping in designing a monitoring and evaluation plan based on each of the partners\u2019 roles.

Lao PDR\u2019s MDG Acceleration Framework Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR) is one of the 10 pilot countries participating in the roll-out of the MAF, the only participant in continental Asia. Lao PDR\u2019s ambitious action plan covers key sectors such as infrastructure, energy, sustainable agriculture, environmental management, education, gender, health and water sanitation. The additional efforts therefore cover all MDGs 211. It builds upon ongoing and planned initiatives in the country such as recommendations of the MDG Progress Report and the Mid-term Review of the 6th Plan. Where appropriate, these are complemented by innovative initiatives serving to help close specific development gaps.212 For purposes of this chapter, focus is concentrated on MDG 1. The 2008 MDG Progress Report identifies Lao PDR as being on track for reaching the target of reducing poverty by half; However, the nation is seriously off track concerning the target of reducing hunger by half213. Accordingly, one of the six priority areas identified in the Lao PDR MAF for accelerating MDG achievement is \u201cSustainable practices for improved food security and environment\u201d. To inform the diagnosis, the Lao PDR MAF draws from existing research (rather than embarking outright on new, potentially onerous, duplicative and delaying data gathering) on locations of the poor, regions with an insecure food supply and the scope of food insecurity from the Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Assessment published by the World Food Programme. One of eight strategies for MDG acceleration in the agriculture and environment priority proposed in the Laos PDR MAF is improving incomes of the rural poor. Particularly interesting from an LEP perspective are interventions on improving access to formal credit and implementing a policy of community participation in issues related to land use. In basic terms the food security or, \u2018LEP nexus\u2019 can be understood as follows: Access to land or secure tenure can improve investment in agriculture and food production. Selling agricultural produce provides opportunities for generating income, which can be used to buy food. In addition to enhancing food security through these means, land has a safety net function which can reduce poor people\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks, induced, for example, by food or economic crises or climate change. Indeed, Lao PDR\u2019s MAF recognizes access to formal credit as an essential factor for improving economic opportunities for the poor therefore, the MAF suggests reforming the bank loan structure to support agricultural loans that extend beyond the scale of 211 Accelerating Progress Towards the MDGs Innovative options for reaching the unreached\u2013Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. 212 Ibid. 213 Ibid., Table I\u20131. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 101 microloans and that are non-discriminatory to women, while expanding service reach. The Lao MAF also recognizes that land titling can be very important for food security and recommends that \u201cland reforms should include a process of land titling to ensure that sustainable agricultural practices can be enhanced.\u201d214 Lao PDR\u2019s MAF also notes the that land ownership is often demanded as collateral for obtaining credit and that security of land ownership can be integrally connected to investments aimed at increasing agricultural productivity and land use management. Conceding that land reform and titling are long-term activities, the MAF recommends that in the interim, a policy on participation of local communities in decisions related to the allocation of concessions and changes in land use be implemented.215 Lao PDR\u2019s framework, and in particular its recommendations for specific actions, subsequently fed into preparation of the Lao PDR\u2019s 7th National Socio-Economic Development Plan216. Implementation of the LMAF is coordinated and monitored by existing structures set up under the Lao PDR Round Table process, which brings together representatives from the government, donor agencies, international organizations, international NGOs and civil society.217 Reflections This example demonstrates that national MAFs can be useful in systematically identifying lagging MDGs as well as solutions to overcome constraints by bringing together national and international stakeholders to focus on common strategies and goals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3950c33-9037-4fc4-beeb-312e2b2d7195": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3950c33-9037-4fc4-beeb-312e2b2d7195", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "598e0d01a08e70d2b6b6468e0ddc5a1eebe6ef0808a3ac5c38ff56c34e6943cc"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c5e09a4-b60f-4d5c-8dfc-094c8de32206", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6df5d7e06ed3767b379c176f1eeeabaf763de0d6d7c035a66a347a4e4d797bd"}}, "hash": "2940d0d51ae1f580a4046cef772dbbfb2eada72e9bd2628e9f24384dc0d87304", "text": "Nonetheless, the financial resource needs of such ambitious plans must not be underestimated.

Legislative reviews by universities emphasise laws in the formal sense, as they appear \u201cin the books\u201d. As a first step in analysing how the legal and policy frameworks affect the lives of the poor and disadvantaged, it provides for a relatively cost-effective and comprehensive study that can form the basis of policy recommendations feeding into the political and legal reform process. It also has the positive side-effect of elevating considerations of legal empowerment in the academic discourse. While valuable in their own right, Access to Justice assessments provide opportunities for including other pillars of legal empowerment in assessments, thereby taking advantage of proven assessment methodologies. Crucially, this can also be an effective way of ensuring studies relating to the other pillars integrate a Human Rights-based approach. By emphasising the perspective of the poor and otherwise marginalized, such \u2018enhanced\u2019 Access to Justice assessments can provide accurate reflections of these groups\u2019 experience in accessing justice per se but also in the context of property rights, labour rights or business rights. While the Doing Business Report does not explicitly focus on business regulation and law aspects as they relate to informality (or other legal empowerment dimensions), it is the methodology, if applied to the legal empowerment context, which is of interest. Embedding LEP-relevant questions into surveys and taking advantage of the DBs extensive network of (voluntary) expert/practitioners could yield important insights into regulatory and legislative barriers to empowering the poor across cities and regions and provide incentives for developing the capacities of legal aid centres, for example, to collect and submit relevant data on an on-going basis. The cost effectiveness of the DB methodology is particularly appealing. National consultations offer a platform for discussions among stakeholders, place LEP issues on a country\u2019s agenda and can be an effective way of building consensus on reform proposals, thereby allowing for smoother implementation of reforms that are broadly accepted and sustainable. At the same time, national consultations generate great expectations which left unmet can lead to disillusionment and damage the credibility of reformers as well as the reputation of LEP as a strategy for poverty eradication. The MDG Acceleration Framework enables governments and development partners, within established national processes, to identify and systematically prioritize bottlenecks blocking MDG progress, including reaching the poor and marginalized, and then devise ways to overcome these bottlenecks. By breaking down silos between sectors, MDGs, and disciplines, the framework fosters an evidence-based, cross-sectoral, and problem-solving approach that can result in accelerated progress on the MDGs.

India\u2019s recent experience with the \u2018right to food\u2019 campaign underscores the importance of strong and effective public action within a democratic framework to end human poverty. It points to the need for building a broad coalition of support as well as forging partnerships with and beyond government to include multiple stakeholders to design, refine and evolve a policy consensus. It also highlights the significance of putting in place constructive pre-legislative (and policy) processes to create public awareness, utilize evidence, dispel misconceptions, generate options and stimulate public discussions as necessary inputs into the formulation of laws and policies. The idea of human development\u2013broadly defined as an enhancement of capabilities, a widening of choices, and an expansion of freedoms \u2013has had a profound impact, in recent years, on development thinking and policy. From a human development perspective, the focus of policymaking shifts from means\u2013an emphasis on economic growth\u2013to ends (asking whether people are enjoying more freedoms; \u2018to do what they want to do and be what they want to be\u2019.218 Similarly, poverty within the human development framework is viewed not narrowly as income deprivation, but as a denial of freedoms\u2013economic, social, cultural and political. This in turn is traced to inadequacies and inequalities in the distribution of opportunities \u2013- between women and men, across regions, between rural and urban areas, and within communities. The idea of human development has been considerably enriched by the human rights discourse through highlighting the importance of both moral consensus and legal obligations. Human rights and human development \u201cshare a common vision and a common purpose \u2013 to secure the freedom, well-being and dignity of all people 218 See Sen, Amartya (1999), \u201cDevelopment as Freedom\u201d, Oxford University Press, New Delhi.

It is the State\u2019s business to create the enabling environment and provide sufficient resources for ensuring universal access to basic social and other services. From a rights perspective, poverty represents a denial of basic entitlements \u2013 to education, health, nutrition, and other constituents of decent living.220A rapid and equitable expansion of freedoms is therefore crucial for ending human poverty. At the same time, by highlighting the importance of accountability, transparency and the rule of law, the human rights perspective lends support to processes that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "edc2899d-f7fb-4d01-ba28-ebe2575cc30b": {"__data__": {"id_": "edc2899d-f7fb-4d01-ba28-ebe2575cc30b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "415ebc4fed5cba1945e934f73daa421169083de981f290de97973c03c32f5703"}}, "hash": "415ebc4fed5cba1945e934f73daa421169083de981f290de97973c03c32f5703", "text": "encourage participation, protection and empowerment of the poor. Rights and development: The on-going debate Several misgivings and concerns continue to dominate policy discussions surrounding human rights and development. The first has to do with the universalism of human rights. Some policymakers question the idea of a set of human rights having \u2018universal\u2019 validity cutting across different religions, traditions and customs. Manifestations of this concern are frequently observed in debates surrounding women\u2019s rights or reproductive and sexual rights. Others have questioned the usefulness of making certain rights universal when, in their view, many \u2018social\u2019 rights, such as the right to food, are best targeted towards the poor. A second issue concerns prioritization of rights. At one level, it is true that no one set of rights is more important than another. For instance, it cannot be argued that fulfilling social and economic rights has a greater urgency than assuring civil and political rights. However, from a practical standpoint, what happens in view of the resource constraints societies face? Do some rights get precedence over other rights? This raises a third issue relating to resource availability. What is the point of the State guaranteeing rights if it does not have the financial and other resources to fulfill the rights? Countries have dealt with this dilemma in different ways. Some include such rights in their constitutions without the expectation of immediately fulfilling it. In India, for instance, this is precisely why the right to education was not included as a fundamental right under the Constitution of India when it was drafted in 1949. Instead, Article 45 of the Directive Principles of State Policy, recognizing that the country at the time of Independence in 1947 did not have sufficient resources, stated that \u201cThe State shall endeavour to provide, within a period of ten years from the commencement of this Constitution, for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years.\u201d221A fourth issue has to do with 219 See in particular United Nations Development Programme (1998), \u201cHuman development and human rights: Report on the Oslo Symposium 2-3 October 1998\u201d, Organized by United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, United Nations Development Programme , New York and United Nations Development Programme (2000), \u201cHuman Development Report 2000\u201d, Oxford University Press, New York. 220 For a comprehensive discussion see, in particular, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (2001), \u201cMillennium Report\u2013Human Rights and Poverty Eradication: A Talisman for the Commonwealth\u2019, New Delhi. And Centre of Development and Human Rights (2004), \u201cThe right to development: A Primer\u201d, Sage Publications, New Delhi, 221 Only in 2002, by the 86th Constitutional Amendment was the right to education made a fundamental right. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 107 collective responsibility for assurance of rights. If the fulfillment of rights is a collective responsibility, then who can specifically be held responsible for their non-fulfillment? Does collective responsibility soon become nobody\u2019s responsibility? Open discussions over time have contributed to resolving many of these issues. A broad consensus has emerged on the universality of human rights. Take the case of child rights as an example. Adopting the framework of rights for assessing the well-being of children offers several advantages. The emphasis on universalism ensures that all children, regardless of caste, class, race, or religion, are assured the same rights. The framework\u2019s emphasis on non-discrimination helps to better understand concerns of exclusion faced by socially and historically disadvantaged communities. Focus on the rights of children for survival, development and protection links these rights to freedoms \u2013 freedom from hunger, freedom from fear, freedom from avoidable morbidity and so on. A human rights approachoffers other advantages as well. It helps to better understand the agency of women \u2013 so critical for the well-being of children \u2013 by assessing gender equality and gender justice. Moreover, the fulfillment of child rights requires active involvement of multiple stakeholders \u2013 governments, communities, and agents inside and outside the family. By underscoring the importance of rights and corresponding duties of various actors, the children\u2019s rights perspective underscores the need for an integrated social approach that can accommodate multiple interventions along simultaneous fronts. Furthermore, the human rights argument offers a strong ethical and moral justification for interventions intended to promote the well-being of children. Do rights have any meaning if they cannot be legally enforced? Does the fact that some human rights cannot be fulfilled today make these rights redundant?

AmartyaSen argues that these are wrong questions to ask. He points out that human rights are different from legal rights; human rights exist whether or not makers and interpreters of law have had the opportunity to reflect these rights in actual legislation. Similarly, one should distinguish between an unrealized and a non-existing right. As a matter of fact, recognizing a right opens up the possibility and the obligation for society to do something \u2013 even if it is over time \u2013 for the fulfilment of the particular right. Sen refers to this as \u2018the social role of human rights in translating an ethical value into practical action aimed at promoting that ethic.\u2019 Senalso points out that requiring a person to always exercise rights in his or her best self-interest is not a practical way of thinking about freedoms. There are many freedoms where \u2018the idea of freedom is not parasitic on the person taking control of the actual exercise of his or her freedom.\u2019 Sen gives the example of a passenger in an airplane. The freedom to fly safely is best left to others (in this case, the pilot) who know more about its fulfilment (about flight plans and cockpit operations). Similarly, given that we live in an inter-dependent world, the freedom from illnesses such as malaria cannot be assured by the individual himself as it would depend on public health actions initiated by the community and the State. 108 The Importance of Public Action in Realizing Social and Economic Rights: Lessons from India\u2019s Right to Food Campaign How does one integrate human rights into effective policy making that contributes to human development? How, for instance, can a rights perspective better inform and influence policy for the realization of the Millennium Development Goals? Take the case of MDG-1, namely \u2018eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.\u2019 Recent Indian experience suggests that building support for a rights-based approach to development and designing appropriate interventions calls for strategic and sustained public action. This is illustrated, for instance, in the recent efforts of India\u2019s Right to Food campaign to assure food and nutritional security. Building a coalition The Right to Food Campaign, which began in 2001 and continues to this date, is an informal network of organizations and individuals committed to the realization of the right to food in India. The Campaign believes that the primary responsibility for guaranteeing basic entitlements rests with the State. Realizing this right requires not only equitable and sustainable food systems, but also entitlements relating to livelihood security such as the right to work, land reform and social security.222One of the major achievements that can be at least partially attributed to the Campaign is the introduction of hot cooked meals for school-attending children across the country. Prior to 2005, children in school received \u2018dry rations\u2019 (or 3 kilograms of rice or wheat) every month. Today, more than 100 million children receive hot-cooked meals in school.This has had a significant impact in terms of ending classroom hunger, enhancing attentiveness in the classroom, boosting school enrolment and bridging social distances. It has thus contributed to not only attaining the MDGs on poverty, hunger and school attendance, but has also indirectly contributed to increased gender equality and better health of children across India. Several features of the Campaign have contributed to this \u2018success\u2019. First, the Right to Food Campaign has built a broad coalition of support for the right to food. The coalition includes eminent citizens (scholars, opinion leaders, scientists, activists) as well as many other networks and campaigns that align themselves with the cause. These include, for instance, the Bharat GyanVigyanSamiti (BGVS), Human Rights Law Network (HRLN), Jan SwathyaAbhiyan (JSA), National Conference of Dalit Organisations (NACDOR), National Alliance for the Fundamental Right to Education (NAFRE), National Alliance of People\u2019s Movements (NAPM), National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR), National Campaign for People\u2019s Right to Information (NCPCRI), National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) and People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL). The Campaign has also welcomed the involvement of political parties and other development organizations. An effective way this has been achieved is through participation in thematic groups.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ea04fdf-0f7d-4bbd-a8fa-c09bfdc539fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ea04fdf-0f7d-4bbd-a8fa-c09bfdc539fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59c3d37cb4e11971b078cd1a6d74e87b2e1126688e9d4d57c231aaab6ccd2666"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d39294e-5bab-4630-9777-cabf39fd8e62", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd01ad98dfdb369cfc486d28c0d9eaa1b3fe60849a8977d65dbc484216d83c9b"}}, "hash": "ade94c8f25214be199959332ded7a681db762e82160773719d646948165568b1", "text": "An effective way this has been achieved is through participation in thematic groups.

The Campaign has provided inputs to and interacted with the NAC which finalized details of the basic framework of a proposed National Food Security Bill in October 2010. Generating and using evidence Second, the Campaign has made systematic efforts to highlight problems concerning hunger and malnutrition in the country. This was completed by undertaking a wide range of activities including public hearings, rallies, protest marches, conventions, media advocacy, and lobbying Members of Parliament. For example, on April 9, 2002, several activities took place across the country as part of a national \u201cday of action on mid-day meals\u201d. Similarly, in May-June 2005, the Campaign facilitated the RozgarAdhikarYatra, a 50-day tour of India\u2019s poorest districts to demand the immediate enactment of a national Employment Guarantee Act. Four national conventions have been held so far in different cities: in 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2010. These efforts have helped to convert private awareness into public understanding, dispel vague perceptions, and draw attention to actual social conditions. The Campaign has also produced several easy-to-read booklets and pamphlets for mass circulation. These include the Mid-Day Meal Primer and Booklet on Mid-Day Meals in Primary Schools.224 Third, the Campaign has managed to successfully galvanize action research studies, directly and indirectly, to generate data and produce insights into the functioning of food delivery programmes. The Campaign has ensured easy access to several studies and field reports as well as surveys relating to mid-day meals undertaken by institutions across 223 The Campaign itself has a small Secretariat (consisting of three remunerated workers) that derives its mandate from the annual convention of the Right to Food Campaign, and plans its work in the light of the convention\u2019s deliberations and decisions. The Secretariat helps with the organisation of the annual convention of the Right to Food Campaign, undertakes follow-up activities after the annual convention, maintains the campaign website (www.righttofoodindia.org), circulates regular information about activities of the campaign, facilitates communication and coordination within the campaign, supports research, investigation and training, and capacity building processes and strengthening of the campaign (including training and material generation). The Secretariat is aided and supported by an Advisory Group. The Secretariat\u2019s work is funded by individual donations in rupees with no strings attached, without institutional support. 224 http://www.righttofoodindia.org/data/wsfmdm.pdf 110 The Importance of Public Action in Realizing Social and Economic Rights: Lessons from India\u2019s Right to Food Campaign the country.225 Results of public hearings are published as part of the Campaign\u2019s efforts for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of Court orders and administrative arrangements in support of the right to food. Evidence has also been effectively generated through a number of mediums including newspaper articles, research papers, television interviews etc. Leveraging the judicial system Fourth, the Campaign has successfully cooperated with the judiciary to extract several benefits for the poor. In April 2001, the People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) filed a \u201cwrit petition\u201d to the Supreme Court initiating public interest litigation (PIL) on the right to food arguing that foodgrains overflowing from storage facilities at the Food Corporation of India (FCI) should be used to protect people from hunger, for instance by launching food-for-work programmes, strengthening the public distribution system, and providing midday meals in primary schools. Initially, the case was brought against the Government of India, the Food Corporation of India (FCI), and six State Governments, in the context of inadequate drought relief. Subsequently, the case was extended to larger issues of chronic hunger and under-nutrition. All State Governments were added to the list of \u201crespondents\u201d.

However, most State Governments took much longer, prompting the Supreme Court to issue stern reminders from time to time. A series of follow-up orders were issued in April 2004 to speed up the implementation of earlier orders, improve the quality of mid-day meals, and address various concerns raised 225 http://www.righttofoodindia.org/mdm/mdm_surveys.html 226 Mandamus is Latin for \u201cwe order\u201d.

In October 2004, the Court noted that some progress had been made with the implementation of earlier orders on mid-day meals. However, feedback received from the States made it clear that in many cases, implementation was being held up by lack of funds. The Court directed the Central Government to provide financial assistance of \u201cone rupee per child per school day\u201d to meet cooking costs. The Court also clarified responsibility to monitor implementation of the mid-day meal scheme \u201cessentially lies with the Central Government\u201d. Again, the Court stressed the urgency of the situation and directed that \u201cevery child eligible for a cooked meal under the Mid- Day Scheme in all States and Union Territories shall be provided with the said meal immediately\u201d. By 2010, 700 \u201caffidavits\u201d were submitted by petitioners and respondents, 97 \u201cinterim applications\u201d were filed, and close to 150 \u201cinterim orders\u201d had been issued. Most interim orders consist of directions to central and state governments. This is because the prevention of hunger and starvation is \u201cone of the prime responsibilities of the Government\u2013whether Central or State\u201d, as the Court made clear from the very beginning. In the case of State Governments, the Chief Secretary is answerable to the Court on behalf of the government. In some circumstances (such as starvation deaths), the Court stated that the Chief Secretary himself or herself would be held \u201cresponsible\u201d for violations of the orders. As far as the Central Government is concerned, some orders are addressed to specific departments or ministries, such as the Ministry of Rural Development, the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the Department of Food and Public distribution under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution. In such cases, the Secretaries of these departments or ministries are responsible for the implementation of Supreme Court orders relevant to them. In the case of other orders, the Central Government is represented in Court by a team led by the Attorney General including the Solicitor General and three Additional Solicitor Generals. Each State and Union Territory is also represented by senior counsel in the hearings. Commissioners: On May 8, 2002, the Supreme Court appointed two Commissioners for the purpose of monitoring implementation of the interim orders. Commissioners are empowered to enquire into any violations of the interim orders and to demand redressal, with full authority of the Supreme Court.

By 2010, six detailed reports had been submitted to the Supreme Court as well as a number of other issue-specific reports addressing the non-compliance of specific orders of the Court. Assistants, nodal officers and advisers: In October 2002, the Supreme Court directed State Governments to appoint \u201cAssistants to the Commissioners\u201d. The mandate of the Assistants is to \u201crender such assistance to the Commissioners as the Commissioners may require\u201d. Assistants to the Commissioners are to be appointed by the Chief Secretary in consultation with Commissioners. In addition, each State Government is to appoint a \u201cNodal Officer\u201d for the purpose of \u201censuring due implementation\u201d of food-related schemes. The Nodal Officers are expected to \u201cprovide Commissioners full access to relevant records and provide relevant information\u201d. Commissioners in turn have also nominated their own \u201cAdvisors\u201d in each state to serve as a bridge between Commissioners, State Government, and various citizens\u2019 groups. Their brief includes sending periodic reports to the Commissioners, conducting enquiries in response to local complaints, sending appeals for intervention to Commissioners whenever required, organising research and surveys, working towards a more effective monitoring and redressal system, and liaisoning with State Governments on behalf of the Commissioners. The Supreme Court has also issued contempt notices to Chief Secretaries and other senior officials at the behest of the Commissioners. In such cases, the Chief Secretaries have been required to present themselves personally in the Supreme Court to answer for non-compliance of Supreme Court orders. In response to petitions by the Campaign, the Supreme Court has issued a number of directives requiring the State to initiate prompt action. Some examples are given below229: a. Timely compliance: \u201cAll such States and Union Territories who have not fully complied with the order dated 28th November, 2001 shall comply with said directions fully in respect of the entire State/Union Territory\u2026 not later than 1stSeptember , 2004.\u201d b. No charge: The meal is to be provided free of cost. Money for the meal is not to be collected from parents or children under any circumstances. c. Priority to cooks and helpers from marginalized groups: \u201cIn appointment of cooks and helpers, preference shall be given to Dalits, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\u201d d. Extension to summer vacations in drought-affected areas: \u201cIn drought- affected areas, mid-day meal shall be supplied even during summer vacations.\u201d e. Kitchen sheds: The Central Government was directed to \u201cmake provisions for construction of kitchen sheds\u201d and to contribute to the cooking costs. f. Quality improvements: \u201cAttempts shall be made for better infrastructure, improved facilities (safe drinking water etc.), closer monitoring (regular inspection) and other quality safeguards. Improvement of the contents of the meal shall be made to provide a nutritious meal to children of the primary schools.\u201d 229 For a more complete listing, see http://www.righttofoodindia.org/mdm/mdm_scorders.html accessed on January 10, 2012 Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 113 g.

Joint inspections of the grain are to be conducted by the FCI and State Governments. \u201cIf the food grain is found, on joint inspection, not to be of fair average quality, it will be replaced by the FCI prior to lifting.\u201d h.

Nevertheless, the Indian example demonstrates that Courts can gradually expand their constitutional role if they are supported by a broad policy consensus among policymakers and civil society. Fifth, a strength of the Campaign has been its ability to merge legal action with local action by mobilising communities around the issues of the right to food, both to ensure accountability at the grassroots as well as nationally to agitate for greater entitlements. This combination of mobilisation, combined with effective media advocacy, has been credited for the success of the Campaign in recent years. The Campaign draws its mobilisational strength from more than 1,500 organisations, including trade unions, NGOs and community based groups. In recent years, the campaign has become more inclusive with sex workers unions, trans-gender activists, people with disabilities and others joining the Steering Committee of the Campaign. Finding solutions Sixth, the Campaign has done well to propose \u2018solutions\u2019 and \u2018alternatives\u2019 \u2013 not merely criticize and find fault with existing schemes and programmes. For instance, it did not merely advocate an end to the system of \u2018dry rations\u2019 that school-children were entitled to before 2005.The Campaign made a strong case for introducing hot-cooked meals in schools. Over the years, the Campaign has pointed to design flaws, emphasized the role of different stakeholders, and made suggestions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery. In doing so, it was able to move from the political (or advocacy) to administrative zones of decision-making. Very cogent arguments were made in the Court by gathering evidence from different countries as well as from within India (in a few states 114 The Importance of Public Action in Realizing Social and Economic Rights: Lessons from India\u2019s Right to Food Campaign that were already serving hot meals to school children). The Campaign has been actively involved with government in spelling out the rules that should govern the implementation of the mid-day meal programme. Seventh, the Campaign has constantly encouraged public monitoring and evaluation. Several methods have been adopted including conduct of surveys, public hearings and social audits. Public hearings offer an opportunity for local administration to listen to and address grievances of individuals and the community. For example,VikasSahyog Kendra (a non-governmental organization), assisted by Gram SwarajAbhiyan, organized a public hearing on August 2, 2011 to review a number of public policies including the mid-day meals in schools in Chhatarpur block of Palamu district in the state of Jharkhand. Other public policies included (i) the public distribution system, (ii) social security schemes, (iii) the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS), and (iv) theIntegrated Child Development Scheme. Presiding over the hearings were the State Advisor to the Commissioner to the Supreme Court, the Deputy Commissioner of Palamau and the Deputy Development Commissioner.230 These public hearings and social audits offer a platform for individuals and the community to seek grievance redressal. They are also useful in providing real time feedback to the local administration and the community, as well as in finding solutions to problems with implementation. For instance, between January- April 2008, the M.V.Foundation231 facilitated a social audit of the Mid- Day Meal Scheme in 111 schools in Adilabad and Kurnool districts of Andhra Pradesh. The Social Audit team prepared and presented a detailed report in a gram sabha232 specially convened for the purpose \u2013 attended on average by about 80 \u2013 150 people consisting of parents, gram panchayat members, the school headmaster, the cooking agency persons and others from the village. The community participated enthusiastically in the gram sabha and, in most villages, questioned the headmaster and cooking agency when any discrepancy was revealed. Many constructive decisions were also taken, such as immediately shifting the rice from the cook\u2019s house to the school, minimising the role of the ration shop dealer, arranging for water facility in the school, and contributing funds for the purchase of plates and glasses for the children. In some villages, even major decisions such as replacing the cooks with more conscientious workers were taken at the community meetings. Suchmeetings have greatly helped to increase the community\u2019s awareness regarding the official provisions of the mid-day meal scheme. This has made communities more vigilant and supportive of the social audit team\u2019s efforts to regularly monitor the implementation of the mid-day meal scheme.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ced45e7b-dc85-44a9-a657-1d3dde291f72": {"__data__": {"id_": "ced45e7b-dc85-44a9-a657-1d3dde291f72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "17b6413f24b98d11d9edecdf3b89429bf075877e96f44a662d22680d8d39b371"}, "2": {"node_id": "a436576d-c78a-486b-ba7a-e9bc7606de47", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "697f599b66ba15500848d21dd6afa9adc758de8d0daac66eea1f99b5d4e8da20"}}, "hash": "b7607db9cbc90ebdc9e34137b6cf9f5f929b6be4b8ae2059319c5b7bea27f639", "text": "230 http://www.righttofoodindia.org/data/campaign/August_2011_public_hearing_meeting_district_ officials_palamu_2_august_2011.pdf 231 The MV Foundation is a voluntary organization working on issues of child labour and children\u2019s right to education. 232 A Gram Sabha consists of persons registered in the electoral rolls of the village or group of villages comprised within the area of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f8d45e0-923f-4f4c-a2cc-de1a71584bca": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f8d45e0-923f-4f4c-a2cc-de1a71584bca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aba7ede09cb51e06da53cd81dc0820fa213c2f7ef508a68d64134e2b19141430"}}, "hash": "aba7ede09cb51e06da53cd81dc0820fa213c2f7ef508a68d64134e2b19141430", "text": "Panchayat. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 115 Looking ahead What lessons can be drawn from the example of the Right to Food campaign for the rest of South Asia? First, the Indian experience underscores the importance of strong and effective public action for a human rights approach to gain currency within a democratic framework. The Indian example highlights the need for a constructive pre-legislative (and policy) process to create public awareness, utilize evidence, dispel misconceptions, generate options and stimulate public discussions. This points to the significance of forging partnerships with and beyond government to include multiple stakeholders who can design, refine and evolve a policy consensus. An equally important dimension is active and sustained engagement of communities with the design, implementation and monitoring of wellthought-out interventions. This has been India\u2019s experience with the introduction of other interventions as well such as the Right to Information Act and the Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Scheme233. Second, the Indian experience draws attention to some necessary conditions for ensuring desired outcomes of such public action. The first necessary condition is a conducive and supportive external political environment in the country. A political party and government in power who were both committed to ensuring food security contributed great support for the campaign. This facilitated an open and serious dialogue with the State. The second necessary condition is the presence of competent people to drive the Campaign. The Right to Food Campaign enjoyed high credibility both with government and the public. Individuals actively involved in promoting the Campaign included eminent social scientists, activists, experts, nutritionists, educationists and other professionals. This lent enormous credibility to the voice of the Campaign as much of the advocacy efforts were backed by rich evidence and rigorous analysis. An equally important systemic contributory factor has been the high rates of economic growth enjoyed by India in recent years. This has enabled the Government of India to channel the larger public revenues generated by the economic growth towards the mid-day meal scheme and other programmes. Third, it is easy to build broad societal consensus around some rights but not all. It was easy in the school feeding programme because it was rather non-controversial and involved children. This may not be the case with mobilizing support for other causes and rights. For example, it has been difficult to mobilize public action in support of the enforcement of several laws that affect the lives of young girls. In India, this would include the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2006. It would be even more difficult in the South Asian context to generate support for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights. 233 The MGNREG Act 2005 provides enhancement of livelihood security, giving atleast 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household, whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. For further details, see the official website accessible at http:// nrega.ap.gov.in/Nregs/Home_eng.jsp# 116 The Importance of Public Action in Realizing Social and Economic Rights: Lessons from India\u2019s Right to Food Campaign Fourth, effective public action requires efforts from by both State and non-State actors. The first responsibility of the State is to create a culture and policy environment in society where human rights are recognized, respected and promoted. Equally important is to inculcate a rights perspective in policy making. Instances of violation of human rights, especially when they are silent and invisible, should be addressed expeditiously. It is equally important for the State to introduce new and innovative ways of carrying out assessments by encouraging instruments such as public reports, independent social audits, and public hearings. The State must also promote greater transparency and openness as fundamental to ensuring accountability. Fifth, public action in defense of rights requires \u2018nudging\u2019 the State. To do this, we require strong networks and campaigns that champion policies and legislation to guarantee rights for the poor and disadvantaged. Often, this is not an easy task. Campaigns, like the Right to Food campaign in India, have had to invest considerable resources in generating evidence in support of their arguments, disseminating the findings, generating public discussion and communicating widely with a broad audience. These efforts have been backed by strategic forms of protests which in turn attracted the media to raise and keep alive issues in the public agenda. With the invasion of new media, we are likely to see new forms of public action as well. To conclude, the assurance of human rights can flourish in well-functioning democracies.

In this context, it would be important for every country to institute a well designed pre-legislative process that permits meaningful engagement with stakeholders before a policy or law is enacted. By seeking greater participation from a diverse set of groups and communities (especially those without voice), the outcomes of public action can be transformative and sustained. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 117 Affirmative Action as a Way and Means of Achieving Economic and Social Rights and the MDGs Alison Graham Summary The role structural discrimination and marginalization play in creating and exacerbating poverty is widely accepted, including in the Millennium Declaration. However, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remained silent on this issue. By using aggregate targets, structural discrimination and marginalization essentially mask inequalities and power imbalances. This chapter looks at how affirmative action (also known as special measures) such as preferential regimes in areas of employment, housing and education can be crucial in complementing development strategies to secure people\u2019s human rights and ensure progress towards achieving the MDGs benefits everyone, not just the privileged elites. Although widely used, affirmative action is still subject to misconceptions about its use and legal dimensions. This chapter clarifies the legal ramifications of affirmative action and details specifically what a rights-based approach to affirmative action entails and what conditions affirmative action measures must fulfil to comply with human rights standards and principles. The document concludes with suggestions for the role of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in securing effective affirmative action programmes that address structural discrimination and marginalisation. 1. Background: Why affirmative action? Imbalanced power relations are partly responsible for current levels of poverty in developing and developed countries.234 Structural and systematic discrimination as well as asymmetric power relations place certain groups including indigenous peoples, women, low caste communities, migrants and non-citizens at greater risk of living in poverty.235 These groups often have limited means of providing an adequate standard of living for themselves through denied access to education, land, or employment either directly or indirectly. Unable to participate in public life, the groups are often excluded and unable to influence policies and decisions directly affecting them. Once \u2018fallen\u2019 into poverty, the poor are exposed to systematic stigmatization and discrimination on the grounds of their poverty, perpetuating their situation.236 People living in poverty are for instance 234 See Claiming the Millennium Development Goals; A human rights approach, OHCHR , 2008 p. 4 235 This link between discrimination and poverty has been observed by many of the UN special procedures on human rights especially the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty (formerly known as the Independent Expert) and the Independent Expert on minority issues. 236 See Report of the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, Magdalena Sep\u00falveda Carmona, on the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights, A/HRC/15/41 6 August 2010, para 22. 118 Affirmative Action as a Way and Means of Achieving Economic and Social Rights and the MDGs more likely to live in geographically remote areas or urban areas with few transport links, creating difficulty for physically accessing jobs, markets, resources and essential services. The poor are also more likely to lack education, access to information about their rights and public policies, making it difficult for them to receive legal entitlements and realise their economic and social rights. This essentially creates a virtually inescapable vicious circle of poverty and marginalisation. Women face particular challenges as well. In many societies, entrenched gender discrimination limits women\u2019s access to education, employment, land, and political representation. Discrimination often confines women to working in the informal economy for casual and insufficient wages. For many women their situation deteriorates by suffering other forms of discrimination based on ethnicity, race, religion, disability, age, class or caste and/or other factors. In the Asia Pacific region, gender \u2018inequality persists despite robust growth and progress, and cuts even deeper for poorer or otherwise excluded groups.\u2019237 This results in women being more vulnerable to poverty with limited access to economic opportunities and extremely low levels of political representation in some parts of Asia.238 While rapid gains have been made in school enrolment and labour force participation, the Pacific region for instance has four of the six countries in the world with no women legislators.239 In South Asia, UNDP observes large gender gaps even in basic capabilities such as education, health nutrition and employment opportunities.240 Unless specific measures are taken to address structural and systematic discrimination,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d22183e0-d055-46e7-b0e8-a84ea9a613b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "d22183e0-d055-46e7-b0e8-a84ea9a613b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18aeb6a3fe7224da66b4aee240a17289bd42ef5fa71f0f4b0a7077b419fb4352"}, "3": {"node_id": "c9a2c2ae-d0cb-46d6-af41-d8f3793aab7c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b880045d24f035eadad17e5ad5ce171950a575ec186ad290945f7de082efcba8"}}, "hash": "26dc2fe2b3128a93d7980a14a8c7d3a72cb67819cc3805a100f1babf45fec044", "text": "development planning and implementation cannot benefit all. Equal treatment will reinforce power asymmetries and marginalisation, and skew realisation of the MDGs with policies and programmes benefitting the elites. This is evident by the fact that ten years into the new millennium, inequality often remains despite substantial progress in achieving the MDGs in aggregate terms. In May 2010, the High Commissioner for Human Rights noted, \u2018even in countries scoring major successes, large disparities still persist with millions of people left behind in the race towards achieving the MDGs\u2019241. Despite progress towards achieving the MDGs, in 2009 the UNDP Nepal Annual Report recognised the variation in human development to be much greater between caste and ethnic groups as opposed to regions and sub-regions with Dalits having a substantially lower life expectancy and per capita income in comparison to other caste groups.242 237 See Power Voice and Rights: Asia Pacific Human Development Report, UNDP 2010 238 ibid. 239 See Power Voice and Rights: Asia Pacific Development Report, UNDP 2010 p24 240 See Power Voice and Rights: Asia Pacific Development Report, UNDP 2010 p34 241 See speech of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Seminar on the Millennium Development Goals and human rights organised by the Government of the Netherlands on 28 May 2010 242 According to UNDP, Terai Dalits have the lowest life expectancy (61.3) and adult literacy (27.3) rates in all social groups. This contrasts sharply with the position of the higher caste (Brahmin, Chetri) of the Terai. They are ranked first with a life expectancy of 63.9 years, an adult literacy rate of 83.8% and an average of 6.4 years of schooling. The average per capita income of Dalits was NRs. 10,000.00, compared to national average of NRs. 15,000.00 and that of Brahmin Chhetri NRs. 18,400.00.

Governments can do this by using \u2018affirmative action\u2019 or \u2018special measures\u2019243. Affirmative action is generally regarded as temporary special measures allowing justifiable preferential treatment to correct past and present forms as well as impacts of discrimination. Affirmative action can reflect the full span of legislative, executive, administrative, budgetary and regulatory instruments, at every level in the State apparatus, as well as plans, policies, programmes and preferential regimes in areas such as employment, housing, education, culture, and participation in public life for disfavoured groups.244 Special measures can be: political such as quotas for political representation for women or certain underrepresented ethnic or religious groups; and/or socio economic such as quotas to remedy, for example, the disproportionate under-representation of certain marginalised groups in schools, employment and social housing, as well as targeted development interventions to certain types of applicants.245 Examples of such measures include grants to help certain communities living in poverty acquire land for settlement (South Africa), and quotas for various disadvantaged groups, under which members can enter institutions of higher education with lower examination grades (India). Grants and quotas can be mandatory or voluntary and be directed to public or private bodies. Reflecting the particular challenges faced by women, there is a separate MDG on women representation and empowerment. A strategic priority listed by the Task Force on Education and Gender Equality is, \u2018to increase women\u2019s share of seats in national parliaments and local government bodies.246 However, affirmative action for women must go beyond this if progress towards all MDGs is to benefit women across the board. UNDP administrator Helen Clark noted \u2018where we see progress towards the MDGs lagging the most is often where the needs and status of women and girls are accorded low priority.247 Without affirmative action, girls will still be denied basic human rights such as the right to education, health, work that allows them to have an adequate standard of living and a life in dignity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9a2c2ae-d0cb-46d6-af41-d8f3793aab7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9a2c2ae-d0cb-46d6-af41-d8f3793aab7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18aeb6a3fe7224da66b4aee240a17289bd42ef5fa71f0f4b0a7077b419fb4352"}, "2": {"node_id": "d22183e0-d055-46e7-b0e8-a84ea9a613b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26dc2fe2b3128a93d7980a14a8c7d3a72cb67819cc3805a100f1babf45fec044"}}, "hash": "b880045d24f035eadad17e5ad5ce171950a575ec186ad290945f7de082efcba8", "text": "The Organisation Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) similarly notes that \u2018while there has been significant progress in some areas, on-going 243 Some of the treaty monitoring bodies such as the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination use the term \u2018special measures\u2019 while others such as the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women use the term \u2018affirmative action\u2019.

For example, India has adopted a reservation system to address the impact of its caste system. The \u2018reservation system\u2019 reserves places for members of scheduled castes and tribes in public employment, education and political affairs. In 1980, for instance, the Backward Classes Commission recommended a total of 49.5% of federal government jobs be set aside for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes.250 In Malaysia, the imbalance between the Malay (the majority) indigenous people (Bumiputra)251 and the Chinese and Indian immigrant communities gave rise to the Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP). This is regarded as affirmative action towards the majority Malay population and requires companies for instance to set aside 30% of their corporate equity for ethnic Malays.252 Similarly, 30% of Government construction contracts were required to come from Malay firms. Malaysian universities were also required to reserve \u2018a reasonable proportion of places\u2019 for ethnic Malay students and faculty members.253 In Sri Lanka, affirmative action was initially limited to university admissions only and targeted towards preferential treatment of the majority (Sinhalese) group of students. However, in the 1970s they were transformed to a regional quota system cutting across ethnic and religious identities.254 2.

Specifically, the CESCR stated that: All legislative and other reforms should take into account the need to promote equality and reverse the devastating effects of discrimination against the indigenous populations, in particular through affirmative action. See E/C.12/1/Add., 28 May 1996, para 27. Similarly, the CESCR recently applauded Brazil\u2019s establishment of \u201caffirmative action programs for Afro-Brazilians, in particular women.\u201d See E/C.12/1/Add.87. Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 123 of an individual as belonging to a group should be based on self-identification by the individual concerned, unless a justification exists to the contrary.267 Affirmative action and women: Article 4 of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women explicitly specifies that the \u2018adoption by States Parties of temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between men and women shall not be considered discrimination as defined in the present Convention.\u2019 Its monitoring body, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), further recognises that the \u2018application of temporary special measures in accordance with the Convention is one of the means to realise d facto or substantive equality for women rather than an exception to the norms of non-discrimination and equality.\u2019268 3. Designing a rights-based approach to affirmative action From a human rights perspective, the temporary system of justified preferences should not be confused with States\u2019 positive obligations to realise human rights for all such as establishing social protection programmes. However, in reality the two initiatives are often confused. CEDAW for instance expressed concern about Vietnam\u2019s apparent lack of clarity about the difference between temporary special measures that are aimed at accelerating de facto (or substantive) equality of women and general social policies that are adopted to implement the Convention.269 These are not temporary but are a permanent part of a State\u2019s artillery for ensuring compliance with human rights in a sustainable long term framework. As essentially a system of justifiable preferences to advance the situation of a particular group, the use of affirmative action is governed by a number of core principles and limitations that ensure compliance with international human rights law. Affirmative action must be designed to overcome barriers facing particular disadvantaged groups in enjoying their rights and \u2018not lead to the maintenance of separate rights for different racial groups.\u2019270 The length of time required for implementation may vary in light of the objectives as well as the means utilised to achieve the goals and gathering the results of 267 See CERD General Comment No. 32 The meaning and scope of special measures in the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, August 2009, para 34 268 See CEDAW General Recommendation No. 25 on article 4, paragraph 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, on temporary special measures para 31 269 See Paragraph(s) 10 CEDAW/C/VNM/CO/6 (CEDAW, 2007) 270 \u2018The notion of inadmissible \u2018separate rights\u2019 must be distinguished from rights accepted and recognised by the international community to secure the existence and identity of groups such as minorities, indigenous peoples and other categories of person whose rights are similarly accepted and recognised within the framework of universal human rights.\u2019 See CERD General Comment No. 32 The meaning and scope of special measures in the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, August 2009, para 26 124 Affirmative Action as a Way and Means of Achieving Economic and Social Rights and the MDGs applying the goals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf6429e0-3d78-4469-b84a-5ea9c138c5bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf6429e0-3d78-4469-b84a-5ea9c138c5bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dbd66fb295c1a7802a7be638f488cab4d4659454ff3c6cf0f3fb0cd97b2386ad"}, "2": {"node_id": "fdf68948-3ae7-4b0c-b62f-557ebb46d857", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7cc72ee64974fa4052a0df3ba90c7d68b90687b0559b6695a0a722d101b88b8a"}}, "hash": "31ac67a2e601bbeacc535d75cc3adaa4a227dd6966e142bc63dd02a82e5f8495", "text": "However, affirmative action initiatives are temporary and \u2018must not be continued after the objectives for which they have been taken have been achieved\u2019.271 More specifically, to meet these broad requirements, when designing affirmative action programmes, policies and measures, States must ensure the programmes are: legal, legitimate, appropriate and proportionate; temporary; participatory; and a result of fair and transparent decision-making.

They must also be distinct from the general positive obligations of a State to fulfil human rights. For example, post- apartheid, the South African Constitution (1996) guarantees equality among persons, and explicitly permits affirmative action. According to Chapter 2, Section 9(2), \u201cTo promote the achievement of equality, legislative and other measures designed to protect or advance persons, or categories of persons, disadvantaged by unfair discrimination may be taken.\u201d273 The Canadian Constitution similarly guarantees equality among citizens and permits affirmative action by recognising that this non-discrimination and equality guarantee \u201cdoes not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\u201d274 On several occasions, human rights monitoring bodies have criticised States for not having a provision allowing affirmative action to be taken in pursuit of substantive equality. In 2007, CEDAW, for instance, expressed concern that although Thailand\u2019s 1997 Constitution allows for preferential treatment of certain groups, \u2018no provision is contained in laws and regulations for temporary special measures aimed at accelerating the de facto equality of women.\u2019275 CEDAW concluded that as a result \u2018no such measures are being adopted to increase women\u2019s participation in decision-making bodies on an equal basis with men, except in selection of commissioners for National Human Rights Commission and members of Village and Urban Fund Committee\u2019.276 In 2007, CEDAW was similarly 271 See CERD General Comment No. 32 The meaning and scope of special measures in the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, August 2009, para 27 272 See CEDAW General Recommendation No. 25 on article 4, paragraph 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, on temporary special measures, para 31 273 See Affirmative action: a global perspective, Global Rights, 2005 p 23 274 See Affirmative action: a global perspective, Global Rights, 2005 p 27 275 See Paragraph(s) 21 CEDAW/C/THA/CO/5 (CEDAW, 2006) 276 Ibid Ways and Means of Realizing Social and Economic Rights and Achieving the MDGs 125 concerned that in Maldives, temporary special measures were neither provided in law nor used by the State as a policy to accelerate the achievement of de facto equality between women and men in any area of CEDAW.277 In several countries, constitutions have gone beyond providing the legal framework for allowing affirmative action to suggesting or even specifying the recipients of such affirmative action and the nature of such actions. In Malaysia, for instance, the Constitution specifically references affirmative action may be needed towards the indigenous Malay population. Its Article 8(5) c makes it clear that the Constitution does not prohibit \u201cany provision for the protection, well-being or advancement of the aboriginal peoples of the Malay Peninsula (including the reservation of land) or the reservation to aborigines of a reasonable proportion of suitable positions in the public service.\u201d278 Part XVI of the Indian Constitution details the affirmative action, or \u201creservation,\u201d program for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes including the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in different political bodies such as the House of the People.279 The beneficiary groups of these provisions are listed in \u201cschedules\u201d (i.e. annexes) to the Constitution. In Fiji the Constitution provides general principles as well as the structure of its administration.280 For example, it established mechanisms for monitoring any affirmative action programme.281 However, inserting such detailed provisions into the Constitution itself is not necessary. Often States have used Acts or Executive Orders to introduce affirmative action programmes. As Cottrel and Ghai note, in the USA, affirmative action was introduced by an Executive Order of the President whilst in Australia, the Public Service Act (1999) provides for the promotion of ethnic and gender diversity in the workplace.282 In fact one can argue that specifying too many details in a constitution could lead to more problems adapting programmes and beneficiaries to contemporary problems and issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36b867c9-a84d-486c-9cf6-84b8f927761e": {"__data__": {"id_": "36b867c9-a84d-486c-9cf6-84b8f927761e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Achievement of MDGs by Ways and Means of Economic and Social Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da83d13e54461dd1a8e432b322b82a1b4fdd7d56c5482d16de168175d242f2e5"}, "2": {"node_id": "c760a56e-c5a0-4fa1-8389-3d4e7305a357", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-achievement-mdgs-ways-and-means-economic-and-social-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b80a350b72b638e05bff4771f88dbcc1b932b18758e7c12227272c317abd009"}}, "hash": "945a21c0cf183616dc0c80a66be6b53ef0d4b91329c180f6a13df58b116c3c8c", "text": "Legitimate, appropriate and proportionate: Affirmative action measures must have the \u2018sole purpose\u2019 of ensuring equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and must be appropriate and proportionate to the situation requiring a remedy. 277 See Paragraph(s) 15 CEDAW/C/MDV/CO/3 (CEDAW, 2007) 278 The Constitution of Malaysia available at: http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/malaysia.pdf 279 See part XVI of the Constitution of In
