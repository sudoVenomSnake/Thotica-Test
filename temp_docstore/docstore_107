In the mid-to-long term, a healthier supply of stocks would help draw new entrants into the export side of the market, reducing the risks of monopolistic behaviours and spreading more control and wealth downstream. 5.5. Key strengths and opportunities Despite the challenges and risks, there is great potential for the sea cucumber value chain in Kenya. Beyond the growing global demand and attractive prices, there is \u201cun- limited\u201d export opportunity in Kenya93,120 and hardly any price volatility.120 Simply put, the market is there to be filled. Knowing that local stocks exist (as in the wild-catch mar- ket) are assurance that the Kenyan coastline boasts appropriate growing conditions for farming sea cucumber. As the sea cucumber industry sits as a Kenyan government priority, efforts in the space will benefit from this directed attention, enthusi- asm, and funding. Importantly, the national government, with financial support from the World Bank,123 is currently investing in the re- search and development of a hatchery pilot in Shimoni, Kwale County. This multi-species facility, while currently undergoing con- struction, is several years away from being fully operational. It is probable the facility will eventually be able to provide sea-cucumber fingerlings for farmer pilot programs, but of even greater value will be its ability to expose the proof of concept for a viable hatchery business. By highlighting the business case, this facility can help unlock critical private sector interest and investment in the value chain. Moreover, while an under-regulated industry holds inherent risk (as outlined in Section 5.4), organizations like IUCN have the unprecedented opportunity to become an irreplaceable partner for robust regula- tion-setting that drives forward an eco-con- scious agenda (including ecosystem pro- tections, stock population monitoring, and environmental measurement requirements) as well as local-area best-practices (like ad- vocating for local community involvement in governance setup and the protection and inclusion of vulnerable populations). In the meantime, while policies are being devel- oped, there exists a window of opportunity to trial thoughtful, responsible short-term breeding solutions that pull juveniles from the ocean in a sustainable way. This type of pilot integrates into government regulatory conversations while also breaking ground on farmer pilot programs in parallel to hatchery development. Among the strengths of the sea cucumber industry are benefits to farmers, such as low barriers to entry (achievable technology, low upstart costs, and part-time farming hours), relative safety (as compared to current wild-capture diving practices), and constant cash flow (when farms are operational and invest in monthly seeding practices, they can benefit from monthly harvests, too). The close-to-shore nature, and the opportunities for value-addition services are conducive to including vulnerable populations like wom- en and youth. Especially in the aftermath of the national economic decline in 2020 due to COVID-19 crisis, market actors can develop a value chain in Kenya that engages the full household to build pandemic-era livelihoods that support coastal families.

Market dynamics According to a Sustainable Seafood Overview report, \u201capproximately 3 billion people in the world rely on wild-caught and farmed seafood as a primary source of protein.\u201d138 FAO estimates the average global citizen consumes 20.5kg per year, as of 2018.83 With an increasing global population, aquatic an- imals emerge as a critical category for food security and daily protein. In fact, the growth rate for human consumption of fish not only outpaces growth rates for other animal proteins, but it has been increasing at \u201ca rate almost twice that of annual world population growth.\u201d83 Not only are there more of us, we are eating much more fish. These growth trends are markedly more pronounced in developing countries. When FAO outlines global fisheries and aq- uaculture production, the totals for \u2018fish\u2019 in- clude shelled molluscs, finfish, crustaceans, and other aquatic animals, but exclude \u201caquatic mammals, crocodiles, alligators and caimans, seaweeds and other aquatic plants.\u201d83 Global production of fish reached 179 million tonnes in 2018, and 69% of the world\u2019s total comes from Asia, of which China accounts for more than half. Africa trails be- hind the Americas and Europe, contributing only around 7% to global totals.83 Most fish is consumed locally, as exports account for only 38% of worldwide production, but even so, the global fish export industry has a re- ported annual value of over US$ 164 billion.83 Global production comes from a relatively even split between wild-capture (96.4 million tonnes, representing 54%) and farmed aq- uaculture (82.1 million tonnes, representing 46%). However, according to reports, \u201cthe value of farmed fish was higher, around US$ 250 billion compared with [US]$ 151 billion for wild-caught fish.\u201d128 On an upward trend, it is estimated that aquaculture production will \u201cincrease by one-third by 2030 \u2026 and will supply the majority of aquatic protein in people\u2019s diets by 2050.\u201d128 While wild-catch production is predom- inantly marine-based (88%), only 38% of farmed fish comes from the ocean.139 Shelled molluscs are the primary product from marine-based aquaculture, with finfish rep- resenting around 24%. On the whole, then, marine-based finfish farming accounts for less than 9% of global aquaculture produc- tion and just over 4% of global fish produc- tion overall.140 The aquaculture industry is underdeveloped across the African region, and the continent contributed less than 3% to the global aqua- culture total in 2018, with sub-Saharan Africa contributing less than 0.5%.83 The continent is heavily dependent on wild-catch, and Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 52 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya according to FAO, \u201caquaculture accounted for 17.9 percent of total fish production in Africa,\u201d83 as compared to the worldwide pro- portion of 46%. Sources agree that wild stocks of fish are dwindling. It is estimated that anywhere from 70%141 up to 85%138 and 90%142 of the world\u2019s fisheries are overfished and overexploited.

The challenge on the horizon is one of feeding Kenya\u2019s increasing population as surrounding countries compete to sup- port their own populations that are growing even faster. The pressure on supply is likely to make fish imports more scarce and more expensive for Kenya in coming years. Reports show that \u201cfish catches have been declining in Africa in recent years by a million tons a year,\u201d147 making it clear that Africa\u2019s overreli- ance on wild-capture fishing poses a threat for not only the health and nutrition of the population, but to the ecosystems upon which coastal communities rely. Mirroring worldwide reports, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on Kenya and the WIO region. With the global tourism indus- try at a standstill, there is no surprise that coastal communities in Kenya are feeling the financial impacts of the shutdown. Also, the increasing difficulty of accessing medical care along with new government-mandated public health protocols add additional pres- sure on poor households.148 Many are forced into subsistence fishing to feed their fami- lies, and the increased fishing activity strains the productive potential of ecosystems. Additionally, the government-mandated evening curfew has impacted the Kenyan Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 53 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya coastal fishing industry in a number of ways. First, from the production side, without the option for night-fishing in deeper waters, local fishers end up taking advantage of more near-shore habitats, even if they are protected areas like community-based LMMAs.148 Lower fish stocks make fishing an ever-more-challenging task, with excess ef- fort spent to reap less reward. Not only does this negatively impact household income and food security, but local ecosystems are suffering, causing a negative biodiversity rip- ple effect as regenerative potential dwindles. Stories from Vanga in Kwale County tell of the challenges within coastal fish trades caused by the pandemic; Blue Ventures quotes one of their Kenyan contacts as saying: \u201cThey have cut and taken the buoys we put to mark our LMMA area.

Production base The market dynamics for the Kenyan fish- eries sector are complex, and it is not the aim of this report to detail the entire pro- duction base. For example, Kenya produces aquatic animals through both wild-capture and aquaculture (farmed) methods. These activities occur both inland and in marine environments. Furthermore, Kenya produc- es an array of animal types, including finfish, mussels, octopi, crabs, oysters, and more. Some products are for the export market, some are for high-value domestic consump- tion (involving transport across the country), and some are for local coastal consumption. In line with the objectives of the study, and with priority value chain outputs in mind, this report focuses specifically on: ma- rine-based, finfish aquaculture for the local coastal market. As such, the production base analysis for this value chain details avenues that address demand for finfish in the local (coastal Kenyan) market.

However, fish consumption at the local level is driven by some 80,000 small-scale artisanal fishers, utilizing some 17,000 artisanal fishing vessels.50 Along the coast, it is men who do the dangerous work of artisanal fishing. Kenya\u2019s fish stocks are becoming more and more depleted, putting pressure on the traditional artisanal fishing ecosystems that support local fish consumption. Anecdotal reports indicate that it is not uncommon for a local fishing boat in the coastal county of Kwale to go out to sea and return empty. Challenges to artisanal fishing include de- pleted fish stocks, worsening sea conditions for small vessels, and increasing need for local landing sites to which fishers can bring their catch. In spite of being introduced into Kenya for decades,152 mariculture has failed to take root due to insufficient investment and inadequate technical expertise. Previous attempts at coastal aquaculture have not yielded positive, sustaining results. However, the sector has received a boost under the KEMFSED project (Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development Project), which promises to build a national mari- culture resource and training centre.153 In response, Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI) is currently pilot- ing marine-based cage farming as a poten- tial solution to the fish supply deficit along the coast. Two of the pilot cages are housed in Kilifi County, and a third is positioned in Kwale county, with plans to establish another 152 Holeh, G.M., Ochiewo, J.O., Tsuma, S., & Mirera, D.O. (2020).

The research is proving that cage farming can work, and the government is preparing to move into the community development phase. To date, research from previous fish farming pilots indicate that farming (specifically milkfish) has been \u201cpracticed at subsistence level, and extensively, contributing more to the food security of the communities, rather than to economic gains.\u201d154 As mariculture rep- resents only 213 - 5%152 of all farmed aquatic animal production (marine and freshwater combined), Kenya has yet to fully exploit the marine farming sector.152 Cage model155 At present, finfish pilots are being tested with milkfish and rabbitfish species. KMFRI is also currently pursuing ongoing testing and research around marine-rearing of other species like tilapia, potentially positioning finfish mariculture as an alternative to frozen imports. Finfish production using current cage-cul- ture technology follows four main steps. First, site selection must be performed.

There are several construction models being tested, but the preferred method in Kwale County consists of a floating wooden structure that is anchored to the ocean floor. A sample layout would include com- partments made of netting that descends 2-3m into the ocean waters. Including two separate compartments enables farmers to separate smaller fish from larger fish. Construction can take around 2 weeks and requires tools and inputs like culture nets, wood, floaters, concrete sinkers, ropes, nails, bolts, and a canoe. Third, farmers secure fingerlings from the wild. At present, local fishers are paid 10KES for each fingerling (a juvenile fish weighing approximately 1g).

Farmers are responsible for the fingerling input cost. In this case, one cycle of fingerling inputs costs 160,000KES (just under US$ 1,500). As more cage systems are deployed across the coast and more fingerlings are required, the need for sustainable sources of seed (fingerlings) becomes of the utmost importance. Future endeavours might utilize government-led hatchery facilities or integrate a specific hatchery area within the cage chamber to ensure scaled operations are not detrimen- tal to wild populations. 156 Calculated from: Ayub, S. (2020). Current minimum wage in Kenya 2020. Tuko Kenya. https://www.tuko.co.ke/281305-current- minimum-wage-kenya-2020.html As a final step, fingerlings are placed inside the compartments and allowed to grow. Growing cycles take 5-6 months, meaning a structure could support 32,000 fish in a year. Wild seaweed is collected and used as food, although experts are researching if a business case exists for buying supplemen- tal food to encourage nutrition and growth. In either case, responsible scaling of the marine-cage-farm sector requires sustaina- ble, non-disruptive feed solutions (whether collected or purchased). During the growth stage, facility staff feed and monitor fish stocks for size and health, routinely check the netting system and anchors, do neces- sary repairs, and ensure security is in place 24 hours/day to protect the harvest. The facility usually sees two people working full-time, one technical manager for daytime shifts, and a security guard at all hours. Beyond staff salaries, farmers are responsible for col- lecting required tools for daily operations like snorkels, brushes, and a record book. Fish are ready to be harvested when they reach 300-400g, and the facility prepares for harvest by purchasing buckets and a weigh- ing scale. At harvest, farmers are obligated to pay a tax to the BMU of 2KES/kg of fish sold. Even with the most conservative profit and loss estimates, a cage farm operating at full capacity under this model stands to make a profit in the first cycle that would pay for the construction costs. During a normal cycle, if the collective profit is spread across a farmer group of 10 people, monthly payments per group member already exceed the mini- mum wage for Kenyan rural labour.156 Cage farming is appealing to fishers be- cause the system eliminates the exercise of Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 56 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya searching for fish schools, and the harvest timing can be controlled. At present, local fishers have a limited window in which to sell their daily catch, otherwise the fish spoil and the effort is wasted. Marine-based fish farming disrupts the current value chain as farmers can produce an exact purchase volume, fresh and of high quality, on de- mand. Assuming 10 farmers were to produce together at full capacity using the Kwale County piloted farming method, rough esti- mates show that the production and harvest capacity per cycle would be more than double the average volume of wild-capture during the same cycle period. Reports from aquaculture cage farming on Lake Victoria also indicate that a fully-stocked cage farm with good management can produce more fish per cycle than what artisanal fishers are seeing with dwindling stocks.157 Furthermore, farming and harvesting can occur year round, which is particularly helpful during rainy sea- sons when the weather makes deep-water fishing dangerous and unproductive. During the months when traditional catch is low, prices increase, so fish farmers stand to take advantage of seasonal pricing. Finfish farming comes with drawbacks, of course. The initial upstart cost requires an investment and cash flow that is prohibitive for an individual farmer. Securing a group loan, encouraging private sector-investment for an outgrower-style model, or identifying less-expensive local building options might make construction more accessible to the fishing community.

There are around 50,000 fish traders in Kenya, with 300,000 people employed upstream. The sector also supports the 2 million people in- directly employed,50 effectively touching the lives of over 5%158 of Kenya\u2019s total population. This complex value chain,93,155 with its multitude of actors, service providers, and value-addition remains fairly consistent between artisanal finfish wild-capture and finfish farming for the local market. Production differs (as detailed in Section 6.2), but the basic premise remains the same: the first-stage market actor collects finfish from the water. Fish from the wild and from aqua- culture installations both enter into the mar- ket through the local landing site. Traders converge at the landing site to purchase the day\u2019s catch, as their power within the value chain precludes fishers from selling directly to the market. An important difference to note is the trader relationship with artisanal fishers. Often, traders are the owners of the boats and equipment, and they enter into Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 57 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya exclusive purchasing agreements, generally at market price, with fishers in exchange for leasing the vessel. Farmers who operate without in-kind support from a trader would disrupt this element of the value chain as they would be free to sell to anyone at the landing site. The end market can take many forms. Working backwards, consumption occurs, generally, in one of three locations: at home, in the market, or in a restaurant. Customers who purchase fish to take home to cook usu- ally purchase from a market vendor. Locals who consume freshly-prepared fish in the market purchase a plate from someone like a \u2018mama karanga,\u2019 a woman who processes (by frying) fish on-site for immediate con- sumption. These simple businesses are often relatively informal and occur in the open-air. This business model was among those neg- atively affected by the COVID-19 government curfews, as legal operating hours were dras- tically slashed. At the landing site, a fisher might sell to a trader or directly to a mama karanga, but a mama karanga can also purchase her fish from other stakeholders en-route to mar- ket. Vendors and restaurateurs might also purchase their fresh supplies from the fish brokers, who are intermediaries between the traders and the market-level actors. As such, the value chain for local coastal fish con- sumption can follow several routes, including multi-stakeholder chains (like a fisher - trad- er - broker - market - consumer path), simple chains (like a fisher - vendor - consumer path), and all paths in-between. Common species sold for local-market preparation are rabbitfish and milkfish, and they generally are sold whole and unprocessed through the trader- and broker-levels. Most of the local-level market action happens in daily cycles, as challenging infrastructure and a lack of cold storage limit the potential to retain freshness for extended periods. Tana River government records indicate that, in 2015, up to 20% of fish harvests were lost to poor post-harvest processing.31 The limited freshness window also means that market action is restricted to local geographies, as transportation even to cites like Mombasa require heavy investment in equipment and cooling-enabled vehicles. Some local gov- ernments have provided coolboxes for use throughout the value chain, to help mitigate the challenges of keeping fish catches fresh in the coastal Kenyan heat. As prices vary market-to-market and across seasons, dissecting the exact amount of value retained by each actor becomes an impossible task. However, one example re- corded among fishers, traders, and brokers in Kwale County shows that, after buying from the fishers for an average price of 200 KES/kg, traders sold to brokers at a price of 300 KES/kg. The broker then sold the fish at 350 KES/kg.

The local government is involved as the project identifies a suitable area for setup and as community members are sensitized and invited to join. Fortunately, the governmen- tal rules and regulations surrounding the fish trade are well established, and any new finfish farming ventures would make use of the protections established from inland aquaculture ventures.160 For a fish farming venture, local commu- nities must be engaged to procure local building materials, labourers for construc- tion of the cage facilities, and farmers to run day-to-day operations.

Coastal county governments have ear- marked support for mariculture in their County Integrated Development Plans, ranging from establishing marine fisheries96 and hatcheries,30,97,99 to specifically promot- ing cage fish farming.97 Government is also involved from a policy level, including the production of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to get authorization from the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA). At the national level, the government has prioritized the operational- isation of fish quality control laboratories.50 This national-level support underscores the way the government is currently supporting initiatives that \u201cimprove management of pri- ority fisheries and mariculture and increase access to complimentary livelihood activities in coastal communities.\u201d50 These efforts are targeted at governance measures that can ensure \u201clong-term sustainability of fish stocks.\u201d50 6.4. Key challenges and threats For finfish farming to offer a viable alterna- tive to wild-capture fishing, it must address the key challenges that threaten potential success. Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 59 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya First, construction and initial setup are costly investments. Community mobilization, pri- vate sector or government intervention, or access to appropriate financial instruments is crucial. Unfortunately, the Kwale County Fisheries Director maintains there are no suit- able loan products currently available.93 The farming facility itself also proves to be a risky investment when all of the valuable stock is vulnerable; theft or damage to the facility can mean the difference between a full farm and a completely empty farm. Additionally, the upstart time (at least 7-9 months before the first harvest) can be discouraging for cash-poor farmers who are investing time, energy, and resources while waiting for a payout. Additionally, as fish farming incurs additional costs (like fingerlings, feed, and security), farmers must believe in the value proposition that appears to increase costs without a noticeable market-price benefit.

Working on a fish farm structure in deeper water requires adequate swimming ability, appropriate safety equipment, as well as sufficient protection from the sun. Because women traditionally do not have deep-wa- ter training, the sector faces a challenge in making the practice as inclusive as previous pond-based coastal fish farming projects.

However, the \u201cweak regulatory environment \u2026 around common resources\u201d can lead to \u201cenviron- mental degradation.\u201d162 Assessments from Lake Victoria show that a dramatic increase in scale (170%163 increase in the number of cag- es between 2016 and 2018) has contributed to negative ecological outcomes. Proper site selection, spacing, and waste management systems are critical for the environmental sustainability of a cage system, especially at scale. Additionally, addressing issues around fish bio-wastes could not only drive value and investment in the sector164 but could also reduce environmental harm caused by the value chain.

Increasing wild catch sustainably requires a commercial or government in- vestment in fishing equipment and vessels and better resource management (like the use and enforcement of quotas, more coast guards, and more landing site inspections). On the other hand, fish farming offers high rates of productivity, greater oversight around sustainability of practices, and guar- anteed supply, even during traditionally low- catch seasons. Finally, from a livelihoods perspective, invest- ing in fish farming reduces the volatility and risk of depending on unpredictable, unsafe daily trips to the sea. Fish farming is safer, more stable, and closer to home. For systems that use continual (week-by-week) seeding, farmers can enjoy a continual cash flow, even in seasons that are traditionally unfit for wild-capture. Planning harvests can reduce waste in the finfish value chain, making farm- ers into good stewards of their Blue natural capital resources. By reducing the amount of fishing in Kenya\u2019s coastal waters, finfish aquaculture enables wild populations to re- generate. Farmers also have the opportunity to reinvest some of their developed stock into LMMA or MPA zones to help repopulate struggling species, increase biodiversity, and build better marine ecosystems.

Recommendations 7.1. Way forward for Kenya First and foremost, developing a clear strategy is paramount to ensure success for efforts in the Kenyan Blue Economy. A comprehensive understanding of how Blue Entrepreneurship advances the national agenda will act as a roadmap that outlines plans for when other players join the sector. The opportunity exists to build rapport and support the Blue Agenda by engaging with the government on current initiatives, like the Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani (JKP) Jumuiya Innovation Labs,55 for example. Furthermore, strategic planning must acknowledge and balance the overarching considerations that will impact potential systemic changes for coastal communities; addressing communi- ty and gender dynamics, critically analysing incentive structures, developing good habits for ecosystem management, and investing in extensive measurement and knowl- edge-sharing is essential for all interventions. Finally, the strategy for any venture includes a thoughtful value proposition for participat- ing in ecosystem conservation and rehabil- itation. For any undertaking, it is critical to clearly demonstrate a link between investing in the ecosystem and household-level bene- fits like higher yields, better returns, or more income. Wealth from natural habitats can only be derived from healthy habitats. This report outlines recommendations for the three selected value chains: seaweed farming, sea cucumber farming, and finfish farming. The following highlights recom- mendations for individual value chains as well as for the farmer program pilots, the suggestions for which are largely cross-cut- ting with some customization based on specific factors and value chain needs. Seaweed farming The following recommendations promote success within the seaweed farming value chain. Critical for Kenya\u2019s competitiveness as a global seaweed exporter is a growth strategy aimed at maximizing scale. At present, Kenya is not a significant player in the WIO region\u2019s seaweed market, and investing in inclusive mechanisms that attract new farmers and encourage timely planting and harvesting, thereby drawing new exporter attention, is key to success. Proposed strategic levers The research revealed three critical levers to support this vision for the sector: A. Increase production to reach current export capacity B. Draw new exporter entrants to the sector C. Scale farming of higher-value species with new production methods Recommendations 64 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya A. Increase production to reach current export capacity The current market chain relies on a solitary buyer and exporter of seaweed, who has recently (within the past 3 years) started building operations in Kenya. The exporter\u2019s stated current capacity is 300 tonnes per year, but present exports are only reaching 80 tonnes per year.90 There is a ready-market to absorb another \u00b14x current farm-level production. At the most basic level, seaweed production hinges on planting as many ropes as possi- ble during the spring-tide, waiting for those seedlings to develop, and harvesting at the appropriate maturity level, some 6 weeks later. Simply put, increasing farm-level pro- duction is a function of devoting time and effort to the tasks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef190120-9d98-4b60-9181-f84234f76c1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef190120-9d98-4b60-9181-f84234f76c1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue entrepreneurship scoping study for Kenya", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ccec2d0261458d81e038c02c00ec155b41d8710f8bbc60f30236631b2ca15f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca4bcbd5-b4aa-402f-ae6f-027b3bbce75c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "064a5e7e5f81b8cda022ef2c691fab624d55ca26844b4b9765780ded5373d9bd"}}, "hash": "08be0c703ad4eb8b1e5bf51554e1902b4d8e82669e846218a81c782d99e7fc18", "text": "Unfortunately, with drop- ping global prices, the value proposition for farmers is too low to encourage a diversion away from other daily activities and into maximum seaweed effort.

This volume is well within reason, as evalu- ations from Zanzibar seaweed farms show \u201cthe average production per farmer would have been about 100 kg per month.\u201d173 Even closer to home, some Kilifi County farmers interviewed report they were able to achieve 1, 2, and even up to 3 tonnes per year per farm. Increasing production to achieve current export capacity requires no new investment in farm setup or farmer-base expansion; instead, scale hinges on developing a value proposition that encourages farmers to do timely planting and harvesting. However, investing in covered drying facilities close to the farm areas would support production in a number of ways. First, farmers are con- strained by the time and labour required to carry heavy loads for drying. Second, provid- ing a covered space for drying saves labour time, as seaweed that comes into contact with rainwater must be re-processed (that is, taken back to the ocean to be submerged and revitalized in the salt water and then transported and dried again). Covered dry- ing facilities in close proximity can improve efficiency by decreasing production time, as well as reduce post-harvest losses, or more specifically, post-harvest loss of farmer time and labour.

Draw new exporter entrants to the sector High production volume is the best way to flag Kenya as a viable market and encourage new exporter entrants. The influx of new market actors is expected to drive competi- tion and provide farmers with more choice, stronger agency, and higher prices. Kenya has the opportunity to develop production volumes that draw new exporters to the sec- tor. Presuming three is the optimal number of permanent exports, and using C-WEED\u2019s export capacity as an indicator, Kenya must increase current production over 11-fold. Expanding the farmer network, potentially using outgrower models, is the most realistic source of this extra volume. For the exporter, asset investment (like an aggregation/stor- age facility and a commercial-grade baler) is required, in addition to operating costs (like transportation and labour). However, from the perspective of investing in new-farm setup, it is estimated that a seaweed plot op- erating at even moderate productive capac- ity (300kg for 6 weeks) could earn enough revenue to pay for initial farm upstart after only one cycle. This value proposition can encourage additional exporter entrants to support farm setup and expansion efforts. Opportunity: \u2022 Develop business case for seaweed exporters to enter the Kenyan market \u2022 Sensitize communities and expand production base to include additional farming locales \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart Competitive Position: \u2022 An uptick in post-pandemic global price will unlock better margins for incoming exporters coming into Kenya \u2022 As the Kenyan national and coastal governments are prioritizing seaweed as a sector, enabling environments for foreign investment are expected to be favourable Inclusivity: \u2022 Expanding competition among seaweed purchasers is expected to elevate farmgate price, enabling more Kenyan farmers to join C. Scale farming of higher-value species with new production methods The Spinosum (Eucheuma denticulatum) seaweed currently being exported from Kenya is a durable species but with low pric- es.

Develop processing and aggregation services at the farmer level to draw more of the market value to the smallholder A. Pilot inclusive farming model to generate proof-of-concept for both local-government and farmer engagement As a first step in developing the sea cucum- ber farming value chain, potential market actors must be convinced of the value and the potential success. Therefore, the entry point of the sector is piloting a sea cucum- ber farming model that works. Upstart investment to the pilot is minimal, including only enclosure supplies and security staff payments. As no hatchery system exists in Kenya, a critical component to the farming pilot is the establishment of a sustainable model for short-term wild-capture of finger- lings. Left with no alternative, the pilot must rely on the ocean for seed resources, but this behaviour must be thoughtful, sustainable, and with only a short-term view in mind. The goal of the pilot is not to exploit the limited wild sea cucumber stocks, but instead, the goal is to prove the business case that will spur private investment in hatchery systems. Opportunity: \u2022 Develop business case for sea cucumber farmers and local government, and by so doing, develop business case for hatchery investment \u2022 Sensitize communities and pilot production model Recommendations 69 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart Competitive Position: \u2022 Kenya\u2019s coast already proves conducive to sea cucumber growth (as evidenced by historically-documented wild stocks) \u2022 As a top producer in the WIO region, Madagascar represents the strongest competition in the sea cucumber market; however, with growing global demand and an unlimited export potential, it seems there is room for unencumbered growth without negative competitive impacts Inclusivity: \u2022 In other countries, sea cucumber production represents an inclusive opportunity (60-80% of farmers are female) \u2022 Seaweed farmers often make the best sea cucumber farmers, as they already spend their time in the ocean, know the tides and the currents, are used to working with commercial partners, and are already aware of the value of these animals B. Invest in scalable hatchery model for sea cucumber juveniles Access to fingerlings (that is, access to a close, operational hatchery) is essential for long- term success of a sea cucumber farming industry. Wild-capture fingerling collection is not sustainable in the long-run, so invest- ment in inputs production will unlock sector transformation. Using the SEAFDEC132 model as an example, one community-based hatch- ery, at an investment cost of US$ 30,000 has the potential to generate 300,000 to 500,000 juveniles per year. Factoring in survival rates of sea cucumbers in enclosures, it can be estimated that a fully-functioning commu- nity farm (with access to a fully-functioning hatchery) could raise 100,000 to 150,000 exportable sea cucumbers in that year. At maximum production, and even at the con- servative end of current farmgate prices for fresh sea cucumbers in Kenya, the facility could pay for itself within the first year of operation. Realistically, a community or a pri- vate investor could expect to recoup facility costs by Year 2 or 3 of the project. For every operating year after that, 2 cycles of revenues from sea cucumber sales would cover oper- ating costs of the facility, and the remaining revenues (3 cycles) going toward enclosure upkeep, security, and farmer profit. As fingerlings cannot be transported more than 100km to be transplanted, a minimum of 3 hatcheries are needed to cover Kenya\u2019s entire coastline.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c9db1f7-084c-44d7-9067-d8eb8df825b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c9db1f7-084c-44d7-9067-d8eb8df825b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue entrepreneurship scoping study for Kenya", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7e7026b247f705bb68fec5773a70d22f5c16dbb9cd3b2224baf2203037deb85"}, "2": {"node_id": "340db9bd-55e0-4df1-8643-f11621d2abe9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77a5483e77410f54bde16ee4ff4dcfbaa0e2dca3d8deb7248e12616d65abd527"}}, "hash": "37f17a224950a8db662dfa94839adf6eda9495f285cb6f3a7e83204f57af8a4a", "text": "Opportunity: \u2022 Sensitize private sector investors and pilot hatchery model \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for hatchery upstart Competitive Position: \u2022 With ongoing government support of regional multi-species hatchery facilities, the enabling environment for foreign investment is expected to be favourable \u2022 Based on the wealth of research and piloting done globally on sea cucumber hatchery specifications, Kenya can learn from these interventions and pilot ready-made models (of course with context-specific adjustments), drastically reducing time-to-market for sea cucumber juveniles Recommendations 70 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Inclusivity: \u2022 While the hatchery model itself is not inherently inclusive, it enables inclusive farming opportunities \u2022 While low-scale, introduction of a new facility would warrant local job-creation ranging from technical (marine hatchery experts) to inclusive / accessible (administration and cleaning) C.

Long term sustainability requires investment in fingerling access (through hatcheries) and responsibly-sourced feed. Investing in finfish farming using cage structures in marine sites has the potential to disrupt the current value chain by increasing and controlling production, avoiding restrictive market re- lationships, and reducing pressure on local environments. Proposed strategic levers The research revealed three critical levers to support this vision for the sector: A. Pilot and scale inclusive community- owned farming model to generate proof-of-concept for farmer-owner engagement B. Invest in scalable hatchery model for sufficient and sustainable access finfish fingerlings C. Engage with partners (like government, NGOs, research institutions) to build an enabling environment that supports and protects the finfish cage farming industry as it comes to maturation Recommendations 73 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya A. Pilot and scale inclusive community- owned farming model to generate proof-of-concept for farmer-owner engagement The marine-based cage-farming industry is emerging, with KMFRI pilots proving the concept and refining the technical expectations for success. However, it is the investment from private-sector entrants taking up the idea that will drive this value chain to scale. Potential systems include examples of Lake Victoria aquaculture mod- els, whereby groups of farmer-owners pool resources (or access group credit) to invest in construction, stocking, and human resource costs. While keeping small roles (like feeding, records support, or post-harvest processing), the group-ownership model necessitates payment for a site manager, a technical expert charged with rearing the fish to market size, as well as security to keep the stock safe. By designating the responsibility to paid employees, the business model elim- inates the \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019 effect of group ownership without designated accountability. While government pilot facilities have garnered input costs upward of 600,000 KES for construction, it is estimated that locally-sourced and locally-negotiated construction could be much less expensive. Even with relatively conservative estimates, a cage farm operating at half capacity could repay construction costs after 3 cycles; in a best-case scenario, the facility would be paid off in the first cycle of production. Some Lake Victoria cage models have achieved production levels nearly triple that found in the KMFRI pilots. As finfish mari- culture develops, leveraging best practices from inland systems is likely to increase pro- ductivity of cage systems in the ocean. The Kenyan coast is home to nearly 200 landing sites, the entry points for all marine catches, including mariculture production. Even in a future scenario with 5 cages for each landing site operating at full capacity, fish production would only abate little more than 1% of the annual Kenyan fish deficit. Production potential is then limited by scale (sustainably increasing the number of cages stationed in the ocean), access to inputs (fin- gerlings from a hatchery), and down-stream market constraints (like cold chain and transportation, as the local coastal market is not expected to absorb large-scale increases in production). Opportunity: \u2022 Develop business case for farmer- owners, and by so doing, develop business case for hatchery investment \u2022 Sensitize communities and pilot production model \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart Competitive Position: \u2022 Artisanal fishers reliant on wild-capture methods are the main competition among fish destined for local coastal markets \u2022 While farming comes with the burden of facility investment and ongoing costs for inputs and operation, the advantages include: guaranteed production, control over harvest, and ability to operate in poor-weather seasons when prices are higher Recommendations 74 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Inclusivity: \u2022 The deep-sea nature of the cage structure can be prohibitive for female inclusion, as can the capital requirement for investing in the group model \u2022 Interventions should identify drivers of female participation (\u00b125%) among Lake Victoria group-ownership models B. Invest in scalable hatchery model for sufficient and sustainable access finfish fingerlings Current cage systems rely on wild-caught fingerlings as seed for production. From both ecological and supply perspectives, this inputs-system is unsustainable. Critical for long-term success of finfish mariculture is sufficient access to fingerlings. Proving the production model\u2019s capacity for scale is the first step to unlocking interest and private-sector investment in hatchery op- erations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b938e07-b944-41d0-aa32-9b782ac62ccc": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b938e07-b944-41d0-aa32-9b782ac62ccc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue entrepreneurship scoping study for Kenya", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1c2c52f5b79e59d25e51e9a0f623ed074a1809d3e4cf6fc99607e2d1d2855bc"}, "2": {"node_id": "cac28113-b7e6-4f11-9735-8ff3a510f384", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb3920febbbcda872ea37d090a9e0b1c858632b7d5370c7978c036f5213a11e9"}}, "hash": "0dc7508681887ba236877d7bf6335f2a0596e241ff12b793b99eb2611ea5a40b", "text": "From there, technical expertise and upstart capital are required.

Engage with partners (like government, NGOs, research institutions) to build an enabling environment that supports and protects the finfish cage farming industry as it comes to maturation The marine fishing industry is already well-established across coastal Kenya; local communities have depended on wild-cap- ture fishing as a source of food security for hundreds of years. While certainly with some costs and risks, these fishing practices, and the associated market structures, are relatively low-cost and deeply entrenched. Marine-based cage farming faces a signif- icant challenge of being competitive in an established market with established norms, especially as there is no price differential at market for farmed fish over wild-caught fish. However, there simply are not enough fish left in the wild, and artisanal fishing cannot continue as-is. Without a shift toward innova- tive practices, local coastal fishing will suffer as supply dwindles, competition from im- ports increases, and actual fishing activities Recommendations 75 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya become more dangerous. New practices that increase sustainable production (like cage farming) are needed, as the strain on the environment (from depleted wild stocks and from unstable ecosystems causing a loss of biodiversity) puts the entire underwater food chain at risk.

From a govern- ance standpoint, present challenges include access (like sea-use rights), regulation (like over- or under-regulation by the national and county governments), community involvement (like local governance chal- lenges), and security (both for high-value items like sea cucumber and finfish and for easily-damaged farm plots like seaweed). Unpredictable market dynamics threaten any farmer pilot program, and each of the se- lected value chains faces unique challenges. For example, the seaweed value chain is at risk for a potential price drop due to the influx of supply, generated as many tourism-based economies have focused on farming during the COVID-19 pandemic.176,89 Sea cucumber is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "624101c1-92b3-4818-90ec-059bfc9133d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "624101c1-92b3-4818-90ec-059bfc9133d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue entrepreneurship scoping study for Kenya", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2df800ca915ee5b6a21a322b5ddea8929f774d56e5b88655a74bba802d03910f"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a52b7d9-8e76-4954-b358-4b931cfa3e0f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a51d32893ec6741d6de8ec96a7b630c39b10976989e0a6361bc579bb3a37f60"}}, "hash": "8c000e1671ddb026d642cab2b5d4c1fa9c7e3ab6805ff09a9558cc55444e19aa", "text": "a high-value item, so market dynamics Recommendations 79 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya are affected by poaching and side-selling. Meanwhile, the domestic finfish markets in Kenya are dominated by traders, so the live- lihoods impacts for fishing and fish-farming households is constrained. Finally, climate change poses an ongoing risk to all select- ed value chains, as rising sea levels, ocean warming, and acidification will continue to alter coastal ecosystems, threatening the long-term stability of investment. To combat these and other challenges, TechnoServe leans on its extensive expe- rience working with a variety of farmers, stakeholders, and value chain market ac- tors. As such, we recommend the following guidance for embarking on farmer pilot programs: \u2022 Begin with sector and community engagement: Initiate farmer pilot program efforts by building relationships and engaging key stakeholders (like government, community, and private- sector partners) to build rapport and gain trust, support, and contextual understanding. Successful interventions will build on existing momentum and enthusiasm as they plan interventions, timing, and support structures that optimize outcomes. In particular, engage government initiatives (like seaweed infrastructure and storage facility construction, sea cucumber research and hatchery planning, and finfish research, hatchery facilities, and infrastructure), both supporting and integrating these efforts for long-term sector-wide success. \u2022 Do thorough Kenya coastline mapping to ensure proper site selection: When identifying priority geographies across the Kenya coastline for farmer pilot programs, explore: \u2022 Space and access factors: Investigate any existing Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMAs) or Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and assess any potential to leverage these zones and their sea-use access rights. Identify existing governance structures and gaps. Determine if the area is accessible by foot during the spring-tide (particularly important for seaweed and sea cucumber farming). \u2022 Social factors: Prioritize communities that are primed to engage in alternative livelihoods activities. For example, mobilization potential increases if communities are already equipped with mindset and skills of performing non- traditional farming exercises (like collecting octopus). Additionally, build on momentum that exists if communities already demonstrate ecosystem management practices (for example, protection zones or timed fishing closures). Furthermore, selected value chains (like seaweed and sea cucumber) that are expected to target and engage female beneficiaries are more likely to succeed in geographies that are enthusiastic about household-level or collective farming and/or areas that demonstrate support for entrepreneurial and financially- independent women. Finally, a farmer pilot program for fish farming is likely to have better social motivation in areas where wild-catch success is dwindling or limited, as Recommendations 80 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya these areas are more likely to accept the required investment of energy and money in order to develop innovative solutions to local fishing challenges. \u2022 Ecosystem factors: Identify priority geographies whose ecosystems are conducive to program requirements. The mapping phase also includes an investigation of predominant weather patterns and key environmental issues, enabling smart investment in weather- resistant construction. Ecosystem requirements are specific for each of the selected value chains and include the following: \u2022 Seaweed: Villages in Kwale county that are already showing success with seaweed farming indicate that seaweed crops grow best in intertidal zones that are protected from high-energy wave activity and boast relatively regulated water temperatures. Areas with seagrass meadows are often conducive to seaweed farming. \u2022 Sea Cucumber:106,115 Successful sea cucumber farming sites in Madagascar meet the following specifications: 1) \u00b160% coverage by seagrass 2) 15+ centimetres of fine sediment 3) high salinity (no freshwater input) 4) constant water coverage, even during low tide 5) relatively regulated water temperatures 6) protection from high-energy waves and natural predators. Note: capitalizing on ideal ecosystem overlaps, Blue Ventures scaling programs have successfully paired sea cucumber farming pens (closer to shore) side-by-side with seaweed farms (farther out to sea). \u2022 Finfish Farming:155 Current and future cage farming efforts in Kenya are most likely to succeed in ecosystems with relatively regulated water temperatures, protection from rough waves, sufficient current and waterflow to wash the chambers, and suitable ocean depth (\u00b15m during low tide, \u00b113m during high tide). \u2022 Solidify finance and planning to secure inputs during the program setup phase: Ensuring sufficient funding for program setup is critical, as long-term community-level sustainability depends on proof of concept and noteworthy revenues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a52b7d9-8e76-4954-b358-4b931cfa3e0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a52b7d9-8e76-4954-b358-4b931cfa3e0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue entrepreneurship scoping study for Kenya", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2df800ca915ee5b6a21a322b5ddea8929f774d56e5b88655a74bba802d03910f"}, "2": {"node_id": "624101c1-92b3-4818-90ec-059bfc9133d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c000e1671ddb026d642cab2b5d4c1fa9c7e3ab6805ff09a9558cc55444e19aa"}}, "hash": "9a51d32893ec6741d6de8ec96a7b630c39b10976989e0a6361bc579bb3a37f60", "text": "Programs that benefit from ample startup investment enable success and stability for ongoing business activities that are not dependent on ongoing intervention. \u2022 Secure comprehensive technical expertise: Engage top-quality technicians and industry experts with sufficient local context when choosing innovations and designing curricula.

Then, engage stakeholders who can most Recommendations 81 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya effectively convey this knowledge and train local communities in best practices. For example, the Kenyan government has proven experience training farmers in seaweed (with the help of local and international NGOs) and finfish farming practices. Meanwhile, Blue Ventures has prepared a transferable toolkit of resources174 for interested parties, and the organization has even availed itself to run comprehensive trainings that outlined sea cucumber deployment in Zanzibar, Tanzania.177 \u2022 Facilitate proper governance: Critical to the success of any farmer pilot program is a robust governance structure. At the local level, it is wise to engage communities with setting up and maintaining governance structures, making locally- informed resource management a collective and responsive effort. Resource management strategies might include no-take zones or no-take periods, and community involvement will address potential conflicts with sea-use and marine resources (particularly important for conflicts between seaweed farms and destructive fishing boats). Other programs have found success by entrenching environmental regulations and ecosystem management support into farmer lease agreements,106 for example, including a mandatory collective fund from farmers to pay back into the LMMA / MPA where they are operating. Additional benefits can 177 Vincent, I. & Razafimamonjiraibe, H. (2020, Feb 10). Farmers of the Sea \u2013 Sea Cucumber Farming as an Alternative to Fishing. Reef Resilience Network. https://reefresilience.org/case-studies/madagascar-sustainable-livelihoods/ be found in supporting government and local entities as policies and regulations (like monitoring, population and stock measurement, and market restrictions) are being crafted for emerging sectors. \u2022 Select beneficiaries: While carefully sensitizing communities and thoughtfully selecting beneficiaries for the farmer pilot programs, sector actors can lean on TechnoServe\u2019s 3-pronged approach for female engagement. Ensuring selection is inclusive and representative of all local people and people groups enables buy-in and long-term project success. Some models recommend clan or tribal mapping, then selection quotas are distributed among local leaders for assessment and final decisions.115 \u2022 Consider ecosystem impacts: According to IUCN objectives, a farmer pilot program will not be successful if it does not improve the natural environment. Therefore, any project upstart must carefully assess and monitor proposed interventions and their potential impacts within the selected ecosystems. For example, an increase in the presence of seaweed from farming initiatives might disrupt the amount of UV light that reaches the ocean floor. Additionally, farming practices have potential to disrupt naturally- occuring seagrass meadows, and loose seaweed can negatively impact coral health. Structures like Recommendations 82 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya finfish cages are bound to affect the environments in which they are placed, so it behooves sector actors to examine ecosystem impacts (like UV light and current flow) along with protection measures that might be required. Of course, some ecosystem impacts will, by design, be positive. For instance, providing an undisturbed habitat through seaweed farming has been shown to increase fish populations. This effect in itself must be monitored as changes in animal populations might impact or motivate different community behaviours; all opportunities and incentives must be carefully monitored and addressed. Similarly, providing farmed solutions as alternatives to sea cucumber and finfish wild catch give the ecosystems an opportunity to rest and regenerate. However, as species repopulate, these habitats will likely see increased fishing and dangerous diving activities. Communities might consider regenerative options (like introducing a \u2018throwback\u2019 percentage, where a portion of each harvest is given to the wild for environmental rehabilitation). \u2022 Work with permanent market actors: Engaging key market stakeholders (like traders, processors, and exporters) enables early-stage buy-in and support that can not only maintain energy in the value chain beyond donor funding windows but also distribute benefits across communities. Specifically, current seaweed farming assets (like ropes and boots) are donor-sponsored, and farmers have yet to understand useful life and associated costs. Without market engagement of suppliers and distributors, the projects cannot be assured of farmer financial stability and sustainable livelihoods benefits. Additionally, engaging an array of permanent market actors in the finfish value chain can develop a value proposition that redistributes agency and control away from traders and back to smallholders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c086061-f650-40fc-8a19-05fe5d20fb80": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c086061-f650-40fc-8a19-05fe5d20fb80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue entrepreneurship scoping study for Kenya", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae9dacfddaad5c845dba35a733280bfb11755350f964acebacd633e7f1145e13"}, "2": {"node_id": "064d6ca3-d076-4244-ba68-adcf473463a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-entrepreneurship-scoping-study-kenya", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea672906e0376454d754108aa82c0c05ab75d6463b55ec48777c283b067c7fb9"}}, "hash": "f5f00aec4e9d78181760f68c1cf362a2837d1eda408b357d8000af0706c871e8", "text": "\u2022 Develop comprehensive monitoring and measurement systems during the trial periods, and make data-driven adjustments: Driving sustainable growth for the Blue Entrepreneurship sector requires diligent measurement and mindful adaptation, and it is advantageous to set up innovative, thoughtful models that can be scaled.

By ad- dressing Blue Entrepreneurship with innova- tion and ground-breaking problem-solving, Kenyan coastal communities will benefit from more cost-effective designs, systems that produce maximum output, and con- tributions to global learnings. In addition to scaling up existing enterprises and making them more inclusive, it is imperative to generate and incubate new industry ideas and pair them with teams that have industry expertise at various stages of concept and launch along with access to appropriate investment vehicles. Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) An intriguing concept, and one such innova- tion, might be research into and deployment of marine-based integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems. These systems involve farming carefully-selected, mutu- ally-beneficial plants and animals in close proximity in order to \u201ctake advantage of synergistic interactions among species\u201d178 and use a diverse poly-culture approach to restore and conserve coastal ecosystems. With careful site-selection and technical un- derstanding of species interactions, market actors can pioneer models that promote coastal livelihoods and benefit marine ecosystems through harmonious layers of nature-based solutions. 178 Chopin, T. (2013, Mar 1). A look at integrated multi-trophic aquaculture. Global Aquaculture Alliance. https://www. aquaculturealliance.org/advocate/look-at-integrated-multi-trophic-aquaculture/ Entrepreneurship training In parallel to value-chain-specific initiatives, supporting other local activities alongside the identified ventures is critical. Opportunity exists to enhance communities and all Blue Entrepreneurship efforts by providing cross-cutting general business training for coastal industries. Providing financial literacy, savings and investment, governance, and management training not only boosts the ef- ficiency of the Blue Economy as a whole, but it helps protect communities and programs from specific risks across seaweed, sea cu- cumber, and finfish farming value chains. Similarly, this type of support benefits coastal communities as they adapt and re- emerge from COVID-19 tourism shutdowns. Spearheading a mindful approach that focuses on environmental and livelihoods resilience will influence Kenya\u2019s tourism sec- tor strategy in a way that builds the industry back better than it was before. IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions To supplement monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) efforts associated with all pilot interventions, all initiatives, actions, and measurements should utilize the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions16 before, during, and after execution. The Standard enlists eight criteria to provide \u201cclear param- eters for defining NbS and a common frame- work to help benchmark progress.\u201d Ensuring all efforts align with a recognized standard of care will avoid unintentional harm to ecosys- tems while also building systems that have potential for meaningful impact at scale.

contributed to the emergence of the Blue Economy as a critical arena for making substantive impact, both for the environment and for local prosperity. IUCN continues to engage in the discussion and aims to develop a pilot model to serve the greater WIO (Western Indian Ocean) region. This report is the first step in identifying and targeting priority interventions and solutions that can support local marine-based com- munities, as suggested interventions help spearhead the work of trialing key concepts along Kenya\u2019s coastline. This scoping study utilizes a combination of primary research (stakeholder interviews, focus group dis- cussions, and field research) and secondary research (literature review) to prioritize value chains and recommendations. The study highlights seaweed farming, sea cucumber farming, and finfish farming as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ce47744-dcc7-4d13-b48c-334923592318": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ce47744-dcc7-4d13-b48c-334923592318", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean SeaDeep ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e63309a5a17e0f68be2cc804d5dcf675138fc470e0120a164179b3d8f49585b"}, "3": {"node_id": "044acfaf-3e56-4f34-ac5a-383ca6e6a232", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2fee7ace9d285ecca4d640bfb3363447c310dfc0d52a8688cabce9ddb7af274"}}, "hash": "607349a430430649fd3729ccc383ed0c3540bc62f6c7aef8dc4aad3a70cc479d", "text": "key oppor- tunities. This executive summary overviews strengths and weaknesses of each value chain along with recommendations to drive sector transformation and reach optimal im- pact. Alongside the strategic levers for each value chain are opportunities for the sector, Kenya\u2019s current competitive position, and the potential for an inclusive market system. Additional detail and specific suggestions are developed in further detail in Chapter 7: Recommendations. Seaweed farming Kenya can maximize potential in the sea- weed industry through a dramatic increase in production and scale, as unlocking the potential for communities to produce at capacity can lead to sector-wide transforma- tion. At present, Kenya is not competitive in the regional seaweed market, and success hinges on both attracting new farmers and utilizing productive space at full capacity. By offering substantive volume, Kenya can draw the attention of additional exporters, devel- oping pricing competition that can benefit smallholders. The research identified three strategic levers to catalyse transformation in the seaweed sector: Executive summary vi Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Table 1: Seaweed farming strategic levers Opportunity Competitiveness Inclusivity \u2022 Develop business case for seaweed farmers to produce at maximum capacity \u2022 Sensitize communities and expand production base to include additional farming locales \u2022 Improve efficiency with covered drying facility to reduce labour and time required \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for ongoing farmer support and new farmer upstart \u2022 Tanzania (specifically Zanzibar) is Kenya\u2019s biggest regional competitor, producing over 103,000 tonnes of seaweed in 2019 \u2022 With similar ecosystems and with an extra 100km of available coastline, Kenya has the capacity to develop its seaweed production volumes and be competitive in the WIO region \u2022 As over 90% of current Kenyan seaweed farming is done by women, expansion opportunities stand to include even more female farmers in the sector \u2022 Furthermore, opportunity exists to encourage household participation for value-add tasks (like carrying heavy loads and transportation) \u2022 Develop business case for seaweed exporters to enter the Kenyan market \u2022 Sensitize communities and expand production base to include additional farming locales \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart \u2022 An uptick in post- pandemic global price will unlock better margins for exporters coming into Kenya \u2022 As the Kenyan national and coastal governments are prioritizing seaweed as a sector, enabling environments for foreign investment are expected to be favourable \u2022 Expanding competition among seaweed purchasers is expected to elevate farmgate price, enabling more Kenyan farmers to join \u2022 Incorporating additional high-value species stands to earn farmers 3x the current value with the same yields \u2022 Offshore farming is less prone to negative effects of rising ocean temperatures \u2022 Mastering deeper- ocean seaweed cultivation (which has historically been challenging for both Kenya and neighbour Zanzibar), has the potential to unlock access to a much larger seaweed market, as the \u201cEucheuma spp.\u201d (which includes Cottonii) category represents 29% of global production \u2022 Female seaweed farmers are highly motivated to start cultivating this species (despite male dominance), pending investment needed to kickstart the offshore farm \u2022 Female inclusion requires sea-safety training and boat- operator training, or these services could be provided by men in the community Source: TechnoServe The current seaweed industry in Kenya faces many addressable challenges. Limited production, which thereby limits income potential and market diversity, is caused by intensive labour conditions, a falling global price, historical dependence on external (do- nor or private sector) funding, and current perceptions among farmers, as they see an unattractive value proposition. COVID-19 has impacted the global price for seaweed, as an influx of farmers from once-tourism-de- pendent countries have fallen back on farming, increasing current global supply. However, as the global market dynamics are anticipated to return to normal post-pan- demic, Kenya has an opportunity to increase Increase production to reach current export capacity A Draw new exporter entrants to the sector Scale farming of higher-value species with new production methods B C Executive summary vii Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya production and be prepared to capitalize on an expected favourable market price. Kenya benefits from an extensive coastline with ecosystems conducive to growing seaweed, current farmers operating below potential, and new untouched communities, all point- ing to the production potential within the country. Additionally, with low barriers to entry, seaweed farming presents inclusive participation opportunities for vulnerable groups (women, youth, and people with disabilities).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "044acfaf-3e56-4f34-ac5a-383ca6e6a232": {"__data__": {"id_": "044acfaf-3e56-4f34-ac5a-383ca6e6a232", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean SeaDeep ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e63309a5a17e0f68be2cc804d5dcf675138fc470e0120a164179b3d8f49585b"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ce47744-dcc7-4d13-b48c-334923592318", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "607349a430430649fd3729ccc383ed0c3540bc62f6c7aef8dc4aad3a70cc479d"}}, "hash": "e2fee7ace9d285ecca4d640bfb3363447c310dfc0d52a8688cabce9ddb7af274", "text": "Seaweed farms offer alternative incomes among communities who would otherwise stress wild marine stocks through over- fishing, and they also create habitats that foster natural biodiversity, so investment in seaweed farming can improve the overall quality, resilience, and productive potential of coastal ecosystems.

Due to decades of overfishing, sea cucumber wild stocks are dwindling, harming the overall biodiversity of coastal ecosystems and forcing fishers into increas- ingly-risky diving practices. With a high price point, growing global demand, and an existing link to the export market, spear- heading inclusive sea cucumber farming models in Kenya will revolutionize the sector. Neighbouring countries in the WIO region have spent years trialing and refining the smallholder-outgrower model, and Kenya\u2019s success in the industry hinges on a three- step intensive investment: 1) establish sus- tainable models for short-term wild-capture of fingerlings, 2) pilot inclusive farming and generate proof-of-concept for both commu- nity-government and farmer engagement, and 3) draw private sector investment for hatchery systems that will enable long-term scale and sustainability. The research identified three strategic levers to catalyse transformation in the sea cucum- ber sector: Executive summary viii Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Table 2: Sea cucumber farming strategic levers Opportunity Competitiveness Inclusivity \u2022 Develop business case for sea cucumber farmers and local government, and by so doing, develop business case for hatchery investment \u2022 Sensitize communities and pilot production model \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart \u2022 Kenya\u2019s coast already proves conducive to sea cucumber growth (as evidenced by historically- documented wild stocks) \u2022 As a top producer in the WIO region, Madagascar represents the strongest competition in the sea cucumber market; however, with growing global demand and an unlimited export potential, it seems there is room for unencumbered growth without negative competitive impacts \u2022 In other countries, sea cucumber production represents an inclusive opportunity (60-80% of farmers are female) \u2022 Seaweed farmers often make the best sea cucumber farmers, as they already spend their time in the ocean, know the tides and the currents, are used to working with commercial partners, and are already aware of the value of these animals \u2022 Sensitize private sector investors and pilot hatchery model \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for hatchery upstart \u2022 With ongoing government support of regional multi-species hatchery facilities, the enabling environment for foreign investment is expected to be favourable \u2022 Based on existing global research, Kenya can pilot ready-made models, drastically reducing time-to-market for sea cucumber juveniles \u2022 While the hatchery model itself is not inherently inclusive, it enables inclusive farming opportunities \u2022 While low-scale, introduction of a new facility would warrant local job- creation ranging from technical (marine hatchery experts) to inclusive / accessible (administration and cleaning) \u2022 Invest in processing equipment and facilities, along with farmer training, to ensure quality is met to maintain favourable pricing \u2022 Shorten the supply chain and retain more value at the smallholder level \u2022 Increasing proportion of value-add services at the farmer level would put smallholders in competition with local traders and possibly regional exporters \u2022 Leveraging the farming model will drastically increase production, giving farmers a healthy volume of final product with which to negotiate, as compared to wild- catch sea cucumber fisheries \u2022 Processing activities at the export facility are already done by women, proving the potential for an inclusive model (for women and youth) at the community level \u2022 However, as the financial control of high-value jobs or products tends to be dominated by men, it is critical that value-add activities do not add to women\u2019s workload without providing appropriate benefit Source: TechnoServe Pilot inclusive farming model to generate proof- of-concept A Invest in scaleable hatchery model for sea cucumber juveniles Develop processing and aggregation services at the farmer level B C Executive summary ix Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya The biggest threat to a successful sea cu- cumber industry in Kenya is the impossibility of production without an operational hatch- ery for sea cucumber juveniles. Hatchery setup has proven challenging in the region, but Kenya can lean on global models and learn from failed attempts. Using the on- going research and investment in a coastal multi-species marine hatchery as a business case, Kenya has the opportunity to develop proof-of-concept for private sector investors, yielding a more sustainable hatchery option for the long-term growth of the industry. However, as an emerging value chain, sea cucumber farming is faced with minimal regulatory guidelines, underdeveloped governance, and yet-unproven negotiations around sea-use access.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b719f51-2028-4b0a-bd4c-aad515b5f2dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b719f51-2028-4b0a-bd4c-aad515b5f2dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean SeaDeep ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b3cbf13db5b8b5f417e87bb6a71c342f45197b9dedd80f6f6eb74a22af6f14e"}, "2": {"node_id": "8bff70e0-50eb-4822-a7dd-aad4189b4a7e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b78f445cd96b43789ecabb7b0ef83a77a55a74753a1029ff351e2f9caeee277"}}, "hash": "6422b20b7431d513c1bfccf2c355850657f9ad6a05eff028b31b3fcaa8c2d422", "text": "Furthermore, as high-value items, dried sea cucumber offers strong economic potential for smallholders, but this same benefit also makes the indus- try vulnerable to theft.

Farming sea cucumber can offer lucrative al- ternatives to overfishing, giving coastal eco- systems an opportunity to regenerate, while increasing the presence of species that sup- port environmental health. Further, current government support for this priority crop creates a favourable enabling environment. Finfish farming Fishing plays a vital role for coastal commu- nities, both in terms of food security and in terms of income generation. Kenya and the rest of the world suffer as global fish stocks disappear through overfishing. Investing in finfish farming using cage structures in marine sites has the potential to disrupt the current Kenyan value chain for local coastal consumption of fish by increasing and controlling production, avoiding restrictive market relationships, and reducing pressure on local environments. Local demand fish re- mains strong, and Kenya has an opportunity to develop sustainable production methods through marine-based finfish cage farming. Investment in fingerling access (through hatcheries) and responsibly-sourced feed are critical to long-term success in the sector, both financially and environmentally.

A lack of technical knowledge and relatively high startup costs, especially without viable financial products to sup- port community-level investment, can bar smallholders from entering the sector. Even more, the high-risk nature of mariculture, in that stocks are vulnerable to theft and escape, make the potential investment even more precarious. Long-term success in the sector also necessitates consistent and sustainable access to fingerlings and feed, but as the farming efforts are only just emerging, there are no viable hatchery facil- ities and no resource management systems around wild-capture of feed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09125952-b5ed-4b83-bc30-e16ef93f40dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "09125952-b5ed-4b83-bc30-e16ef93f40dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean SeaDeep ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2f009a2e1242d000f0d9a7ff2b9dc61cc953f889b82a3d678254485dce8c555"}, "2": {"node_id": "384c9776-6683-4d3d-9f3a-2eb2c87bec92", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c00d11a109a2e4e35cf750dab8f3b91def92c84ee45bf220e2239cb244807f28"}}, "hash": "6e8d9f64926d79b85a99a5de67ea820e8ab9718d61e2479e74a7d872e3e72b7b", "text": "Furthermore, the deeper-water nature of finfish farming structures, paired with the asset-burden of capital investment, leads to a lower potential for inclusivity among women in the commu- nity.

Fortunately, the Kenyan government, through KMFRI (Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute) is proving the business case in active testing, priming the space to pilot a scalable model among the private sector. Once constructed and regulated, the low running costs bring community-level operations within reach of smallholders. The industry benefits from strong local coastal demand for fish con- sumption (through a growing population and increasing dependence on fish imports). Finally, investing in finfish farming has the potential to disrupt the current value chain by increasing and controlling production and harvests, allowing farmers to avoid re- strictive market relationships and drawing more of the value toward the smallholder. Once scaled, sector innovations like cage farming can offer nature-based solutions that combat the impacts of destructive fish- ing practices and reduce pressure on local environments. What follows are detailed assessments and recommendations for each value chain that outline critical steps for success in the sectors, along with overall suggestions for boosting coastal economies and supporting pilots for farmer programs. Important to note is the ever-present threat of climate change, as each of the selected value chains will be affected by rising sea temperatures and more turbulent waters. These efforts are expected to contribute to a holistic approach for ensuring sustainable, meaningful impact, both for Kenyan ecosystems and for local-ar- ea alternative livelihoods.

Furthermore, Kenya sits among the 14 countries on the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy (Ocean Panel),4 an initiative which further highlights Kenya\u2019s enthusiasm for identifying innovative solutions that will protect the ocean and develop ocean-based economic opportunities. Not only does Kenya\u2019s participation in the groundbreaking Ocean Panel reinforce the degree to which the national government is primed to en- gage in this space, but the Ocean Panel itself serves as a resource for cutting-edge technologies and captivating ideas, and it acts as a global support for sustainable Blue Economy ventures.

The potential to drive impact among coastal communities grows year-on-year, as a combination of factors highlights Blue Entrepreneurship as a key driver. For example, global demand for ocean-based and ocean-adjacent products and services continues to grow, due to a rising global population8 who need inexpensive protein sources,9,10 an increasing middle-class inter- ested in travel,11 and a growing proportion of world tourism being dedicated to \u201cemerging markets.\u201d12 Kenya benefits from both of these sectors, with 0.8%13 of national gross domes- tic product (GDP) dedicated to fisheries and 6 ICT Authority.

Mindful of the ongoing health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on Kenya and its coastline, there is a need to ex- plore opportunities in the Blue Economy and other sectors to maximize positive impact on both coastal communities and ocean eco- systems. As such, interventions are expected to adhere to the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u2122 (NbS)16 that ensure environmental impacts are conscious of any potential unintended consequences. 1.2.

The recommendations will not only identify ways to catalyse investment but also under- score strategies to catalyse inclusive impact in the sectors, particularly in regards to the scaling of initiatives that positively impact the climate and ocean biodiversity. It is also particularly important that the strat- egy builds on existing donor and govern- ment initiatives and harnesses ways to both enhance and scale what is already working as well as recommend improved coordina- tion among market actors where there is an opportunity. The sub-objectives of the research are orien- tated around the following elements: \u2022 Establish market fundamentals: Gain clear understanding of how the sector currently operates, the opportunities and gaps in terms of competitiveness, the opportunities and challenges in regards to inclusive supply chains (particularly how value flows upstream and downstream), and develop a clear map of current donor initiatives and government policies supporting the sector. \u2022 Prioritize opportunities: Develop a long-list of potential interventions to support the sector, assess their potential for additionality in terms of i) climate impact ii) ocean biodiversity impact iii) employment opportunities created, and iv) feasibility, and identify those 2-3 value chains and/or strategies that seem to offer the greatest potential. \u2022 Deliver overall vision and strategies for transformation: Bring the analytical components together into a broader sector vision. Detail the strategies required, how they would work, how they will close the competitiveness gap, how they will deliver climate and conservation impact, how they drive greater inclusivity, how they will leverage existing programs and policies. Quantify the investment and impact benefits. Illuminate strategic pillars to achieve these visions and outline a roadmap over the next four years. 1.3. Research questions and methodology Ultimately, the research aims to answer: \u2022 Which three value chains present the optimal opportunity and most immediate potential for Kenya to positively impact coastal communities in terms of livelihoods and environmental progress (both conservation and regeneration)? By addressing this question using a com- bination of intensive literature review, desk research, and semi-structured interviews, the research will reveal the influential factors enabling or blocking potential for positive impact. Once the broad framework is in place, more specific value-chain-related questions can be explored and expounded. From there, the research hopes to address sub-questions like: \u2022 What are the market constraints and opportunities in the selected value chains? Introduction 4 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya \u2022 Which specific dynamics should be accounted for when planning future interventions? 1.4. Limitations of the research This research intends to utilize available re- sources to understand the current landscape for enterprises in coastal Kenya. We have limited the scoping efforts to ocean- based opportunities or value chains that have a direct connection to the coastline, thereby excluding on-land drivers of ocean health like plastics pollution and waste man- agement. Additionally, we excluded in-depth analyses of enablers, like government policy or large-scale infrastructure. These param- eters help us target impacts around coastal communities, enterprises, and households. While there is a pressing need to find scalable opportunities that can benefit the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region, the scope of this research is limited to the Kenyan context, with a specific focus on coastal geographies. Due to time constraints, local-area primary research was conducted exclusively in Kwale County locations, but we can reasonably ex- pect some transferability across geograph- ical areas when assessing the enablers and blockers. Secondary research is limited by widely-ac- knowledged over- and under-reporting of global fisheries data, complicating the exercise of pinpointing and reporting exact figures. We recognize the constraints to available data, and we proceed with the 18 TechnoServe. (n.d.). Mission. https://www.technoserve.org/about-us-varb/ understanding that all assessments and rec- ommendations are based on an incomplete global picture.

The Blue Economy concept The following research relies on a combina- tion of established working understandings of the Blue Economy, particularly those which integrate \u2018sustainability\u2019 as a core component. While some sources consider all economic activities that operate within the backdrop of the ocean,19,20 this report sets expectations of responsible engagement with value chains that promote regeneration and/or conservation impacts for the ocean and seas. For example, in line with what the World Bank describes as the \u201csustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods and jobs, and ocean ecosystem health,\u201d21 the Commonwealth of Nations depicts the Blue Economy as \u201can emerging concept which encourages better stewardship of our ocean or \u2018blue\u2019 resources.\u201d22 This research will not attempt to define the \u201cBlue Economy,\u201d per se.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce03f04f-97c7-4b61-8b6e-100bdd6a0b9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce03f04f-97c7-4b61-8b6e-100bdd6a0b9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean SeaDeep ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e412e4a2f8c5a7c2a4f0e3104be21513aa3d36e4808b3b7a26d3832808a4159e"}, "2": {"node_id": "40d64367-e9a9-4506-b245-792a5de987e1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee8a8985f630cad7ea8d93f33d0db61cf6d7800606b886d10cd78bd21cb10462"}}, "hash": "80d63a6de538270edfea49c7a3897fac51c3eed1e986bb7ad0ccd66cff600716", "text": "However, embedded in the purposes of this inves- tigation is an underlying expectation that interventions or recommendations will pro- mote the livelihoods of coastal communities (including vulnerable populations) and en- gage in enterprising activities that promote both active (conservation) and proactive (re- generation) benefits toward the ocean and the species therein. For the purposes of this study, we interpret \u2018Blue Entrepreneurship\u2019 as components within the Blue Economy space that involve individual (or household) business opportunities. Additionally, coastal communities are among the most affected by climate change impacts and ocean over- exploitation, as their direct livelihoods are dependent on ocean resources, making the focus on coastal Blue Entrepreneurship all the more urgent. By responsibly engaging in the Blue Economy sector, Kenya also showcases the initiative\u2019s support of and contributions toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).23 Regenerative, sustainable ocean-facing ventures contribute directly toward SDG 14: Life Below Water, and these initiatives also have the potential to support SDG 13: Climate Action. By applying a gen- der-aware lens during data collection, data analysis, and innovation ideation phases, the Economy 8 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya study is positioned to produce outcomes that also address gender equity among coastal communities (SDG 5). In addition, the follow-on effects from increased local in- vestment in critical ecosystems is expected to support SDG 12: Sustainable Consumption and Production, while with improved, more-stable incomes enable enterprising households and communities to tackle pov- erty (SDG 1), food insecurity (SDG 2), health (SDG 3), and education (SDG 4). According to insights from the OECD Roundtable held in March 2019, it is estimated that we will only achieve the SDGs by 209424 if we continue to operate with a business-as-usual approach. This staggering outlook compels us to ur- gently take proactive measures and address systemic issues surrounding poverty, health, and the environment. 2.2.

Ministry Of Agriculture, Livestock & Fisheries country population has increased by around 23%27 in the past 10 years,28 the population along the coast has increased by around 30%.29 Comprehensive research and sustain- able interventions that prioritize the Blue Economy stand to serve a growing propor- tion of Kenya\u2019s people. It also seems that county governments are adopting and promoting Blue Economy interventions as of late, as they recognize the importance of the sector on their local populations. For example, Lamu County government reports the fisheries industry as affecting 70%30 of county incomes, un- derscoring the need for attention in this space. Interestingly, when reviewing Kenya\u2019s documented 2016 County Prioritised Value Chains31 across the 6 coastal counties, only Tana River claimed \u2018fish\u2019 as an industry of in- terest. Despite being hailed as a priority from the national government, on-land agriculture and livestock has historically been perceived at the highest importance. However, in more recent years, it is clear from individual county development plans for 2018 - 2022 actions that fisheries are a focus.

Therefore, problems in an urban coastal region will not be the same as the problems in a rural one, underscoring the need for thoughtful analysis and flexible solutions. 32 Calculated from: KNBS 2019 census (see footnote #25 for citation) 33 Calculated from: KNBS 2019 census (see footnote #25 for citation) 34 National Geographic.

Profit According to recent research, if the ocean was an economy (specifically, thinking of the total \u201cvalue of key ocean assets\u201d), it would be the world\u2019s 7th largest, worth $24 tril- lion.45,46 From that immense global resource, the \u201cocean asset base\u201d of the WIO region values around an estimated $334 billion.47 Measuring economic output in a manner similar to measuring a country\u2019s GDP, the WIO produces nearly $21 billion annually, comprised from sectors like coastal tourism ($10.4 billion), carbon sequestration ($2.9 billion), and \u2018direct outputs\u2019 like fisheries and aquaculture ($1.9 billion).47 With Kenya\u2019s 536 kilometres48 of coastline, it benefits from a range of ocean-based industries like fishing and seafood capture, coastal and marine tourism, and shipping. Kenya, which was cit- ed as one of the fastest-growing economies49 in Sub-Saharan Africa, showcases potential for economic growth across the country\u2019s coasts across a variety of sectors. The Blue Economy currently contributes just under 180 billion KES per year (2.5% of the national GDP), and at full potential, the Blue Economy stands to bring in 500 billion KES per year.50 Economy 11 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya However, Kenya fell victim to the economic constriction of Q2 2020,51 taking a particular hit in the tourism sector, as the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Global supply chain disruptions along with changes to daily operating life (like a government-mandated curfew) have impacted the Kenyan local and national economies in ways not yet fully cap- tured. Even so, this research and subsequent recommended interventions are informed with an awareness of the economic im- pacts, both globally and domestically, of the COVID-19 crisis, especially as more focus is being brought to the profit potential of the ocean and coastal ecosystems. 51 Focus Economics.

Climate impact The devastating results of climate change not only threaten the health of our planet and the ocean, but they put Blue Economy development at risk. This makes it vital to develop a resilient Blue Economy that can adapt to these threats. Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of natural disasters. When occur- ring offshore, these natural disasters are a threat to marine industries such as the cruise industry (tourism), shipping (trade), and oil and gas (energy). If happening inshore, they dramatically increase coastal erosion and biodiversity loss, through destruction of nat- ural habitats. Natural disasters that happen on land transport pollution to the ocean. Another climate change impact is acidifi- cation of the ocean. This change leads to widespread collapse of coral systems, which are home to at least 25% of all species in the ocean. Moreover, ocean acidification threatens the health of zooplankton; if these die alongside the 25% of all biodiversity sus- tained by reefs, the whole ocean food chain is at risk of collapse. Such a dramatic impact on the marine food chain would directly impact the 2.4 billion people living less than 100km from the coast52,53 and who rely on the ocean for business and food security. Furthermore, ocean stratification due to climate change means that the oxygen-rich upper layer of the ocean heats up faster than the nutrient-rich bottom layer. This leads to less natural stirring of the two layers, and in the long run, can create a precarious en- vironment in which the majority of species will struggle to find both food and oxygen. Additionally, the rise of sea levels, due to increasing global temperatures and glacial ice melting, impacts photo-dependent ma- rine species (like corals and seaweed) whose positions under water will soon be too deep for the sun\u2019s rays to reach. The global community is only recently realiz- ing the intense negative impacts of climate change on the ocean, with more new infor- mation constantly made available. We are beginning to understand the threat to ma- rine life and to the coastal communities who depend on these changing ecosystems. This reinforces the urgent need to develop inno- vative solutions that support communities as they integrate into their income-build- ing activities the critical conservation and Blue Economy sectors and value chain overview 14 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya regeneration efforts needed to abate the disastrous effects of climate change. 3.1.2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79aae51b-f598-4113-811b-7cb4f630e188": {"__data__": {"id_": "79aae51b-f598-4113-811b-7cb4f630e188", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean SeaDeep ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19797e0218daedaa993db7634a3e508920007f569aeaf964321ec2b56da561aa"}, "2": {"node_id": "b2a26ccf-4144-4f77-b6a4-250b0fc000fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad0bc5f9f56a53cd2b39bfd8a86102f30c4c8e1132aec61acbae923857fa13f8"}}, "hash": "148fead6b555676acf98a3f33f3b0f113e969273276f7458664c8d2e73377f5c", "text": "3.1.2.

While more and more global consumers are making purchasing decisions that account for supply chains and their environmental impacts, this grassroots interest is not enough to main- tain and preserve the Blue natural capital resource for the long run. Instead, the Ocean Panel and other organizations are calling upon countries to plan for and execute strat- egies that address the increasing economic and resource pressure being placed upon the ocean. Citing Kenya\u2019s National Spatial Planning (NSP) 2015-2045, Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani (JKP) highlights how the Kenyan national strategy is developing expectations and ac- cordingly positioning the Blue Economy for growth in coming years.

Policy environment At the national-policy level, the \u201cClimate Change Act, 201658 is the key legislation guiding Kenya\u2019s climate change response.\u201d59 As part of the effort to fulfill that Act, Kenya\u2019s Ministry Of Environment And Forestry re- leased the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) 2018 - 2022. This Action Plan supports \u201cthe achievement of [Kenya\u2019s] Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement,\u201d which identifies \u201cwater and the Blue Economy\u201d as one of the targeted areas for intervention.59 Certainly as Kenya works toward its devolution status,60 legislative challenges and delays can be ex- pected as each county becomes responsible for its own interpretations, enactments, and enforcements of national-level initiatives and goals.61 Even so, efforts that support en- vironmental conservation and regeneration are primed to be supported at high levels by Kenya\u2019s policy structures.

De-risking coastal communities through diversification, while simultaneous- ly stimulating Blue Economy growth and prosperity, depends on collective effort that regenerates and conserves the Blue natural capital upon which all these coastal indus- tries depend. This research underscores the need for interventions that link livelihoods and economic benefits with long-term ocean health. A final important challenge to the Blue Economy is lack of specific technical know- how around ocean-related economies. Kenyan coastal communities, while armed with a wealth of indigenous and historical knowledge, lack technical ocean under- standings and are disadvantaged from a lack of access to advanced technologies. At the high-level, the translation of research into development and implemented practic- es is minimal, as evidenced by a noticeable lack of marine economic ventures, despite years of marine research in the country. Kenyan coastal success depends on relia- ble biodiversity and human ocean-activity data, ocean floor and coral mapping, and economic data related to Blue outputs. At the local-level, communities are under-edu- cated about simple, actionable conservation and restoration practices and how critical these practices are to both their livelihoods as well as to the long-term health of their local ecosystems. 77 Ecorys.

A report published through the European Commission77 identifies key mar- itime functions and sub-functions, and the research team adopted this framework to initiate value chain brainstorming activities. The structure divided the first-round work into the following six functions: Blue Economy sectors and value chain overview 18 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya \u2022 Maritime transport and shipbuilding \u2022 Food, nutrition, health and ecosystem services \u2022 Energy and raw materials \u2022 Leisure, working and living \u2022 Coastal protection \u2022 Maritime monitoring and surveillance More detail on functions and sub-functions can be found in Appendix 2. While creating a truly comprehensive set of ocean-based value chains represents an impossible task, the research team instead utilized the selected framework to investi- gate and expose various backdrops within the Blue Economy, making the list as com- plete and representative as possible. Simply put, the initial research phase attempted to identify a multi-sector assortment of \u2018ways to make money\u2019 across the coast. Important to note are some primary exclusion criteria for the initial exhaustive list of Blue Economy options. Based on the scoping study framing and the intended impacts for results and recommendations, we did not include ven- tures that were: \u2022 Non-income-generating (e.g.: volunteer or unpaid conservation efforts); \u2022 Inland-based (e.g.: on-land pollution- reduction schemes); and/or \u2022 Enablers (e.g.: government policy) From there, we set out to pare down to the fi- nal Long List of 8-12 ventures, so the research team needed to: \u2022 Develop selection criteria for the first assessment (further detailed in Section 3.3) that could quickly and efficiently reduce the exhaustive list across a variety of cross-cutting measures \u2022 Use stakeholder interviews and secondary research to evaluate each option on the exhaustive list against the first-assessment selection criteria \u2022 Promote the ventures with the strongest potential to the Long List Finally, the research team developed the Short List, aiming for 2-3 high-priority value chains for the deep-dive investigation. To arrive at the final Short List, we took the fol- lowing actions: \u2022 Develop a set of selection criteria for the second assessment (further detailed in Section 3.3), introducing additional metrics that could point to economic and community potential within the value chains \u2022 Conduct secondary research and stakeholder interviews to assess the Long List against the second- assessment selection criteria \u2022 Host a Focus Group session with a variety of industry experts to generate an engaging discussion around the Long List status and the potential of an initial suggested Short List \u2022 Work closely with IUCN for final approval of the Short List Ultimately, the research team identified 66 value chains for the Blue Economy in Kenya, 11 options for the Long List, and ended with 3 Blue Economy value chains for the Short List. 3.3. Selection criteria As part of the \u2018prioritizing value chains\u2019 step in the study process, the research team developed an efficient, comprehensive set of selection criteria. These criteria pinpoint Blue Economy sectors and value chain overview 19 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya value chains that exist in the overlap between ventures positioned to meet the livelihoods and environmental goals of the overall pro- ject and value chain areas primed to benefit from long-term support and current nation- al and regional momentum. The first-assessment selection criteria fo- cused on the following metrics: \u2022 Community- Enterprise Potential: Can you start or promote an inclusive enterprise (scaled thru community) with this value chain? \u2022 Regenerative Potential: What is the potential for the local environment to be restored and conserved? What is the potential to avoid future degradation of ecosystems? \u2022 Nature Conservation & Climate Change Potential: To what degree will the value chain activities conserve animals or plants in the ecosystems? To what degree will activities mitigate effects or help communities adapt to climate change impacts? \u2022 Upstart Time: How long until profit potential? 78 Ministry of Environment and Forestry.

Essentially, we assumed they represented the \u2018best possible\u2019 versions of the value chains. We also did not apply any additional, explicit weighting to these cri- teria; however, based on rating scales used, Kenya Government Priority and High-Level Panel Priority criteria carry \u00bd or \u2153 of the weight of other metrics, respectively.

The second-assessment selection evaluation embedded the assumption that activities highly negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic would be de-prioritized until some stability and regularity return to the industries. All criteria are equally weighted. Figure 2 shows the 11 value chains in the Long List, presented by function, as ranked against the second-assessment selection criteria. The four-colour visual rating scale ranges from Red = low suitability to Dark Green = high suitability. The research team then engaged in the Focus Group activity, with the aim of gener- ating discussion around the Long List and the emerging Short List. At that time, the front-running value chains were: \u2022 Seaweed farming \u2022 Finfish cage farming \u2022 Sea Cucumber farming \u2022 Planting On-land Trees (to prevent mangrove deforestation) The virtual Focus Group event was held on 18 February 2021. Besides the research team and IUCN representation, there were six attend- ees from across Kenya, bringing expertise in various subjects and representing various stakeholders, including: Coastal Women in Fisheries Entrepreneurship (CWiFE), Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), and Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani (JKP). Several key takeaways emerged from the Focus Group, notably: \u2022 Social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic affected the local fisheries industry primarily through a government-mandated curfew ordinance which affected traditional fishing and fish-processing working hours, with the majority of the economic disruption occurring for women Blue Economy sectors and value chain overview 25 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya \u2022 Seaweed is an important focus of government-led or government-backed organizations \u2022 Sea cucumber and octopus present strong potential across coastal fisheries and mariculture projects, and these value chains were targeted as priority for Kenya among the Blue Economy Implementation Committee Additionally, since financing and innovation are already in place to achieve scale for on- land timber production, other value chains seemed to have more need, and therefore more potential, for additional support and investment. This assessment fits with the research aims, namely the end results of scalable, innovative recommendations for the sector.

Total produc- tion, including both collected and farmed, went from \u201c0.6 million tonnes in 2000 to 32.4 million tonnes in 2018.\u201d83 Important to note is that while the overall production of aquatic algae (of which, seaweed is the primary output) is increasing, it is increasing at a decreasing rate.83 While FAO-collected data shows that the majority of seaweed pro- duction (over 99%) occurs in Asian countries, the report is clear in saying that total values are underrepresented, therefore leading to potentially inaccurate country-assigned pro- portions, as it does not have data from sever- al major global producers.83 The value of the global commercials seaweed market varies due to over- and under-reporting of data more so than because of actual output vari- ations.

Production base The global commercial landscape for sea- weed production includes a variety of mech- anisms, ranging from small-scale operations (like wild-harvest and near-shore cultivation) to large-scale commercial ventures (like off- shore -or \u201cat sea\u201d- cultivation) to innovative designs (like integrated multi-trophic aqua- culture (IMTA) systems). In Kenya, production of exportable seaweed is exclusively farmed, as the sole exporter, C-WEED Corporation,90 does not purchase wild-harvested products. To maintain qual- ity and a transparent purchasing chain, the Kenya Country Representative buys exclu- sively from its own registered farmers. Reports confirm that Kenya\u2019s seaweed pro- duction potential is bolstered by its \u201clengthy coastline endowed with a wide variety of habitats for seaweed communities\u201d as well as its many (over 380) naturally-occurring species, some of which are unique to Kenyan coastal areas.91 However, current production is limited to Kwale County, where previous seaweed farming program pilots existed and then went dormant. A scout from C-WEED, a global exporting company operating in Zanzibar, Tanzania for over 30 years, hap- pened upon villages where farmers had successfully stored seaweed for up to three to four years, ready for purchase and export.

Additionally, as seaweed is propagated by retying smaller harvested bunches back onto the ropes and allowing them to re-grow, there is no \u2018seed- ling\u2019 cost past the first season. Farmers are currently only growing the Eucheuma den- ticulatum species. This variety is farmed for carrageenan, used as a gelling and stabilizing agent in the \u201cproduction of pharmaceutical, cleaning and personal care products like lotions and toothpaste, as well as in edible food such as burgers and various types of desserts.\u201d92 Farming cycles align with tidal cycles, and farmers work during the spring tide that comes every two weeks. During this period (5-7 days) where the low tides are lowest and the high tides are highest, farmers ideally spend the first three days harvesting and drying seaweed, with the remaining four days dedicated to re-seeding the ropes and securing them back into position. After two to four spring tides of growth (approximately 6 weeks), the seaweed should be ready. Farmers must take care to harvest quickly enough, else over-grown seaweed that pushes too hard against the tie-tie becomes severed and floats away. During working weeks, farmers average roughly three to four hours per day, when tides are low enough to access farm plots. On site, farmers monitor their crops and do the tiring work of carrying heavy loads to drying stations, often without help. Production cycles are also depending on seasonal weather patterns. Conditions are Value chain analysis: seaweed farming 32 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya good and yields are generally high from March through early May, during the in- ter-monsoon season. From June to July/ August, coastal areas in Kenya are subject to the Southeast Monsoon. This season brings extreme wind and rough sea conditions that not only cause seaweed to break away from ropes but also bring invasive filamentous green algae that destroy crops. Production increases again during August/September to November when conditions are relatively cool. From December to February, seaweed plants are unable to survive the hot temper- atures of summer waters, so farmers plant \u2018survival seedlings\u2019 in deep-water storage zones where cooler and more regulated wa- ter temperatures will keep the seedlings safe until it is time to replant. To date, there are around 1,500 registered seaweed farmers in Kwale County;93 howev- er, only about 500-600 are active and have substantial production. While some youth participate, farmers are generally between 40 and 55 years old, and over 90% of farmers are women. Kenyan seaweed faces a number of produc- tion-specific challenges. Unsurprisingly, envi- ronmental factors, like unfavourable weather patterns and warming sea temperatures, make farming in certain seasons impossible and come with higher risk of infestation or disease. Farmers also complain of a lack of assets, such as boots, mallets, and boats/ rafts, that would support farming activities. Although, some stakeholders argue that the frustration around inputs is a natural result of dependence on a revolving door of NGO and donor-funded projects. With the arrival of each new program, and the accompanying flurry of funding and startup support, local 93 Martin Kiogora (stakeholder interview, 12 Mar 2021) farmers are further disincentivised to see seaweed farming as a business and invest in necessary assets and equipment them- selves. Between the expectation of support and the current perception of low prices for difficult labour, motivation among farmers can be a challenge to production. 4.3. Broader value chain mapping As the seaweed value chain in Kenya is ex- port-only and dominated by a single export- er, the broader dynamics are relatively sim- ple. Seaweed is grown and dried by coastal farmers, and then seaweed is collected, transported, and exported by the C-WEED Corporation.

Farmers might be paid once or twice a year, and the infrequency is due to low production and the time it takes the com- munity to meet a minimum village volume that justifies exporter collection and trans- portation costs. After receiving payments, farmers often contribute to their village-level seaweed-farming SACCOS (Savings and Credit Cooperative Societies) that serves as a local financial instrument. Purchases are made in bulk, ranging any- where from 2 - 23 tonnes in a given collec- tion. The exporting company takes on the operating costs of transportation and labour, and collections are taken to the main centre in Kibuyuni, where dried seaweed is baled. The commercial-grade baling machine packs seaweed from farmer sacks into 100kg bales. These bales are then transported to Mombasa, where they are loaded into shipping containers, holding 20 tonnes of dried seaweed each (200 bales for each 120ft container).

The global price for seaweed dropped by US$ 100 per metric ton in 2020, and again by US$ 120 per metric ton in early 2021.90 This means the exporter is now earn- ing only 74 KES/kg on the global market, as opposed to the pre-pandemic price of 92 KES/kg. Using estimates of operating costs, it is likely that farmers retain 30-45% of the profit pro- portion in the value chain, while the exporter retains 55-70%. With decreasing global pric- es, the export business is caught between the challenges of low production volumes and shrinking margins. Increasing both yield (which is sometimes an issue of farmer mo- tivation) and number of farms would help justify continued spending on operational costs. While not yet developed, the sector has the potential to incorporate additional market actors for value-add and support activities. For example, intensive labour and carrying of heavy loads might be outsourced to local income-generating youth groups. With suf- ficient production, transportation services might also be a sustainable business model for local entrepreneurs. Kenya has yet to be competitive in the WIO seaweed trade, limited by scale and produc- tivity challenges. With target expansion ef- forts and thoughtful farmer support, Kenya\u2019s coastal farmers have the potential to outstrip production in Zanzibar, which currently stands at over 100,000 tonnes annually.83 Value chain analysis: seaweed farming 34 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Enabling environment The sector is also marked by the presence of NGOs who have historically offered farmer training programs and distributed inputs.

Finally, the seaweed value chain is influenced by government research facilities responsible for completing suitability mapping and up- dated environmental impact assessments. 4.4. Key challenges and threats Several prominent challenges face the sea- weed industry in Kenya today. First is one of scale. At present, only a small number of farmers are producing seaweed, limiting the attractiveness of investment by private sec- tor players and exporters. Farmer issues, like difficult, exposed working conditions and the poor value proposition of intensive effort for minimum payout, all discourage new farm- ers from entering the market. Fewer farmers thereby limits Kenya\u2019s overall potential to scale the industry. Furthermore, seaweed farming, as a relatively new venture, still struggles with dependence on government and donor support, and only a few farmers in Kwale County have managed to create a fully-autonomous business. Scaling seaweed output in Kenya, especially as global prices are currently falling, requires either easing the production burden or capturing more of the market value at the smallholder level, Value chain analysis: seaweed farming 35 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya driving farming adoption in the category and bringing critical attention to Kenya as a viable market player. Additional scaling challenges have been reported from some coastal communities who are unwilling to set up seaweed farming in their areas. Some local leaders fear that developing farming ventures will disrupt the status quo and are wary of the increased empowerment that comes with female farmers generating their own incomes. Over the past decade, several seaweed farming pilots have been launched across Kenya\u2019s coastline. As such, the local BMUs have developed protocols for sea-use access and leasing to farmer groups. Even though the governance work has begun, gaps for comprehensive management remain. Currently, seaweed farmers complain of con- flict with local fishers, who take advantage of increased fish populations in the newfound habitats but destroy seaweed lines and crops in the process. The lack of complete zoning and protections, that is gazetting the sea-access rights, threatens the security and scalability of the seaweed farming sector. Another threat to seaweed farming longevity is unstable access to a changing global mar- ket. First and foremost, there is no domestic market for farmed seaweed, apart from small value-added products that have yet to prove large enough to absorb significant lev- els of production. Therefore, the industry is dependent on global exports. At present, the entire sector rests on the export capacity of a single, solitary buyer; without enough volume to attract additional export players, farmers and their livelihoods are dependent on the success and intervention of this sole market actor. Highlighting the risk of dependence are reports from stakeholders of infrequent exports. The Country Representative from C-WEED Corporation confirmed the delay in shipments was due to deflated global de- mand related to an oversupply in the global market and a downward price trend. Moreover, financial impacts of the COVID-19 crisis also threaten the success of the sector, as production from other tourism-depend- ent countries has increased, dropping global prices. Granted, any worldwide event that dramatically reduces the price for farmers will exacerbate already-thin margins and a waning value proposition. The influx of supply due to COVID-19 happens to be the current culprit. Incomes from seaweed are already relatively low due to the commod- itised nature of the product, and Kenya will struggle to entice farmers and generate required sector scale if prices drop further. Finally, as with all mariculture initiatives, climate change impacts pose a threat to long-term Kenyan seaweed production.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "758b5049-9de1-4407-ac07-db82b039ee28": {"__data__": {"id_": "758b5049-9de1-4407-ac07-db82b039ee28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean SeaDeep ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bff4ddb0886ed36514d8f30bb0e8c7d6e8fb83c6e283d61be94a5843f46c4628"}, "2": {"node_id": "a1240b01-4156-48b6-a537-6072d78d576d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1176a07863480ecb33b98849ee6765edd1e4ee804f7406558f48ad2504a42ab2"}}, "hash": "6e4e693a74fc963a9b669488f3f8a1fd8d9b2844e531432de47eaab2509f7dab", "text": "The intertidal areas where seaweed is grown are at greater risk of rising temperatures, and changes in weather patterns that generate rougher seas negatively impact farming infrastructure.

Key strengths and opportunities Leaning on lessons from Kwale County seaweed pilots and learnings from seaweed farming projects in Zanzibar, Tanzania, it is clear that Kenya boasts coastal ecosystems that are conducive to growing seaweed.

Additionally, seaweed production does not require clearing of land or use of freshwater. These \u2018avoided produc- tion costs\u2019 also make farming relatively envi- ronmentally-friendly, albeit farmer practices and community conflict are the main drivers of unintended negative environmental consequences (like destruction of seagrass meadows). In Kenya, seaweed farming appeals to wom- en. Beyond the low cost, there is no require- ment for land ownership, and the near-shore area is safer (as compared to deep-water ventures like fishing). At this stage in value chain development, profit margins are also limited, so seaweed is not yet appealing as a crop for male involvement. Further involvement in the sector must responsibly consider the societal and family dynamics at play in Kenyan coastal communities, as the role of women as primary seaweed farmers develops. Innovations and interventions must be cognisant of potential harm (emo- tionally, financially, or otherwise) to women by outlining an expectation of intensive work with minimal benefit. Reports from the field suggest that the sec- tor also benefits from momentum driven by local enthusiasm and word-of-mouth pro- motion.

Another strength of the seaweed industry in Kenya is its status as a high-priority area for government support. Its position as a key sec- tor for the Blue Economy agenda in Kenya is encouraging for market players who want to be assured of high-level attention and coop- eration, in funding, research, and policy, for pushing seaweed success.100 County govern- ments are also taking the lead on seaweed. In Kwale County,93 for example, the county government already allocates funds to the sector, and the Fisheries Director reports on plans to expand the value-chain by ensuring a ready-market for the current production. Additionally, because pilots are already un- derway in key areas, local government Beach Management Units (BMUs) have already outlined governance structures for sea-use access of community-based seaweed farms. Replicating the model and adapting for local context across other geographies will be much simpler than developing all the regu- lations from scratch. Seaweed farming is attractive to farmers, as the barriers to entry are relatively low (like low-tech farming mechanics and minimal input cost). As seaweed can be produced year-round and does not require full-time attention, coastal households benefit from an alternative livelihood option that offers supplemental, rather than replacement, income and constant cash flow. As the plots utilize near-shore intertidal zones, seaweed Value chain analysis: seaweed farming 37 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya farming can be taken up by a full range of community members, including women and youth, making it a welcome economic option to help coastal areas recover from COVID-19 declines. Diversification and access are two critical components for building household economic resilience, and seaweed farming serves to both reduce the community\u2019s de- pendence on fishing as an income source as well as reduce the strain on the local ecosys- tems from overfishing.

Demand for edible sea cucumbers continues to grow on the global market, with a boom among China\u2019s middle class in the 1980s spearheading the trend.107 Additionally, chemicals found in the skin can be used in both traditional and modern medicine, so the market is also responding to a growing interest among pharmaceutical firms.107 These converging interests com- pound demand and have led to dramatic overfishing of sea cucumber globally. Sources say that upwards of 70% of glob- al fisheries for sea cucumber are fully or over-exploited or depleted,102,104 with \u201cno natural populations remaining\u201d in China.102 This dramatic rise in demand and price have led to what Mongabay terms a \u201cmarine gold rush.\u201d104 As of 1996, only 35 countries engaged in the sea cucumber export business, but by 2011, that number had more than doubled to 83.107,108 Furthermore, between 2011 to 2016, the global average market price for sea cu- cumbers rose nearly 17%.107 Value chain analysis: sea cucumber farming 40 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya This extreme demand generates damaging results. Fisheries around the world are see- ing drops in wild availability. For example, in Yucatan, Mexico it took only 2 years (2012 to 2014) for wild sea cucumber harvests to drop 95% (from 260 tons to only 14 tons).107 Business Insider reports that, as of 2019, from the \u201c70 or more species of exploited sea cucumbers, seven are now classified as endangered\u2026 all through exploitation.\u201d107 These results do critical damage to local ecosystems as well as to the communities whose livelihoods depend on fisheries for survival. The decline in available resources is linked to a combination of foreign demand, ineffective governance structures, and daily economic pressure among poor coastal communities.109 Over-reliance on small scale fisheries is common, and 66% of sea cucum- ber fisheries are small-scale.106 Exploitation of any piece of these fragile ecosystems puts the environment and the livelihoods of hun- dreds of millions of people at stake. As much of the sea cucumber trade world- wide exists through informal channels sup- ported by poaching, global production sta- tistics are hardly comprehensive. The market is fraught with illegal hunting and, either through negligence or intentional subver- sion, underreported import and export figures.110,111 For example, a 2020 study from Traffic shows that between 2012 and 2019, Hong Kong reported receiving sea cucumber 109 KCET (KCET-TV).

This attention has yet to translate into sufficient government monitoring and intervention, however.

Sea cucumber trade and production is a high-value indus- try. Therefore, this issue that necessitates increased regulatory oversight and financial resources dedicated to security and anti-cor- ruption measures is the same issue that points to a lucrative global market with po- tential to capitalize on unmet demand while simultaneously creating models that offer sustainable production and even regenerate ocean ecosystems. 115 Hery Lova Razafimamonjiraibe (stakeholder interview, 17 Mar 2021) 116 Blue Ventures.

Production base Global production of sea cucumber consists of a mixture of wild-catch and aquaculture farming facilities, with the prevalence of each production type dictated by availability of wild stocks, access to hatchery and rearing technology, and prevalence and enforceabil- ity of local governance requirements. In many countries that see an overlap of hospitable ecosystems and minimal (or no) domestic consumption, sea cucumber wild catch is the predominant means of produc- tion. Due to the high value, and because sea cucumbers are slow-moving, \u2018catching\u2019 is really more like \u2018collecting,\u2019 adding to the problem of global sea cucumber stocks that are dramatically overfished.

How sea cucumbers are boosting the bioeconomy in Zanzibar. http://www.fao.org/fao-stories/article/ en/c/1247576/ fishers can still manage a relatively high catch, but quality is reduced, due to small- er sizes. Additional challenges of the rainy season include lower production base, as many fishers avoid the practice when seas are rough, and post-harvest losses due to ex- cess rain that make drying processes slower or less effective. Export prices from Kenya are highest from November to February, coinciding with holidays like Christmas and Lunar New Year. Kenya competes on the global market with Asian countries, like Fiji in particular, and with other African countries, like Madagascar and Seychelles. When vying for a position in the global export market, Kenya faces production challenges like climate change, insufficient supply, and declining stocks. According to the Fisheries Directors of Kwale County, wild sea cucumber stocks have been on the decline for decades, forcing several operators to close their sea cucumber busi- nesses.93 Sea cucumber aquaculture is an option for Kenyan production that could solve some of the problems with availability, while also building back the ecosystems in ways that protect and regenerate other ani- mal populations. Several examples of sea cucumber aquacul- ture projects exist in the WIO region, some more successful than others. A Zanzibar, Tanzania sea cucumber project, supported by FAO and Korea International Cooperation Agency,122 faces the aftermath of a liveli- hoods program cut short. Despite technical research and training through FAO and Blue Ventures, the hatchery has shut down due to an inability to master sea cucumber juvenile Value chain analysis: sea cucumber farming 43 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya feeding techniques115 and a lack of funding,123 stopping the program in its tracks. However, leaning on decades of trial, adap- tation, and learning, Blue Ventures102,106 offers an example of a community-farming setup in Madagascar and points to the potential successes that can be found for both eco- systems and local community livelihoods. In Madagascar, Blue Ventures sea cucumber farmers are earning on-par with the coun- try\u2019s agricultural minimum wage,124 just from doing sea cucumber farming part-time (roughly 20 hours/month).115 These farmers also produce high-value seaweed, adding to their incomes. Additionally, the farming practices are yielding a 60% return on juve- niles to harvest, which is double the return at a standard industrial farm.

One exporter interviewed chooses to travel to Hong Kong from Mombasa, carrying the shipment himself. This work, of course, requires a special export license, as well as four additional certifications.

At present, the sea cucumber export market in Kenya is limited, as exporters are facing increased financial pressure, and some have recently shut down operations.93 Throughout the whole of Kenya, no sea cucumber aquaculture presently exists,93 and introducing sea cucumber farming will disrupt the current value chain. Opportunity exists to harness a lucrative industry, incor- porate innovative ideas (that are inclusive of vulnerable populations) to boost supply, and generate substantial value for local-fisher livelihoods. Enabling environment As an emerging value chain, the sea cucum- ber industry is widely unregulated across Kenya. This means that wild populations are not monitored or measured, no catch quo- tas exist, and sea cucumber businesses are Value chain analysis: sea cucumber farming 46 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya subject to general sector regulations, rather than measures informed specifically for the product. The Kwale County Fisheries Director confirmed that, in the county, regulations around sea cucumber catch are nonexistent. However, the county is currently undergo- ing efforts to revive aquaculture practices that stalled during the Economic Stimulus Program. As the county government prior- itizes its constituent\u2019s demands, efforts cur- rently focus on freshwater aquaculture near dams. Positively, Kilifi County government set targets for 2018 - 202295 that include con- ducting feasibility studies, with sea cucum- ber named specifically as a priority. Market actors can expect the enabling environment and government regulation of sea cucumber on the coast to be a work-in-progress for the foreseeable future. 5.4. Key challenges and threats The most pressing bottleneck for a robust, sustainable sea cucumber aquaculture value chain in Kenya is the issue of institut- ing and maintaining viable hatcheries. At present, not a single hatchery exists, and the sector has no chance of survival or scale without operational hatcheries relatively close to farming grounds, as fingerlings are too delicate to transport far distances (that is, no further than 100km).115,120 As seen with the Zanzibar effort, the hatchery challenge represents a combination of issues including funding (even with an active hatchery, simi- lar projects require a minimum of five years115 of external program funding to achieve self-sufficient systems), technical expertise 137 Karega, V.

First, the lack of current government regulation in the sector means farmers are at risk from both ecological and financial factors.

If Kenya can solve the hatchery issue and find funding for sufficient support during farmer Value chain analysis: sea cucumber farming 47 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya scale-up, we can expect to build an indus- try that is competitive with Madagascar in the WIO region. In the mid-to-long term, a healthier supply of stocks would help draw new entrants into the export side of the market, reducing the risks of monopolistic behaviours and spreading more control and wealth downstream. 5.5. Key strengths and opportunities Despite the challenges and risks, there is great potential for the sea cucumber value chain in Kenya. Beyond the growing global demand and attractive prices, there is \u201cun- limited\u201d export opportunity in Kenya93,120 and hardly any price volatility.120 Simply put, the market is there to be filled. Knowing that local stocks exist (as in the wild-catch mar- ket) are assurance that the Kenyan coastline boasts appropriate growing conditions for farming sea cucumber. As the sea cucumber industry sits as a Kenyan government priority, efforts in the space will benefit from this directed attention, enthusi- asm, and funding. Importantly, the national government, with financial support from the World Bank,123 is currently investing in the re- search and development of a hatchery pilot in Shimoni, Kwale County. This multi-species facility, while currently undergoing con- struction, is several years away from being fully operational. It is probable the facility will eventually be able to provide sea-cucumber fingerlings for farmer pilot programs, but of even greater value will be its ability to expose the proof of concept for a viable hatchery business. By highlighting the business case, this facility can help unlock critical private sector interest and investment in the value chain. Moreover, while an under-regulated industry holds inherent risk (as outlined in Section 5.4), organizations like IUCN have the unprecedented opportunity to become an irreplaceable partner for robust regula- tion-setting that drives forward an eco-con- scious agenda (including ecosystem pro- tections, stock population monitoring, and environmental measurement requirements) as well as local-area best-practices (like ad- vocating for local community involvement in governance setup and the protection and inclusion of vulnerable populations). In the meantime, while policies are being devel- oped, there exists a window of opportunity to trial thoughtful, responsible short-term breeding solutions that pull juveniles from the ocean in a sustainable way. This type of pilot integrates into government regulatory conversations while also breaking ground on farmer pilot programs in parallel to hatchery development. Among the strengths of the sea cucumber industry are benefits to farmers, such as low barriers to entry (achievable technology, low upstart costs, and part-time farming hours), relative safety (as compared to current wild-capture diving practices), and constant cash flow (when farms are operational and invest in monthly seeding practices, they can benefit from monthly harvests, too). The close-to-shore nature, and the opportunities for value-addition services are conducive to including vulnerable populations like wom- en and youth. Especially in the aftermath of the national economic decline in 2020 due to COVID-19 crisis, market actors can develop a value chain in Kenya that engages the full household to build pandemic-era livelihoods that support coastal families.

Market dynamics According to a Sustainable Seafood Overview report, \u201capproximately 3 billion people in the world rely on wild-caught and farmed seafood as a primary source of protein.\u201d138 FAO estimates the average global citizen consumes 20.5kg per year, as of 2018.83 With an increasing global population, aquatic an- imals emerge as a critical category for food security and daily protein. In fact, the growth rate for human consumption of fish not only outpaces growth rates for other animal proteins, but it has been increasing at \u201ca rate almost twice that of annual world population growth.\u201d83 Not only are there more of us, we are eating much more fish. These growth trends are markedly more pronounced in developing countries. When FAO outlines global fisheries and aq- uaculture production, the totals for \u2018fish\u2019 in- clude shelled molluscs, finfish, crustaceans, and other aquatic animals, but exclude \u201caquatic mammals, crocodiles, alligators and caimans, seaweeds and other aquatic plants.\u201d83 Global production of fish reached 179 million tonnes in 2018, and 69% of the world\u2019s total comes from Asia, of which China accounts for more than half. Africa trails be- hind the Americas and Europe, contributing only around 7% to global totals.83 Most fish is consumed locally, as exports account for only 38% of worldwide production, but even so, the global fish export industry has a re- ported annual value of over US$ 164 billion.83 Global production comes from a relatively even split between wild-capture (96.4 million tonnes, representing 54%) and farmed aq- uaculture (82.1 million tonnes, representing 46%). However, according to reports, \u201cthe value of farmed fish was higher, around US$ 250 billion compared with [US]$ 151 billion for wild-caught fish.\u201d128 On an upward trend, it is estimated that aquaculture production will \u201cincrease by one-third by 2030 \u2026 and will supply the majority of aquatic protein in people\u2019s diets by 2050.\u201d128 While wild-catch production is predom- inantly marine-based (88%), only 38% of farmed fish comes from the ocean.139 Shelled molluscs are the primary product from marine-based aquaculture, with finfish rep- resenting around 24%. On the whole, then, marine-based finfish farming accounts for less than 9% of global aquaculture produc- tion and just over 4% of global fish produc- tion overall.140 The aquaculture industry is underdeveloped across the African region, and the continent contributed less than 3% to the global aqua- culture total in 2018, with sub-Saharan Africa contributing less than 0.5%.83 The continent is heavily dependent on wild-catch, and Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 52 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya according to FAO, \u201caquaculture accounted for 17.9 percent of total fish production in Africa,\u201d83 as compared to the worldwide pro- portion of 46%.

The challenge on the horizon is one of feeding Kenya\u2019s increasing population as surrounding countries compete to sup- port their own populations that are growing even faster. The pressure on supply is likely to make fish imports more scarce and more expensive for Kenya in coming years. Reports show that \u201cfish catches have been declining in Africa in recent years by a million tons a year,\u201d147 making it clear that Africa\u2019s overreli- ance on wild-capture fishing poses a threat for not only the health and nutrition of the population, but to the ecosystems upon which coastal communities rely. Mirroring worldwide reports, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on Kenya and the WIO region. With the global tourism indus- try at a standstill, there is no surprise that coastal communities in Kenya are feeling the financial impacts of the shutdown. Also, the increasing difficulty of accessing medical care along with new government-mandated public health protocols add additional pres- sure on poor households.148 Many are forced into subsistence fishing to feed their fami- lies, and the increased fishing activity strains the productive potential of ecosystems. Additionally, the government-mandated evening curfew has impacted the Kenyan Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 53 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya coastal fishing industry in a number of ways. First, from the production side, without the option for night-fishing in deeper waters, local fishers end up taking advantage of more near-shore habitats, even if they are protected areas like community-based LMMAs.148 Lower fish stocks make fishing an ever-more-challenging task, with excess ef- fort spent to reap less reward. Not only does this negatively impact household income and food security, but local ecosystems are suffering, causing a negative biodiversity rip- ple effect as regenerative potential dwindles. Stories from Vanga in Kwale County tell of the challenges within coastal fish trades caused by the pandemic; Blue Ventures quotes one of their Kenyan contacts as saying: \u201cThey have cut and taken the buoys we put to mark our LMMA area.

Production base The market dynamics for the Kenyan fish- eries sector are complex, and it is not the aim of this report to detail the entire pro- duction base. For example, Kenya produces aquatic animals through both wild-capture and aquaculture (farmed) methods. These activities occur both inland and in marine environments. Furthermore, Kenya produc- es an array of animal types, including finfish, mussels, octopi, crabs, oysters, and more. Some products are for the export market, some are for high-value domestic consump- tion (involving transport across the country), and some are for local coastal consumption. In line with the objectives of the study, and with priority value chain outputs in mind, this report focuses specifically on: ma- rine-based, finfish aquaculture for the local coastal market. As such, the production base analysis for this value chain details avenues that address demand for finfish in the local (coastal Kenyan) market.

However, fish consumption at the local level is driven by some 80,000 small-scale artisanal fishers, utilizing some 17,000 artisanal fishing vessels.50 Along the coast, it is men who do the dangerous work of artisanal fishing. Kenya\u2019s fish stocks are becoming more and more depleted, putting pressure on the traditional artisanal fishing ecosystems that support local fish consumption. Anecdotal reports indicate that it is not uncommon for a local fishing boat in the coastal county of Kwale to go out to sea and return empty. Challenges to artisanal fishing include de- pleted fish stocks, worsening sea conditions for small vessels, and increasing need for local landing sites to which fishers can bring their catch. In spite of being introduced into Kenya for decades,152 mariculture has failed to take root due to insufficient investment and inadequate technical expertise. Previous attempts at coastal aquaculture have not yielded positive, sustaining results. However, the sector has received a boost under the KEMFSED project (Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development Project), which promises to build a national mari- culture resource and training centre.153 In response, Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI) is currently pilot- ing marine-based cage farming as a poten- tial solution to the fish supply deficit along the coast. Two of the pilot cages are housed in Kilifi County, and a third is positioned in Kwale county, with plans to establish another 152 Holeh, G.M., Ochiewo, J.O., Tsuma, S., & Mirera, D.O. (2020).

To date, research from previous fish farming pilots indicate that farming (specifically milkfish) has been \u201cpracticed at subsistence level, and extensively, contributing more to the food security of the communities, rather than to economic gains.\u201d154 As mariculture rep- resents only 213 - 5%152 of all farmed aquatic animal production (marine and freshwater combined), Kenya has yet to fully exploit the marine farming sector.152 Cage model155 At present, finfish pilots are being tested with milkfish and rabbitfish species. KMFRI is also currently pursuing ongoing testing and research around marine-rearing of other species like tilapia, potentially positioning finfish mariculture as an alternative to frozen imports.

There are several construction models being tested, but the preferred method in Kwale County consists of a floating wooden structure that is anchored to the ocean floor.

Third, farmers secure fingerlings from the wild. At present, local fishers are paid 10KES for each fingerling (a juvenile fish weighing approximately 1g).

Farmers are responsible for the fingerling input cost. In this case, one cycle of fingerling inputs costs 160,000KES (just under US$ 1,500). As more cage systems are deployed across the coast and more fingerlings are required, the need for sustainable sources of seed (fingerlings) becomes of the utmost importance. Future endeavours might utilize government-led hatchery facilities or integrate a specific hatchery area within the cage chamber to ensure scaled operations are not detrimen- tal to wild populations. 156 Calculated from: Ayub, S. (2020). Current minimum wage in Kenya 2020. Tuko Kenya. https://www.tuko.co.ke/281305-current- minimum-wage-kenya-2020.html As a final step, fingerlings are placed inside the compartments and allowed to grow. Growing cycles take 5-6 months, meaning a structure could support 32,000 fish in a year. Wild seaweed is collected and used as food, although experts are researching if a business case exists for buying supplemen- tal food to encourage nutrition and growth. In either case, responsible scaling of the marine-cage-farm sector requires sustaina- ble, non-disruptive feed solutions (whether collected or purchased). During the growth stage, facility staff feed and monitor fish stocks for size and health, routinely check the netting system and anchors, do neces- sary repairs, and ensure security is in place 24 hours/day to protect the harvest. The facility usually sees two people working full-time, one technical manager for daytime shifts, and a security guard at all hours. Beyond staff salaries, farmers are responsible for col- lecting required tools for daily operations like snorkels, brushes, and a record book. Fish are ready to be harvested when they reach 300-400g, and the facility prepares for harvest by purchasing buckets and a weigh- ing scale. At harvest, farmers are obligated to pay a tax to the BMU of 2KES/kg of fish sold. Even with the most conservative profit and loss estimates, a cage farm operating at full capacity under this model stands to make a profit in the first cycle that would pay for the construction costs. During a normal cycle, if the collective profit is spread across a farmer group of 10 people, monthly payments per group member already exceed the mini- mum wage for Kenyan rural labour.156 Cage farming is appealing to fishers be- cause the system eliminates the exercise of Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 56 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya searching for fish schools, and the harvest timing can be controlled. At present, local fishers have a limited window in which to sell their daily catch, otherwise the fish spoil and the effort is wasted. Marine-based fish farming disrupts the current value chain as farmers can produce an exact purchase volume, fresh and of high quality, on de- mand. Assuming 10 farmers were to produce together at full capacity using the Kwale County piloted farming method, rough esti- mates show that the production and harvest capacity per cycle would be more than double the average volume of wild-capture during the same cycle period. Reports from aquaculture cage farming on Lake Victoria also indicate that a fully-stocked cage farm with good management can produce more fish per cycle than what artisanal fishers are seeing with dwindling stocks.157 Furthermore, farming and harvesting can occur year round, which is particularly helpful during rainy sea- sons when the weather makes deep-water fishing dangerous and unproductive. During the months when traditional catch is low, prices increase, so fish farmers stand to take advantage of seasonal pricing. Finfish farming comes with drawbacks, of course. The initial upstart cost requires an investment and cash flow that is prohibitive for an individual farmer. Securing a group loan, encouraging private sector-investment for an outgrower-style model, or identifying less-expensive local building options might make construction more accessible to the fishing community.

There are around 50,000 fish traders in Kenya, with 300,000 people employed upstream. The sector also supports the 2 million people in- directly employed,50 effectively touching the lives of over 5%158 of Kenya\u2019s total population. This complex value chain,93,155 with its multitude of actors, service providers, and value-addition remains fairly consistent between artisanal finfish wild-capture and finfish farming for the local market. Production differs (as detailed in Section 6.2), but the basic premise remains the same: the first-stage market actor collects finfish from the water. Fish from the wild and from aqua- culture installations both enter into the mar- ket through the local landing site. Traders converge at the landing site to purchase the day\u2019s catch, as their power within the value chain precludes fishers from selling directly to the market. An important difference to note is the trader relationship with artisanal fishers. Often, traders are the owners of the boats and equipment, and they enter into Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 57 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya exclusive purchasing agreements, generally at market price, with fishers in exchange for leasing the vessel. Farmers who operate without in-kind support from a trader would disrupt this element of the value chain as they would be free to sell to anyone at the landing site. The end market can take many forms. Working backwards, consumption occurs, generally, in one of three locations: at home, in the market, or in a restaurant. Customers who purchase fish to take home to cook usu- ally purchase from a market vendor. Locals who consume freshly-prepared fish in the market purchase a plate from someone like a \u2018mama karanga,\u2019 a woman who processes (by frying) fish on-site for immediate con- sumption. These simple businesses are often relatively informal and occur in the open-air. This business model was among those neg- atively affected by the COVID-19 government curfews, as legal operating hours were dras- tically slashed. At the landing site, a fisher might sell to a trader or directly to a mama karanga, but a mama karanga can also purchase her fish from other stakeholders en-route to mar- ket. Vendors and restaurateurs might also purchase their fresh supplies from the fish brokers, who are intermediaries between the traders and the market-level actors. As such, the value chain for local coastal fish con- sumption can follow several routes, including multi-stakeholder chains (like a fisher - trad- er - broker - market - consumer path), simple chains (like a fisher - vendor - consumer path), and all paths in-between. Common species sold for local-market preparation are rabbitfish and milkfish, and they generally are sold whole and unprocessed through the trader- and broker-levels. Most of the local-level market action happens in daily cycles, as challenging infrastructure and a lack of cold storage limit the potential to retain freshness for extended periods. Tana River government records indicate that, in 2015, up to 20% of fish harvests were lost to poor post-harvest processing.31 The limited freshness window also means that market action is restricted to local geographies, as transportation even to cites like Mombasa require heavy investment in equipment and cooling-enabled vehicles. Some local gov- ernments have provided coolboxes for use throughout the value chain, to help mitigate the challenges of keeping fish catches fresh in the coastal Kenyan heat. As prices vary market-to-market and across seasons, dissecting the exact amount of value retained by each actor becomes an impossible task. However, one example re- corded among fishers, traders, and brokers in Kwale County shows that, after buying from the fishers for an average price of 200 KES/kg, traders sold to brokers at a price of 300 KES/kg. The broker then sold the fish at 350 KES/kg.

Key challenges and threats For finfish farming to offer a viable alterna- tive to wild-capture fishing, it must address the key challenges that threaten potential success. Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 59 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya First, construction and initial setup are costly investments. Community mobilization, pri- vate sector or government intervention, or access to appropriate financial instruments is crucial. Unfortunately, the Kwale County Fisheries Director maintains there are no suit- able loan products currently available.93 The farming facility itself also proves to be a risky investment when all of the valuable stock is vulnerable; theft or damage to the facility can mean the difference between a full farm and a completely empty farm. Additionally, the upstart time (at least 7-9 months before the first harvest) can be discouraging for cash-poor farmers who are investing time, energy, and resources while waiting for a payout. Additionally, as fish farming incurs additional costs (like fingerlings, feed, and security), farmers must believe in the value proposition that appears to increase costs without a noticeable market-price benefit. At the local-market, a farmed fish is the same as a caught one. Proof-of-concept must be established for mobilization and community engagement to take hold. Even with community participation, a history of failed development projects proves that col- lective management and group-ownership consistently pose a challenge that impedes long-term success.

Farmers should also be prepared for resistance from traders who currently dominate. Environmental conditions also pose a long-term threat through climate change issues as water temperatures rise and seas become rougher and more dangerous. Fish farming also poses a safety threat, from both sun safety and water safety perspectives. Working on a fish farm structure in deeper water requires adequate swimming ability, appropriate safety equipment, as well as sufficient protection from the sun. Because women traditionally do not have deep-wa- ter training, the sector faces a challenge in making the practice as inclusive as previous pond-based coastal fish farming projects.

At present, the lack of strong re- source management plans poses a threat to the viability of fingerling and seaweed-feed activities. Finally, for a fish farming to truly be a success, their implementation must have a positive impact on the environment.

Proper site selection, spacing, and waste management systems are critical for the environmental sustainability of a cage system, especially at scale. Additionally, addressing issues around fish bio-wastes could not only drive value and investment in the sector164 but could also reduce environmental harm caused by the value chain.

Key strengths and opportunities The finfish farming value chain benefits from the strong local demand and the established coastal market for fish. Declining wild stocks make a strong business case for mariculture production. Positively, the Kenyan landscape boasts strong government enthusiasm for fisheries. Local governments are actively supporting the local-market fish value chain in general, as evidenced through provision of supplies.

Increasing wild catch sustainably requires a commercial or government in- vestment in fishing equipment and vessels and better resource management (like the use and enforcement of quotas, more coast guards, and more landing site inspections). On the other hand, fish farming offers high rates of productivity, greater oversight around sustainability of practices, and guar- anteed supply, even during traditionally low- catch seasons. Finally, from a livelihoods perspective, invest- ing in fish farming reduces the volatility and risk of depending on unpredictable, unsafe daily trips to the sea. Fish farming is safer, more stable, and closer to home. For systems that use continual (week-by-week) seeding, farmers can enjoy a continual cash flow, even in seasons that are traditionally unfit for wild-capture. Planning harvests can reduce waste in the finfish value chain, making farm- ers into good stewards of their Blue natural capital resources. By reducing the amount of fishing in Kenya\u2019s coastal waters, finfish aquaculture enables wild populations to re- generate. Farmers also have the opportunity to reinvest some of their developed stock into LMMA or MPA zones to help repopulate struggling species, increase biodiversity, and build better marine ecosystems.

Recommendations 7.1. Way forward for Kenya First and foremost, developing a clear strategy is paramount to ensure success for efforts in the Kenyan Blue Economy. A comprehensive understanding of how Blue Entrepreneurship advances the national agenda will act as a roadmap that outlines plans for when other players join the sector. The opportunity exists to build rapport and support the Blue Agenda by engaging with the government on current initiatives, like the Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani (JKP) Jumuiya Innovation Labs,55 for example. Furthermore, strategic planning must acknowledge and balance the overarching considerations that will impact potential systemic changes for coastal communities; addressing communi- ty and gender dynamics, critically analysing incentive structures, developing good habits for ecosystem management, and investing in extensive measurement and knowl- edge-sharing is essential for all interventions. Finally, the strategy for any venture includes a thoughtful value proposition for participat- ing in ecosystem conservation and rehabil- itation. For any undertaking, it is critical to clearly demonstrate a link between investing in the ecosystem and household-level bene- fits like higher yields, better returns, or more income. Wealth from natural habitats can only be derived from healthy habitats. This report outlines recommendations for the three selected value chains: seaweed farming, sea cucumber farming, and finfish farming. The following highlights recom- mendations for individual value chains as well as for the farmer program pilots, the suggestions for which are largely cross-cut- ting with some customization based on specific factors and value chain needs. Seaweed farming The following recommendations promote success within the seaweed farming value chain. Critical for Kenya\u2019s competitiveness as a global seaweed exporter is a growth strategy aimed at maximizing scale. At present, Kenya is not a significant player in the WIO region\u2019s seaweed market, and investing in inclusive mechanisms that attract new farmers and encourage timely planting and harvesting, thereby drawing new exporter attention, is key to success. Proposed strategic levers The research revealed three critical levers to support this vision for the sector: A. Increase production to reach current export capacity B. Draw new exporter entrants to the sector C. Scale farming of higher-value species with new production methods Recommendations 64 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya A. Increase production to reach current export capacity The current market chain relies on a solitary buyer and exporter of seaweed, who has recently (within the past 3 years) started building operations in Kenya. The exporter\u2019s stated current capacity is 300 tonnes per year, but present exports are only reaching 80 tonnes per year.90 There is a ready-market to absorb another \u00b14x current farm-level production. At the most basic level, seaweed production hinges on planting as many ropes as possi- ble during the spring-tide, waiting for those seedlings to develop, and harvesting at the appropriate maturity level, some 6 weeks later.

This volume is well within reason, as evalu- ations from Zanzibar seaweed farms show \u201cthe average production per farmer would have been about 100 kg per month.\u201d173 Even closer to home, some Kilifi County farmers interviewed report they were able to achieve 1, 2, and even up to 3 tonnes per year per farm. Increasing production to achieve current export capacity requires no new investment in farm setup or farmer-base expansion; instead, scale hinges on developing a value proposition that encourages farmers to do timely planting and harvesting. However, investing in covered drying facilities close to the farm areas would support production in a number of ways. First, farmers are con- strained by the time and labour required to carry heavy loads for drying. Second, provid- ing a covered space for drying saves labour time, as seaweed that comes into contact with rainwater must be re-processed (that is, taken back to the ocean to be submerged and revitalized in the salt water and then transported and dried again). Covered dry- ing facilities in close proximity can improve efficiency by decreasing production time, as well as reduce post-harvest losses, or more specifically, post-harvest loss of farmer time and labour.

Draw new exporter entrants to the sector High production volume is the best way to flag Kenya as a viable market and encourage new exporter entrants. The influx of new market actors is expected to drive competi- tion and provide farmers with more choice, stronger agency, and higher prices. Kenya has the opportunity to develop production volumes that draw new exporters to the sec- tor. Presuming three is the optimal number of permanent exports, and using C-WEED\u2019s export capacity as an indicator, Kenya must increase current production over 11-fold. Expanding the farmer network, potentially using outgrower models, is the most realistic source of this extra volume. For the exporter, asset investment (like an aggregation/stor- age facility and a commercial-grade baler) is required, in addition to operating costs (like transportation and labour). However, from the perspective of investing in new-farm setup, it is estimated that a seaweed plot op- erating at even moderate productive capac- ity (300kg for 6 weeks) could earn enough revenue to pay for initial farm upstart after only one cycle. This value proposition can encourage additional exporter entrants to support farm setup and expansion efforts. Opportunity: \u2022 Develop business case for seaweed exporters to enter the Kenyan market \u2022 Sensitize communities and expand production base to include additional farming locales \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart Competitive Position: \u2022 An uptick in post-pandemic global price will unlock better margins for incoming exporters coming into Kenya \u2022 As the Kenyan national and coastal governments are prioritizing seaweed as a sector, enabling environments for foreign investment are expected to be favourable Inclusivity: \u2022 Expanding competition among seaweed purchasers is expected to elevate farmgate price, enabling more Kenyan farmers to join C.

Develop processing and aggregation services at the farmer level to draw more of the market value to the smallholder A. Pilot inclusive farming model to generate proof-of-concept for both local-government and farmer engagement As a first step in developing the sea cucum- ber farming value chain, potential market actors must be convinced of the value and the potential success. Therefore, the entry point of the sector is piloting a sea cucum- ber farming model that works. Upstart investment to the pilot is minimal, including only enclosure supplies and security staff payments. As no hatchery system exists in Kenya, a critical component to the farming pilot is the establishment of a sustainable model for short-term wild-capture of finger- lings. Left with no alternative, the pilot must rely on the ocean for seed resources, but this behaviour must be thoughtful, sustainable, and with only a short-term view in mind. The goal of the pilot is not to exploit the limited wild sea cucumber stocks, but instead, the goal is to prove the business case that will spur private investment in hatchery systems. Opportunity: \u2022 Develop business case for sea cucumber farmers and local government, and by so doing, develop business case for hatchery investment \u2022 Sensitize communities and pilot production model Recommendations 69 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart Competitive Position: \u2022 Kenya\u2019s coast already proves conducive to sea cucumber growth (as evidenced by historically-documented wild stocks) \u2022 As a top producer in the WIO region, Madagascar represents the strongest competition in the sea cucumber market; however, with growing global demand and an unlimited export potential, it seems there is room for unencumbered growth without negative competitive impacts Inclusivity: \u2022 In other countries, sea cucumber production represents an inclusive opportunity (60-80% of farmers are female) \u2022 Seaweed farmers often make the best sea cucumber farmers, as they already spend their time in the ocean, know the tides and the currents, are used to working with commercial partners, and are already aware of the value of these animals B. Invest in scalable hatchery model for sea cucumber juveniles Access to fingerlings (that is, access to a close, operational hatchery) is essential for long- term success of a sea cucumber farming industry. Wild-capture fingerling collection is not sustainable in the long-run, so invest- ment in inputs production will unlock sector transformation. Using the SEAFDEC132 model as an example, one community-based hatch- ery, at an investment cost of US$ 30,000 has the potential to generate 300,000 to 500,000 juveniles per year. Factoring in survival rates of sea cucumbers in enclosures, it can be estimated that a fully-functioning commu- nity farm (with access to a fully-functioning hatchery) could raise 100,000 to 150,000 exportable sea cucumbers in that year. At maximum production, and even at the con- servative end of current farmgate prices for fresh sea cucumbers in Kenya, the facility could pay for itself within the first year of operation. Realistically, a community or a pri- vate investor could expect to recoup facility costs by Year 2 or 3 of the project. For every operating year after that, 2 cycles of revenues from sea cucumber sales would cover oper- ating costs of the facility, and the remaining revenues (3 cycles) going toward enclosure upkeep, security, and farmer profit. As fingerlings cannot be transported more than 100km to be transplanted, a minimum of 3 hatcheries are needed to cover Kenya\u2019s entire coastline.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5fcbc016-1f43-441a-96d1-8a1fab6296e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fcbc016-1f43-441a-96d1-8a1fab6296e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean SeaDeep ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "330be5d9796520e6fbd48a06cc5014d2a0b97028b906327c308372d92ef6ea6f"}, "2": {"node_id": "92de0761-4884-41d7-b155-3a8c7ff6bb3b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae47739ca26dfa690c44e29262431d17cf45ea63081af9038d21a2f3c307bbb7"}}, "hash": "f09195bce1e5aab62d930ea5bd29186e18278cd0cea15c730d315c8b13078a17", "text": "Opportunity: \u2022 Sensitize private sector investors and pilot hatchery model \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for hatchery upstart Competitive Position: \u2022 With ongoing government support of regional multi-species hatchery facilities, the enabling environment for foreign investment is expected to be favourable \u2022 Based on the wealth of research and piloting done globally on sea cucumber hatchery specifications, Kenya can learn from these interventions and pilot ready-made models (of course with context-specific adjustments), drastically reducing time-to-market for sea cucumber juveniles Recommendations 70 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Inclusivity: \u2022 While the hatchery model itself is not inherently inclusive, it enables inclusive farming opportunities \u2022 While low-scale, introduction of a new facility would warrant local job-creation ranging from technical (marine hatchery experts) to inclusive / accessible (administration and cleaning) C.

However, it is the investment from private-sector entrants taking up the idea that will drive this value chain to scale. Potential systems include examples of Lake Victoria aquaculture mod- els, whereby groups of farmer-owners pool resources (or access group credit) to invest in construction, stocking, and human resource costs. While keeping small roles (like feeding, records support, or post-harvest processing), the group-ownership model necessitates payment for a site manager, a technical expert charged with rearing the fish to market size, as well as security to keep the stock safe. By designating the responsibility to paid employees, the business model elim- inates the \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019 effect of group ownership without designated accountability. While government pilot facilities have garnered input costs upward of 600,000 KES for construction, it is estimated that locally-sourced and locally-negotiated construction could be much less expensive. Even with relatively conservative estimates, a cage farm operating at half capacity could repay construction costs after 3 cycles; in a best-case scenario, the facility would be paid off in the first cycle of production. Some Lake Victoria cage models have achieved production levels nearly triple that found in the KMFRI pilots. As finfish mari- culture develops, leveraging best practices from inland systems is likely to increase pro- ductivity of cage systems in the ocean. The Kenyan coast is home to nearly 200 landing sites, the entry points for all marine catches, including mariculture production. Even in a future scenario with 5 cages for each landing site operating at full capacity, fish production would only abate little more than 1% of the annual Kenyan fish deficit. Production potential is then limited by scale (sustainably increasing the number of cages stationed in the ocean), access to inputs (fin- gerlings from a hatchery), and down-stream market constraints (like cold chain and transportation, as the local coastal market is not expected to absorb large-scale increases in production). Opportunity: \u2022 Develop business case for farmer- owners, and by so doing, develop business case for hatchery investment \u2022 Sensitize communities and pilot production model \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart Competitive Position: \u2022 Artisanal fishers reliant on wild-capture methods are the main competition among fish destined for local coastal markets \u2022 While farming comes with the burden of facility investment and ongoing costs for inputs and operation, the advantages include: guaranteed production, control over harvest, and ability to operate in poor-weather seasons when prices are higher Recommendations 74 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Inclusivity: \u2022 The deep-sea nature of the cage structure can be prohibitive for female inclusion, as can the capital requirement for investing in the group model \u2022 Interventions should identify drivers of female participation (\u00b125%) among Lake Victoria group-ownership models B. Invest in scalable hatchery model for sufficient and sustainable access finfish fingerlings Current cage systems rely on wild-caught fingerlings as seed for production. From both ecological and supply perspectives, this inputs-system is unsustainable. Critical for long-term success of finfish mariculture is sufficient access to fingerlings. Proving the production model\u2019s capacity for scale is the first step to unlocking interest and private-sector investment in hatchery op- erations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83bcdb90-1c16-4250-bdf9-65f881ba0f2c": {"__data__": {"id_": "83bcdb90-1c16-4250-bdf9-65f881ba0f2c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean SeaDeep ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "897c70d5e4dc2d826217a7375bf70a568c8ed8f5d324eeb06c517494f85d25f9"}, "2": {"node_id": "e529cec6-0a08-4f1b-ac46-09f445a88291", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af1104e0b9815c396eeed7695acfc15e76d9a1cdbc1e6d109c2afc5366db02ce"}}, "hash": "a64c3feb6a7c40e9803597b3e86472e89a6010e9500fff289a892f0bd6535366", "text": "From there, technical expertise and upstart capital are required.

While certainly with some costs and risks, these fishing practices, and the associated market structures, are relatively low-cost and deeply entrenched. Marine-based cage farming faces a signif- icant challenge of being competitive in an established market with established norms, especially as there is no price differential at market for farmed fish over wild-caught fish. However, there simply are not enough fish left in the wild, and artisanal fishing cannot continue as-is. Without a shift toward innova- tive practices, local coastal fishing will suffer as supply dwindles, competition from im- ports increases, and actual fishing activities Recommendations 75 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya become more dangerous. New practices that increase sustainable production (like cage farming) are needed, as the strain on the environment (from depleted wild stocks and from unstable ecosystems causing a loss of biodiversity) puts the entire underwater food chain at risk.

It is wise to be prepared for upstart issues (like long upstart time and high upstart costs, particularly for the sea cucumber and finfish farming ventures), as well as mobilization issues (like farmer motivation) and entrepreneurship issues (like farmer professionalisation and business mindset).106,175 Farmer pilot programs also face implementation challenges, particularly around comprehensive technical expertise (like mariculture best practices, growing conditions, site selection, and training) as well as inputs supply and knowledge (like seed, particularly for the sea cucumber and finfish farming ventures). From a govern- ance standpoint, present challenges include access (like sea-use rights), regulation (like over- or under-regulation by the national and county governments), community involvement (like local governance chal- lenges), and security (both for high-value items like sea cucumber and finfish and for easily-damaged farm plots like seaweed). Unpredictable market dynamics threaten any farmer pilot program, and each of the se- lected value chains faces unique challenges. For example, the seaweed value chain is at risk for a potential price drop due to the influx of supply, generated as many tourism-based economies have focused on farming during the COVID-19 pandemic.176,89 Sea cucumber is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "102a979b-c0ff-48b4-9d3b-622b347a0f15": {"__data__": {"id_": "102a979b-c0ff-48b4-9d3b-622b347a0f15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean SeaDeep ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5677e8a900a0ae6635f61678ecb9f6038c114405d07ccd5eaa3abc4cc6be9a95"}, "3": {"node_id": "dc47ef78-22f3-4667-8099-2c856f20e809", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e625a306d70c732cd60be060dc05e53062a90ee8505e761fc8449b39ae0f1e6"}}, "hash": "1cb86114e53406066fde4bc2f6ebdeea4db8fc8f27cab75df4f6b33ef5341934", "text": "a high-value item, so market dynamics Recommendations 79 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya are affected by poaching and side-selling. Meanwhile, the domestic finfish markets in Kenya are dominated by traders, so the live- lihoods impacts for fishing and fish-farming households is constrained. Finally, climate change poses an ongoing risk to all select- ed value chains, as rising sea levels, ocean warming, and acidification will continue to alter coastal ecosystems, threatening the long-term stability of investment. To combat these and other challenges, TechnoServe leans on its extensive expe- rience working with a variety of farmers, stakeholders, and value chain market ac- tors. As such, we recommend the following guidance for embarking on farmer pilot programs: \u2022 Begin with sector and community engagement: Initiate farmer pilot program efforts by building relationships and engaging key stakeholders (like government, community, and private- sector partners) to build rapport and gain trust, support, and contextual understanding. Successful interventions will build on existing momentum and enthusiasm as they plan interventions, timing, and support structures that optimize outcomes. In particular, engage government initiatives (like seaweed infrastructure and storage facility construction, sea cucumber research and hatchery planning, and finfish research, hatchery facilities, and infrastructure), both supporting and integrating these efforts for long-term sector-wide success. \u2022 Do thorough Kenya coastline mapping to ensure proper site selection: When identifying priority geographies across the Kenya coastline for farmer pilot programs, explore: \u2022 Space and access factors: Investigate any existing Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMAs) or Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and assess any potential to leverage these zones and their sea-use access rights. Identify existing governance structures and gaps. Determine if the area is accessible by foot during the spring-tide (particularly important for seaweed and sea cucumber farming). \u2022 Social factors: Prioritize communities that are primed to engage in alternative livelihoods activities. For example, mobilization potential increases if communities are already equipped with mindset and skills of performing non- traditional farming exercises (like collecting octopus). Additionally, build on momentum that exists if communities already demonstrate ecosystem management practices (for example, protection zones or timed fishing closures). Furthermore, selected value chains (like seaweed and sea cucumber) that are expected to target and engage female beneficiaries are more likely to succeed in geographies that are enthusiastic about household-level or collective farming and/or areas that demonstrate support for entrepreneurial and financially- independent women. Finally, a farmer pilot program for fish farming is likely to have better social motivation in areas where wild-catch success is dwindling or limited, as Recommendations 80 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya these areas are more likely to accept the required investment of energy and money in order to develop innovative solutions to local fishing challenges. \u2022 Ecosystem factors: Identify priority geographies whose ecosystems are conducive to program requirements. The mapping phase also includes an investigation of predominant weather patterns and key environmental issues, enabling smart investment in weather- resistant construction. Ecosystem requirements are specific for each of the selected value chains and include the following: \u2022 Seaweed: Villages in Kwale county that are already showing success with seaweed farming indicate that seaweed crops grow best in intertidal zones that are protected from high-energy wave activity and boast relatively regulated water temperatures. Areas with seagrass meadows are often conducive to seaweed farming. \u2022 Sea Cucumber:106,115 Successful sea cucumber farming sites in Madagascar meet the following specifications: 1) \u00b160% coverage by seagrass 2) 15+ centimetres of fine sediment 3) high salinity (no freshwater input) 4) constant water coverage, even during low tide 5) relatively regulated water temperatures 6) protection from high-energy waves and natural predators. Note: capitalizing on ideal ecosystem overlaps, Blue Ventures scaling programs have successfully paired sea cucumber farming pens (closer to shore) side-by-side with seaweed farms (farther out to sea). \u2022 Finfish Farming:155 Current and future cage farming efforts in Kenya are most likely to succeed in ecosystems with relatively regulated water temperatures, protection from rough waves, sufficient current and waterflow to wash the chambers, and suitable ocean depth (\u00b15m during low tide, \u00b113m during high tide). \u2022 Solidify finance and planning to secure inputs during the program setup phase: Ensuring sufficient funding for program setup is critical, as long-term community-level sustainability depends on proof of concept and noteworthy revenues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc47ef78-22f3-4667-8099-2c856f20e809": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc47ef78-22f3-4667-8099-2c856f20e809", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean SeaDeep ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5677e8a900a0ae6635f61678ecb9f6038c114405d07ccd5eaa3abc4cc6be9a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "102a979b-c0ff-48b4-9d3b-622b347a0f15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1cb86114e53406066fde4bc2f6ebdeea4db8fc8f27cab75df4f6b33ef5341934"}}, "hash": "5e625a306d70c732cd60be060dc05e53062a90ee8505e761fc8449b39ae0f1e6", "text": "Programs that benefit from ample startup investment enable success and stability for ongoing business activities that are not dependent on ongoing intervention. \u2022 Secure comprehensive technical expertise: Engage top-quality technicians and industry experts with sufficient local context when choosing innovations and designing curricula.

Then, engage stakeholders who can most Recommendations 81 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya effectively convey this knowledge and train local communities in best practices. For example, the Kenyan government has proven experience training farmers in seaweed (with the help of local and international NGOs) and finfish farming practices. Meanwhile, Blue Ventures has prepared a transferable toolkit of resources174 for interested parties, and the organization has even availed itself to run comprehensive trainings that outlined sea cucumber deployment in Zanzibar, Tanzania.177 \u2022 Facilitate proper governance: Critical to the success of any farmer pilot program is a robust governance structure. At the local level, it is wise to engage communities with setting up and maintaining governance structures, making locally- informed resource management a collective and responsive effort. Resource management strategies might include no-take zones or no-take periods, and community involvement will address potential conflicts with sea-use and marine resources (particularly important for conflicts between seaweed farms and destructive fishing boats). Other programs have found success by entrenching environmental regulations and ecosystem management support into farmer lease agreements,106 for example, including a mandatory collective fund from farmers to pay back into the LMMA / MPA where they are operating. Additional benefits can 177 Vincent, I. & Razafimamonjiraibe, H. (2020, Feb 10). Farmers of the Sea \u2013 Sea Cucumber Farming as an Alternative to Fishing. Reef Resilience Network. https://reefresilience.org/case-studies/madagascar-sustainable-livelihoods/ be found in supporting government and local entities as policies and regulations (like monitoring, population and stock measurement, and market restrictions) are being crafted for emerging sectors. \u2022 Select beneficiaries: While carefully sensitizing communities and thoughtfully selecting beneficiaries for the farmer pilot programs, sector actors can lean on TechnoServe\u2019s 3-pronged approach for female engagement. Ensuring selection is inclusive and representative of all local people and people groups enables buy-in and long-term project success. Some models recommend clan or tribal mapping, then selection quotas are distributed among local leaders for assessment and final decisions.115 \u2022 Consider ecosystem impacts: According to IUCN objectives, a farmer pilot program will not be successful if it does not improve the natural environment. Therefore, any project upstart must carefully assess and monitor proposed interventions and their potential impacts within the selected ecosystems. For example, an increase in the presence of seaweed from farming initiatives might disrupt the amount of UV light that reaches the ocean floor. Additionally, farming practices have potential to disrupt naturally- occuring seagrass meadows, and loose seaweed can negatively impact coral health. Structures like Recommendations 82 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya finfish cages are bound to affect the environments in which they are placed, so it behooves sector actors to examine ecosystem impacts (like UV light and current flow) along with protection measures that might be required. Of course, some ecosystem impacts will, by design, be positive. For instance, providing an undisturbed habitat through seaweed farming has been shown to increase fish populations. This effect in itself must be monitored as changes in animal populations might impact or motivate different community behaviours; all opportunities and incentives must be carefully monitored and addressed. Similarly, providing farmed solutions as alternatives to sea cucumber and finfish wild catch give the ecosystems an opportunity to rest and regenerate. However, as species repopulate, these habitats will likely see increased fishing and dangerous diving activities. Communities might consider regenerative options (like introducing a \u2018throwback\u2019 percentage, where a portion of each harvest is given to the wild for environmental rehabilitation). \u2022 Work with permanent market actors: Engaging key market stakeholders (like traders, processors, and exporters) enables early-stage buy-in and support that can not only maintain energy in the value chain beyond donor funding windows but also distribute benefits across communities. Specifically, current seaweed farming assets (like ropes and boots) are donor-sponsored, and farmers have yet to understand useful life and associated costs. Without market engagement of suppliers and distributors, the projects cannot be assured of farmer financial stability and sustainable livelihoods benefits. Additionally, engaging an array of permanent market actors in the finfish value chain can develop a value proposition that redistributes agency and control away from traders and back to smallholders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "899f7209-2173-4b67-8fd1-15728f81b790": {"__data__": {"id_": "899f7209-2173-4b67-8fd1-15728f81b790", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean SeaDeep ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5c607ad7d62358bea11f50015bf8b23ec5aea09451078a536b36a24d72625cc"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7b38ac7-7c19-4fc4-8a17-01e31dddd927", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14bb2a78554117c4601e8863e39638465ebd8bc1a431fe6ad6e5ec2990992b0b"}}, "hash": "e37b6a86ca4162391ef8fcc2c65bdb29b462aca39ce5fb173b9622f3807c501e", "text": "\u2022 Develop comprehensive monitoring and measurement systems during the trial periods, and make data-driven adjustments: Driving sustainable growth for the Blue Entrepreneurship sector requires diligent measurement and mindful adaptation, and it is advantageous to set up innovative, thoughtful models that can be scaled.

By ad- dressing Blue Entrepreneurship with innova- tion and ground-breaking problem-solving, Kenyan coastal communities will benefit from more cost-effective designs, systems that produce maximum output, and con- tributions to global learnings. In addition to scaling up existing enterprises and making them more inclusive, it is imperative to generate and incubate new industry ideas and pair them with teams that have industry expertise at various stages of concept and launch along with access to appropriate investment vehicles. Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) An intriguing concept, and one such innova- tion, might be research into and deployment of marine-based integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems. These systems involve farming carefully-selected, mutu- ally-beneficial plants and animals in close proximity in order to \u201ctake advantage of synergistic interactions among species\u201d178 and use a diverse poly-culture approach to restore and conserve coastal ecosystems. With careful site-selection and technical un- derstanding of species interactions, market actors can pioneer models that promote coastal livelihoods and benefit marine ecosystems through harmonious layers of nature-based solutions. 178 Chopin, T. (2013, Mar 1). A look at integrated multi-trophic aquaculture. Global Aquaculture Alliance. https://www. aquaculturealliance.org/advocate/look-at-integrated-multi-trophic-aquaculture/ Entrepreneurship training In parallel to value-chain-specific initiatives, supporting other local activities alongside the identified ventures is critical. Opportunity exists to enhance communities and all Blue Entrepreneurship efforts by providing cross-cutting general business training for coastal industries. Providing financial literacy, savings and investment, governance, and management training not only boosts the ef- ficiency of the Blue Economy as a whole, but it helps protect communities and programs from specific risks across seaweed, sea cu- cumber, and finfish farming value chains. Similarly, this type of support benefits coastal communities as they adapt and re- emerge from COVID-19 tourism shutdowns. Spearheading a mindful approach that focuses on environmental and livelihoods resilience will influence Kenya\u2019s tourism sec- tor strategy in a way that builds the industry back better than it was before. IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions To supplement monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) efforts associated with all pilot interventions, all initiatives, actions, and measurements should utilize the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions16 before, during, and after execution. The Standard enlists eight criteria to provide \u201cclear param- eters for defining NbS and a common frame- work to help benchmark progress.\u201d Ensuring all efforts align with a recognized standard of care will avoid unintentional harm to ecosys- tems while also building systems that have potential for meaningful impact at scale. Recommendations 84 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya 7.3. Conclusions This scoping study explored an array of functions and sub-functions with the Blue Economy in Kenya and identified three key value chains for priority engagement: sea- weed farming, sea cucumber farming, and finfish farming. This report details dynamics of each value chain and mechanisms for engaging at the community livelihood level, bridging the gap and promoting Kenya\u2019s Blue Entrepreneurship sector. Included rec- ommendations provide a strategic outline to develop the Blue Economy across Kenya and the Western Indian Ocean region by mobilizing investments that promote en- trepreneurship, foregrounding strategies to scale positive environmental impacts and enhance ocean biodiversity, and building on existing momentum that benefits peo- ple, the ocean, and the climate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2219772a-b330-4579-a120-67a72f1a51f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "2219772a-b330-4579-a120-67a72f1a51f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean SeaDeep ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffce03eae771b588b9aa73a92d279c468ac63111d4f359792d6a712c595f2437"}, "2": {"node_id": "55c8d015-0ba6-44a7-bc54-739ad41c558b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean-seadeep", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f3afd1a1b9ad5519d5eb9dd81dd230385c0c41faf8d27b555123d3b2bb6e7c3"}}, "hash": "caf20d8b0b93973528ca657ab74900b715316ed546a54c6f2c8efc015da5ac02", "text": "Appendix 85 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Appendix 179 https://www.kmfri.go.ke/index.php/cb-profile/gatunga 180 https://www.kmfri.co.ke/index.php/component/comprofiler/userprofile/dmirera 181 https://www.nema.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=228&catid=2&Itemid=324 182 https://www.kmfri.co.ke/index.php/cb-profile/smwangi 183 https://www.the-star.co.ke/counties/coast/2019-05-31-coast-regional-bloc-eyes-blue-economy/ 184 https://www.kmfri.co.ke/index.php/cb-profile/bnyonje Appendix 1: Stakeholder interviews The research team conducted stakeholder interviews with the following industry experts, representing local communities, government agencies, NGOs, and others.

contributed to the emergence of the Blue Economy as a critical arena for making substantive impact, both for the environment and for local prosperity. IUCN continues to engage in the discussion and aims to develop a pilot model to serve the greater WIO (Western Indian Ocean) region. This report is the first step in identifying and targeting priority interventions and solutions that can support local marine-based com- munities, as suggested interventions help spearhead the work of trialing key concepts along Kenya\u2019s coastline. This scoping study utilizes a combination of primary research (stakeholder interviews, focus group dis- cussions, and field research) and secondary research (literature review) to prioritize value chains and recommendations. The study highlights seaweed farming, sea cucumber farming, and finfish farming as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8af3b33c-ea37-4b5b-8cb6-f710e169458a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8af3b33c-ea37-4b5b-8cb6-f710e169458a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "866f7e20b09c9ac14f994c0ddf75c1cc7d483e4c916c061a83d29063d93a57b2"}}, "hash": "866f7e20b09c9ac14f994c0ddf75c1cc7d483e4c916c061a83d29063d93a57b2", "text": "key oppor- tunities. This executive summary overviews strengths and weaknesses of each value chain along with recommendations to drive sector transformation and reach optimal im- pact. Alongside the strategic levers for each value chain are opportunities for the sector, Kenya\u2019s current competitive position, and the potential for an inclusive market system. Additional detail and specific suggestions are developed in further detail in Chapter 7: Recommendations. Seaweed farming Kenya can maximize potential in the sea- weed industry through a dramatic increase in production and scale, as unlocking the potential for communities to produce at capacity can lead to sector-wide transforma- tion. At present, Kenya is not competitive in the regional seaweed market, and success hinges on both attracting new farmers and utilizing productive space at full capacity. By offering substantive volume, Kenya can draw the attention of additional exporters, devel- oping pricing competition that can benefit smallholders. The research identified three strategic levers to catalyse transformation in the seaweed sector: Executive summary vi Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Table 1: Seaweed farming strategic levers Opportunity Competitiveness Inclusivity \u2022 Develop business case for seaweed farmers to produce at maximum capacity \u2022 Sensitize communities and expand production base to include additional farming locales \u2022 Improve efficiency with covered drying facility to reduce labour and time required \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for ongoing farmer support and new farmer upstart \u2022 Tanzania (specifically Zanzibar) is Kenya\u2019s biggest regional competitor, producing over 103,000 tonnes of seaweed in 2019 \u2022 With similar ecosystems and with an extra 100km of available coastline, Kenya has the capacity to develop its seaweed production volumes and be competitive in the WIO region \u2022 As over 90% of current Kenyan seaweed farming is done by women, expansion opportunities stand to include even more female farmers in the sector \u2022 Furthermore, opportunity exists to encourage household participation for value-add tasks (like carrying heavy loads and transportation) \u2022 Develop business case for seaweed exporters to enter the Kenyan market \u2022 Sensitize communities and expand production base to include additional farming locales \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart \u2022 An uptick in post- pandemic global price will unlock better margins for exporters coming into Kenya \u2022 As the Kenyan national and coastal governments are prioritizing seaweed as a sector, enabling environments for foreign investment are expected to be favourable \u2022 Expanding competition among seaweed purchasers is expected to elevate farmgate price, enabling more Kenyan farmers to join \u2022 Incorporating additional high-value species stands to earn farmers 3x the current value with the same yields \u2022 Offshore farming is less prone to negative effects of rising ocean temperatures \u2022 Mastering deeper- ocean seaweed cultivation (which has historically been challenging for both Kenya and neighbour Zanzibar), has the potential to unlock access to a much larger seaweed market, as the \u201cEucheuma spp.\u201d (which includes Cottonii) category represents 29% of global production \u2022 Female seaweed farmers are highly motivated to start cultivating this species (despite male dominance), pending investment needed to kickstart the offshore farm \u2022 Female inclusion requires sea-safety training and boat- operator training, or these services could be provided by men in the community Source: TechnoServe The current seaweed industry in Kenya faces many addressable challenges. Limited production, which thereby limits income potential and market diversity, is caused by intensive labour conditions, a falling global price, historical dependence on external (do- nor or private sector) funding, and current perceptions among farmers, as they see an unattractive value proposition. COVID-19 has impacted the global price for seaweed, as an influx of farmers from once-tourism-de- pendent countries have fallen back on farming, increasing current global supply. However, as the global market dynamics are anticipated to return to normal post-pan- demic, Kenya has an opportunity to increase Increase production to reach current export capacity A Draw new exporter entrants to the sector Scale farming of higher-value species with new production methods B C Executive summary vii Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya production and be prepared to capitalize on an expected favourable market price. Kenya benefits from an extensive coastline with ecosystems conducive to growing seaweed, current farmers operating below potential, and new untouched communities, all point- ing to the production potential within the country. Additionally, with low barriers to entry, seaweed farming presents inclusive participation opportunities for vulnerable groups (women, youth, and people with disabilities). Seaweed farms offer alternative incomes among communities who would otherwise stress wild marine stocks through over- fishing, and they also create habitats that foster natural biodiversity, so investment in seaweed farming can improve the overall quality, resilience, and productive potential of coastal ecosystems.

Due to decades of overfishing, sea cucumber wild stocks are dwindling, harming the overall biodiversity of coastal ecosystems and forcing fishers into increas- ingly-risky diving practices. With a high price point, growing global demand, and an existing link to the export market, spear- heading inclusive sea cucumber farming models in Kenya will revolutionize the sector. Neighbouring countries in the WIO region have spent years trialing and refining the smallholder-outgrower model, and Kenya\u2019s success in the industry hinges on a three- step intensive investment: 1) establish sus- tainable models for short-term wild-capture of fingerlings, 2) pilot inclusive farming and generate proof-of-concept for both commu- nity-government and farmer engagement, and 3) draw private sector investment for hatchery systems that will enable long-term scale and sustainability. The research identified three strategic levers to catalyse transformation in the sea cucum- ber sector: Executive summary viii Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Table 2: Sea cucumber farming strategic levers Opportunity Competitiveness Inclusivity \u2022 Develop business case for sea cucumber farmers and local government, and by so doing, develop business case for hatchery investment \u2022 Sensitize communities and pilot production model \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart \u2022 Kenya\u2019s coast already proves conducive to sea cucumber growth (as evidenced by historically- documented wild stocks) \u2022 As a top producer in the WIO region, Madagascar represents the strongest competition in the sea cucumber market; however, with growing global demand and an unlimited export potential, it seems there is room for unencumbered growth without negative competitive impacts \u2022 In other countries, sea cucumber production represents an inclusive opportunity (60-80% of farmers are female) \u2022 Seaweed farmers often make the best sea cucumber farmers, as they already spend their time in the ocean, know the tides and the currents, are used to working with commercial partners, and are already aware of the value of these animals \u2022 Sensitize private sector investors and pilot hatchery model \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for hatchery upstart \u2022 With ongoing government support of regional multi-species hatchery facilities, the enabling environment for foreign investment is expected to be favourable \u2022 Based on existing global research, Kenya can pilot ready-made models, drastically reducing time-to-market for sea cucumber juveniles \u2022 While the hatchery model itself is not inherently inclusive, it enables inclusive farming opportunities \u2022 While low-scale, introduction of a new facility would warrant local job- creation ranging from technical (marine hatchery experts) to inclusive / accessible (administration and cleaning) \u2022 Invest in processing equipment and facilities, along with farmer training, to ensure quality is met to maintain favourable pricing \u2022 Shorten the supply chain and retain more value at the smallholder level \u2022 Increasing proportion of value-add services at the farmer level would put smallholders in competition with local traders and possibly regional exporters \u2022 Leveraging the farming model will drastically increase production, giving farmers a healthy volume of final product with which to negotiate, as compared to wild- catch sea cucumber fisheries \u2022 Processing activities at the export facility are already done by women, proving the potential for an inclusive model (for women and youth) at the community level \u2022 However, as the financial control of high-value jobs or products tends to be dominated by men, it is critical that value-add activities do not add to women\u2019s workload without providing appropriate benefit Source: TechnoServe Pilot inclusive farming model to generate proof- of-concept A Invest in scaleable hatchery model for sea cucumber juveniles Develop processing and aggregation services at the farmer level B C Executive summary ix Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya The biggest threat to a successful sea cu- cumber industry in Kenya is the impossibility of production without an operational hatch- ery for sea cucumber juveniles. Hatchery setup has proven challenging in the region, but Kenya can lean on global models and learn from failed attempts. Using the on- going research and investment in a coastal multi-species marine hatchery as a business case, Kenya has the opportunity to develop proof-of-concept for private sector investors, yielding a more sustainable hatchery option for the long-term growth of the industry.

Farming sea cucumber can offer lucrative al- ternatives to overfishing, giving coastal eco- systems an opportunity to regenerate, while increasing the presence of species that sup- port environmental health. Further, current government support for this priority crop creates a favourable enabling environment. Finfish farming Fishing plays a vital role for coastal commu- nities, both in terms of food security and in terms of income generation. Kenya and the rest of the world suffer as global fish stocks disappear through overfishing. Investing in finfish farming using cage structures in marine sites has the potential to disrupt the current Kenyan value chain for local coastal consumption of fish by increasing and controlling production, avoiding restrictive market relationships, and reducing pressure on local environments. Local demand fish re- mains strong, and Kenya has an opportunity to develop sustainable production methods through marine-based finfish cage farming. Investment in fingerling access (through hatcheries) and responsibly-sourced feed are critical to long-term success in the sector, both financially and environmentally. The research identified three strategic levers to catalyse transformation in the finfish farming sector: Executive summary x Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Table 3: Finfish cage farming strategic levers Opportunity Competitiveness Inclusivity \u2022 Develop business case for farmer-owners, and by so doing, develop business case for hatchery investment \u2022 Sensitize communities and pilot production model \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart \u2022 Artisanal fishers reliant on wild-capture methods are the main competition among fish destined for local coastal markets \u2022 While farming comes with the burden of facility investment and ongoing costs for inputs and operation, the advantages include: guaranteed production, control over harvest, and ability to operate in poor-weather seasons when prices are higher \u2022 The deep-sea nature of the cage structure can be prohibitive for female inclusion, as can the capital requirement for investing in the group model \u2022 Interventions should identify drivers of female participation (\u00b125%) among Lake Victoria group- ownership models \u2022 Sensitize private sector investors and pilot hatchery model \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for hatchery upstart \u2022 With ongoing government support of regional multi-species hatchery facilities, the enabling environment for investment is expected to be favourable \u2022 Hatcheries have the opportunity to lean on extensive research and development already done by KMFRI, drastically reducing time-to-market for local species fingerlings \u2022 While the hatchery model itself is not inherently inclusive, it enables inclusive farming opportunities \u2022 While low-scale, introduction of a new facility would warrant local job- creation ranging from technical (marine hatchery experts) to inclusive / accessible (administration and cleaning) \u2022 Engage with invested market actors who have authority to develop the enabling environment \u2022 Encourage policies and regulation that support responsible rearing and harvesting of fish (incl. feed, seed) \u2022 Support research and development, and deployment, of critical technologies and investments \u2022 Support integration of a Market Systems Development (MSD/ M4P) approach \u2022 Current investment in KMFRI trials of marine-based cage farming display government interest, and stakeholder interviews indicate a willingness to partner to reach scale \u2022 Designing policy and regulation for a new industry can set the stage for sustainable practices and inclusive markets from the onset \u2022 Opportunity exists to bring the enabling environment conversation to a variety of different stakeholders, each with their own expertise and inclusivity agenda \u2022 Involvement of carefully-selected partners can ensure that special attention is paid to inclusivity (women, youth, people with disabilities) for any regulations or policy implementation Source: TechnoServe Pilot and scale farming model for proof- of- concept A Invest in scaleable hatchery model for finfish fingerlings Engage partners to develop supportive enabling environment B C Executive summary xi Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya The finfish farming industry faces many challenges. A lack of technical knowledge and relatively high startup costs, especially without viable financial products to sup- port community-level investment, can bar smallholders from entering the sector. Even more, the high-risk nature of mariculture, in that stocks are vulnerable to theft and escape, make the potential investment even more precarious. Long-term success in the sector also necessitates consistent and sustainable access to fingerlings and feed, but as the farming efforts are only just emerging, there are no viable hatchery facil- ities and no resource management systems around wild-capture of feed. Furthermore, the deeper-water nature of finfish farming structures, paired with the asset-burden of capital investment, leads to a lower potential for inclusivity among women in the commu- nity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1aafd594-1c8b-4dbf-b73c-5b94710cf871": {"__data__": {"id_": "1aafd594-1c8b-4dbf-b73c-5b94710cf871", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b84c10b983ae518d7d71425c143fdfc7f0e1f353aae56e0261ade70c1eef13d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "28e0fe9d-ce50-4b0e-a088-dd7ad4e1ab36", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b95e9245bfe8913159bc7b42632196a88b79f77ea0977ec79832d6ef4104fa51"}}, "hash": "1747903749d8889c3df389b9785c6218b69f078f80a0c4458bfe0c11bc89a087", "text": "However, the market for cage-farming aquaculture systems is already developed and operational along Kenya\u2019s Lake Victoria.

Fortunately, the Kenyan government, through KMFRI (Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute) is proving the business case in active testing, priming the space to pilot a scalable model among the private sector. Once constructed and regulated, the low running costs bring community-level operations within reach of smallholders. The industry benefits from strong local coastal demand for fish con- sumption (through a growing population and increasing dependence on fish imports). Finally, investing in finfish farming has the potential to disrupt the current value chain by increasing and controlling production and harvests, allowing farmers to avoid re- strictive market relationships and drawing more of the value toward the smallholder. Once scaled, sector innovations like cage farming can offer nature-based solutions that combat the impacts of destructive fish- ing practices and reduce pressure on local environments. What follows are detailed assessments and recommendations for each value chain that outline critical steps for success in the sectors, along with overall suggestions for boosting coastal economies and supporting pilots for farmer programs. Important to note is the ever-present threat of climate change, as each of the selected value chains will be affected by rising sea temperatures and more turbulent waters. These efforts are expected to contribute to a holistic approach for ensuring sustainable, meaningful impact, both for Kenyan ecosystems and for local-ar- ea alternative livelihoods.

Background The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), dedicated to actions that \u201cconserve nature and accelerate the transi- tion to sustainable development\u201d1, seeks to further engage in the Blue Entrepreneurship space, build on existing successes across East Africa, and scale creative solutions, using Kenya as the pilot location. By participating in the Kenyan Blue Economy (definition and details further outlined in Chapter 2) with a focus on coastal regions, IUCN hopes to positively impact communities whose livelihoods depend on the ocean and ma- rine-based incomes, while also promoting sustainable, regenerative value propositions that actively protect and enhance the ocean environment.

Furthermore, Kenya sits among the 14 countries on the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy (Ocean Panel),4 an initiative which further highlights Kenya\u2019s enthusiasm for identifying innovative solutions that will protect the ocean and develop ocean-based economic opportunities. Not only does Kenya\u2019s participation in the groundbreaking Ocean Panel reinforce the degree to which the national government is primed to en- gage in this space, but the Ocean Panel itself serves as a resource for cutting-edge technologies and captivating ideas, and it acts as a global support for sustainable Blue Economy ventures.

The potential to drive impact among coastal communities grows year-on-year, as a combination of factors highlights Blue Entrepreneurship as a key driver. For example, global demand for ocean-based and ocean-adjacent products and services continues to grow, due to a rising global population8 who need inexpensive protein sources,9,10 an increasing middle-class inter- ested in travel,11 and a growing proportion of world tourism being dedicated to \u201cemerging markets.\u201d12 Kenya benefits from both of these sectors, with 0.8%13 of national gross domes- tic product (GDP) dedicated to fisheries and 6 ICT Authority.

Mindful of the ongoing health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on Kenya and its coastline, there is a need to ex- plore opportunities in the Blue Economy and other sectors to maximize positive impact on both coastal communities and ocean eco- systems. As such, interventions are expected to adhere to the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u2122 (NbS)16 that ensure environmental impacts are conscious of any potential unintended consequences. 1.2. Objectives of the study17 The objective of this scoping study for the Blue Economy in Kenya is to provide a roadm- ap of strategies, activities, and investments that have the potential to benefit people, the ocean, and the climate.

The recommendations will not only identify ways to catalyse investment but also under- score strategies to catalyse inclusive impact in the sectors, particularly in regards to the scaling of initiatives that positively impact the climate and ocean biodiversity. It is also particularly important that the strat- egy builds on existing donor and govern- ment initiatives and harnesses ways to both enhance and scale what is already working as well as recommend improved coordina- tion among market actors where there is an opportunity. The sub-objectives of the research are orien- tated around the following elements: \u2022 Establish market fundamentals: Gain clear understanding of how the sector currently operates, the opportunities and gaps in terms of competitiveness, the opportunities and challenges in regards to inclusive supply chains (particularly how value flows upstream and downstream), and develop a clear map of current donor initiatives and government policies supporting the sector. \u2022 Prioritize opportunities: Develop a long-list of potential interventions to support the sector, assess their potential for additionality in terms of i) climate impact ii) ocean biodiversity impact iii) employment opportunities created, and iv) feasibility, and identify those 2-3 value chains and/or strategies that seem to offer the greatest potential. \u2022 Deliver overall vision and strategies for transformation: Bring the analytical components together into a broader sector vision. Detail the strategies required, how they would work, how they will close the competitiveness gap, how they will deliver climate and conservation impact, how they drive greater inclusivity, how they will leverage existing programs and policies. Quantify the investment and impact benefits. Illuminate strategic pillars to achieve these visions and outline a roadmap over the next four years. 1.3. Research questions and methodology Ultimately, the research aims to answer: \u2022 Which three value chains present the optimal opportunity and most immediate potential for Kenya to positively impact coastal communities in terms of livelihoods and environmental progress (both conservation and regeneration)? By addressing this question using a com- bination of intensive literature review, desk research, and semi-structured interviews, the research will reveal the influential factors enabling or blocking potential for positive impact. Once the broad framework is in place, more specific value-chain-related questions can be explored and expounded. From there, the research hopes to address sub-questions like: \u2022 What are the market constraints and opportunities in the selected value chains? Introduction 4 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya \u2022 Which specific dynamics should be accounted for when planning future interventions? 1.4. Limitations of the research This research intends to utilize available re- sources to understand the current landscape for enterprises in coastal Kenya. We have limited the scoping efforts to ocean- based opportunities or value chains that have a direct connection to the coastline, thereby excluding on-land drivers of ocean health like plastics pollution and waste man- agement. Additionally, we excluded in-depth analyses of enablers, like government policy or large-scale infrastructure. These param- eters help us target impacts around coastal communities, enterprises, and households. While there is a pressing need to find scalable opportunities that can benefit the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region, the scope of this research is limited to the Kenyan context, with a specific focus on coastal geographies. Due to time constraints, local-area primary research was conducted exclusively in Kwale County locations, but we can reasonably ex- pect some transferability across geograph- ical areas when assessing the enablers and blockers. Secondary research is limited by widely-ac- knowledged over- and under-reporting of global fisheries data, complicating the exercise of pinpointing and reporting exact figures. We recognize the constraints to available data, and we proceed with the 18 TechnoServe. (n.d.). Mission. https://www.technoserve.org/about-us-varb/ understanding that all assessments and rec- ommendations are based on an incomplete global picture.

The Blue Economy concept The following research relies on a combina- tion of established working understandings of the Blue Economy, particularly those which integrate \u2018sustainability\u2019 as a core component. While some sources consider all economic activities that operate within the backdrop of the ocean,19,20 this report sets expectations of responsible engagement with value chains that promote regeneration and/or conservation impacts for the ocean and seas. For example, in line with what the World Bank describes as the \u201csustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods and jobs, and ocean ecosystem health,\u201d21 the Commonwealth of Nations depicts the Blue Economy as \u201can emerging concept which encourages better stewardship of our ocean or \u2018blue\u2019 resources.\u201d22 This research will not attempt to define the \u201cBlue Economy,\u201d per se.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fc922cd-6e05-4ea1-bde3-bb4be9e9b439": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fc922cd-6e05-4ea1-bde3-bb4be9e9b439", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ece28fa13313f4647e53a132a005033dc04ed4cfd7344dda6bbf5dac36b35eb3"}, "2": {"node_id": "a104b15a-abdb-4bbf-8881-7156beb24df4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "594b41ee1294ffbbdb36c20cd44c475131efedd314cef924303b3b2798349c6d"}}, "hash": "3499369e0c4c3ea69ff6d4bbe97407085a8e0470a2e2928c1bbe9cb0442b1800", "text": "However, embedded in the purposes of this inves- tigation is an underlying expectation that interventions or recommendations will pro- mote the livelihoods of coastal communities (including vulnerable populations) and en- gage in enterprising activities that promote both active (conservation) and proactive (re- generation) benefits toward the ocean and the species therein. For the purposes of this study, we interpret \u2018Blue Entrepreneurship\u2019 as components within the Blue Economy space that involve individual (or household) business opportunities. Additionally, coastal communities are among the most affected by climate change impacts and ocean over- exploitation, as their direct livelihoods are dependent on ocean resources, making the focus on coastal Blue Entrepreneurship all the more urgent. By responsibly engaging in the Blue Economy sector, Kenya also showcases the initiative\u2019s support of and contributions toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).23 Regenerative, sustainable ocean-facing ventures contribute directly toward SDG 14: Life Below Water, and these initiatives also have the potential to support SDG 13: Climate Action. By applying a gen- der-aware lens during data collection, data analysis, and innovation ideation phases, the Economy 8 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya study is positioned to produce outcomes that also address gender equity among coastal communities (SDG 5). In addition, the follow-on effects from increased local in- vestment in critical ecosystems is expected to support SDG 12: Sustainable Consumption and Production, while with improved, more-stable incomes enable enterprising households and communities to tackle pov- erty (SDG 1), food insecurity (SDG 2), health (SDG 3), and education (SDG 4). According to insights from the OECD Roundtable held in March 2019, it is estimated that we will only achieve the SDGs by 209424 if we continue to operate with a business-as-usual approach. This staggering outlook compels us to ur- gently take proactive measures and address systemic issues surrounding poverty, health, and the environment. 2.2.

Ministry Of Agriculture, Livestock & Fisheries country population has increased by around 23%27 in the past 10 years,28 the population along the coast has increased by around 30%.29 Comprehensive research and sustain- able interventions that prioritize the Blue Economy stand to serve a growing propor- tion of Kenya\u2019s people. It also seems that county governments are adopting and promoting Blue Economy interventions as of late, as they recognize the importance of the sector on their local populations. For example, Lamu County government reports the fisheries industry as affecting 70%30 of county incomes, un- derscoring the need for attention in this space. Interestingly, when reviewing Kenya\u2019s documented 2016 County Prioritised Value Chains31 across the 6 coastal counties, only Tana River claimed \u2018fish\u2019 as an industry of in- terest. Despite being hailed as a priority from the national government, on-land agriculture and livestock has historically been perceived at the highest importance. However, in more recent years, it is clear from individual county development plans for 2018 - 2022 actions that fisheries are a focus. Even more, plans reinforce county appreciation for the ocean, and they emphasize interest in developing the sector in a sustainable way. Despite movement toward ocean-based support, it is clear that Kenyan coastal counties have Economy 9 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya yet to capitalize on the boundless potential of their access to this Blue natural resource. Furthermore, Kenya\u2019s coastline is home to both intensely crowded areas (Mombasa\u2019s population density is 67x32 the national av- erage) and notably rural areas (Tana River\u2019s population density is 1/1033 the national av- erage). With an array of settings, economic makeups, and community needs, it becomes critical to focus on enterprise solutions that speak to the diverse local contexts and area issues. Not only will this research aim to parse out how different communities expe- rience Blue Entrepreneurship growth, that is, understanding the needs of both the pro- ducing and consuming parties, but we will also consider the various ways communities are able to leverage natural resources sus- tainably, given local resource management constraints. Additionally, the Blue Economy is growing unevenly across regions and sec- tors, with supporting infrastructure follow- ing a similar pattern. Therefore, problems in an urban coastal region will not be the same as the problems in a rural one, underscoring the need for thoughtful analysis and flexible solutions. 32 Calculated from: KNBS 2019 census (see footnote #25 for citation) 33 Calculated from: KNBS 2019 census (see footnote #25 for citation) 34 National Geographic.

Profit According to recent research, if the ocean was an economy (specifically, thinking of the total \u201cvalue of key ocean assets\u201d), it would be the world\u2019s 7th largest, worth $24 tril- lion.45,46 From that immense global resource, the \u201cocean asset base\u201d of the WIO region values around an estimated $334 billion.47 Measuring economic output in a manner similar to measuring a country\u2019s GDP, the WIO produces nearly $21 billion annually, comprised from sectors like coastal tourism ($10.4 billion), carbon sequestration ($2.9 billion), and \u2018direct outputs\u2019 like fisheries and aquaculture ($1.9 billion).47 With Kenya\u2019s 536 kilometres48 of coastline, it benefits from a range of ocean-based industries like fishing and seafood capture, coastal and marine tourism, and shipping. Kenya, which was cit- ed as one of the fastest-growing economies49 in Sub-Saharan Africa, showcases potential for economic growth across the country\u2019s coasts across a variety of sectors. The Blue Economy currently contributes just under 180 billion KES per year (2.5% of the national GDP), and at full potential, the Blue Economy stands to bring in 500 billion KES per year.50 Economy 11 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya However, Kenya fell victim to the economic constriction of Q2 2020,51 taking a particular hit in the tourism sector, as the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Global supply chain disruptions along with changes to daily operating life (like a government-mandated curfew) have impacted the Kenyan local and national economies in ways not yet fully cap- tured. Even so, this research and subsequent recommended interventions are informed with an awareness of the economic im- pacts, both globally and domestically, of the COVID-19 crisis, especially as more focus is being brought to the profit potential of the ocean and coastal ecosystems. 51 Focus Economics.

Climate impact The devastating results of climate change not only threaten the health of our planet and the ocean, but they put Blue Economy development at risk. This makes it vital to develop a resilient Blue Economy that can adapt to these threats. Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of natural disasters. When occur- ring offshore, these natural disasters are a threat to marine industries such as the cruise industry (tourism), shipping (trade), and oil and gas (energy). If happening inshore, they dramatically increase coastal erosion and biodiversity loss, through destruction of nat- ural habitats. Natural disasters that happen on land transport pollution to the ocean. Another climate change impact is acidifi- cation of the ocean. This change leads to widespread collapse of coral systems, which are home to at least 25% of all species in the ocean. Moreover, ocean acidification threatens the health of zooplankton; if these die alongside the 25% of all biodiversity sus- tained by reefs, the whole ocean food chain is at risk of collapse. Such a dramatic impact on the marine food chain would directly impact the 2.4 billion people living less than 100km from the coast52,53 and who rely on the ocean for business and food security. Furthermore, ocean stratification due to climate change means that the oxygen-rich upper layer of the ocean heats up faster than the nutrient-rich bottom layer. This leads to less natural stirring of the two layers, and in the long run, can create a precarious en- vironment in which the majority of species will struggle to find both food and oxygen. Additionally, the rise of sea levels, due to increasing global temperatures and glacial ice melting, impacts photo-dependent ma- rine species (like corals and seaweed) whose positions under water will soon be too deep for the sun\u2019s rays to reach. The global community is only recently realiz- ing the intense negative impacts of climate change on the ocean, with more new infor- mation constantly made available. We are beginning to understand the threat to ma- rine life and to the coastal communities who depend on these changing ecosystems. This reinforces the urgent need to develop inno- vative solutions that support communities as they integrate into their income-build- ing activities the critical conservation and Blue Economy sectors and value chain overview 14 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya regeneration efforts needed to abate the disastrous effects of climate change. 3.1.2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53746a75-fae5-4d23-b24e-4e315cc037fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "53746a75-fae5-4d23-b24e-4e315cc037fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c71df6c6e71494857510d70ad367799a3e15947ac4ec2533995f9b510a2c062e"}, "2": {"node_id": "8bc32dfd-8aff-445d-9043-e9641f892aed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bc4c04822e5a31692cf526688f5ecc87ef6d0506ab36eb6a60ce20319d32a91"}}, "hash": "bfecf3b29ca49a48af7af81b564e8ef9e1be5a117e7ac44b6a7bca5c6c061848", "text": "3.1.2. Percent GDP of Kenyan economy In 2019, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics published a report tallying Gross County Product from 2013 - 2017, which re- ports that coastal counties contributed \u00b19% to Kenya\u2019s overall GDP.54 However, according to Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani (JKP), Kenya\u2019s Economic Development Organization for coastal counties, the total Blue Economy in Kenya currently contributes only \u00b11% (that is, about 44 billion KES)55 to national-level GDP. Although a relatively small portion of the overall country economics, the Blue Economy plays a major role among coastal communities who depend on the ocean for food security and income. Across the Kenyan coastline, innovative ven- tures are emerging that blend community livelihoods targets with conservation and regenerative aims. These Blue Economy strategies are proving that environmental protection and profit can, in fact, go hand-in- hand.

This research aims to further contribute to the growing body of evidence that supports the Blue Economy as not only necessary for ocean health and long-term viability, but also as profitable enough to enrich and sustain livelihoods for coastal communities. 3.1.3. Forecasts / expectations With the expanding global population and with ever-decreasing barriers to globaliza- tion, we are seeing increased demand for transportation, shipping, food, medicine, and entertainment from the ocean. While more and more global consumers are making purchasing decisions that account for supply chains and their environmental impacts, this grassroots interest is not enough to main- tain and preserve the Blue natural capital resource for the long run. Instead, the Ocean Panel and other organizations are calling upon countries to plan for and execute strat- egies that address the increasing economic and resource pressure being placed upon the ocean. Citing Kenya\u2019s National Spatial Planning (NSP) 2015-2045, Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani (JKP) highlights how the Kenyan national strategy is developing expectations and ac- cordingly positioning the Blue Economy for growth in coming years.

Policy environment At the national-policy level, the \u201cClimate Change Act, 201658 is the key legislation guiding Kenya\u2019s climate change response.\u201d59 As part of the effort to fulfill that Act, Kenya\u2019s Ministry Of Environment And Forestry re- leased the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) 2018 - 2022. This Action Plan supports \u201cthe achievement of [Kenya\u2019s] Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement,\u201d which identifies \u201cwater and the Blue Economy\u201d as one of the targeted areas for intervention.59 Certainly as Kenya works toward its devolution status,60 legislative challenges and delays can be ex- pected as each county becomes responsible for its own interpretations, enactments, and enforcements of national-level initiatives and goals.61 Even so, efforts that support en- vironmental conservation and regeneration are primed to be supported at high levels by Kenya\u2019s policy structures.

De-risking coastal communities through diversification, while simultaneous- ly stimulating Blue Economy growth and prosperity, depends on collective effort that regenerates and conserves the Blue natural capital upon which all these coastal indus- tries depend. This research underscores the need for interventions that link livelihoods and economic benefits with long-term ocean health. A final important challenge to the Blue Economy is lack of specific technical know- how around ocean-related economies. Kenyan coastal communities, while armed with a wealth of indigenous and historical knowledge, lack technical ocean under- standings and are disadvantaged from a lack of access to advanced technologies. At the high-level, the translation of research into development and implemented practic- es is minimal, as evidenced by a noticeable lack of marine economic ventures, despite years of marine research in the country. Kenyan coastal success depends on relia- ble biodiversity and human ocean-activity data, ocean floor and coral mapping, and economic data related to Blue outputs. At the local-level, communities are under-edu- cated about simple, actionable conservation and restoration practices and how critical these practices are to both their livelihoods as well as to the long-term health of their local ecosystems. 77 Ecorys.

A report published through the European Commission77 identifies key mar- itime functions and sub-functions, and the research team adopted this framework to initiate value chain brainstorming activities. The structure divided the first-round work into the following six functions: Blue Economy sectors and value chain overview 18 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya \u2022 Maritime transport and shipbuilding \u2022 Food, nutrition, health and ecosystem services \u2022 Energy and raw materials \u2022 Leisure, working and living \u2022 Coastal protection \u2022 Maritime monitoring and surveillance More detail on functions and sub-functions can be found in Appendix 2. While creating a truly comprehensive set of ocean-based value chains represents an impossible task, the research team instead utilized the selected framework to investi- gate and expose various backdrops within the Blue Economy, making the list as com- plete and representative as possible. Simply put, the initial research phase attempted to identify a multi-sector assortment of \u2018ways to make money\u2019 across the coast. Important to note are some primary exclusion criteria for the initial exhaustive list of Blue Economy options. Based on the scoping study framing and the intended impacts for results and recommendations, we did not include ven- tures that were: \u2022 Non-income-generating (e.g.: volunteer or unpaid conservation efforts); \u2022 Inland-based (e.g.: on-land pollution- reduction schemes); and/or \u2022 Enablers (e.g.: government policy) From there, we set out to pare down to the fi- nal Long List of 8-12 ventures, so the research team needed to: \u2022 Develop selection criteria for the first assessment (further detailed in Section 3.3) that could quickly and efficiently reduce the exhaustive list across a variety of cross-cutting measures \u2022 Use stakeholder interviews and secondary research to evaluate each option on the exhaustive list against the first-assessment selection criteria \u2022 Promote the ventures with the strongest potential to the Long List Finally, the research team developed the Short List, aiming for 2-3 high-priority value chains for the deep-dive investigation. To arrive at the final Short List, we took the fol- lowing actions: \u2022 Develop a set of selection criteria for the second assessment (further detailed in Section 3.3), introducing additional metrics that could point to economic and community potential within the value chains \u2022 Conduct secondary research and stakeholder interviews to assess the Long List against the second- assessment selection criteria \u2022 Host a Focus Group session with a variety of industry experts to generate an engaging discussion around the Long List status and the potential of an initial suggested Short List \u2022 Work closely with IUCN for final approval of the Short List Ultimately, the research team identified 66 value chains for the Blue Economy in Kenya, 11 options for the Long List, and ended with 3 Blue Economy value chains for the Short List. 3.3. Selection criteria As part of the \u2018prioritizing value chains\u2019 step in the study process, the research team developed an efficient, comprehensive set of selection criteria. These criteria pinpoint Blue Economy sectors and value chain overview 19 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya value chains that exist in the overlap between ventures positioned to meet the livelihoods and environmental goals of the overall pro- ject and value chain areas primed to benefit from long-term support and current nation- al and regional momentum. The first-assessment selection criteria fo- cused on the following metrics: \u2022 Community- Enterprise Potential: Can you start or promote an inclusive enterprise (scaled thru community) with this value chain? \u2022 Regenerative Potential: What is the potential for the local environment to be restored and conserved? What is the potential to avoid future degradation of ecosystems? \u2022 Nature Conservation & Climate Change Potential: To what degree will the value chain activities conserve animals or plants in the ecosystems? To what degree will activities mitigate effects or help communities adapt to climate change impacts? \u2022 Upstart Time: How long until profit potential? 78 Ministry of Environment and Forestry.

The second-assessment selection evaluation embedded the assumption that activities highly negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic would be de-prioritized until some stability and regularity return to the industries. All criteria are equally weighted. Figure 2 shows the 11 value chains in the Long List, presented by function, as ranked against the second-assessment selection criteria. The four-colour visual rating scale ranges from Red = low suitability to Dark Green = high suitability. The research team then engaged in the Focus Group activity, with the aim of gener- ating discussion around the Long List and the emerging Short List. At that time, the front-running value chains were: \u2022 Seaweed farming \u2022 Finfish cage farming \u2022 Sea Cucumber farming \u2022 Planting On-land Trees (to prevent mangrove deforestation) The virtual Focus Group event was held on 18 February 2021. Besides the research team and IUCN representation, there were six attend- ees from across Kenya, bringing expertise in various subjects and representing various stakeholders, including: Coastal Women in Fisheries Entrepreneurship (CWiFE), Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), and Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani (JKP). Several key takeaways emerged from the Focus Group, notably: \u2022 Social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic affected the local fisheries industry primarily through a government-mandated curfew ordinance which affected traditional fishing and fish-processing working hours, with the majority of the economic disruption occurring for women Blue Economy sectors and value chain overview 25 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya \u2022 Seaweed is an important focus of government-led or government-backed organizations \u2022 Sea cucumber and octopus present strong potential across coastal fisheries and mariculture projects, and these value chains were targeted as priority for Kenya among the Blue Economy Implementation Committee Additionally, since financing and innovation are already in place to achieve scale for on- land timber production, other value chains seemed to have more need, and therefore more potential, for additional support and investment. This assessment fits with the research aims, namely the end results of scalable, innovative recommendations for the sector. With this updated knowledge, alongside the secondary research, first-hand accounts from stakeholder interviews, and insights from the expert panel, the research team finalized the prioritization of value chains exercise. Important to note is that this step repre- sents a prioritization, not an elimination. The research is not deeming non-prioritized value chains as \u2018bad\u2019 ideas, per se. We are not discouraging actors from investing in the deprioritised options, but based on the fac- tors considered, the research team arrived at the final Short List of 3 value chains for immediate focus and more comprehensive deep-dive research.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f88163f-f2da-4ffb-9efe-b8295fb6e942": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f88163f-f2da-4ffb-9efe-b8295fb6e942", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39e3df4f7be421a97cd55e44777d951a7cb67c7118e96f5419745ca745d0195b"}, "2": {"node_id": "8590ad91-e3ec-469e-b0cc-2ecfc30ffa25", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8045ead969a0f21a11058b56834094ec303d0d767651b46cd45f4a8729194241"}}, "hash": "0817b29f6ed8662a9bdfff9d2af518984e9361be518c0e7e2f3a94ea9b7f46e5", "text": "Figure 2: Long list against second-assessment selection criteria Function[1] Value Chain Options Inclusion of Minorities Value Chain Stakeholder Focus IUCN Synergies Market Potential Production Potential Impact of COVID-19 Food, nutrition, health and eco-system services ---farming--- Seaweed 3 3 2.5 3 2 2 Offshore Oyster 2 3 2 1 2 0 Finfish 2 2 1.5 3 3 2 Sea Cucumber 2 2 2.5 3 2 2 ---wild-catch--- Artisanal fishing (finfish) 1 3 1.5 3 2 2 Leisure, working and living ---tourism--- Accommodation (local stay, cultural stay) 2 2 1 3 1 0 Marine Protected Area - Creation / Mgmt 1 0 1.5 2 2 1 Tourist Guides + snorkeling + MPA 1 3 1 2 3 0 Coastal protection ---planting--- on-land Trees (protecting mangrove) 2 3 1.5 3 2 3 ---rehabilitation--- Mangrove Restoration - Carbon Credit (KE) 1 0 2 2 2 2 Mangrove honey 3 2 2 1 2 2 Source: TechnoServe Blue Economy sectors and value chain overview 26 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Table 5: Short list rationale Short List Rationale Seaweed farming \u2022 High potential for minority inclusion \u2022 Strong market potential \u2022 Strong IUCN synergies and focus Sea Cucumber farming \u2022 Marked as a KE government priority \u2022 Strong market potential \u2022 Potential for innovative solutions, (e.g.: symbiotic farming in combination with seaweed) Finfish cage farming \u2022 Strong market", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "738c907f-8ccf-45aa-88be-20ee239b7653": {"__data__": {"id_": "738c907f-8ccf-45aa-88be-20ee239b7653", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14eb8007319a2ee1417fef2c432c581e6e2ce686d4c555104415c31e043c8ae0"}, "3": {"node_id": "80f60277-baa1-4be4-afdc-f186d80be806", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c384cb609f34536759dbaaebddf9b529ac9ad36769475a221fde45b3ba0c72b3"}}, "hash": "62aac9aade28c46ddd2e24f278758827298293bdd9bed98bb68129e0b3bc6ce0", "text": "potential \u2022 Moderate potential for minority inclusion \u2022 Potential to innovate within the sector Source: TechnoServe 3.4.

Only a handful of these species are \u201cintensively cultivated,\u201d65 but the majority of global seaweed production, 97.1%83 accord- ing to FAO reports, is farmed rather than collected from the wild. Many seaweed varieties are used, both raw and processed, for food and human con- sumption. By 2017, seaweed was listed as \u201cthe fastest-growing component of global food production.\u201d84 Processed seaweed extracts (like alginate, agar and carrageenan) are used as binders, gels, and emulsifiers in food and food products.85 Further still, seaweed and seaweed outputs are used in animal feed, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, and more.83,86 Beyond its application for commercial products, seaweed holds immense value for ocean ecosystems and the planet.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80f60277-baa1-4be4-afdc-f186d80be806": {"__data__": {"id_": "80f60277-baa1-4be4-afdc-f186d80be806", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14eb8007319a2ee1417fef2c432c581e6e2ce686d4c555104415c31e043c8ae0"}, "2": {"node_id": "738c907f-8ccf-45aa-88be-20ee239b7653", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62aac9aade28c46ddd2e24f278758827298293bdd9bed98bb68129e0b3bc6ce0"}}, "hash": "c384cb609f34536759dbaaebddf9b529ac9ad36769475a221fde45b3ba0c72b3", "text": "Seaweed forests offer natural benefits like sequester- ing excess carbon, providing diverse animal and plant habitats, contributing to the ocean food chain, and mitigating coastal erosion from wave forces.83 Therefore, responsible participation in the value chain recognizes and alleviates the potential negative impacts of unsustainable exploitation.

Total produc- tion, including both collected and farmed, went from \u201c0.6 million tonnes in 2000 to 32.4 million tonnes in 2018.\u201d83 Important to note is that while the overall production of aquatic algae (of which, seaweed is the primary output) is increasing, it is increasing at a decreasing rate.83 While FAO-collected data shows that the majority of seaweed pro- duction (over 99%) occurs in Asian countries, the report is clear in saying that total values are underrepresented, therefore leading to potentially inaccurate country-assigned pro- portions, as it does not have data from sever- al major global producers.83 The value of the global commercials seaweed market varies due to over- and under-reporting of data more so than because of actual output vari- ations.

Production base The global commercial landscape for sea- weed production includes a variety of mech- anisms, ranging from small-scale operations (like wild-harvest and near-shore cultivation) to large-scale commercial ventures (like off- shore -or \u201cat sea\u201d- cultivation) to innovative designs (like integrated multi-trophic aqua- culture (IMTA) systems). In Kenya, production of exportable seaweed is exclusively farmed, as the sole exporter, C-WEED Corporation,90 does not purchase wild-harvested products. To maintain qual- ity and a transparent purchasing chain, the Kenya Country Representative buys exclu- sively from its own registered farmers. Reports confirm that Kenya\u2019s seaweed pro- duction potential is bolstered by its \u201clengthy coastline endowed with a wide variety of habitats for seaweed communities\u201d as well as its many (over 380) naturally-occurring species, some of which are unique to Kenyan coastal areas.91 However, current production is limited to Kwale County, where previous seaweed farming program pilots existed and then went dormant. A scout from C-WEED, a global exporting company operating in Zanzibar, Tanzania for over 30 years, hap- pened upon villages where farmers had successfully stored seaweed for up to three to four years, ready for purchase and export. By early 2018, C-WEED had registered in Kenya, and the once-quiet seaweed industry Value chain analysis: seaweed farming 31 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya began to restart along the southern coast. At present, Kenya\u2019s seaweed farms are cen- tred around eight seaweed centres, located in Gazi, Nyumba Sita, Tumbe, Funzi Island, Mwambao, Mkwiro, Jimbo, and Kibuyuni, all in Kwale County.

Each farmer area can hold 300 ropes, but field reports indicate that the space is often under-utilised. The average farmer is currently producing 300 - 500kg per production cycle (that is, every six weeks), whereas the production poten- tial is more like 1 tonne of dried seaweed in the same timeframe.

This variety is farmed for carrageenan, used as a gelling and stabilizing agent in the \u201cproduction of pharmaceutical, cleaning and personal care products like lotions and toothpaste, as well as in edible food such as burgers and various types of desserts.\u201d92 Farming cycles align with tidal cycles, and farmers work during the spring tide that comes every two weeks. During this period (5-7 days) where the low tides are lowest and the high tides are highest, farmers ideally spend the first three days harvesting and drying seaweed, with the remaining four days dedicated to re-seeding the ropes and securing them back into position. After two to four spring tides of growth (approximately 6 weeks), the seaweed should be ready. Farmers must take care to harvest quickly enough, else over-grown seaweed that pushes too hard against the tie-tie becomes severed and floats away. During working weeks, farmers average roughly three to four hours per day, when tides are low enough to access farm plots. On site, farmers monitor their crops and do the tiring work of carrying heavy loads to drying stations, often without help. Production cycles are also depending on seasonal weather patterns. Conditions are Value chain analysis: seaweed farming 32 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya good and yields are generally high from March through early May, during the in- ter-monsoon season. From June to July/ August, coastal areas in Kenya are subject to the Southeast Monsoon. This season brings extreme wind and rough sea conditions that not only cause seaweed to break away from ropes but also bring invasive filamentous green algae that destroy crops. Production increases again during August/September to November when conditions are relatively cool. From December to February, seaweed plants are unable to survive the hot temper- atures of summer waters, so farmers plant \u2018survival seedlings\u2019 in deep-water storage zones where cooler and more regulated wa- ter temperatures will keep the seedlings safe until it is time to replant. To date, there are around 1,500 registered seaweed farmers in Kwale County;93 howev- er, only about 500-600 are active and have substantial production. While some youth participate, farmers are generally between 40 and 55 years old, and over 90% of farmers are women. Kenyan seaweed faces a number of produc- tion-specific challenges. Unsurprisingly, envi- ronmental factors, like unfavourable weather patterns and warming sea temperatures, make farming in certain seasons impossible and come with higher risk of infestation or disease. Farmers also complain of a lack of assets, such as boots, mallets, and boats/ rafts, that would support farming activities. Although, some stakeholders argue that the frustration around inputs is a natural result of dependence on a revolving door of NGO and donor-funded projects. With the arrival of each new program, and the accompanying flurry of funding and startup support, local 93 Martin Kiogora (stakeholder interview, 12 Mar 2021) farmers are further disincentivised to see seaweed farming as a business and invest in necessary assets and equipment them- selves. Between the expectation of support and the current perception of low prices for difficult labour, motivation among farmers can be a challenge to production. 4.3. Broader value chain mapping As the seaweed value chain in Kenya is ex- port-only and dominated by a single export- er, the broader dynamics are relatively sim- ple. Seaweed is grown and dried by coastal farmers, and then seaweed is collected, transported, and exported by the C-WEED Corporation. Farmers operate in eight geographies across Kwale County and are visited by the C-WEED Country Representative on a bi-weekly basis to receive technical support and advice.

At the mid- to- high end of the average, and only at the farm part-time (\u00b150 hours/month),90 seaweed farmers are still earning on-par with the Kenyan minimum wage94 for rural general labour. Farmers might be paid once or twice a year, and the infrequency is due to low production and the time it takes the com- munity to meet a minimum village volume that justifies exporter collection and trans- portation costs. After receiving payments, farmers often contribute to their village-level seaweed-farming SACCOS (Savings and Credit Cooperative Societies) that serves as a local financial instrument. Purchases are made in bulk, ranging any- where from 2 - 23 tonnes in a given collec- tion. The exporting company takes on the operating costs of transportation and labour, and collections are taken to the main centre in Kibuyuni, where dried seaweed is baled. The commercial-grade baling machine packs seaweed from farmer sacks into 100kg bales. These bales are then transported to Mombasa, where they are loaded into shipping containers, holding 20 tonnes of dried seaweed each (200 bales for each 120ft container). While the parent company ships seaweed across the globe based on client demand, the Kenya operation has exclusively shipped its seaweed product to a manufac- turer in France.

The global price for seaweed dropped by US$ 100 per metric ton in 2020, and again by US$ 120 per metric ton in early 2021.90 This means the exporter is now earn- ing only 74 KES/kg on the global market, as opposed to the pre-pandemic price of 92 KES/kg. Using estimates of operating costs, it is likely that farmers retain 30-45% of the profit pro- portion in the value chain, while the exporter retains 55-70%. With decreasing global pric- es, the export business is caught between the challenges of low production volumes and shrinking margins. Increasing both yield (which is sometimes an issue of farmer mo- tivation) and number of farms would help justify continued spending on operational costs. While not yet developed, the sector has the potential to incorporate additional market actors for value-add and support activities. For example, intensive labour and carrying of heavy loads might be outsourced to local income-generating youth groups. With suf- ficient production, transportation services might also be a sustainable business model for local entrepreneurs. Kenya has yet to be competitive in the WIO seaweed trade, limited by scale and produc- tivity challenges. With target expansion ef- forts and thoughtful farmer support, Kenya\u2019s coastal farmers have the potential to outstrip production in Zanzibar, which currently stands at over 100,000 tonnes annually.83 Value chain analysis: seaweed farming 34 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Enabling environment The sector is also marked by the presence of NGOs who have historically offered farmer training programs and distributed inputs. The local government, specifically the BMUs, are involved from a sea-use access and mon- itoring perspective.

Finally, the seaweed value chain is influenced by government research facilities responsible for completing suitability mapping and up- dated environmental impact assessments. 4.4. Key challenges and threats Several prominent challenges face the sea- weed industry in Kenya today. First is one of scale. At present, only a small number of farmers are producing seaweed, limiting the attractiveness of investment by private sec- tor players and exporters. Farmer issues, like difficult, exposed working conditions and the poor value proposition of intensive effort for minimum payout, all discourage new farm- ers from entering the market. Fewer farmers thereby limits Kenya\u2019s overall potential to scale the industry. Furthermore, seaweed farming, as a relatively new venture, still struggles with dependence on government and donor support, and only a few farmers in Kwale County have managed to create a fully-autonomous business. Scaling seaweed output in Kenya, especially as global prices are currently falling, requires either easing the production burden or capturing more of the market value at the smallholder level, Value chain analysis: seaweed farming 35 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya driving farming adoption in the category and bringing critical attention to Kenya as a viable market player. Additional scaling challenges have been reported from some coastal communities who are unwilling to set up seaweed farming in their areas. Some local leaders fear that developing farming ventures will disrupt the status quo and are wary of the increased empowerment that comes with female farmers generating their own incomes. Over the past decade, several seaweed farming pilots have been launched across Kenya\u2019s coastline. As such, the local BMUs have developed protocols for sea-use access and leasing to farmer groups. Even though the governance work has begun, gaps for comprehensive management remain. Currently, seaweed farmers complain of con- flict with local fishers, who take advantage of increased fish populations in the newfound habitats but destroy seaweed lines and crops in the process. The lack of complete zoning and protections, that is gazetting the sea-access rights, threatens the security and scalability of the seaweed farming sector. Another threat to seaweed farming longevity is unstable access to a changing global mar- ket. First and foremost, there is no domestic market for farmed seaweed, apart from small value-added products that have yet to prove large enough to absorb significant lev- els of production. Therefore, the industry is dependent on global exports. At present, the entire sector rests on the export capacity of a single, solitary buyer; without enough volume to attract additional export players, farmers and their livelihoods are dependent on the success and intervention of this sole market actor. Highlighting the risk of dependence are reports from stakeholders of infrequent exports. The Country Representative from C-WEED Corporation confirmed the delay in shipments was due to deflated global de- mand related to an oversupply in the global market and a downward price trend. Moreover, financial impacts of the COVID-19 crisis also threaten the success of the sector, as production from other tourism-depend- ent countries has increased, dropping global prices. Granted, any worldwide event that dramatically reduces the price for farmers will exacerbate already-thin margins and a waning value proposition. The influx of supply due to COVID-19 happens to be the current culprit. Incomes from seaweed are already relatively low due to the commod- itised nature of the product, and Kenya will struggle to entice farmers and generate required sector scale if prices drop further. Finally, as with all mariculture initiatives, climate change impacts pose a threat to long-term Kenyan seaweed production.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4e325df-d065-401e-83b4-f46faf2cba47": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4e325df-d065-401e-83b4-f46faf2cba47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7261ee4ee1fd41b0809c6b15424acd773cfa49695ae5b1ef4d8f71731b3ac4c"}, "2": {"node_id": "65a5595f-fd5e-4300-a1a0-ae68008b9259", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7dd0d71203c05a23e90358f73cab55e354d84a6a59ff9731ce7894bf04d5407f"}}, "hash": "dc17bc18c12a03b237a77d1870b5c83b95ac02e33c6e4b137446547028e27ad3", "text": "The intertidal areas where seaweed is grown are at greater risk of rising temperatures, and changes in weather patterns that generate rougher seas negatively impact farming infrastructure.

Key strengths and opportunities Leaning on lessons from Kwale County seaweed pilots and learnings from seaweed farming projects in Zanzibar, Tanzania, it is clear that Kenya boasts coastal ecosystems that are conducive to growing seaweed. As farming gains more traction, the extensive Kenyan coastline offers untold expansion potential for smallholder farming.

Additionally, seaweed production does not require clearing of land or use of freshwater. These \u2018avoided produc- tion costs\u2019 also make farming relatively envi- ronmentally-friendly, albeit farmer practices and community conflict are the main drivers of unintended negative environmental consequences (like destruction of seagrass meadows). In Kenya, seaweed farming appeals to wom- en. Beyond the low cost, there is no require- ment for land ownership, and the near-shore area is safer (as compared to deep-water ventures like fishing). At this stage in value chain development, profit margins are also limited, so seaweed is not yet appealing as a crop for male involvement. Further involvement in the sector must responsibly consider the societal and family dynamics at play in Kenyan coastal communities, as the role of women as primary seaweed farmers develops. Innovations and interventions must be cognisant of potential harm (emo- tionally, financially, or otherwise) to women by outlining an expectation of intensive work with minimal benefit. Reports from the field suggest that the sec- tor also benefits from momentum driven by local enthusiasm and word-of-mouth pro- motion. Farmer-focused efforts will be more effective and have stronger staying-power if they can reduce the effort spent on mobili- zation and idea-pitching by capitalizing on the organic energy and supporting commu- nities on projects they select. 100 Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI).

Another strength of the seaweed industry in Kenya is its status as a high-priority area for government support. Its position as a key sec- tor for the Blue Economy agenda in Kenya is encouraging for market players who want to be assured of high-level attention and coop- eration, in funding, research, and policy, for pushing seaweed success.100 County govern- ments are also taking the lead on seaweed. In Kwale County,93 for example, the county government already allocates funds to the sector, and the Fisheries Director reports on plans to expand the value-chain by ensuring a ready-market for the current production. Additionally, because pilots are already un- derway in key areas, local government Beach Management Units (BMUs) have already outlined governance structures for sea-use access of community-based seaweed farms. Replicating the model and adapting for local context across other geographies will be much simpler than developing all the regu- lations from scratch. Seaweed farming is attractive to farmers, as the barriers to entry are relatively low (like low-tech farming mechanics and minimal input cost). As seaweed can be produced year-round and does not require full-time attention, coastal households benefit from an alternative livelihood option that offers supplemental, rather than replacement, income and constant cash flow. As the plots utilize near-shore intertidal zones, seaweed Value chain analysis: seaweed farming 37 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya farming can be taken up by a full range of community members, including women and youth, making it a welcome economic option to help coastal areas recover from COVID-19 declines. Diversification and access are two critical components for building household economic resilience, and seaweed farming serves to both reduce the community\u2019s de- pendence on fishing as an income source as well as reduce the strain on the local ecosys- tems from overfishing.

Sources say that upwards of 70% of glob- al fisheries for sea cucumber are fully or over-exploited or depleted,102,104 with \u201cno natural populations remaining\u201d in China.102 This dramatic rise in demand and price have led to what Mongabay terms a \u201cmarine gold rush.\u201d104 As of 1996, only 35 countries engaged in the sea cucumber export business, but by 2011, that number had more than doubled to 83.107,108 Furthermore, between 2011 to 2016, the global average market price for sea cu- cumbers rose nearly 17%.107 Value chain analysis: sea cucumber farming 40 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya This extreme demand generates damaging results. Fisheries around the world are see- ing drops in wild availability. For example, in Yucatan, Mexico it took only 2 years (2012 to 2014) for wild sea cucumber harvests to drop 95% (from 260 tons to only 14 tons).107 Business Insider reports that, as of 2019, from the \u201c70 or more species of exploited sea cucumbers, seven are now classified as endangered\u2026 all through exploitation.\u201d107 These results do critical damage to local ecosystems as well as to the communities whose livelihoods depend on fisheries for survival. The decline in available resources is linked to a combination of foreign demand, ineffective governance structures, and daily economic pressure among poor coastal communities.109 Over-reliance on small scale fisheries is common, and 66% of sea cucum- ber fisheries are small-scale.106 Exploitation of any piece of these fragile ecosystems puts the environment and the livelihoods of hun- dreds of millions of people at stake. As much of the sea cucumber trade world- wide exists through informal channels sup- ported by poaching, global production sta- tistics are hardly comprehensive.

Production base Global production of sea cucumber consists of a mixture of wild-catch and aquaculture farming facilities, with the prevalence of each production type dictated by availability of wild stocks, access to hatchery and rearing technology, and prevalence and enforceabil- ity of local governance requirements. In many countries that see an overlap of hospitable ecosystems and minimal (or no) domestic consumption, sea cucumber wild catch is the predominant means of produc- tion. Due to the high value, and because sea cucumbers are slow-moving, \u2018catching\u2019 is really more like \u2018collecting,\u2019 adding to the problem of global sea cucumber stocks that are dramatically overfished.

How sea cucumbers are boosting the bioeconomy in Zanzibar. http://www.fao.org/fao-stories/article/ en/c/1247576/ fishers can still manage a relatively high catch, but quality is reduced, due to small- er sizes. Additional challenges of the rainy season include lower production base, as many fishers avoid the practice when seas are rough, and post-harvest losses due to ex- cess rain that make drying processes slower or less effective. Export prices from Kenya are highest from November to February, coinciding with holidays like Christmas and Lunar New Year. Kenya competes on the global market with Asian countries, like Fiji in particular, and with other African countries, like Madagascar and Seychelles. When vying for a position in the global export market, Kenya faces production challenges like climate change, insufficient supply, and declining stocks. According to the Fisheries Directors of Kwale County, wild sea cucumber stocks have been on the decline for decades, forcing several operators to close their sea cucumber busi- nesses.93 Sea cucumber aquaculture is an option for Kenyan production that could solve some of the problems with availability, while also building back the ecosystems in ways that protect and regenerate other ani- mal populations. Several examples of sea cucumber aquacul- ture projects exist in the WIO region, some more successful than others. A Zanzibar, Tanzania sea cucumber project, supported by FAO and Korea International Cooperation Agency,122 faces the aftermath of a liveli- hoods program cut short. Despite technical research and training through FAO and Blue Ventures, the hatchery has shut down due to an inability to master sea cucumber juvenile Value chain analysis: sea cucumber farming 43 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya feeding techniques115 and a lack of funding,123 stopping the program in its tracks. However, leaning on decades of trial, adap- tation, and learning, Blue Ventures102,106 offers an example of a community-farming setup in Madagascar and points to the potential successes that can be found for both eco- systems and local community livelihoods. In Madagascar, Blue Ventures sea cucumber farmers are earning on-par with the coun- try\u2019s agricultural minimum wage,124 just from doing sea cucumber farming part-time (roughly 20 hours/month).115 These farmers also produce high-value seaweed, adding to their incomes. Additionally, the farming practices are yielding a 60% return on juve- niles to harvest, which is double the return at a standard industrial farm. By 2015, the 100+ active farmers in 2 villages in southwest Madagascar had produced and sold nearly 24,000 market-sized sea cucumbers, with a total value of more than US$ 18,000.125 This model also encourages community engage- ment and supports local leaders as they es- tablish and enforce sustainable governance practices that protect farmers and mitigate conflict. Additionally, locals in Madagascar are seeing ecosystem improvements,126 like more biodiversity and faster-growing seaweed, due to the increased presence of sandfish.

The full process can transform a fat, wet sea cucumber that started at 450g into a hard, dried item of only 15g.126 Many exporters are based in Mombasa, while some prefer keeping operations in smaller fishing villages, like Shimoni, where supply is easily accessed and labour is less expensive. One exporter interviewed chooses to travel to Hong Kong from Mombasa, carrying the shipment himself. This work, of course, requires a special export license, as well as four additional certifications. For high-qual- ity sea cucumbers, the exporter is able to collect prices of 15,000 - 18,500 KES/kg from Asian customers, retaining an astounding 85-90%136 of the final value of the product. At present, the sea cucumber export market in Kenya is limited, as exporters are facing increased financial pressure, and some have recently shut down operations.93 Throughout the whole of Kenya, no sea cucumber aquaculture presently exists,93 and introducing sea cucumber farming will disrupt the current value chain. Opportunity exists to harness a lucrative industry, incor- porate innovative ideas (that are inclusive of vulnerable populations) to boost supply, and generate substantial value for local-fisher livelihoods. Enabling environment As an emerging value chain, the sea cucum- ber industry is widely unregulated across Kenya. This means that wild populations are not monitored or measured, no catch quo- tas exist, and sea cucumber businesses are Value chain analysis: sea cucumber farming 46 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya subject to general sector regulations, rather than measures informed specifically for the product. The Kwale County Fisheries Director confirmed that, in the county, regulations around sea cucumber catch are nonexistent. However, the county is currently undergo- ing efforts to revive aquaculture practices that stalled during the Economic Stimulus Program. As the county government prior- itizes its constituent\u2019s demands, efforts cur- rently focus on freshwater aquaculture near dams. Positively, Kilifi County government set targets for 2018 - 202295 that include con- ducting feasibility studies, with sea cucum- ber named specifically as a priority. Market actors can expect the enabling environment and government regulation of sea cucumber on the coast to be a work-in-progress for the foreseeable future. 5.4. Key challenges and threats The most pressing bottleneck for a robust, sustainable sea cucumber aquaculture value chain in Kenya is the issue of institut- ing and maintaining viable hatcheries. At present, not a single hatchery exists, and the sector has no chance of survival or scale without operational hatcheries relatively close to farming grounds, as fingerlings are too delicate to transport far distances (that is, no further than 100km).115,120 As seen with the Zanzibar effort, the hatchery challenge represents a combination of issues including funding (even with an active hatchery, simi- lar projects require a minimum of five years115 of external program funding to achieve self-sufficient systems), technical expertise 137 Karega, V.

Furthermore, industry actors must prepare for additional challenges within the emerg- ing sea cucumber value chain. First, the lack of current government regulation in the sector means farmers are at risk from both ecological and financial factors. Lack of regulation around stock monitoring, quotas, and ecosystem protections has the poten- tial to jeopardize efforts to improve natural habitats and increase smallholder access to Blue natural capital. Moreover, the lack of regulations around pricing or exporter policy leaves the economic agency of smallholders at risk from potential monopolistic behav- iour throughout the value chain, as has been a challenge to sea cucumber farming efforts in both Madagascar115 and Tanzania.137 Additionally, the process to engage local community governments to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72840012-cc96-4bdc-ac4e-ca1b3fc602b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "72840012-cc96-4bdc-ac4e-ca1b3fc602b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ae3ac6d453c734e9dcef974f440d182360cdc8747e24e6551fcf7c374c2854b"}, "3": {"node_id": "db5a2ed4-b555-4554-ab90-a33a43f25de6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "076d424c231bd2e001527b82ac49c36c34379e6002b141c4cc24ac457ab8e03a"}}, "hash": "9d84644e7064d7fe0eb6682a638a12f1bbdebae3d033829ca124a6925a8e311f", "text": "solidify protect- ed and gazetted sea-use access for small- holders can take many years.61 Finally, all marine-based extraction value chains in Kenya will face short-term chal- lenges of farming safety, that is, farmer expo- sure to the sun\u2019s damaging UV rays and en- vironmental dangers that come with a lack of swimming skill and safety equipment. In the medium-to-long-term, climate change issues, like warming water temperatures and rougher seas, pose a risk to all Kenyan mariculture initiatives. If Kenya can solve the hatchery issue and find funding for sufficient support during farmer Value chain analysis: sea cucumber farming 47 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya scale-up, we can expect to build an indus- try that is competitive with Madagascar in the WIO region. In the mid-to-long term, a healthier supply of stocks would help draw new entrants into the export side of the market, reducing the risks of monopolistic behaviours and spreading more control and wealth downstream. 5.5. Key strengths and opportunities Despite the challenges and risks, there is great potential for the sea cucumber value chain in Kenya. Beyond the growing global demand and attractive prices, there is \u201cun- limited\u201d export opportunity in Kenya93,120 and hardly any price volatility.120 Simply put, the market is there to be filled. Knowing that local stocks exist (as in the wild-catch mar- ket) are assurance that the Kenyan coastline boasts appropriate growing conditions for farming sea cucumber. As the sea cucumber industry sits as a Kenyan government priority, efforts in the space will benefit from this directed attention, enthusi- asm, and funding. Importantly, the national government, with financial support from the World Bank,123 is currently investing in the re- search and development of a hatchery pilot in Shimoni, Kwale County. This multi-species facility, while currently undergoing con- struction, is several years away from being fully operational. It is probable the facility will eventually be able to provide sea-cucumber fingerlings for farmer pilot programs, but of even greater value will be its ability to expose the proof of concept for a viable hatchery business. By highlighting the business case, this facility can help unlock critical private sector interest and investment in the value chain. Moreover, while an under-regulated industry holds inherent risk (as outlined in Section 5.4), organizations like IUCN have the unprecedented opportunity to become an irreplaceable partner for robust regula- tion-setting that drives forward an eco-con- scious agenda (including ecosystem pro- tections, stock population monitoring, and environmental measurement requirements) as well as local-area best-practices (like ad- vocating for local community involvement in governance setup and the protection and inclusion of vulnerable populations). In the meantime, while policies are being devel- oped, there exists a window of opportunity to trial thoughtful, responsible short-term breeding solutions that pull juveniles from the ocean in a sustainable way. This type of pilot integrates into government regulatory conversations while also breaking ground on farmer pilot programs in parallel to hatchery development. Among the strengths of the sea cucumber industry are benefits to farmers, such as low barriers to entry (achievable technology, low upstart costs, and part-time farming hours), relative safety (as compared to current wild-capture diving practices), and constant cash flow (when farms are operational and invest in monthly seeding practices, they can benefit from monthly harvests, too). The close-to-shore nature, and the opportunities for value-addition services are conducive to including vulnerable populations like wom- en and youth. Especially in the aftermath of the national economic decline in 2020 due to COVID-19 crisis, market actors can develop a value chain in Kenya that engages the full household to build pandemic-era livelihoods that support coastal families. Acknowledging the benefit these crea- tures have to coastal ecosystems, a critical Value chain analysis: sea cucumber farming 48 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya environmental opportunity exists. Farmers could develop partnerships or arrangements with local government entities with resourc- es and incentive to buy-back stocks through- out the process. These sea cucumbers could then be used to reseed into the wild, bolster- ing biodiversity, enhancing LMMA and MPA ecosystems, and bringing compounded benefits as they make underwater habitats even better than before.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db5a2ed4-b555-4554-ab90-a33a43f25de6": {"__data__": {"id_": "db5a2ed4-b555-4554-ab90-a33a43f25de6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ae3ac6d453c734e9dcef974f440d182360cdc8747e24e6551fcf7c374c2854b"}, "2": {"node_id": "72840012-cc96-4bdc-ac4e-ca1b3fc602b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d84644e7064d7fe0eb6682a638a12f1bbdebae3d033829ca124a6925a8e311f"}}, "hash": "076d424c231bd2e001527b82ac49c36c34379e6002b141c4cc24ac457ab8e03a", "text": "Finally, as sea cucumber farming is expected to take only around 20115 hours per month from the smallholder, building into the sea cucumber value chain has the opportunity to offer critical alternative livelihoods options to coastal households that are supplemental to, rather than exclusive of, existing activities.

Market dynamics According to a Sustainable Seafood Overview report, \u201capproximately 3 billion people in the world rely on wild-caught and farmed seafood as a primary source of protein.\u201d138 FAO estimates the average global citizen consumes 20.5kg per year, as of 2018.83 With an increasing global population, aquatic an- imals emerge as a critical category for food security and daily protein. In fact, the growth rate for human consumption of fish not only outpaces growth rates for other animal proteins, but it has been increasing at \u201ca rate almost twice that of annual world population growth.\u201d83 Not only are there more of us, we are eating much more fish. These growth trends are markedly more pronounced in developing countries. When FAO outlines global fisheries and aq- uaculture production, the totals for \u2018fish\u2019 in- clude shelled molluscs, finfish, crustaceans, and other aquatic animals, but exclude \u201caquatic mammals, crocodiles, alligators and caimans, seaweeds and other aquatic plants.\u201d83 Global production of fish reached 179 million tonnes in 2018, and 69% of the world\u2019s total comes from Asia, of which China accounts for more than half. Africa trails be- hind the Americas and Europe, contributing only around 7% to global totals.83 Most fish is consumed locally, as exports account for only 38% of worldwide production, but even so, the global fish export industry has a re- ported annual value of over US$ 164 billion.83 Global production comes from a relatively even split between wild-capture (96.4 million tonnes, representing 54%) and farmed aq- uaculture (82.1 million tonnes, representing 46%). However, according to reports, \u201cthe value of farmed fish was higher, around US$ 250 billion compared with [US]$ 151 billion for wild-caught fish.\u201d128 On an upward trend, it is estimated that aquaculture production will \u201cincrease by one-third by 2030 \u2026 and will supply the majority of aquatic protein in people\u2019s diets by 2050.\u201d128 While wild-catch production is predom- inantly marine-based (88%), only 38% of farmed fish comes from the ocean.139 Shelled molluscs are the primary product from marine-based aquaculture, with finfish rep- resenting around 24%. On the whole, then, marine-based finfish farming accounts for less than 9% of global aquaculture produc- tion and just over 4% of global fish produc- tion overall.140 The aquaculture industry is underdeveloped across the African region, and the continent contributed less than 3% to the global aqua- culture total in 2018, with sub-Saharan Africa contributing less than 0.5%.83 The continent is heavily dependent on wild-catch, and Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 52 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya according to FAO, \u201caquaculture accounted for 17.9 percent of total fish production in Africa,\u201d83 as compared to the worldwide pro- portion of 46%. Sources agree that wild stocks of fish are dwindling. It is estimated that anywhere from 70%141 up to 85%138 and 90%142 of the world\u2019s fisheries are overfished and overexploited.

The community perspective: how COVID-19 is impacting the lives of coastal people in Kenya. https://blog. blueventures.org/en/the-community-perspective-how-covid-19-is-impacting-the-lives-of-coastal-people-in-kenya/ and globally, Kenya\u2019s per capita consumption of fish (less than 4kg146 per year) is among the lowest. The challenge on the horizon is one of feeding Kenya\u2019s increasing population as surrounding countries compete to sup- port their own populations that are growing even faster. The pressure on supply is likely to make fish imports more scarce and more expensive for Kenya in coming years. Reports show that \u201cfish catches have been declining in Africa in recent years by a million tons a year,\u201d147 making it clear that Africa\u2019s overreli- ance on wild-capture fishing poses a threat for not only the health and nutrition of the population, but to the ecosystems upon which coastal communities rely. Mirroring worldwide reports, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on Kenya and the WIO region. With the global tourism indus- try at a standstill, there is no surprise that coastal communities in Kenya are feeling the financial impacts of the shutdown. Also, the increasing difficulty of accessing medical care along with new government-mandated public health protocols add additional pres- sure on poor households.148 Many are forced into subsistence fishing to feed their fami- lies, and the increased fishing activity strains the productive potential of ecosystems. Additionally, the government-mandated evening curfew has impacted the Kenyan Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 53 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya coastal fishing industry in a number of ways. First, from the production side, without the option for night-fishing in deeper waters, local fishers end up taking advantage of more near-shore habitats, even if they are protected areas like community-based LMMAs.148 Lower fish stocks make fishing an ever-more-challenging task, with excess ef- fort spent to reap less reward. Not only does this negatively impact household income and food security, but local ecosystems are suffering, causing a negative biodiversity rip- ple effect as regenerative potential dwindles. Stories from Vanga in Kwale County tell of the challenges within coastal fish trades caused by the pandemic; Blue Ventures quotes one of their Kenyan contacts as saying: \u201cThey have cut and taken the buoys we put to mark our LMMA area. It is now a prime fishing area and there is not much we can do. The number of people fishing at the reefs here has increased but the fish trade has fallen very low. Previously here in Vanga, up to six fish trucks would come everyday to collect fish for the Mombasa and Nairobi market.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f863aa72-af09-4ee3-9716-88e1437eef0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f863aa72-af09-4ee3-9716-88e1437eef0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8456cd0566dcb48728f170efbd4b9cc8f0a8df8c86aea01eb7f1e8d4a4695f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd647cf8-3de5-4341-9c83-14bb2586b96c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b04cc99012bb454521762c30e4d50fdaff89bf6c96e563fcde9a4049acc06c7"}}, "hash": "f021d63c52376c4d79f001d9b82e1ef90e1439d350ddb1e814830158c765e3b0", "text": "But recently, only one truck has been able to ferry fish to Mombasa, and that was for the local market.\u201d148 On the positive side, local coastal demand for fish in Kenya remains strong, and pan- demic-restricted trade comes with both an increase in \u201ccatches [that] are sold locally\u201d149 and a welcome decrease in local price.148 149 Blue Ventures.
