(2008); Note: * UNIFEM (2008) data 27 3.2.2. Feminization of Employment The feminization of the labor force is a global phenomenon. According to ILO (2008), about 200 million women joined the global labor force in the last decade. In 2007, there were about 1.2 billion women in paid work compared to 1.8 billion men (ILO 2008). Female participation in paid formal work has increased globally while male employment had remained stagnant (Elder and Schmidt 2004; Arias 2001). There has been a steady rise in the female labor force participation rate since the 1970s in most regions, including South Asia and Southeast Asia (UNRISD 2005). This is due to changes such as rising levels of female education, decline in the average family size, and the changing aspirations of women and their families. It is also influenced by changes in structural factors such as, a decline in agricultural production, growing landlessness, withdrawal of agricultural subsidies, declining levels of male employment and male wages as a result of the dismantling of state owned enterprises and structural adjustment policies (Chen et al. 2004). According to Kabeer (2007), the informalization15 of paid work and the changing nature of demand in the labor market also influenced the feminization of employment. Female labor is considered flexible labor for certain highly competitive, labor- intensive sectors of global supply chains such as clothing, fresh produce, etc. (UNIFEM 2008). This is due to the following reasons: 1) female labor is free of the fixed cost (i.e., employer provided benefits, social security) associated with male employment in the organized sector; 2) male breadwinner ideology still influences the view that women are secondary earners, thus low pay is justified; 3) gender discrimination and segregated markets curtail women\u2019s options and reduce their reserve price (Elson 1999; Kabeer 2007). In addition, there has been a sectoral shift in female labor. The feminization of employment indicates that demand for women\u2019s labor is present. Being able to earn an income and other things associated with work such as mobility, create opportunities for women to exercise agency and choice at an individual level. However, the type of work women are being recruited for is important. The structural factors such as occupational segregation and male breadwinner ideology, which create demand for women\u2019s flexible labor may not necessarily strengthen women\u2019s voice and collective bargaining power in the market. What does feminization of employment mean for rural women? Women are a part of the movement from agriculture to taking up an increased share of the manufacturing labor force. Female migration from rural to urban areas for work in manufacturing sectors has created opportunities for women to negotiate household relations. However, this section largely focuses on employment in the informal sector and leaves out the formal manufacturing sector as this does not fall under the purview of the paper on rural livelihoods. There are intra-regional differences in terms of employment growth. The ILO (2008b) study on ASEAN countries (excluding Myanmar) shows that ASEAN countries have made gains in labor markets growth and productivity in 2007 in comparison to the other sub-regions. Informal sector employment, which include own 15 The movement of formal paid work into the informal sector through subcontracting, home-based production etc. 28 account workers, self-employed workers, causal day laborers and owners of small- scale enterprise is one of the key sources of income for the poor in this region. Farrington et al. (2004) point out that the contribution of non-farm economic activities to rural income has been underestimated in South Asia, and contributes between 40 to 50 per cent to rural income.

The growth of home-based workers in South and Southeast Asia is a dominant trend in female employment. According to Doane (2007), women prefer home-based work as it allows for flexibility to do reproductive work. An income and social hierarchy exists among informal workers and the home-based workers are at the bottom of this hierarchy. They are not covered by social protection laws and are considered as supplementary earners. Their fall-back position is weak, as there is limited demand for their products, and they are vulnerable to market shocks. In rigid forms of patriarchal regions, such as South Asia, women home-based workers have limited access to raw materials, capital and market information. These barriers lead to production of low quality products. The working conditions of informal workers indicate that while being able to work and earn an income may be an empowering experience, the experience of the work itself may not be empowering and will not lead to structural changes. 3.2.3 Gender and Agricultural Markets According to the World Bank et al. (2008), women entrepreneurs and farmers face constraints stemming from lower mobility, restrictions in accessing training, market information and productive resources. Gurung\u2019s (2006) research in Tamil Nadu shows that women lose income and control as the product moves from the farm to the market. The types of constraints women face in accessing the market differs across the sub- regions in the Asia-Pacific. In East Asia, the Pacific and South Asia, the agro-climatic diversity has led to the production of many different types of crops. Yet, poor market distribution affects most of the region, although domestic markets are growing. According to World Bank et al. (2008), several countries such as China, India and Thailand have matured agro-processing industries. These countries are in a position to supply processed and value-added products to the domestic and international markets. However, in other Southeast Asian countries that are in transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, the businesswomen lack entrepreneurial skills and access to technology. For example, in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, 48 per cent of male owned enterprises use technology compared with only five per cent of women-owned enterprises (World Bank et al. 2008). The smaller Pacific Islands are facing competition from the larger economies in the region. Booth (1999) points out that women\u2019s role in production, natural resource management and fishing were not addressed adequately by policies. There is a shortage of traditional food crops produced by women (that are high in demand because of tourism and growth of export sector) given the emphasis placed on cash crops. 29 The sub-regional pictures indicate that women\u2019s participation in the market is limited in the Asia-Pacific. Women have distinct rights and obligations within the household and market-related activities. According to the World Bank et al. (2008) most of the female farmers are small holders producing traditional food crops for subsistence and sales. Female managed farms have lower productivity as they use low levels of mechanization and technological input (ibid). Women generally own small-scale farms whereas, men own medium to large-scale commercial farms. Thus, men are better able to capitalize from the commercialization of agriculture. The global integration of markets implies that free entry of traditional agriculture crops into domestic markets has an adverse effect on the smallholders (usually women) unless they are prepared. IFAD (2002) research shows that women have a lower presence in the formal sector and in the urbanized/developed markets. Women\u2019s ability to participate in these markets is dependent on women gaining landownership, access to technological assistance and formal financial markets, and training. Given that women-owned farms are small, increasing mechanization without increasing women\u2019s landholding may produce the best results. Box 3.1 However, women can still benefit from the commercialization of agriculture. The expansion of high value products such as vegetables and crops in the urban markets presents an opportunity for women. However the key challenge lies in how women are able to retain control over processing and marketing (Box 3.1). Production of some of the high-value crops requires labor intensive techniques, such as pruning or trellising, where women tend to specialize. The key question in terms of the agricultural market is how will the commercialization of the agricultural market affect women? Much of the market created by commercialization may be difficult for small farm holders to access. They may lack the required capital and technological know how. Commercialization also affects the gender division of labor in small-scale farms, which in turn affects how resources are managed, as well as income and expenditure flows. The introduction of commercialized small-scale faming may change gender Learning", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e96ef72-dba6-421f-b4e7-66819f7cb124": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e96ef72-dba6-421f-b4e7-66819f7cb124", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d0ad99de25372996f8a61fb7006fadb75ca7e3226d14cd569d3f79e7e721676"}}, "hash": "2d0ad99de25372996f8a61fb7006fadb75ca7e3226d14cd569d3f79e7e721676", "text": "to Survey the Market: LEAF program in Bangladesh Livelihoods, Empowerment and Agroforestry (LEAF) projects in North Bengal, Bangladesh trained local women and minority communities to run small businesses through local CBOs.

The community organizations were trained by NGOs to undertake market survey trips, which increased their confidence and brought the women into direct contact with the market actors. The direct contact with market actors allowed women to overcome information barriers. Before women\u2019s only channel of information were the local traders.

Women\u2019s effective participation in supply chain requires interventions such as, reduction of structural barriers to entry for women; capacity development of small enterprises; and the development of market linkages. 3.2.4 Gendered Voice Women\u2019s voice is a crucial factor for highlighting women\u2019s livelihood concerns and in promoting women\u2019s interests both at the local level and within the national policy making processes. Regarding women\u2019s representation in parliaments, the Asia-Pacific region has yet to reach a critical mass. However, according to UNIFEM (2008), in the last decade the percentage of women in parliament has increased. South Asia is ahead of other regions at about 16 per cent, whereas East Asia and the Pacific are at 11 per cent. The reason behind the difference between South Asia and other regions is the quota (UNIFEM 2008). At the local government level, which is a key arena for influencing rural livelihoods, South Asian countries, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have reserved seats for women. The experience of these countries illustrates both the positive and adverse impacts of the quota system. The presence of women in the formal political arena does not necessarily imply that they would act for women. Research shows that quotas were used in India and Bangladesh for proxy representation (Hassan 1999). There is a tendency among women representatives to identify with their caste identity and to promote caste interests rather than gender interests (World Bank et al. 2008). However, comparative studies conducted in Rajasthan and West Bengal, India, showed that female-headed panchayats addressed livelihood concerns raised by females at a higher rate than male-headed panchayats (Box 3.2). In Bangladesh, research shows people reported a higher rate of satisfaction with the performance of the female local representative in terms of distribution of public resources and allocation of projects, compared to the performance of the male members (Khan and Mohsin 2008). Box. 3.2 Acting for Women: Local Level Female Representatives and Livelihood Policy Outputs India introduced gender reservations for all tiers of local government in 1992. One third of the panchayat seats are reserved for women only through competition, and one third of the council heads are also reserved. Studies comparing how local councils function in West Bengal and Rajasthan show that there is a systematic difference in the complaints and requests filed based on the sex of the person filing the complaint. More women than men filed complaints on water resource management. Interestingly, the number of drinking water projects was 60 per cent higher in female led councils compared to the male-led councils. In West Bengal, female-led councils undertook road-building projects at a higher rate compared to male-led councils, since the jobs were likely to go to females. The evidence here suggests that the presence of women in decision-making bodies can make a difference in addressing women\u2019s livelihood concerns. Source: Chattapodhaya and Duflo (2004) 31 In socialist countries, such as China and Viet Nam, women have a significant presence with the Communist party and at different levels of the local government structures for the following reasons: a) historically, women participated in large numbers in the nationalist struggles and in the communist revolution; and b) during the post-revolution period, the state policies created space for women in formal politics. In China, about 21 per cent of the members of parliament are women (de Hann 2009).

This can be created through opening up formal spaces. For example, the PRSP consultation process in Bangladesh included a wide range of feminist organizations that led to more gender sensitive analysis. However, collective organizing and the creation of networks can raise issues of concern more effectively. For example, GABRIELLA in the Philippines, the largest alliance dedicated to promoting women\u2019s and indigenous people\u2019s rights, used the party list system to campaign and win seats for their members. These members were able to file for legislation in behalf of rural women, migrant workers and on other issues. 16 According to the World Bank (2008), community driven development or CDD and self-help groups are effective ways for increasing women\u2019s participation and voice in matters related to rural livelihoods. In the Asia-Pacific region, many countries such as Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Cambodia and Sri Lanka have community driven development projects. These create space for women to participate in the development and implementation of projects. However, the effectiveness of women\u2019s voice is influenced by the social and gender norms around how women should exercise voice (i.e., content and how things are said) in the public arena. In rigid forms of patriarchies, women may face mobility related constraints that may limit their participation in community projects. 4. GENDER AND AGRICULTURE 4.1 Gender and Land Women\u2019s direct access to, and ownership of, land in the Asia-Pacific region is affected by gender-biased inheritance laws, customary practices and land policies. Women mainly access and use agricultural land as sharecroppers, laborers, or de facto household heads due to male migration. In South Asia, about three to 10 per cent of the rural women own the land that they cultivate (Kelkar and Nathan 2005). Ownership of land or formal land rights is critical for the rural poor since ownership or formal rights provides access to key markets and nonmarket institutions such as community power structures. Direct access to land and formal rights are critical for female-headed households (headed by widows, abandoned and divorced women, or females becoming heads of household due to migration of the male head) to establish claims over household assets and labor contributions from immediate and extended 16 See (www.gabirellawomensparty.net). 32 family members. Moreover, formal claims increase women\u2019s bargaining power within the household and increases household welfare (World Bank et al. 2008). An inverse relationship exists between women\u2019s property ownership and domestic violence against women (UNRISD 2005). Agarwal\u2019s study conducted on 500 households in Kerala showed that only seven percent of women who owned land and their house reported experiencing violence compared to 49 per cent of women who did not own property (Agarwal 2009).17 In Asia-Pacific, inheritance practices are patrilineal, matrilineal and bilateral. Patrilineality is the dominant pattern in South Asia. Matrilineality and bilateral inheritance exists in South India (Nayar, Tiyyars and Chettis communities), Northeast Asia (Khasis, Garo and other communities) Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia (countries such as Malaysia and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic). In addition, Muslim inheritance norms are bilateral, although in practice for Muslim women in rigid form of patriarchies, the customary tenure system is patrilineal. How family land is allocated is also influenced by marital residence (patrilocal or matrilocal/virilocal) and asset transfers during the marriage (bride price/dowry). The land inheritance and marriage practices determine the degree of female dependence, control over crop and income, women\u2019s managerial authority over land and labor. Agarwal (1994) draws attention to the fact that in matrilineal societies, women\u2019s fall- back position in case of marital breakdown is strong. Women are less dependent on the husband for their material well-being and exercise more agency in household decision making and use of labor. Women are able to control crop surplus, cash earnings and participate in trade, particularly in Sinhalese communities (Agarwal 1994). Women also had greater mobility. However, property rights did not change the overall gender division of labor; women are responsible for household work and childcare. Moreover, the managerial authority over land in some of the matrilineal communities was exercised by the men in the family (brother and/or maternal uncles).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62ef6e31-ea34-4acc-8d90-9be7d5d3009a": {"__data__": {"id_": "62ef6e31-ea34-4acc-8d90-9be7d5d3009a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b306359bffff219f64d5ad0984a332a8658ab44928dcd408b6b99a6afcace27"}, "2": {"node_id": "c4fbf0fd-7c21-4cf3-abfa-203eb08ff090", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42e70e04bd33ff9eb93648560974bfe91b2ed437c1a5da5cacc62316f3348493"}}, "hash": "43377fa85fc28c2a9dbaf6993cefa909ef663cf1cefe25585a18a2680f934720", "text": "Interestingly, while in some communities women are able to exercise managerial rights over land, they are not able to participate in public decision-making bodies.

In these cases, redistributive land reform programs, resettlement 17 It should be noted that Kerala is a matrilineal society, where women in practice inherit property, which is why the study was conducted in Kerala. The study results controlled variables such as: husband\u2019s and wives\u2019 occupation, education, parents\u2019 occupation and education, the proximity of the couple\u2019s residence to the wife\u2019s natal household etc. The study divided women in four groups: a) those who owned land and house; those who owned only the house; those who owned only land and those who had no property. The study also found that fewer women in both groups-- who owned only the house or only land reported lower levels of violence compared to the women who did not own property (Agarwal 2009). 33 programs and leasehold arrangements by the state can play crucial roles in creating the scope for women to own and use land. Generally, land reform programs that take households as distribution units generally targeted landless men for redistribution since men are considered the household heads (Jackson and Rao 2005). However, women have been targeted for redistribution as a group under some land reform movements, such as the Bodghaya movement in Bihar, India, where 10 per cent of the land was redistributed in women\u2019s names (Jacobs 1998). In socialist countries such as China and Viet Nam, poor women had access to land as farmers through the establishment of agricultural collectives (Jacobs 1998). However, Viet Nam\u2019s land reform did not abolish family-owned small holdings, which were cultivated by the families. The land reform and establishment of collectives increased the visibility of women\u2019s role in agriculture and established a separate identity and allowed them to escape different forms oppression, such as early marriage, etc. However, men were able to control women\u2019s labor for cultivating family farms and control the outputs and income. The collectives produced subsistence crops whereas the family-owned farms earned higher profits through the production of cash crops. The male owners, however, were unwilling to join the collectives. Eventually, the family small holding farms were contracted producing for the collectives, which made women\u2019s labor less visible (Jacobs 1998). Creation of group-based agricultural collectives for landless women may create scope for women to lease or buy land collectively and link up with produce markets. However, creating and sustaining such groups require state sponsorship or assistance from NGOs. For example, the Deccan Development Society (DDS), an NGO in Andhra Pradesh was able to organize low caste Dalit women in small groups for leasing and purchasing land. At present, the women in these groups in 14 villages have managed to purchase 500 acres (Agarwal 2009). The women have also leased land under Andhra Pradesh\u2019s anti poverty scheme and have received subsidized credit from the state (Agarwal 2009). This program allowed women to earn additional income, and pool resources and credit. The collectives were successful since participation in these are voluntary. The groups are small in size, and there is a clear and transparent redistribution principle of the benefits among members. Monitoring mechanisms ensure that the free rider problem does not arise. Moreover, because of their economic and caste-based identities, women in these groups have fewer alternative options for income and a high incentive for co-operation. This perhaps indicates that in contexts where women engage in subsistence based farming, a group approach to land lease and ownership may work well for women (Agarwal 2009). 4.2 Gender and Agricultural Labor Market Gender inequities in the agricultural labor market are pervasive across all regions. In the Asia-Pacific region, more women than men work in agriculture. According to ILO (2006), twice as many women compared to men in Southeast Asia and about one third more women compared to men in South Asia work as agricultural laborers. Women involved in agricultural work engage as: unpaid family workers, those who are paid in kind (exchange labor), self employed workers and wage labors. Typically for rural women in South Asia, women tend to have less control over their own labor, and their role in agriculture is assumed to be an extension of their reproductive role at home. 34 They also have less control over the labor of their household members/relatives because they are unable to provide reciprocal labor or favors. This section focuses on women who engage in agricultural work in exchange for cash. These can be on-farm (weeding, planting, etc.) or off-farm (cutting, packaging, etc). Assessing agricultural wage labor, especially by gender is difficult. However, studies show that women\u2019s time constraint remains a key issue.

This places constraints on how women engage in the labor market and perhaps explains why women in this region have been slow to move out of this sector compared to men. According to the World Bank (2008), this has reduced women\u2019s bargaining power in the market. The impact of this kind of work on gender power relations within the household is not transformative. Moreover, the casualization of agricultural production has led to a concentration of females in low-paid, insecure, labor-intensive work. The gender wage gap exists in all the sub-regions. For example, the average wage for casual labor for women is 30 per cent lower than men (UNRISD 2005). Seasonal migration for agricultural work had contradictory effects on women. On the one hand, the experience of work itself is not empowering as women are in insecure, low-paid work with no opportunities for alternative employment. The reproductive burden on women, those who migrate with families, does not change (UNRISD 2005). In agro-processing industries, the wage gap also exists. In Bangladesh, female shrimp fry catchers are paid about 64 per cent of what male fry catchers are paid (World Bank et al. 2008). Occupational segregation exists in the agro-processing industry in Southeast and South Asia. Studies on Punjab (India) show that about 60 per cent of the laborers in tomato farming are seasonal female laborers (Gill 2001). This study shows that although a gender wage gap (females get about 60 per cent of the wages compared to men) and occupational segregation exist, and women have to work long hours in insecure jobs, tomato farming has provided a new form of employment for women (Gill 2001). For women, being able to migrate and earn money changes their bargaining power as well as the family structure. There is a rise in female-headed households (women leaving their husbands and women workers collectively living together). However, workers experience limited tenure, labor-intensive work, sexual harassment, and health and safety hazards. The employment guarantee schemes, such as those in India, have actually had a positive gender impact. The scheme stipulates that one third of those participating in public work projects must be women, thus increasing women\u2019s sense of entitlement, and voice into this process (Box 4.1). In terms of policies, steps need to be taken for providing legal protection, developing labor codes and rural transport and infrastructure for strengthening women\u2019s voice and shifting the power structures. 35 Box 4.1 4.3 Rural Finance There is a range of financial service providers focused on rural areas such as banks, microfinance institutions, etc. They offer a range of services to the poor such as credit, savings, insurance, remittance services, leasing, etc. However, this section specifically focuses on microfinance, which has emerged as a key strategy in South Asia for poor women to access financial assets. It is also a key mechanism for coping during the agricultural lean periods and for diversification into non-agricultural based work (Kelkar and Nathan 2005). Studies have analyzed the benefits of microfinance programmes on women. They have researched the impact on individual and household level well-being (Pitt et al. 2006) and women\u2019s empowerment. The studies have also looked at women\u2019s groups acting as a collective (Kabeer 2005). The overall impact of credit on well-being has been positive, improving nutritional status, children\u2019s schooling, consumption, etc. However, some studies also demonstrate impoverishment of the households as a result of debt recycling (Kabeer 2005). Time analysis shows that the overall work load of women involved in group-based programs has increased. Women make time for income generation activities and also complete reproductive work. Qualitative studies from Bangladesh show that women are aware about this trade off between leisure time and income generation work, but are willing to carry the double burden (Kabeer 1998). Some studies provide anecdotal evidence where men offer to share childcare, while women are away for group meetings (Nazneen 2008). Debates exist on whether credit is empowering for women. Some studies show that credit empowers women at the individual level increasing their decision making power. However, other studies illustrate that group based credit fails to promote broader empowerment at the political and social levels (Sharma et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a36fb7d4-ee7d-4c0a-a61b-6f55ec3d410f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a36fb7d4-ee7d-4c0a-a61b-6f55ec3d410f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "012cb58892f9a767c5d7b820bb2f5b9cd53fd6064e0112e05e48d7b3389b19b0"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2312f9a-45df-4ef6-a38b-9c2ded8852af", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1308c92e629566812a0fc26e1b70b5de1662811aeb6fab3a46ba8754a544fc5"}}, "hash": "6ab21341a07958723ddaba0fc32b6ae1b14103890929a62c2ab39dd25140df28", "text": "2007; Kalpana Establishing Women\u2019s Livelihood Rights: The Employment Guarantee Scheme India enacted the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) in 2005.

This scheme has created scope for women to access wage work and also increased their sense of entitlement. For example, in Karuli district in Rajasthan, a woman panchayat leader has taken this scheme further by creating a women-only monitoring committee for the NREGA in the region. This has increased the responsiveness of government officials to the needs of women. In another district of Rajasthan called Dungrapur, women do two-thirds of the work on NRGEA projects. Women dig, break stones, lift and deposit stones. The women in this district report that they are proud of the work they do. 36 2008). Women\u2019s sole control over loan use and management remains open to question (Goetz and Sen Gupta 1996). Some studies suggest that involvement in MFI has changed the proportion of women\u2019s wage compared to men\u2019s wage through non- agricultural work. It has also reduced rural women\u2019s underemployment to almost half in Bangladesh (Kelkar and Nathan 2005). MFIs prefer women as clients as they are reliable in terms of repayment. Though poverty alleviation remains the key focus of these programmes they are also seen as a pathway to empower women. How gender equitable the impact of microfinance is depends on the following aspects: female mobility; women\u2019s responsibility for subsistence work (which means they may invest in safe products); opportunity for investing in non sex-stereotyped activities; female literacy level and costs related to accessing information (Mayoux 2005). Despite women being preferred clients, they are still institutionally discriminated against. Women\u2019s access to institutional services is unequal. Studies show that if the range of services is compared against what women actually received; they access a very small portion of the services (World Bank et al. 2008). This is because women receive smaller loans compared to men and there are no clear guidelines on graduating out to the small enterprise development category. Additionally, there are not enough support services to help women remove market access constraints and increase access to other resources (e.g. land) that help to use credit successfully. Institutional gender bias (small loans, lack of support services), restrictive social norms (restriction on mobility, gender norms around work); individual factors (lack of literacy skills), all limit women\u2019s options in diversifying their livelihoods in a manner that increases women\u2019s participation and voice in rural markets (Nazneen 2008). Studies have shown that credit groups and self-help groups, ubiquitous in South Asia, have not proved effective for financing agricultural production. This is because these groups are unable to provide large amounts of capital needed for farming at different points of the farming cycle (World Bank et al. 2008). 4.4 Gender, Rural Infrastructure and Water Management Land and water rights are closely related. Given the lower level of female land ownership in the Asia-Pacific, it is not surprising that women have fewer rights over water and a minimal role in water management processes. As women are responsible for domestic water collection, access to clean water may reduce their workload, and increase overall well-being. Water management influences the livelihood strategies of women, thus they need user and ownership rights over water as they are producers in the agricultural sector (IFAD 2007). Many women are involved in farming as laborers and as de jure family heads (due to male migration). According to the World Bank et al. (2008), agricultural water management includes the following: irrigation, drainage, recycled water use, water conservation and watershed management. There is an overwhelming emphasis on the engineering and technological aspects of this sector, as well as on the environmental impacts. Policy making processes related to water bodies and management is a male- dominated area, and in many cases has not taken into account women\u2019s knowledge, needs and unequal ownership/user rights. The reasons for this oversight are many: lack of staff capacity, absence of gender disaggregated data, and gender biased social 37 and cultural norms (IFAD 2007). Women are rarely seen as farm owners. This perception even affects group-based strategies for managing water resources. For example, India\u2019s watershed development program relies heavily on farmers\u2019 groups to deal with land degradation. However, the emphasis on men as land title holders leads to marginalization of women\u2019s groups, even though women play a key role in managing common resources (World Bank et al. 2008). The access and use of production technology by poor women are constrained because they lack literacy skills and money to buy inputs from the markets, and due to class (and gender) bias that operates in agricultural extension services.

Extension agents who transmit knowledge and services do not see women as targets of their work, whether in rigid forms of patriarchies like Bangladesh or in societies where female mobility is higher like Sri Lanka (Agarwal 1994). 4.5 Governance, Gender and Agricultural Livelihoods Frequently, gender analysis of rural livelihoods focus on the gender biased access to resources and the gendered nature of participation and power within households, rural markets and communities. Gender analysis of agricultural policy making processes and state service provision, and how these can reinforce or mitigate gender biases at the market, community and household levels, are key for understanding how women\u2019s power and participation can be expanded. Feminist studies have shown that state service provision remains male biased, especially when it comes to agricultural extension services (Elson 1995). Creating gender sensitive state services, policy- making arenas and legal reforms are crucial for making space for women (Goetz and Jenkins 2005). These reforms make the public service providers and policy makers act in a more gender equitable manner. Aside from these supply side reforms, there are demand side reforms that strengthen women\u2019s ability to hold state officials to account (Goetz and Jenkins 2005). The demand side includes the use of various participatory methods such as citizen\u2019s report cards and public assessments. For example, in Bangladesh the Local Government Support Programme (LGSP) has created processes for local people to monitor how block grants are spent and establish social accountability relations. The participation of female elected councilors in this process is mandatory (Hassan 2008). One of the key areas is to focus on how policy processes and projects remain gendered (Goetz 1997). According to the World Bank (2008), engendering the existing processes and projects require the presence of active women policy makers (this does not rule out active male policy makers); gender inclusive policy making processes and policies themselves. This indicates that the supply side of gender sensitive agricultural governance works at the national and local levels. It requires national and agricultural policy formulation processes that create space for women to participate; creation or reformulation of national machineries that addresses gender issues in agriculture; gender sensitive budgeting; and incorporation of women as service providers. Decentralization is generally considered to be a positive step towards ensuring participation of poor and marginalized groups in decision-making processes at the local level. However, research shows that projects that are administered through local 38 level pubic administration are less likely to address women\u2019s needs when compared to projects that are community driven (Baden 2000). This is because women may have greater access to local decision making bodies and the issues they raise would have greater relevance. However, the local level patriarchal structure may be stronger and when combined with customary laws, these may make it harder for women to participate effectively and influence decision-making. Moreover, the structure, availability of resources and the politics of decentralization also affect what women can do at the local level. Women themselves may lack capacity, literacy skills and time. Community driven projects may create scope for inclusion of and participation by women. However, these projects are affected by local customs and class/caste/ethnicity based divisions. They may lack institutional capacity and may be implemented in a top-down manner. Good governance also includes collective organization by people. Rural women in the Asia-Pacific participate in different types of groups related to agriculture; including self help groups, producer associations, voluntary and business groups. There are also natural resource management groups, NGO credit groups, etc. There is variation in how women benefit from participating in these groups and whether they are able to exercise their voice to influence service provider\u2019s policies or hold organizations to account in matters that affect their livelihood. This is because existing gender relations and norms effect how and to what extent women are able to derive benefits from groups. Credit and saving groups may facilitate women producers to diversify, while common resource management groups may create space for women to participate (Heyer et al. 2002). Aside from access to economic resources, these groups are a space where women can develop their organizational skills, self esteem and a social network outside their kinship based networks (Agarwal 2009; Kabeer and Matin 2004).

Some, however, have been successful such as SEWA, a registered trade union of 800,000 women of which two thirds are small farmers or landless laborers. It has been able to create a comprehensive strategy for empowering women by improving their assets, employment opportunities and ability to negotiate with power holders at different levels (Rose 1992). It has also created the All India Women Farmers Association. This created space for enhancing skills, opportunities, development of women\u2019s leadership. However, collective organizing into a producer\u2019s co-operative does not necessarily guarantee that changes will take place at the structural level, i.e., women\u2019s access to land or user rights over natural resources. Moreover, self-help groups or NGO credit groups may exclude marginalized, minority or poor women. For example, Kalpana\u2019s (2008) research on self-help groups in Tamil Nadu shows that Dalit women are systematically excluded. The groups can be used as mechanisms to create pressure for collecting payment on loans (Nazneen 2008). 39 5. GENDER AND EMPLOYMENT 5.1 Gender and Formal Employment In the Asia Pacific region, countries that have large export based sector, there has been feminization of certain forms of industries that are perceived to be more suited to traditional skills and attributes associated with women. For example, female workers are perceived to have \u2018nimble fingers\u2019 and patience suitable for garment, micro chip processing, etc (Elson and Pearson 1981). Initially, the demands for female labor for these industries were influenced by factors such as: a) gender segregation of occupations; and b) female labor being free of \u2018fixed costs\u2019 associated with organized labor (security benefits, etc). In addition, Agro processing industries have led to the development of a female workforce in formal employment. However, most of the female employment in this region still remains in the informal sector. In fact, few of the countries that have growing export oriented manufacturing sectors, such as Malaysia, Thailand and Bangladesh, have women been absorbed into the formal sectors. The work conditions and payment are better in these sectors compared to the other sectors in the rural/urban economy. Many of these industries are not based in rural areas, so does not fall under the purview of this paper. However, these industries have created different livelihood opportunities for rural female population. Moreover, female migration to urban areas has changed the nature of family structures and their ability to make decisions and bargain at the household level. 5.2 Gender and Informal Employment Women\u2019s informal employment comprises of 65 per cent of non-agricultural work in the Asia-Pacific (ILO 2002). Informal work includes workers in the unorganized or informal economy that include both employee and own account workers in non- agriculture and manufacturing employment.18 According to Kelkar and Nathan (2005), in South Asia, the informal workers have grown in both absolute and relative terms compared to the formal workers and this trend has a female face. There are about 50 million home based workers in South Asia and 80 per cent of them are women (Doane 2007). In India, the unorganized sector accounts for about 90 per cent of female workers, including wage and piece rate workers and the self-employed (Doane 2007). However, the women moving out of home based production, or self- employment to salaried wage work is low compared to Southeast Asia (Kelkar and Nathan 2005). Informal workers have been incorporated into the global commodity chains to reduce costs. Different types of home-based work have developed, which reduce the cost of production by transferring part of the cost to the worker and economizing on the benefit accorded to formal economy workers. Home-based workers in Southeast and South Asia are not covered by social protection laws and classified as housewives in 18 Definitions of informal employment includes: a) Self employment in formal enterprises (small or unregistered enterprises); b) unpaid family workers, employers, own account worker; c) wage employment in informal enterprises: (without secure contracts, worker benefits and legal protection): employees of informal enterprises, informal wage worker, causal day laborer, domestic workers contract workers, temporary part-time workers (ILO 2002) 40 the census.

At the lower end, are workers with limited access to resources, market information, and technology with fewer direct linkages. It is difficult to categorize home-based workers along this hierarchical scale based on what they do. However, mostly isolated, rural self-employed workers comprise the bottom rung of the ladder. Doane (2007) points out that gender is a key determinant of a worker\u2019s position within this hierarchy. Women may prefer home-based work as it provides flexibility for carrying out reproductive work. However, the nature of the work itself may be problematic as it isolates women from other women and public settings. Moreover, in rigid forms of patriarchies very few home-based workers have direct access to the market, and lack information related to the market about prices, raw materials, etc. For example, women pottery makers in Bangladesh and Pakistan have remained at the low end of the hierarchy although the demand for pottery has increased in the urban and international markets. This is due to restricted mobility, limited access to raw materials and information in markets. For some industries such as garments and papermaking, the growth of the modern sector has lessened the value of the products produced by home-based workers. Economic instability creates increased vulnerability of the female home based workers. In Southeast Asia, during the Asian financial crisis in 1990s combined with footloose capital moving to cheaper production places, home-based subcontracting emerged as a way of production. This increased competition for existing home-based workers, and made them more vulnerable. The poorest of the home-based workers may not have any access to micro-finance institutions or NGOs. For example, the shell collectors who live in boats in Bangladesh do not receive any formal assistance. HomeNet studies on South Asia and Southeast Asia suggests that factors such as gender, social exclusion and economic trends have an intergenerational poverty effect on the children of home-based workers (Doane 2007). A HNSA study (2006) pointed out that girl children of home-based workers in South Asia were taken out of schools and employed in home based work, whereas male children were allowed to go to school. There is a marked education gap among girl and boy children of home-based production workers in South Asia. However, Southeast Asian countries demonstrate a different trend. In the case of economic difficulties, the eldest male child may be taken out of school to look his siblings, while this is not the case for girls. 5.3 How Empowering is Paid Work? Paid work is seen as a pathway of women\u2019s empowerment and promoted as such in the policy literature (Kabeer 2007). However, the extent to which paid work is empowering depends on the geography of gender (Townsend and Momsen 1987)\u2014 the nature of family and kinship systems, and the gender division of labor patterns. Moreover, the nature of work, and the stage the women are at in their life cycle, are crucial to analyzing the impact of paid work. Women\u2019s experience of paid work is a 41 contradictory process, generating gains as well as losses (Elson and Pearson 1981). Kabeer (2007) argues that by and large, the entry of younger women into paid work in formal sectors has expanded their life choices. They are able to control their own incomes, have increased mobility and can negotiate over strategic decisions such as marriage. They also contribute significantly to the natal family. There are numerous studies on Southeast and South Asia where women have sought employment in factory work/export processing industries (Ong 1987; Davin 2004). These studies show that work has allowed women to resist parental authority. They also have a greater sense of responsibility for their own actions and a wider social orientation. Wolf\u2019s (1992) comparative study between women workers from Indonesia and Taiwan, Province of China shows that women\u2019s room for maneuver depended on how restrictive the patriarchal structures are. Despite the opportunities that paid employment provides, married women\u2019s participation over own labor and income in rigid forms of patriarchies is controlled by men. However, studies conducted in India and Bangladesh show that there is a positive relationship between women\u2019s economic involvement and women resisting male control and trying to renegotiate gender power relations (Kabeer 2000; Blomquist 2004). Generally, work outside the home leads to a shift in the domestic balance of power. Decision moves from norm-based decision making to negotiated decision-making. In fact, working women report a jointness in decision making rather than men being the sole decision maker in household matters. The studies conducted in Bangladesh show that regardless of who controls the wages, women\u2019s involvement in outside", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e08ae919-8076-4940-986f-3ef3d4938fb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "e08ae919-8076-4940-986f-3ef3d4938fb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46c178752081de4ed7105e596d9894f7477ea0e85477a9a2e677bc2e5e16c3ca"}, "3": {"node_id": "779a64f1-c3b0-4a89-bd2c-7f3519ffbe05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b00f300509e6118381935519d5900f113f69481a8afc94112ffda6bf4a840f87"}}, "hash": "05b33a92a35bde093b78eb92ccede233b9279c75460c745fa0578644d76134bb", "text": "work led to higher levels of savings, mobility and surprisingly lower levels of domestic violence (Kabeer 2008). The type of work women engage in plays a key role. Kabeer\u2019s (2008) study on Bangladeshi women found that compared to women working in the informal sector or those not involved in the productive sector, women involved in paid work in the formal sector had more control over household expenditure, were most likely to buy assets, save and experience a higher level of mobility. Admittedly, studies on relations between women\u2019s work and domestic violence have shown mixed results. Some studies show that in certain contexts, particularly where there is extreme poverty-related stress, violence increases after the women start working (Kabeer 1998; Kabeer 2007). Notably, the relationship between women\u2019s work and domestic violence has been more researched and the results are more mixed compared to the very few studies that analyzed the relationship between women\u2019s property ownership and domestic violence (Agarwal 2009). The results show a strong inverse relationship between the two. Studies conducted in Bangladesh, show that women engaged in informal work tend to acquire non-land assets such as a rickshaw, poultry, other livestock, jewelry, grocery shop, etc (Farrington et al. 2004; Schuler et al. 1996). This may be because the loans were given to build productive capital. However, this does not imply that women have control over these assets, since studies also show that a significant number of women reported that their personal items such as jewelry were sold off by their husbands (Schuler et al. 1996). The gender division of labor at home is an area that is slowly changing. Research shows that negotiations do take place over the distribution of workload, though the 42 male privilege of not having domestic chores is difficult to change. In fact, studies conducted on Bangladeshi women show that married women take the burden of domestic chores as a trade off for being allowed to work (Kabeer 2007). Female migrants in areas that have a loose patriarchal form, such as the Philippines, do not expect the gender division of household to change because of paid work or migration. Most of the female migrant workers either ask other extended family members to help or hire people to do the housework. 6. GENDER AND NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 6.1 Gender and Forestry For rural poor women, forests are a source of subsistence and they provide safety nets in times of crisis. UNRISD (2005) points out that gender asymmetry in land ownership causes women to rely on non-wood forest products. Women\u2019s household activities also make them dependent on some of the forest products such as firewood. Women\u2019s (and men\u2019s) access to forest products and user rights are influenced by community norms on gender and common resource use and formal laws. Women\u2019s role in accessing, managing and benefiting from non-wood products not only affects their livelihood strategies but also their power relations within the household and community. This is because women do not have to collect and sell non-wood products through men, unlike crops. According to Kelkar and Nathan (2005) in South Asia, women\u2019s rights to access forest resources can mitigate gender power relations in patrilineal indigenous communities. For example, among the Naga community in India, women\u2019s roles in processing forest products for the market have positively affected their bargaining power. In matrilineal indigenous societies of South Asia, women play a larger role and have clear user rights to forest products. However, the gender relations and community norms around forest product use are changing given the pressure from the state in favor of andocentric systems (Kelkar and Nathan 2005). Community forestry programs were initiated in the belief that these would provide spaces for local poor to access and manage forest resources. There has been increased control over forest products by local elites, particularly of community forestry programs. The forest-based livelihood needs of poor women have mostly been ignored in these programs, which encouraged timber planting. Leasehold forestry that assigns a particular part of the forest to the poor (sometimes to women) places restrictions on forest use. However it may create opportunities for women to increase their income. A community forestry program in India, shows that inclusion of women into forest management meets male resistance both at the administrative and at the community levels (Agarwal 2002). Aside from male resistance, women\u2019s work burden increases as they take on additional duties along with household responsibilities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "779a64f1-c3b0-4a89-bd2c-7f3519ffbe05": {"__data__": {"id_": "779a64f1-c3b0-4a89-bd2c-7f3519ffbe05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46c178752081de4ed7105e596d9894f7477ea0e85477a9a2e677bc2e5e16c3ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "e08ae919-8076-4940-986f-3ef3d4938fb5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05b33a92a35bde093b78eb92ccede233b9279c75460c745fa0578644d76134bb"}}, "hash": "b00f300509e6118381935519d5900f113f69481a8afc94112ffda6bf4a840f87", "text": "However, the community may treat these additional duties as a natural extension of women\u2019s work and may not recognize women\u2019s role.

In mixed groups, men tend to dominate over women and women have weaker voices given the prevailing gender norms. Women\u2019s groups generally created scope for building 43 solidarity among women. However, research shows that these groups also reproduce social hierarchies (Agarwal 2002; Kelkar and Nathan 2005). 7. GENDER AND COPING STRATEGIES 7.1 Gender and Natural Disasters Poor men and women are affected differently by natural disasters. Women and girls have limited access to resources and control over critical assets, thus are more vulnerable when disasters happen. More women also die in natural disasters. According to World Bank et al. (2008), women are present in higher numbers in vulnerable social groups, such as poor and the elderly. They are less prepared for disasters given restrictions on mobility. They also have less information about what to do during disasters, and their dress code may restrict their ability to swim or climb trees during cyclones, etc. All of this contributes towards a high female mortality rate. During the post disaster period, women are burdened with reproductive duties (i.e. fetching water), thus increasing women\u2019s workload. Women in most cases, because of restricted mobility cannot migrate from disaster prone areas. In case of slow onset of disasters, such as drought, land degradation and desertification, women spend extra time carrying out reproductive duties, leaving them with little spare time (BRIDGE 2008). Sometimes, girls leave school to help with the extra work burden. Responses by men and women to natural disasters are linked to their social roles and status. Women generally take the supportive role and care for the children, while men take up the leadership role. Social networks determine what strategies the households can take to mitigate the impact of disaster. Female-headed households generally lack access to these types of resources and rural poor women and men do not have savings or assets to mitigate external shocks (World Bank et al. 2008). Post disaster management may create opportunities for women to participate and access resources depending on how the land reform, skills, employment programs are designed and implemented (World Bank et al. 2008). 7.2 Gender and Migration Globally, feminization of paid work has been driven by a rise in female migration at both domestic and international levels (Kabeer 2007). The sub-regions vary in terms of internal and international migration. In regions where rigid forms of patriarchy operates, such as South Asia or the Middle East, urban and international female migration is lower compared to Southeast Asia, which allows for greater mobility of females. International migration from South Asia and Southeast Asian regions are mainly to the Middle East and other developed economies in East Asia and for a limited range of work such as domestic service, informal commerce, etc. Urban migration is higher in countries such as China and Bangladesh where export processing industries created work opportunities for women. Female migration remains poverty driven with women having less choice for taking up migration as a diversification strategy in Asia (Jolly and Reeves 2003). The change in demand for female labor and gender segregation of labor markets has created opportunities for women to migrate. This section mainly focuses on international migration since seasonal migration in rural areas and female migration to urban areas have been discussed in other sections of the paper. 44 The flow of migrant labor has added to the flexibility of the market. Migration of female domestic workers into developed countries in the West as well as Japan and Taiwan, Province of China mirrors the rise in female labor force participation in these countries (Kabeer 2007). For example, there is one foreign maid for every eight households in Singapore (Yeoh et al. 1999). However, this perhaps indicates that intra household division of labor remains unequal in affluent families living in developed countries. This also indicates a strength of ideologies in these regions that support male privilege. Migration has led to a change in family structure and a rise of transnational families (Jolly and Reeves 2005). Studies conducted in the Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries shows that migration of a daughter causes the least disruption to the family structure. Moreover, daughters are more reliable in terms of sending back their earnings compared to sons. Therefore, the migration of unmarried daughters to a major city or abroad is a strategy to increase income (Chantavich 2001). However, it is different when married women migrate. In some areas, female migration may not be socially acceptable. However, qualitative studies conducted in Bangladesh and the Philippines show that women who migrate have reported that there is an increased willingness among husbands to consider their wive\u2019s", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0f47bdf-efa9-4516-97b8-2412eb1f5930": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0f47bdf-efa9-4516-97b8-2412eb1f5930", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16a208a5cac086b40b2f9dd36167d63980692e191fb06faba47e883652b8a0ae"}}, "hash": "16a208a5cac086b40b2f9dd36167d63980692e191fb06faba47e883652b8a0ae", "text": "opinions regarding household matters (Siddiqui 2001; Oishi 2005). They also reported an increase in co-operative ventures. Some qualitative studies also found that the men were juggling both domestic duties and work and reported a new found respect for the domestic burden carried by their wives (Asis et al. 2001). However, these studies have highlighted the exceptions, since macro level analysis shows a less harmonious picture. Studies conducted on Bangladeshi female migrants (both to urban areas and abroad) revealed that they migrated to escape from social and domestic oppression in order to gain their independence (Oishi 2005). Moreover, in Gamburd\u2019s (2003) study on Sri Lanka, men reported that their masculinity (i.e., role as provider) was questioned by the family and the community. What these studies indicate is that norms around family systems, marriage and domestic division of labor are in flux. However, research also shows that women, even in loose forms of patriarchies, do not expect the domestic division of labor to change even after undertaking migration (Parrenas 2001). Closely related to the ideas around masculinity and domestic division of labor is the ideology around motherhood. Interestingly, research shows that the majority of female migrants, regardless of their country of origin, reported that they relied on other female members of their extended families or external help to care for their children (Kabeer 2007). The fathers do not feature prominently in matters related to childcare. Gamburd\u2019s study (2003) on Sri Lanka found that in in 50 per cent of the cases, the grandmothers cared for the children. What are the impacts of female migration on children? Studies conducted in the Philippines show a mixed picture. Studies carried out in 1990s showed that the children of female migrants are lagging behind in school. Research conducted during the following decade show that children of migrant mothers and similar grades kept up with other children of parents who had not migrated (Kabeer 2007). However, 45 about 35 per cent of the children reported that they found it hard to cope without their mothers, although about half of them reported that they understood the need for their mother\u2019s decision to migrate. Overall, for female migrant workers the support of extended family is vital. Despite the difficulties they have experienced in the receiving countries many reported a growth in self-confidence and autonomy. There are legal restrictions that limit female migration. According to Jolly and Reeves (2005), many countries such as Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and the Philippines have placed age limits on migration. These legal restrictions are placed to tackle trafficking and a response to the exploitative experience of female migrants in the Middle East. However, only few countries such as the Philippines and Sri Lanka, have taken steps to address gender specific aspects of migration and their impact, although their effectiveness is widely critiqued (IOM 2003; Jolly and Reeves 2003). Aside from female migration, male migration has increased. Male migration led to the feminization of the agriculture sector and has increased women\u2019s workload (Jolly and Reeves 2003). What is the impact of male migration on household structure and women? Studies show that male migration has led to a greater role for women\u2019s participation in household and farm management (Croll and Hung 1997; Siddiqui 2001). However, in rigid forms of patriarchal regions women also have to rely on extended family networks for accessing extra household resources and markets. This has led to conflicts with family members and daughters-in-law left behind (Lefevbre 1999). At other times, the families, particularly in South Asia, have adopted conservative norms around gender relations (Jolly and Reeves 2003). 8. GENDER, RURAL LIVELIHOODS AND THE INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT 8.1 Gender Impact of Liberalization Policies It is difficult to assess the gender impact of liberalization policies on rural livelihood since various social processes influence the gender dimension of rural livelihood (Jackson and Rao 2004). Moreover, liberalization is a very complex process, which influences livelihoods in different and at times contradictory ways. As a way to unpack the complexity of the issue in a manageable form, this section will focus on gender impacts in the following areas connected to liberalization policies: a) rise of corporate farming; b) increased casualization of agricultural labor; c) opportunities or constraints regarding diversification of livelihood strategies (non farm activities and migration); and d) increased vulnerability of smallholders. According to the UNRISD (2005), agricultural liberalization has contributed to the vulnerability of smallholders and added to the workload of women without providing the sought stimulus to production and technological change. It has also led to a restructured economy and changed social relations. Liberalization has increased the female presence in the agricultural sector (UNRISD", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3748fd18-4999-4933-8627-f8da12723c51": {"__data__": {"id_": "3748fd18-4999-4933-8627-f8da12723c51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bef70975d47f62e8ff9b524c3a356e8a298524011870c56efec4ac9fc02d14d"}}, "hash": "5bef70975d47f62e8ff9b524c3a356e8a298524011870c56efec4ac9fc02d14d", "text": "2005). Though overall agricultural labor has declined, except for in the Middle East, women have been slow in moving out of the agricultural sector to non-agricultural work. This is particularly true of regions where a rigid form of patriarchal system operates. Increased male migration to perform non-agricultural work in the urban sector is a key factor behind the increased female presence in agriculture. Moreover, casualization of work has led 46 to women being concentrated in low-status, vulnerable work in the informal economy. However, there is no systematic data to show the impact of liberalization on women\u2019s unpaid work (reproductive work). Liberalization has led to a development of commercial farming or corporate farming. These large-scale farms that produce high value agricultural products such as horticultural produce, are a new source of employment. These farms have highly gendered occupational systems. Moreover the gender pay gap exists. However, these farms also provide women an opportunity to diversify their income. The question is what type of strategies are women pursuing regarding these types of employment? What are the changes that are taking place? Corporate farming in the Indian states of Punjab and the Andhra Pradesh, show that this type of model has alienated the smallholders. Most of the women who are either land owners or de facto owners are smallholders. The work on these farms is seasonal, with long hours, less safe and insecure with no scope for advancement (Jackson and Rao 2004). However, this is a new alternative to women as a source of livelihood other than migration. Also women\u2019s physical mobility has increased and in certain cases given the seasonal and migrating nature of the work, there is a rise in female- headed households and greater autonomy within the households. There are very few studies on the gender impact of different diversification strategies (UNRISD 2005; BRIDGE 2008). Does diversification (i.e., taking up non-farm employment, formal employment in corporate agricultural farms, migration) offer more effective routes of out poverty? In other words, does non-farm or corporate farm income have an impact on increasing well-being? What types of opportunities are there for women for non-farm employment and commercial farm employment? Once women have engaged in non-farm employment or migrated or worked in corporate farming, are they able to invest back into the household/farms? Studies show that in rigid forms of patriarchies (South Asia and the Middle East), men benefit the most from diversification (UNRISD 2005; Jackson and Rao 2004). This is because their mobility is higher, and they have more options regarding non- farm employment in construction and services in urban areas. Women migrate to urban areas if there are large manufacturing industries. It is the younger women who mostly migrate for these jobs and have managed to exercise agency over their labor supply decisions. However, studies on South Asia show that women mostly engage in rural-rural migration (Jackson and Rao 2004; Kelkar and Nathan 2005); although in Bangladesh women migrate in significant numbers to work in the export sector. The types of work they have are not useful for investing back into the households or farm holdings (UNRISD 2005). Women\u2019s strategies remain survival driven and they save less as they earn less, which means they are make fewer investments. However, the household structure is changing given the seasonal migration for agricultural work and also migration abroad. 47 9. CONCLUSIONS 9.1 Uneven Progress and Persistent Inequalities The gender dimensions of rural livelihoods in Asia-Pacific are diverse and complex. It is difficult to draw conclusions about existing and emerging trends in this region which include: feminization of agriculture, increased participation of women in non- farm activities, internal and international migration of women, and other structural changes. These have had contradictory impacts on women\u2019s (and men\u2019s) choice and agency within the household, community, market and state levels. On the one hand, they indicate that the established patterns of gender asymmetries regarding livelihoods are changing as more women enter agriculture labor markets and take up non- agriculture based work or diversify their livelihood strategies. They also indicate that new forms of gender asymmetries have emerged, which exist along with many of the older forms of gender asymmetries (Kabeer 2007). For example, more women compared to men are taking up vulnerable forms of employment, which limits their ability to cope with economic shocks and crisis. It also means many of them are without social protection (not that poor men do not face the same conditions). However, demand for female labor for these kinds of work indicates that women face challenges that will limit their ability to negotiate in the market.

Moreover, in many cases these developments may have increased empowerment in one institutional site, for example increased bargaining power within the household. However, these place women in a disadvantageous position in other sites, such as the market, and have not led to structural changes of women\u2019s positions. What are the commonalities and differences in matters related to rural women\u2019s (and men\u2019s) livelihoods that exist among the sub-regions? Overall, women\u2019s engagement in the agriculture labor markets and informal sector, and women\u2019s labor force participation has increased in the region which indicates women have established their right to work. \u2018women\u2019s right to work\u2019 (Kabeer, 2007). Second, though women\u2019s labor force participation has increased in all of the sub- regions, the number of women in vulnerable forms of employment, i.e., self- employment, own account work, contributing family worker, has also increased. The number of women in these vulnerable forms of employment is higher compared to men for all sub-regions (Table 3.4). Third, compared with men, women\u2019s movement out of agriculture is slow (except for Southeast Asia) and involvement in formal paid work is lower (ILO 2008). In South Asia, eight in ten women work in vulnerable forms of employment (UNIFEM 2008). Typically, these forms of work are insecure, low paid and not covered by the legal framework. This indicates that the female labor absorption rate is high, but results from casualization, deregulations, male migration and demand for particular forms of flexible labor (World Bank et al. 2008; Kabeer 2007). 48 Fourth, liberalization has led to the diversification of livelihood strategies as women participate in new forms of work in commercial farms and agricultural value chains, particularly in Southeast Asia, China and India. However, these changes have also increased their vulnerabilities. These new trends in livelihoods have created new forms of gender asymmetries. More women are vulnerable to economic shocks and crises compared to men. Women, as the trend for casualization and flexible labor increases, will find themselves without social security and protection (particularly in countries where these systems do not work effectively). Moreover, as these trends continue, women may have to carry the double burden, but yet may lose the traditional support they receive from their families if they are unable to provide safety nets. The progress towards gender equality in rural livelihoods has been uneven. Who has gained or has been disadvantaged from the changes in livelihood opportunities caused by existing and emerging trends in rural livelihoods, depends on different factors. At an individual level, these include: one\u2019s stage in the life cycle, one\u2019s marital status, the particular strategy one has undertaken, and one\u2019s class, caste other social markers, etc. The complex interaction between these factors and other social and economic factors influences livelihood options, choice and ability to exercise agency. Some women, depending on the point they are at in their life cycle and the strategy they chose, such as the young female migrant workers in export processing sectors, have come out as winners (although they may face structural constraints at work). Others, such as those taking up seasonal rural migration or small farm holders producing subsistence crops and facing competition from commercial farms, have been affected adversely. Moreover, the choice of livelihood strategy may, in one institutional site, increase women\u2019s bargaining power while making them vulnerable in another site. For example, in many cases, access to microfinance and involvement in non-agricultural work has increased women\u2019s well-being and voice. However, the way these loans are provided have not in many cases challenged the gender biases that operate within the market (i.e. gender segregated work, development of market linkage). In certain cases, gender norms have proved to be persistent, such as women\u2019s engagement in income generation and different forms of work have not changed the gender division of labor and women\u2019s overall work burden has increased. Moreover, in certain cases new forms of gender asymmetries have arisen as women\u2019s numbers swell in vulnerable forms of employment because of the demand for women\u2019s flexible labor rises.

The discussion below highlights the activities that can be undertaken by different actors at different institutional sites. While labor market oriented strategies are discussed in this section here, it also focuses on how rural women\u2019s participation and voice and those willing to act for rural women within the institutional sites such as community, state, and the international policy making arenas, can be strengthened. It is difficult to prioritize policy prescriptions for a region as diverse as Asia-Pacific, particularly given the contradictory nature of the existing and emerging trends on women\u2019s choice, agency and voice. The polices and activities that need to be prioritized are: a) those that strengthen women\u2019s fall back position economically and socially; b) activities that strengthen coping abilities during crisis periods; and c) group based activities that strengthen women\u2019s collective voice and bargaining power at the different institutional sites. The state is a main actor for the activities that fall under the first two categories. However, activities related to strengthening collective voice and bargaining power can be facilitated by civil society and international actors at different levels. Bringing the State Back In The state should prioritize enacting gender sensitive laws, implementing measures to create a dynamic rural economy, providing social security, and creating social safety nets during periods of crisis. All have far reaching impact on improving rural women\u2019s livelihood opportunities and promoting gender equality. The aim of these policies and programs should be to strengthen rural women\u2019s fall-back position. This requires the state to create synergies between social protection policies with agricultural policies (Farrington et al. 2004). Aside from the stand alone social protection policies such as cash transfers, subsidized food, employment generation, insurance and contributory pensions, the state must also consider the gender impact of agricultural policies and services regarding insurance, financial services (savings, insurance); technology, input supply and marketing services. Generation of rural employment opportunities both off and on the farm is vital for creating a dynamic rural economy. Government policies must focus on creating a good investment climate through securing property rights, improving communications and transport, and removing barriers to accessing finance. Social protection for informal workers, particularly women, remains a key policy area for the state. This can be addressed through many different kinds of systems. A multilayered approach to the provision of social protection is useful, as this approach emphasizes national policies but allows for it to be supplemented by other actors. It also does not undermine community-based approaches. The provision of cross subsidies is one way to ensure social protection. For example, the Indian government provides subsidies to large insurance corporations, who offer some of the services to informal workers, including SEWA members (UNRISD 2005). 50 State partnerships with CSOs can work to the benefit of informal workers. Of course, the extension of social protection to informal workers implies additional administrative costs. In SEWA\u2019s case, the additional cost was borne by a solidarity network that was built with a large part borne by members themselves. Employer\u2019s contribution may also be another possible avenue for raising part of the cost. Rural public works, such as employment guarantee schemes, food for work and cash for work help to keep poor women afloat during lean agricultural periods. Aside from rural public works, there are other measures that may strengthen the fall-back positions of workers in the informal economy, one being legal protection. Better targeting systems need to be created to identify vulnerable households and remove them out of poverty. Rural household types vary between those with primary income from informal sectors to those with primary income from formal work. Targeting the former category for specific welfare benefits and schemes may benefit poor rural women, since the majority of female informal workers are concentrated in these types of households. Gender sensitive governance reforms are crucial for improving state responsiveness towards women in agriculture. This requires institutional and legal changes such as the decentralization of agricultural services and functions. This implies transfer of staff, resources and functions to the lowest tier of the government, which is closer to the people. Decentralization by itself does not mean it will be gender sensitive and elite capture is a key problem. This requires the creation of reserved seats for ensuring women\u2019s participation; building capacity of the state service providers to do gender analysis; and creating an incentive system that rewards workers for addressing gender needs of women.

Aside from these measures, the creation of mechanisms and forums where women are able to participate in the policy making process is also vital. Some of the existing policy analysis tools such as formulation of PRSP plans and gender responsive budgeting can be used by women\u2019s organizations and other CSOs to analyse whether and how gender issues are addressed by the state. Community driven projects created by the state for agriculture or natural resource management can create scope for women (and men in disadvantageous positions) to participate in how resources are managed at the local level. However, these projects need to be carefully designed to mitigate the class and gender (caste and other) effect on how the groups function. Studies have shown that the poorest women (and men) are excluded and sometimes women\u2019s work burden is increased and women do not participate effectively because of gender norms. This indicates that these committees have to consciously target less powerful groups and also provide women with training and other capacity development skills. The enactment of progressive laws and state programs based on these laws can provide women access to critical resources such as land. The state can allocate land through land reform, resettlement programs, leasehold programs and anti-poverty programs. However, whether a land redistribution program is effectively able to 51 address gender issues depends on how programs are implemented and how negotiations are performed with the participant populations to overcome resistance to women owning land. Negotiations on land redistribution must include women (not only household heads). The promotion of collective land rights of women can increase women\u2019s access/ownership, particularly through helping women to purchase or lease land. The extension of the legal rights framework for female agricultural and informal workers is a key step towards ensuring decent work conditions for women and men. International conventions and frameworks exist with many countries as signatories, yet national legislative frameworks may still be inadequate. Moreover, in many countries family laws need to be changed as these serve as a basis for a husband\u2019s control over his wife\u2019s labor. A key element in ensuring the rights of informal workers is to create legal provisions that allow them to benefit from collective provisions (such as equal pay for equal work). Linking Women to Markets and Getting Markets to Work for Women The activities and policies that should be prioritized in this area are: a) capacity development of rural women (and rural women\u2019s collectives/collectivities); b) provision of information, credit and access to input, produce, product markets to rural women (and women\u2019s collectives); and c) regulation. Women entrepreneurs in the Asia-Pacific own small-scale farms, thus facing high risks and low capacity for market integration. For these female smallholders and entrepreneurs, a key area is capacity development so that they are able to: a) access markets, both input and produce markets, as buyers and sellers; b) secure market information about what is in demand; and c) add value to their products. Capacity development of female entrepreneurs requires context-based skills/training programs, that not only include literacy and numeracy, but also confidence building measures and ways to access market intelligence. The use of female trainers may help in circumventing the influence of gender hierarchy and create an enabling environment. Procurement centers can be established that are community managed and decentralized for storing, assessing and trading agricultural commodities. Establishment of these types of centers can be owned and operated by women\u2019s self help groups. These centers are like depots at the village level and can localize the value chain by acting as a \u2018one stop shop\u2019. Both small scale and marginal farmers and suppliers (input suppliers, banks) do not have to deal with different producers/suppliers. It also helps to overcome the access barriers and ensure product quality and standards. Providers of rural finance must move beyond providing access, and should consider how access can enable women and men to challenge gender power relations and gender-biased structures. This implies that the providers in the rural financial market need to change their organizational structures and mechanisms for delivering credit. It requires the following: establishment of clear guidelines related to graduation procedures; the removal of gender bias in program design through the involvement of 52 gender experts and women\u2019s organizations; collection of gender disaggregated data; identification of good practices; collaboration among the various service providers; and gender audits of the organizations at the local level. For female traders, particularly micro-traders, information technology and skills training may increase their productivity and competitiveness.

Specific programs must be set up to address gender segregation in the market. Education programs that are not biased along these themes and occupational lines is a first step for increasing the range work options for women. Building Women\u2019s Voice and Acting for Women Priority activities to build women\u2019s voice are: a) creating channels and mechanisms for women\u2019s participation in formal policy spaces and at the community level; and b) establishing networks and alliances that help women to channel voice horizontally and vertically. `Building rural women\u2019s voice is a key area for promoting gender equality in various arenas related to rural livelihood. Building women\u2019s voice includes activities to open up formal policy spaces for actors who can give voice to rural women\u2019s livelihood needs. It also incorporates the creation of new forums and the opening up of spaces for rural women to participate and influence services, programs and policies. These refer to the supply side of governance. For example, the quota system in South Asia at the national and local levels has effectively brought women into formal politics and political spaces. Admittedly, male policy makers can be gender responsive and female policy makers may fail to act for women. Direct elections to reserved seats, reservation of council headship in certain constituencies for female headship, and earmarking a certain number of projects to be headed by female councilors have not only brought women into policy spaces but created scope for the elected councilor to act for rural women. Collective organization by women themselves and the creation of trade unions and networks have increased women\u2019s ability to influence livelihood issues. This is particularly effective for informal, home-based workers and small farm holders. For example, SEWA in India, a registered trade union for female small farmers and informal workers, has managed to successfully campaign, negotiate and create pressure on power holders to address the needs of informal workers and to create women\u2019s leadership. It has also created a platform for female farmers in India to raise their demands. Setting up user groups is also a popular way to incorporate women\u2019s voice into decision making regarding services and management of resources. However, they can be dominated by people in power, and actually increase the workload of women members. The creation of national and international networks facilitated by CSOs or women\u2019s organizations is useful for channeling rural women\u2019s voice at the 53 national/international policy level. CSO and networks can act as key points for accessing information and also combine different national and local schemes that are created for informal workers. For example, a SEWA-led campaign on the ILO adoption of the Convention on Home Work, was coordinated by HomeNet, an international network of home workers worldwide (UNIFEM 2008). Network and umbrella alliances created by women\u2019s organizations can create successful campaigns for the concerns and needs of female farmers and informal workers. For example, GABRIELLA, the biggest alliance of women\u2019s organizations in the Philippines, was able to run on a ticket that stressed pro-women legislation, and after winning the seats, was able place legislative proposals on benefits for Filipino women workers.19 Media can play a key role in channeling rural women\u2019s voice and highlight their livelihood concerns. Media can also act as a watchdog to monitor the implementation of state policies. They can also be effective partners in creating civil society alliances for promoting the needs of female migrants, female farmers and informal workers (also male workers). Enabling Policies, Mandates, Monitoring and Civil Society Initiatives How gender and livelihood issues are incorporated in national and international policies effects whether policies can be used to promote gender equality. National and international policies can serve as government mandates, which can be rallying points for mobilizing around women\u2019s rights or the rights of men in vulnerable positions. These can also be used for citizen\u2019s action at the local level or for creating external pressure on the state. In fact, the existence of public service charters that specify responsibilities towards women can be a powerful tool for ensuring rural poor women\u2019s (and men\u2019s) needs are addressed. While codes of conduct such as corporate social responsibility (CSR) and Ethical Trade Initiatives (ETI) help to ensure proper standards, not all of these benefit men and women equally. Capacity of local organizations to monitor implementation of the codes; ensuring coverage of informal/casual workers under the code; inclusion of gender specific issues in codes of conduct are key areas that need to be addressed.

Introduction In the Asia-Pacific region, the so-called feminization of migration started in the late 1970s when women began being employed as live-in domestic workers in the Middle East. By the mid-1990s women constituted up to 70 per cent of the migration flow to both the Middle East, and increasingly in East Asian industrializing countries such as Taiwan, Province of China, Singapore and Malaysia (UNRISD 2005).

Internal and international migrations are in fact linked in a number of ways. First is in step migration, which is when migrants choose to move first to one or two locations within their own country prior to emigration to another country. They move to these locations to fill in jobs that had been abandoned by others who have moved to other countries (IOM 2008b). Step migration has been observed, for example, in the Indian state of Kerala, where the vacuum left by skilled workers who left for Gulf countries has been filled in by migrants from neighboring states (Rajan and Zachariah 2005).

Irregular migrants may become b onded labourers to employers who threaten to expose their illegal status. Otherwise, state policies may actually encourage bonded labour of some kind. For instance, a comparative study on Lao, Burmese and Isan migrants working in shrimp farms in Surat Thani Province, Thailand, revealed that Burmese migrants more t han Isan or Lao migrants, a re bonde d t o e mployers not be cause t hey w ere irregular migrants, but because Thai immigration law penalizes employers who do not register their migrant employees (Resurreccion and Sajor 2008).

Burmese women living near the border towns of China also explore employment opportunities in these places. A recent study on a Burmese village and migrant remittances revealed the diversity of l ivelihoods that women (mothers and daughters) have taken as they migrated to Chinese border towns (Din 2006). According to Din\u2019s study (2006), a broker sold a temporary wife to a Chinese man for whom she performed domestic and sex work. She can be sold to another man after living with her earlier temporary husband for some time. A temporary wife stays in the Chinese town with her temporary husband and receives a wage from him which she u sually r emits to h er f amily in M yanmar. Many o f th e te mporary w ives a re married in Myanmar to men who are heavily drug-addicted and are, thus, unable to work for a living. The women have become the de facto breadwinners. The market for temporary wives are said to be widespread in border towns in these two countries, and has been viewed as one of the effects of China\u2019s increasing male population because 21 of its One Child Policy and cultural norms for son preference. Cases of trafficking women as temporary wives is said to be a pervasive practice as well in these places.

In 2004, more than 1,000 Russian women engaged in sex work in the Republic of Korea, many of whom entered the country with tourist visas (UN 2005). Given the largely unregulated and underground nature of the sex industry, actual numbers are difficult to ascertain and are likely higher than available estimates.

It draws attention to the flexible nature of work largely associated with female labour. About 60per cent of registered Lao workers in Thailand work in construction and agriculture, and a small portion in the fishing industries (Regional Thematic Working Group on International Migration Including Human Trafficking 2008). Records from the statistics department of Brunei Darussalam show that more migrant men than women are employed in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, however there was almost gender parity in mining and quarrying (Department of Statistics, Brunei Darussalam 2005). In t he bor der t owns of Y angian, C hina, m igrants f rom t he Democratic P eople\u2019s Republic of Korea come as male individuals, leaving wives and children behind in the North Hamgyong Province, the northernmost and one of the poorest regions in the country. The migrants tend to be highly vulnerable to exploitation and many of them work in agriculture and forestry (Smith 2005). In the late 1990s, Indonesians, many with families, migrated to the Malaysian palm oil plantations, among them in the Selangor State of Malaysia to work as plantation workers. Since migrant labour was cheaper, indigenous Malaysian female and male contract workers were eventually displaced especially since palm oil became one of the country\u2019s chief exports (Teng 2008).

Female migrants also respond to similar employment opportunities as those discussed in the previous section on transnational migration.

It is also equally noteworthy that there are more women than men up to age 29 who work outside their villages. The study discovered that these young women were employed by garment factories owned by Chinese businessmen in nearby provincial towns. In contrast f rom t he a ge o f 30 onw ards, t here i s a de ep pl unge i n t he p ercentage o f women who work as labour migrants. This seems to indicate that in view of preference for young female labour by the urban labour market, older women have then become the farm mainstays in their villages. The gender and age differentials in non-farm employment indicate that new meanings regarding the position of women as farmers and factory workers are being re-worked along age and life cycle parameters.

W hile f emale migrants may work in key revenue-generating industries that enable them access to better incomes, social experiences of living in the city may place them at greater risk.

Agriculture thus provides a platform for semi-skilled female migrants to enter urban labour markets such as in the growing garment industry.

Labour c onditions of m igrant w omen i n t he i nformal e conomy \u2014 whether in domestic work or in underground jobs ungoverned by a legal contract \u2014 are particularly adverse since they do not have any legal protection either as a migrant or as a worker (Gills 2002).

In other places, t hey work as waste p ickers an d r ecyclers an d s mall t ransport o perators (Resurreccion and Van Khanh 2007; Ofreneo 2008) Lee (2007) points out that rural women dominate rural-urban migration in Cambodia, many of whom work as hairdressers, petrol and cigarette sellers, manicurists, shop assistants, a nd f ruit v endors. T here a re an e stimated 4,000 be er p romotion girls i n Cambodia, most falling between 20-29 years old. They work in beer gardens, karaoke bars, ni ghtclubs a nd s oup s hops.

Since they work on a commission-basis earning a basic salary of US$ 50 per month, most usually end up s elling beer at all costs even if it means having to engage in sex work. Rural women from the Red River Delta working in the city of Hanoi as waste pickers live in crowded hostels, where they sleep on floor mats and where it is unbearably hot and dusty during the summer and very cold in the winter. They live in the city for eight months yearly and return to Nam Dinh Province during the peak labour periods of rice planting and harvesting.

Waste picking is considered an exclusively feminine job in Viet Nam.

Additionally, while the macro statistical projections present a view that remittances can potentially contribute to short-term poverty alleviation or long-term development, a major concern is that the poorest people from the poorest countries are generally unable to migrate and that they profit least from remittances (Francis 2002; UNFPA 2006). With the exception of Tonga, the largest remittance- receiving countries are middle-income countries like India, China, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. Remittances are highly differentiated and selective in terms of who the remitter is and the capacity to remit, and will h ave differentiated and n on-uniform impacts on migrant-sending communities, households and overall development. As de Haas (2005) emphasizes, the direct benefits of remittances do not tend to flow to the poorest m embers of c ommunities or to t he p oorest c ountries, t hus challenging remittances as the \u2018new development mantra.\u2019 In the case of Asia, countries classified as M iddle-Income co untries ar e t he l argest s ending co untries i n t he r egion (i.e., Philippines, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Indonesia)11, and a re also th e ma jor r ecipients o f mi grant remittances compared with Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Piper (2005) makes a similar point as she observes that destination countries often create stratified patterns of migration, where differential routes of entry may favour more highly educated and highly skilled migrants rather (Ibid). 11 All are Middle Income countries. Nepal also has a huge emigrant population, but is considered one of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). 42 that t hose from poorer, disadvantaged groups i n s ending countries.

This is the same for Burmese young female migrants in Thailand who send money for education and to boost hometown livelihoods, and who express obligation towards parents and siblings ( UNESCAP 20 06). W alton-Roberts ( 2004) i n he r s tudy on India i ndicates that female migrant remittances were used largely for the personal provision of care whereas male migrant remittances were used more for infrastructural development of care institutions.

A dditionally, temporary, s killed 43 and semi-skilled migrants tend to remit more than permanent, highly skilled migrants whose num bers a re a lso s maller. S tudies c onducted b y INSTRAW ( 2008) f urther show that there is greater effort to remit on t he part of women since their wages are relatively smaller in destination countries. As a result, they are not able to improve their quality of life in destination countries, or invest in their own career advancement through education, but instead may be locked in the domestic and care-giving sector. The INSTRAW ( 2008) c ases a lso de monstrated t hat i n general, t he i ncreased importance of women as providers through remittances has enhanced their status in households a nd c ommunities. H owever, i t w as poi nted out t hat s ocial perceptions were ambivalent: ranging from valuing the contributions of migrant women to well- being to blaming them for child and family abandonment. One other study noted that the ambivalence o f n ewly acquired status lay in the r emitter herself. Older women who remitted their earnings home tended to feel empowered since they felt that they assumed the traditional male breadwinner role. Remittances from younger women, on the ot her ha nd, were f ound t o i ntensify generational a nd gender pow er r elations within clans (Agunias 2006). Younger female migrants a re often ex pected to remit regularly a nd di rectly t o t heir pa rents a nd t hey often l ack t he f reedoms t hat m ale migrant relatives and s iblings e njoy. Y ounger migrant w omen w ith a subordinate position in patriarchal families are generally less likely to control the allocation and spending of their remittance earnings than older women migrating from more equal gender positions in origin households (Sorensen 2007). Remittances f rom in ternal a nd in ternational migration ma y also d iffer.

Much has yet to be known about the dynamics of control over migrant women\u2019s remitted earnings. The growing global and development discourse on migrant remittances \u2013 and their management and investment \u2013 tends to lose sight of migrants as social individuals and may instrumentalize them as \u2018pawns of development\u2019 without concern for or action on their well-being or human rights in their host societies (Olsen 2008) and eventually upon return to their ho me societies.

While remittances are an important source of improved livelihoods, health care and education of c hildren o f l eft b ehind f amilies, a na rrow f ocus on t heir productive effects may blur concerns over the welfare and rights of migrant women and men in destination places, replace the state\u2019s welfare and social security obligations, as well as sidestep changing and unequal relations among members of receiving households both as a result of migration and remittances. IV. Migration Policies and their Gender Implications Summing up the Issues Facing Migrant Women The preceding s ections unde rscored t he i ncreasingly feminized na ture of m igration through evidence of the growing numbers of women migrating for work in countries other than their own, or moving to cities from the countryside to respond to labour market needs for specific types of female labour. Moreover, the preceding sections draw attention to the gendered nature of migration where female migrants are often subjected to gender-specific forms of exploitation, isolation and discrimination once they reach their places of destination. This is however not to preclude the fact that female migrants have benefited from their migration, although much of the literature suggests t hat m igration i s a c ontradictory e xperience f raught w ith bot h r isks a nd 45 opportunity. Female migrants face many challenges from the moment that they decide to make the move. For instance, female migrants may fall prey to unscrupulous, sometimes illegal, recruiters w ho c harge e xorbitant r ecruitment f ees a nd do not obs erve r egulatory mechanisms for the secure movement and occupational placement of migrants. Once in their destination places, female migrants may face late, insufficient or total lack of payment of agreed wages, non-fulfillment of airfare reimbursements and harassment to actual abuse of women workers by employers especially since they are isolated and vulnerable i n t hese n ew pl aces. O ther pr oblems a lso i nclude t he l ack of s ocial protection, denial of collective bargaining and organization, denial of human rights, discrimination, sexual harassment, xenophobia and general social exclusion. Extreme cases of female m igrant vul nerability l ead t o t rafficking, e nslavement a nd bonde d labour. The most seriously vulnerable among migrants are usually female: domestic workers an d en tertainers, t rafficked pe rsons a nd i rregular m igrant w orkers (Wickramasekera 2002). Additionally, as return migrants, women face challenges as they re-integrate in their home communities where resilient gender norms continue to apply. Migrant remitters are also not fully in control of their remitted earnings once received, especially if they are stationed overseas or in another country. To mitigate and ad dress p ossible ad verse effects ex perienced es pecially b y low s killed f emale migrants, policies in both sending and receiving countries require gender-responsive measures.

Consensus is wide that rural migrants tend to benefit economically from their move to urban areas. Policy makers recognize this fact but fear that migration may exacerbate housing conditions, infrastructure and services and place further pressure on the urban economy, thus bloating the urban informal sector and increasing poverty.

This pol icy environment i s how ever be ing i ncreasingly challenged b y a dvocacy groups, civil actions and multilateral bodies. There have been some bright spots in the international policy horizon with respect to female migrants\u2019 welfare and social protection. Much however has yet to be done to make governments aware that female migrants\u2019 well-being can contribute both to the goals of de velopment b oth i n s ending a nd r eceiving c ountries, a nd t o t heir ow n empowerment \u2013 which should n ot be considered m utually exclusive, but opt imally beneficial.

However, to date, onl y sending countries like S ri Lanka and the Philippines in the Asian regions have ratified the Convention13. Host countries limit the recognition and application of hum an rights t o t heir c itizens onl y, a nd di stinguish be tween documented and undocumented (irregular) migrants, thus the reluctance to ratify the convention. The Convention acknowledges both male and female migrants, however it does not address gender-specific issues. Truong (1996) notes that the Convention does not recognize women migrants in their role as reproductive workers in the care- taking economy. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) provides liberalization of trade in services and offers a multilateral platform for negotiations designed to enable the movement of service providers. A major shortcoming of this platform is that it does not provide universal criteria for the admission of specific types of service providers and their access to labour markets. The Agreement does not define which t ypes of service providers or the sectoral coverage of country commitments (IOM 2008b). The Global Forum in Migration and Development (GFMD) appears to be a workable platform where representatives from both sending and origin countries can come to the table for straightforward and no-holds barred, yet non-binding and non-normative, discussions. T he r ecently concluded G FMD m eeting i n M anila l ast O ctober 2008 drew attention to the enormous benefits that migration can bring. There were open discussions on t he rights of migrants and the need to create enabling environments that would optimize migrants\u2019 contributions to development. Migration management schemes by receiving countries were also presented and recommendations for follow up actions will document more good practices on migrant protection and explore the potential of more flexible and liberal policies for regular and circulatory migration (Global F orum on M igration a nd D evelopment 2008) . T here w as no s eparate roundtable discussion or side event that discussed the specific nature and conditions of female migrant workers. 13 As of September 2008, only 39 out of 191 countries have ratified the Convention (IOM, 2008b) 58 There is some recognition that apart from non-binding forums such as the GFMD, regional and bi lateral cooperation could s erve as m ore workable p athways t owards more pr otection of m igrant w orkers.

A case in point is the ASEAN, a sub-regional body that has signed a Declaration on the Protection of Migrant Workers in January 2007 dur ing the 12th ASEAN Summit.

They should also \u2018provide migrant workers, who may be victims of discrimination, abuse, exploitation, violence, with adequate access to the legal and judicial system of the receiving state (Paragraph 9). At the same time, the Declaration is explicit about its adverse position vis-\u00e0-vis irregular m igrants: \u201c Nothing in th e p resent D eclaration s hall b e in terpreted as implying regularization of the situation of migrant workers who are undocumented\u201d (Paragraph 4 ).

This paper explores the gender dimensions of asset ownership. It examines the multitude of inheritance systems and legal provisions existing in the Asia-Pacific region with special reference to the challenges faced by women. The efforts taken throughout the region to ensure equitable rights for women over land, property and resources have also been studied. The paper concludes with policy recommendations for ensuring gender equitable rights over assets. The authors underscore the need for building up empirical information and statistical data on individual ownership of assets to enable evidence-based advocacy for requisite policy changes. Key words: asset ownership, human development, gender inequalities The views expressed in this publication are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the United Nations, including UNDP, or the UN Member States. This paper was commissioned by the Human Development Report Unit as a technical background paper to inform the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report, \u201cPower, Voice and Rights\u201d. The data may differ from that finally presented in Asia-Pacific Human Development Report. Readers may contact the author directly for any clarifications, queries on data, inferences, and conclusions or to engage in discussion.

command over assets: Addressing gender inequalities 1. INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT Women\u2019s command over assets is widely recognized as a key element for gender equity and empowerment. Improvements in welfare, productivity, equality, and bargaining power not just within the household, but also in their communities and other public arenas are associated with the potential that women\u2019s command over assets has for wealth accumulation, access to human capital, improvements in food security (and thereby health and nutritional status), reduction in the incidence of domestic violence and generational transfers (intra- as well as inter-) through myriad routes (Agarwal 1996; 1997; Quisumbing 2003; Deere and Doss 2006; World Bank 2001a). Command over assets can be acquired through inheritance, succession, or acquisition (including purchase, gift, exchange or accumulation). However, the State, family, community and the market play a great role in women\u2019s ability to gain command over assets. Customary and/or family laws and marriage-related practices affect women\u2019s property rights wherein these overlap with civil laws, as in many countries of South Asia and Africa. Other approaches like utilization of social capital (group membership and networks as in self-help groups and microfinance) and enterprise ownerships, which may involve ownership or use of buildings, tools, equipment, and so on, are also now gaining recognition as far as women\u2019s command over assets is concerned. Unequal command over assets is one of the major forms of gender inequalities across the world. Only an estimated 1 to 2 per cent of all titled land is owned by women (USAID 2003, cited in UN-Habitat 2006). The World Bank report on Engendering Development (2001b), which recognizes gender equality as a core development issue, highlights that \u201cin no region of the developing world are women equal to men in legal, social and economic rights. Gender gaps are widespread in access to and control of resources, in economic opportunities, in power and political voice\u201d (World Bank 2001b:1). The Asia-Pacific region is vast and comprises four major sub-divisions, including the North and South East Asia, the Pacific, and South and West Asia1. The countries in this region have a wide range of policies, statutes and protocols that affect women\u2019s command over assets, land, housing, livestock, and other physical and financial capital. The historical, political, legal, economic and socio-cultural and religious differences prevalent among these countries have led to widespread variations in asset ownership and control among women of this region. The inequalities in inheritance regimes and legal provisions constrain, if not debar, women\u2019s ownership and, very 1 North East Asia consists of Cambodia, China, Japan, Hong Kong, China (SAR), Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, Lao Peoples\u2019 Democratic Republic (PDR), Macao, China (SAR), Mongolia and Viet Nam; while South East Asia includes Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Timor-Leste.

Legal provisions are necessary but not sufficient to ensure women\u2019s ownership or user rights on the basis of inheritance systems under their control. These may be easily lost or foregone unless women are able to exercise their power, voice and agency. Development of human capabilities, in terms of education, health, information, participation or security, is a precursor to women\u2019s empowerment and agency. The command over human capital (education, health, information, skill and training, for instance) becomes central to narrowing the gender asset gaps and thereby ensuring gender equality. In the less developed countries of the Asia-Pacific region, wide gender gap exists in human development indicators, be it in the sphere of literacy, health and nutritional status, wages and earnings, or political participation and representation. While adequate information and research are available on these dimensions, relatively little is known about gender gaps in wealth or assets. Doss et al. (2008) have emphasized in their work the need to examine and gather more on gender asset gaps, given the realization that household and individual welfare are not necessarily the same. Since the gender distribution of assets is likely to be different in myriad ways\u2014forms of assets, significance assigned to these and the uses that they are put to\u2014the implications of women\u2019s command over assets for equity, efficiency, productivity and empowerment also accordingly differ (Deere and Doss 2006). Although little evidence is available on whether the decisions of men and women differ in the event of a trauma or crisis, given their asset or wealth position, some aspects on women\u2019s well-being have been widely recognized. Women\u2019s ownership of assets is likely to prevent them from falling into poverty and destitution, lead to better outcomes for their children, or result in better outcomes in case of widowhood, divorce, separation or in violent situations (Deere and Doss 2006). Unfortunately, very few studies examine the gender dimensions of asset ownership. This is predominantly due to utter lack of empirical information and statistical data on individual ownership of assets2. However, there is an urgent need for this, as existing limited information reveals that women in many countries are far less likely to have ownership or control over productive assets, as compared to men. Further, they may not receive the benefits of the assets held by men, even when they live in the same household (Deere and Doss 2006). The use of gender asset gap as a measure to track progress towards Millennium Development Goal (MDG)-3 of gender equality and empowerment is proposed as a powerful indicator by Doss et al. 2008. \u201cBesides being a measure of opportunities (i.e., through the ability to generate income or additional wealth) or outcomes (net wealth), ownership of assets is critically important to women\u2019s bargaining power and hence their economic empowerment.\u201d (Doss et al. 2008:3). It may be emphasized 2 For an excellent guide to collecting such data, see Doss et al. 2008. 8 here that women\u2019s entitlement to productive assets is not just a legal or policy matter, but essentially a question of social transformation of gender relations and social institutions. To facilitate gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment through improved command over assets, various processes of formalization, land titling, state-supported enterprise development, community participation, formation of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and provision of micro-credit need to be strategically planned and promoted. Some of these steps (such as the shift from communal land tenure to individualized rights or even from matrilineal inheritance regimes to a bilateral system of inheritance) have turned into processes that alienate women from the traditional rights that they had over land and property. In other instances, Quisumbing et al. (2001) illustrate how inheritance systems are evolving into more egalitarian systems (as in parts of South East Asia). Arguments for independent rights to assets for women are discussed in the next subsection. 1.1 Arguments for Women\u2019s Independent Rights to Assets This sub-section provides a brief discussion on the definition of assets, and those assets considered in this paper to eventually illustrate the routes through which gender biases creep in and disparities are generated, especially in the context of Asia-Pacific countries.

Thus, assets include real or physical assets such as land, housing, livestock, businesses, equipment, jewellery and consumer durables as well as financial assets such as cash accounts of various kinds, stocks, bonds, trusts and public and private pensions. Assets may represent a store of value, have current use value or provide services (as in the instance of home ownership), so as to facilitate their conversion into cash, or be a source of generating financial incomes. In the context of women\u2019s command over assets being a key element for their empowerment, an alternative categorization of assets include human capital (education, information, health and nutritional status), natural capital (property rights to land, water, and other natural resources, including forests and common property resources), financial capital (savings, credit and insurance), physical capital (buildings, tools, equipment), social capital (group memberships and social networks), and political capital (influence in governance processes) [adopted from Quisumbing and Meinzen-Dick 20093 and Rao 2006]. 3 Commentary on strengthening women\u2019s assets, www.ifpri.org, 2009. 9 Different forms of assets reveal the nature of gender gaps when women\u2019s command over these resources is examined. Women\u2019s ownership of land is quite low even in countries where legal provisions assign equal rights to women and men. Land ownership distribution across women and men shows substantial gaps even in the countries of Latin America and Africa, as examined by Deere and Doss 2006. Among natural capital, women also resort to the use of common property resources, forests and water bodies for their sustenance and livelihood, often more than men within the same communities. This excludes indigenous people, wherein both men and women depend on natural resources tremendously. Often, women tend to depend on resources owned by the state or by men, which may result in sub-optimal production or output scenarios due to their lack of ownership and control over the resources. Women depend to a great extent on animal husbandry, but their ownership is typically restricted to small ruminants and relatively low value assets as compared to men. For example, in rural areas, while men own drought and milch animals, women own small cattle, pigs, poultry, and so on. Even if women own milch cattles, these are generally in smaller numbers as compared to men. In some cases, women receive these animals as gifts in marriage. In India, for instance, the practice of dowry involves giving gifts to women in marriage, which may include assets like land, livestock, jewellery, sewing machine, vehicle, refrigerator, television, furniture, utensils, and many consumer durables apart from cash. Although it is meant to be the property of the bride, this is often left ambiguous and not clarified through formal documentation. While it may still serve as security for some women in the matrimonial household, there are instances of women having no control over such assets. In any case, ownership of the gifts received as dowry is not a right of the women, but is subject to inter-personal relations and family considerations, even resulting in dowry-related violence and deaths. Hence gifts received in the form of dowry constitute a different set of assets. Lack of data on assets gifted in marriage or for that matter those given subsequently by the parents to the daughter or her marital household constrain any systematic enquiry on the possible impact that these may have on gender asset gaps or the bargaining power of women in different spheres. Similarly, deposits and other financial resources remain beyond systematic coverage due to the absence of reliable information. Ownership and control over assets provide direct and indirect benefits to individuals and households. For instance, under land and housing, the benefits may accrue through generation of rent, provision of a source of financial income, increase in value, and the use of these assets as collateral to secure credit. They serve as a buffer during emergencies and may be used as collateral, pawned or sold. They can also be passed on to future generations (Doss et al. 2008:1-2). In economies that are urbanizing or rapidly changing towards non-farm employment opportunities, assets in the form of human capital may be more valuable forms of investments than agricultural land. Command over resources - physical and financial - enhances women\u2019s capabilities as well as her potential to participate in various income-earning ventures and businesses, thereby narrowing the gender asset gaps. 10 While every form of capital is critical in defining women\u2019s command over assets, only some assets are considered in this paper.

The approaches that help women wield and accumulate financial and social capital\u2014 microfinance, SHG formation and enterprise ownership (large, small and micro)\u2014are discussed to illustrate how women improve their bargaining power, overcome traditional inhibitions and enhance their potential to gain command over assets in the process4. The various arguments proffered in the literature for ensuring women\u2019s command over resources and for narrowing the gender asset gaps are discussed in the next section. 1.1.2 Arguments for Women\u2019s Command over Assets Women\u2019s independent command over assets has been based on the three major arguments of welfare, efficiency, and equality and empowerment (see Agarwal 1996; Deere and Doss 2006; Alsop et al. 2006). The linkages of rights over assets for enhancing capability and overall gender development as well as the use of ownership and control as an instrument of poverty alleviation are alternative ways of emphasizing the necessity for women\u2019s independent command over assets (World Bank 2001b; Moser 1998). The lower status of women in many of the countries in the region is linked to women\u2019s inadequate command over assets, which translates into systematically lower access to community governance, health and education facilities as well as less than optimal participation in economic decision-making (Elson 1991; Kelkar 2005). Ownership and access to resources are equally effective for reducing the vulnerability and dependence levels of women. The social policies of many countries have shifted emphasis from income and consumption to directly addressing the critical role played by assets and capabilities in improving both individual and household socio-economic well-being and associated poverty reduction. The asset-based welfare policy developed by Sherraden (1991) is based on two premises. First, the poor can save and accumulate assets, and second, assets have positive social, psychological and civic effects independent of the effects on income. Arguing for a policy shift from income to assets, Sherraden (1991) highlighted that income only maintains consumption, but assets change the way people think and interact with the world. With assets, people begin to think for the long-term and to pursue long-term goals. A World Bank report on poverty (World Bank 2001a) noted that empowerment was directly linked to the expansion of assets. Empowerment is thus the outcome rather than the means of poverty reduction (Alsop et al. 2006). The new poverty debate indicates that the vulnerability of people is closely associated with asset ownership. The more assets people have, the less vulnerable they are, and the 4 Although human capital is an integral dimension and forms the basis for women\u2019s command over other forms of capital/assets, it is not being separately examined in depth here. Similarly, women\u2019s labour as an input which helps improve their command over assets of various forms is another dimension that is not directly dealt with in this paper. Even ownership of livestock and women\u2019s involvement in animal husbandry is not discussed here. Education and employment form the focus of two different technical background papers. 11 greater the erosion of people\u2019s assets, the greater is their vulnerability and associated insecurity (Moser 1998). While this is applicable for all persons, women\u2019s command over assets is critical for gender equity and empowerment. Another dimension that assumes importance for women\u2019s command over assets pertains to intra-household relationships and bargaining power. The decision-making power of women is linked to their bargaining strength, which is backed by the command they have over assets (Agarwal 1996). The uniqueness of the bargaining model lies in its gender-differentiated approach in dealing with intra-household interactions. The model emphasizes the welfare, efficiency and equity implications that tend to differ by gender in the household allocation of resources. These have been extended here to indicate how market, community and state interactions can also benefit from the asset position of women. A person\u2019s bargaining strength within the family depends on his/her ownership of and control over assets, access to employment and other means of earning an income, support from NGOs, support from the state, social perceptions about needs, contributions and other determinants of deservedness, as also social norms (Agarwal 1996; Quisumbing 2003). Perceptions about one\u2019s contribution depend on the extent of visibility of one\u2019s work.

The various factors that come under the domain of bargaining include gender gap in skills, information and education, barriers to entry into trade unions and other institutions, as also a woman\u2019s household property status, all of which affect women\u2019s access to markets. The dominance of patriarchal relations in the market sphere, which extend to credit access, can also adversely affect the efforts of women to improve their relative bargaining strength that is so critical within competitive environs. However, the formation of SHGs, based on the understanding that women work better in groups and can withstand risks by sharing the repercussions, draws on socio-cultural understanding and values. Women have the least bargaining power among all individuals, vis-\u00e0-vis the community due to their exclusion from the sphere of public decision-making, weak intra-household bargaining power, as also a lack of kin support that men have within their villages after marriage. Gender-progressive coalitions are a better means of enhancing women\u2019s bargaining power within the community. The state can itself be seen as an arena of cooperation and conflict, which takes place at multiple levels. For example, though the state may arrive at a consensus for passing gender-progressive laws and policies, it may still face resistance from the local bureaucracy. Again, some departments may follow gender-progressive policies within an overall gender-retrogressive state structure and development framework. In this process of contestation, an individual\u2019s bargaining 12 strength, especially that of women, depends upon whether they are functioning as individuals or as a group, size of the group, their ability to gain support from the media, stance of the opposition parties, and also the extent to which the state is democratic. In order to ensure the protection of women\u2019s entitlements, their rights need to be enforced. Where customary and statutory rights are not consistent, the enforcement of women\u2019s rights does not occur automatically. In spite of the implementation of legal reforms, what matters is how these laws are locally interpreted and implemented. The evolution of local customs can occur in response to changing economic incentives. Inasmuch as the command over assets aids the process of wealth accumulation, it generates social and economic advantages for current and future generations through bequeath gifts and inheritance (Quisumbing 2003) 1.1.3 Rationale for Closing Gender Asset Gaps The need to ascertain the presence and extent of gender asset gaps, in the absence of statistical information for systematically studying its impact in order to aid policy formulation and programme implementation, has been gaining currency in recent times (Doss et al. 2008). Inequalities in resource distribution between men and women have both economic and social consequences, which may exhibit specific cultural variations in the way it manifests itself in different countries (Quisumbing 2003). For instance, women tend to own jewellery (especially in Asia), which is an important and relatively liquid means of wealth accumulation, while men are more likely to own transport vehicles. A burgeoning literature shows that household welfare is not equivalent to the welfare of the individuals within it (Haddad and Kanbur 1991; Haddad et al. 1997; Sen 1990). Worldwide patterns of wealth ownership by gender suggest that women face greater constraints than men in accumulating and keeping assets. In addition, women may not receive the benefits of assets held by men, even when they live in the same household (Deere and Doss 2006). The rejection of the unitary model of household behaviour, which considers households as groups of individuals that have the same preferences and pool in all their resources to attain common goals, re-emphasizes the need for women\u2019s individual command over resources on many counts associated with the collective model. Quisumbing and Maluccio (2003) find the collective model as an alternative that allows for differences of opinion regarding economic decisions among household members. Greater individualization of inheritance rights serves as an incentive for improvements as a consequence of secure land and property rights. However, the consequences that this has on gender equity need to be evaluated. While shifts from communal land tenure to individualized rights tend to erode women\u2019s rights, some studies highlight how women with command over resources can produce results at equally efficient levels as that of men, especially if they have access to inputs, information and technology (de Brauw et al. 2008; Gwako 2002). In addition, the command that women have over resources may have implications for productivity and even well-being when intra-generational or inter-vivos transfers are accounted 13 for. The promotion of inheritance systems, which reward differential work efforts by men and women has been noted in some parts", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd264f47-834e-4dd1-b950-903adf76a41f": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd264f47-834e-4dd1-b950-903adf76a41f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a0a1ed849d74afab54e4593634a9585a1e859d28abf06f96e96b48df34507d83"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d622bc1-76b6-4a45-8ce9-2f264b083a67", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "01a8fba854243f37f52c3b0393eb817999c931c0476d392c82eba3a3cd24bb38"}}, "hash": "9b58c8f501d338a71b8e396d00c29d259b982b3a009182b67420ec35b2478e4f", "text": "of South East Asia by Quisumbing et al. (2001), and Quisumbing (2003). They arrive at the conclusion that individualization of land tenure institutions has contributed to both increased efficiency and equity in inter-generational transfers. Apart from the equity and well-being arguments, it has also been noted in the literature that men and women use their wealth in different ways. Studies by Quisumbing and Maluccio (2003) have shown that household expenditures differ depending on the assets brought to marriage by each spouse and that the current asset distribution by gender affects household expenditure patterns on food, health, education and household services. Quisumbing and Maluccio\u2019s (2003) analysis on assets brought to marriage in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Ethiopia, and South Africa, proved that husbands brought greater wealth to marriage than wives. These differences were substantial, and the gender inequalities tended to persist over the lifecycle. The independent rights and earnings of women are seen as benefiting the food and nutritional statuses of the household and children, as also the education of the next generation, especially girls, and leading to a reduction in their vulnerability to trauma and violence. Ownership and command over resources have implications for poverty alleviation, and given the fact that there is a feminization of poverty, eliminating or reducing the gaps in the asset position of women as compared to that of men can be very beneficial. Asset ownership influences the \u201cfallback\u201d position of each spouse in negotiations over key household and family decisions, and hence the exit options available to each (Quisumbing and Hallman 2006; Doss 1996). Surveys from South Asia have noted that women who owned land had greater say in household decision-making than women without land (Mason 1998; Allendorf 2007; Agarwal 1998; 2002). In Colombia, Friedemann-Sanchez (2006) found that women use property and social assets to negotiate for the right to work, control their own income, move freely, and live without spousal violence. In-depth research conducted in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and South Africa shows that, though women bring far fewer assets to marriage, these assets play a significant role in household decision-making, particularly regarding the allocation of household expenditures to food, education, health, and children\u2019s clothing. In all these countries, assets in the hands of women increased the share that the household spent on education. Women\u2019s asset ownership may increase the anthropometric status of children (Duflo 2000) and the incidence of prenatal care (Beegle et al. 2001) and reduce domestic violence (Panda and Agarwal 2005; Friedemann-S\u00e1nchez 2006). Asset ownership is thus related not only to well-being but also to women\u2019s empowerment. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) study indicates that women who have greater bargaining power within the household\u2014owing to more assets brought to marriage\u2014are better able to invest in social capital and to join groups and networks, which allows them to learn about new agricultural techniques, obtain credit, and develop social support systems (Quisumbing and Dick 2009). Studies from Bangladesh, for example, find that their participation in credit programmes lead to women assuming a greater role in household decision-making, 14 and having greater access to financial and economic resources, greater social networks, greater bargaining power vis-\u00e0-vis their husbands, and greater freedom of mobility. Female credit also tended to generally increase spousal communication about family planning and parenting concerns. Extensive evidence also proves that closing the gap in productive resources like land held by men and women has the potential to increase agricultural productivity by 10 to 20 per cent (Quisumbing and Dick 2009). Therefore, studies that highlight the presence of gender asset gaps, identify sources from which these arise as the starting points for bridging the gaps through appropriate policy planning and interventions. This is undertaken in the second and third sections of this paper, after providing a socio-economic profile of women in the Asia-Pacific region. 1.2 Socio-economic Status of Women in the Asia-Pacific Region The Asia-Pacific region is inhabited by one-half of the world\u2019s population as a consequence of the two most populated countries of the world (India and China) under it.

A large segment of the region is rural, given the lower urbanization levels in the two most populated countries of China and India. The region, therefore, depends critically on agriculture and primary production, most of which necessitate ownership or access to natural resources. Women are involved in these activities, especially in the rural areas, but also in many an urban context, where informal economies provide livelihood options to them. Access to land and village commons or common property resources are extremely critical for many rural households and the women within them. These also become important for the indigenous people, especially the islanders who face problems related to degrees of isolation, size of the land available, resource endowments, and cultural and economic development. Among the different regions of the world, the Asia-Pacific region displays the lowest percentage of agricultural holdings headed by women as shown in Figure 1. Latin America and Africa are relatively better placed in this regard due to some reforms and mobilizations that have taken place around the issue of land ownership by women in the countries in these regions. Women as a collective group/segment are not homogeneous. This is also the case with the countries of the Asia-Pacific region, which is quite heterogeneous. Many of the Pacific Island countries are inhabited by indigenous people, who follow their own 15 customary laws, especially with regard to land ownership and inheritance practices. While some of the Asia-Pacific countries follow matrilineal inheritance practices with many cultural variations, others follow the mainstream gender-biased, patrilineal system, wherein women are often deprived of equitable rights to land and property. It may, however, be highlighted that even under matrilineal systems, though women seem to be relatively better off, they are not always recipients of equitable access to the land they own. Even if women have access to use land and other productive resources/assets, they often have limited control over these assets, in terms of major decisions with regard to their purchase, sale, mortgaging, pawning or gifting. It is this lack of control together with poor knowledge/information regarding their rights and ownership of resources, which works against them. Figure 1: Percentage of Agricultural Holdings Headed by Women 0 5 10 15 20 25 Africa Asia/Pacific Europe Latin America Source: FAOSTAT cited in FAO 2004. There are also restrictions to women\u2019s independent handling of savings and undertaking investments since they are considered too inept or ill-informed to take the correct decisions. The greater share of property ownership by men enables them to provide collateral for larger loans, whereas women\u2019s access to credit is limited to smaller loans. The relatively lower credibility assigned to women in the context of financial assets stems from the patriarchal biases and their lower human capital endowments, though experiences of microcredit institutions have shown them to be better clients in all respects. These disparities and gender gaps prevalent in basic human development attributes must be addressed and eliminated in order to improve the initial conditions of women in many countries of the Asia-Pacific region. In spite of the relatively better human development scenario of the region as a whole, in quite a few highly developed countries, the gender imbalances and differences continue to persist (UNDP 2005). These disparities are more glaring in the spheres influenced by customary and cultural practices, which are difficult to quantify and measure, but are also prevalent in the relatively easy-to-quantify indicators of gender development. One of the areas wherein information is poor, in fact, almost non-existent, pertains to women\u2019s command over assets. This is partly due to the absence of proper reportage and recording mechanisms and partly due to low importance attributed to the collation 16 and collection of statistical information on these aspects. Only in few countries is some information on bank accounts and property in the name of women available. Information on SHG membership or on women beneficiaries who have been provided loans may be available to some extent. A comparative profile for countries across the region is severely lacking, if not completely absent, thereby limiting the possibility of any statistical evaluation or of accounts being provided here.

The global Human Development Report (HDR) provides some information on the quantitative indicators, which is presented here for the Asia-Pacific countries. In 2008, nine countries of the Asia-Pacific region were categorized as having high human development level, three each from South East Asia, North East Asia, and the Pacific (see Table 1.2.1). In the Pacific, apart from Australia and New Zealand, the third country is Tonga which is the only sovereign monarchy consisting of 48 inhabited islands, with a high literacy level and a large segment of its population working in Australia and New Zealand. Despite their high level of human development, the countries of North East and South East Asia nevertheless display substantial disparities across urban-rural locations and across gender. All the other countries of Asia and the Pacific region, which have been included in the analysis for calculation of the Human Development Index (HDI) in the global UNDP report fall within medium levels of development (see Table 1.2.2). Even Timor-Leste and Pakistan, which exhibited a low level of HDI in 2004, have subsequently shown some improvement. Another recent addition to the quantification on gender gaps is available in terms of the Gender Gap Report of the World Economic Forum (Hausmann et al. 2008). This report has been calculating a gender gap index based on a set of 4 sub-indices using ratios of 14 indicators. An important dimension on the basis of which the report calculates one of the sub-indices relates to economic participation and opportunity. The index on economic participation and opportunity is based on female-to-male ratios of labour force participation; wage equality for similar work; female-earned 17 income; female legislators, senior officials and managers; and female professional and technical workers. The other sub-indices relate to educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. The last indicator uses three ratios of women with seats in Parliament, at the ministerial level, and the number of years that a female leader has been the head of state or government over the last 50 years. The values of these sub-indices for the 21 Asia-Pacific countries included here and their ranks are provided in Table 1.2.3.

Source: Hausmann et al. 2008. The countries of the Asia-Pacific region, which have reported improvements over time in the GGI-based ranks, are Mongolia, Bangladesh, China, Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives. A look at the sub-indices, especially in terms of the economic participation and opportunity (EPO) ranks, is relevant for reflecting the economic equity dimensions. The countries reporting better scores and thereby lower ranks are New Zealand, the Philippines, Mongolia, Australia, Viet Nam and Thailand. They are followed by China, Cambodia and Singapore (see Table 1.2.3). 19 Countries with insignificant gaps in educational attainments are New Zealand, the Philippines, Australia, the Maldives and Mongolia, while the countries displaying significant gender gaps are Nepal, Pakistan, India, Cambodia, Viet Nam and Bangladesh. Educational attributes facilitate increasing awareness levels regarding the rights due to women, which can influence their participation in labour markets, political arena and social spheres. Ownership and access to assets and resources can potentially improve under these situations, provided the socio-cultural and community structures are amenable to alterations, which are dependent on the extent of mobilization and space for collective action available for women. For instance, in parts of Bhutan, where the matrilineal system of inheritance is followed, almost 60 per cent of the rural women are owners of land. However, this results in the women participating in work at an early age, which constrains women\u2019s education. This situation has such an adverse impact on women that local women\u2019s groups have been advocating investment in women\u2019s education even if it is at the cost of the traditional female inheritance in the region (Planning Commission and UN 2001). Women\u2019s ownership of assets and the extent of their control over these assets have major implications for their economic and social rights. The adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 established that it is not only civil and political rights that are fundamental for gender equity, but economic and social rights are equally essential. The Vienna Declaration in 1993 recognized women\u2019s rights as human rights. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1979, commits countries to incorporate the principle of equity of men and women in their legal system (see Box 1.2.1). This is the \u201conly human rights treaty\u2026that targets culture and tradition as influential forces shaping gender roles and family relations\u201d (UNDP 2008:2).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55a3ce9b-4c0a-41df-bfb8-28d52fd484a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "55a3ce9b-4c0a-41df-bfb8-28d52fd484a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c6b4d2ea67cad385f0a42d770aecedde323bf2d6b25f20166b488fb2d4a460a"}, "2": {"node_id": "23b2b714-616e-4a2e-ac99-851122cc19f0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3609b12bd65400a1222496c7d4b788536d80a33b9b8c71356dfcacec7540f5aa"}}, "hash": "c2998b61b76533a5d9d253d28ab4321cdffc84feadcefc3d09189136e3340c08", "text": "The major influence and constraint in women\u2019s ownership and access to land and property, apart from economic and social structures, stems from the operation of customary laws, especially marriage and inheritance practices.

For facilitating the transformation towards gender equity, different agents require a change in perceptions and notions regarding women\u2019s roles, productivities, and contributions to the economy and the society.

The next section illustrates the evidence on gender asset gaps for the Asia-Pacific region. 20 Box 1.2.1: Bringing the Convention (CEDAW) Home Legal action to \u2018bring home\u2019 the Convention is one way of changing national legislation and removing discrimination. In a number of cases, the Convention has been successfully invoked to persuade domestic courts to refer to international standards, in particular the Convention, when applying existing law. Some of these cases are reproduced below. United Republic of Tanzania: In Ephrohim v Pastory, a woman brought a court challenge to the Haya customary law that prevented her from selling clan land. Holaria Pastory had inherited land from her father, through his will. When she tried to sell it, however, her nephew applied to have the sale voided. The Tanzania Declaration of Customary Law prohibited her from selling the land under Section 20 of its rules of inheritance, which states that \u201cwomen can inherit, except for clan land, which they may receive in usufruct but may not sell.\u201d Pastory argued that this constraint on women\u2019s property rights violated the constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights. The court, noting that the Government had ratified CEDAW, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights, found that women were constitutionally protected from discrimination and thus overruled the rules of customary law. It stated that \u201cthe principles enunciated in the above-named documents are a standard below which any civilized nation will be ashamed to fall.\u201d Nepal: In Dhungana v Nepal, the Forum for Women, Law and Development asked the Supreme Court to overturn a law that gave sons a share of ancestral property at birth but denied daughters a share of their parents\u2019 property until they reached the age of 35 without having married, and required that it be returned to the family if a daughter subsequently married. Because CEDAW has the status of national law in Nepal, the case was argued both as a violation of the Convention and as a violation of the constitution\u2019s equality guarantee. The Supreme Court found that the law did discriminate against women and directed the Nepalese Government to \u201cintroduce an appropriate Bill to Parliament within one year.\u201d India: In Madhu Kishwar and Others v State of Bihar and Others, the customary law excluding tribal women from inheritance of land or property was challenged. The court recommended that the Central Government withdraw the exemptions given under the Hindu Succession Act and the Indian Succession Act. Although judges may be unwilling to base their decisions on an international treaty such as CEDAW, they have the authority to do so if their country has ratified it. Some of the most interesting and significant decisions have been produced when a court decided to combine a vague or inadequate constitutional guarantee of women's equality with the principles of gender equality articulated in the Convention. Litigation has made history when courts have successfully relied on the Convention to interpret constitutional guarantees of equality, including access to land and inheritance rights. Source: Hartl 2003. 21 2. EVIDENCE ON GENDER ASSET GAPS Most countries of the world are aiming to move towards the constitutional provisions guaranteeing gender-egalitarian land and property rights. While there have been some progressive reforms and changes, there is still a substantial and pervasive presence of gender asset gaps in most countries across the world, including the Asia-Pacific region. However, given the pervasive presence of gender biases and discrimination against women, even legally egalitarian provisions are transformed into wide gender asset gaps as a consequence of the existing patriarchal and institutional structures. In other words, recognition and enactment of progressive laws by themselves do not translate into implementation and realization of rights. The customary land areas of the developing countries are gradually evolving from a situation of communal ownership towards that of individualized ownership. The patrilineal systems of inheritance, which bestow the male progeny with inheritance rights over land and property without granting equal rights for women, are pervasive in most parts of the Asia-Pacific region in practice. With the exception of a few countries (such as Bhutan, the Cook islands, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), some areas of Papua New Guinea, and India\u2014such as the North East and parts of Kerala)\u2014almost all the countries follow the male lineage for transfer of land.

This, of course, does not always translate into favourable gender asset gap situations. The countries, which follow female lineage or equal inheritance, experience the lack of women\u2019s control on land in spite of ownership. Women refrained themselves from claiming inherited land as brothers were seen as a source of social support, for instance, in Gujarat, India (Unni 1999), and in Afghanistan (World Bank 2005). By highlighting the prevalent inheritance rights, customary and family laws, formalization processes and land titling procedures in different countries of the region, this section illustrates how women fare in terms of the command over major assets such as land, property and housing. The instance of Japan, which has adopted an individual ownership system, shows that increasing numbers of single working women have benefited by acquiring housing ownership, which, in turn, is an outcome of their improving employment and earning situation. A large proportion of rural women in the region still continue to depend on land and natural resources, with many of them being involved in animal husbandry activities for a livelihood. Livestock, especially small ruminants, which are most often owned by women, are usually viewed as savings, as these assume a fairly liquid form that can be encashed in times of crises. Livestock ownership also serves as a means of accessing credit, training, other forms of technical assistance and the opportunity for formation of women\u2019s groups, especially with the involvement of the State and other agencies. The State plays a crucial role, both directly because land ownership control is in the hands of the state, and indirectly because of its involvement in legal provisions and their implementation. The right to purchase and sell land in certain contexts is limited 22 by the law of the land, as in the case of tribal areas or in some of the Pacific islands. The extent of development of markets for land transactions also influences transfers and acquisitions. Formal land titling procedures and record maintenance can also be critical for preventing the improper denial or loss of property. While formal systems are essential, at the same time, there have been instances of women losing out on the traditional rights customarily granted to them in the course of formalization procedures that issue rights to the male heads of households. Formalization is often seen as a shift from \u2018informal\u2019 to \u2018formal\u2019, from oral to written, from extra-legal to legal or from unofficial to official norms (Ikdahl et al. 2005). De Soto (2000) lays emphasis upon the rule of law for development as the lack of formalized property rights explains the failure of non-Western countries to achieve development. People remain poor due to the fact that ownership rights are not properly recorded and are thus useless as collateral for loans. Economic growth will be hindered without the formalization of legal rules governing property (Sachs 1996; Posner 1998). Legal scholar David Kennedy (2003) also finds much faith in the ability of the formal legal system in the fair distribution of property. Yet, discussions on formalization remain gender-neutral. Empirical evidence proves that an increase in income is treated differently by men and women (Agarwal 1996; Deere and Doss 2006). Although De Soto and his supporters consider security of tenure one way of promoting credit, critics point out that it is women\u2019s unwaged labour that is expected to service rural debt. Land titling is another formal mechanism of granting and recording ownership rights of specific parcels of land to different parties (McGee 2006). Although land titling is suggested as a solution to gender disparities in land rights, it is not the only way to provide women access to land (ICRW 2005). In cases where there is titling and formal registration of land, it is necessary for men and women to be able to acquire title individually or jointly. Joint titling helps in securing women on the demise of a spouse, and in preventing dispossession of women through abandonment, separation or divorce, besides also increasing women\u2019s bargaining power in the household. Leasing arrangements and granting of land sites for cultivation, grazing, (even mining) or housing are resorted to on state-owned land. Allocation of plots is one of the anti-poverty measures assigned for poor households. However, these plots are often allocated to the head of the household. Unless the government initiates a policy to issue joint ownership rights, these measures will not be effective for poor women, especially in times of crisis. Like land ownership, inheritance to property including housing also often", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e6e7ea6-1d50-4516-aad6-3431559c3c8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e6e7ea6-1d50-4516-aad6-3431559c3c8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aaaf1e78b32dec08f625bffed2cad011c00c7729fbeeffac740d66e8941760b8"}}, "hash": "aaaf1e78b32dec08f625bffed2cad011c00c7729fbeeffac740d66e8941760b8", "text": "follows patrilineal systems. There are a few exceptions in matrilineal societies wherein women gain ownership titles to homesteads. The state, in its pursuit of improving housing conditions, and as a measure for alleviating poverty also assigns plots to poor households, mostly in the joint names of both the man as well as the woman. In some cases, only women are assigned housing titles. In order to encourage the registration of property in the names of women, specific policies that lower the rate of property taxes for women have been introduced in various states of India. This is gradually bringing benefits to women, especially in times of crisis or distress due to divorce, separation, etc. However, needless to say, these gains are only feasible with the spread of awareness and education among the 23 women regarding the formal procedures, maintenance of relevant records and papers, etc. Legal universalism or standardization is clearly not the desired solution, since implementing equality\u2014a central objective to the concerns of human development\u2014 is not the same as implementing uniformity. As upheld in the HDR 2004, there is a need for \u201cinternal reform of all customary laws, upholding gender equality rather than imposing identical gender-biased, prejudicial laws across all communities\u201d (UNDP 2004:57). Deere and Doss (2006) in their detailed literature review of inheritance systems, emphasize that all other conditions apart, women are better off in total or partial community ownership regimes as compared to the marital regime of property separation, which grants individual rights to men and women over property. 2.1 Command over Major Assets (Land, Property and Housing) One of the most daunting challenges in achieving gender equality in the region is the lack of equal rights and security on land. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), while the proportion of female-headed households continues to grow, reaching almost one-third in some developing countries, less than two per cent of the land is owned by women (FAO 2004, cited in UNDP 2008). Security of land can be obtained by ownership and access, but it also depends on the control of land and the right to use it. Widespread variations are notable in the inheritance and customary property rights applicable in different parts of the Asia-Pacific region, ranging from traditional women favouring matriliny; conditional access to and control over land subject to marriage and family laws; equal property rights to men and women; and patrilineal systems. In some parts of the South East Asian countries, traditionally strong inheritance practices favour women\u2019s property ownership, which are gradually shifting towards bilateral systems, just as is the case with inheritance systems in the countries of North East Asia, which have also been evolving towards equal rights for women and men. In contrast, women in South and West Asia have, for centuries, been denied land rights, though there have been some progressive changes in recent times (such as the amendment to the Hindu Succession Act in 2004 and Nepal\u2019s country code in 2002). Most parts of the Pacific are governed by customary law that is gradually undergoing some changes. The countries of the Asia-Pacific region display tremendous variations in the legal inheritance regimes that influence the command that women have over land and property. The manner in which universal legal systems function and the simultaneous operation of community, religion-based and personal laws that are followed for marriage, divorce, guardianship, inheritance, and so on, introduce conflicting situations which contest gender equalities despite the constitutional provisions for it (Deere and Doss 2006). Access to or ownership of property and homesteads are equally significant in the case of women\u2019s lives, especially in times of divorce or the break-up of families. With the declining income share from agriculture in certain regions, for instance in South and South East Asia, land ownership is no longer the predominant source of household income (Rao 2005; Quisumbing 2003). Migration to urban locations in search of 24 alternate livelihoods as well as the increasing masses of landless compels the recognition of asset strategies involving investments in human resources, such as education and social support networks (Heyer 1989). Instances of progressive legal reforms such as the Hindu Succession Act, in India and Nepal and the shift towards bilateral inheritance systems, which are more egalitarian as noted in parts of South East Asia, are observed. With regard to housing ownership and rights, lack of information restricts systematic enquiry. There is no doubt that the assignment of housing assets to women can be very beneficial and must be considered as a policy imperative. Instances abound from Asian countries where government policies have ensured this, particularly for poor women", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27c8a4f1-23e7-46db-9baa-85450716e50e": {"__data__": {"id_": "27c8a4f1-23e7-46db-9baa-85450716e50e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f9bc9b303d3f2b8fbcf577ef5b4f1519b3772a9412fe55ee43529eb29c6019b"}, "3": {"node_id": "ebe059a1-63aa-45ac-97c3-612ada585e3b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "860d459d1284a69b2def8492525dec4f46c1bb5377b0dbbaac9583333b9c3990"}}, "hash": "fe02c640fdc56010e7de1ddfc4a88734b1f425cf0f00ee5ef4be653d11edcadc", "text": "(the Indira Awas Yojana in India, and the National Housing Policy of Bangladesh are a few instances). While the better off sections of society may also have instances of property owned by women in many of the Asia-Pacific countries, there is minimal information on these matters. An instance of this can be seen in the context of Japan, where single, educated working women are able to acquire ownership to housing (Izuhara 2004, 2005; Hirayama and Izuhara 2007). Nevertheless, inequalities continue to prevail in the inheritance and acquisition patterns noted among women in the region with regard to the command over assets. Some of these are illustrated in the following sub-sections. Unless these are tackled and addressed upfront, economic equity will continue to remain a distant dream. 2.1.1 South and West Asia South Asia and Africa are known as the two most culturally diverse regions of the world. The West Asian countries of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Afghanistan are Islamic countries, which follow Sharia and civil laws, though customary law often over-rides them in practice. Cultural pluralism in South and West Asia, a region which is home to several major religious groups, including Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians as well as many smaller, more localized traditions followed among the multi-ethnic populations of the region, define the customary values and very often form the basis for the legal systems followed in most countries of the region. For instance, Bhutan grants equal rights to all children by law, though matriliny exists in most parts of northern and eastern Bhutan. The manner in which universal legal systems function and the simultaneous operation of community, religion-based and personal laws that are followed for marriage, divorce, guardianship, inheritance, and so on, lead to conflicting situations that contest gender equalities despite the constitutional provisions for it (UNIFEM 2003; MHHDC 2000). In the Hindu tradition, as practised by a majority of the population in South Asia, especially India, inheritance practices are detailed in the legal doctrines of Dharmashastras and Mitakshara (Agarwal 1996). These ancient doctrines continue to influence law and custom, especially with regard to land rights. According to the Mitakshara system, there are two types of property: ancestral property, which is jointly held by the family, and independent property such as land that is self-acquired. In the Dharmashastra system, there was no distinction between ancestral land and independent property as far as inheritance customs were concerned. 25 Prior to the 2004 amendment to the Hindu Succession Act, the rights of male heirs differed between the two types of land, and women were prohibited from fully inheriting either type; widows and unmarried daughters were entitled to inherit a limited income from a joint estate, whereas from an independent property, a widow could inherit if there was no son or grandson, but only for her lifetime. A daughter can inherit her father\u2019s land only if there is no son, grandson or widow in the family. The new amendment now grants equal rights to women as well (Das 2005). Both daughters and sons now have equal inheritance rights to property. However, it remains to be seen whether women actually use the legal provisions to improve their asset position, and whether, and to what extent, such an amendment has narrowed the gender asset gap. Unlike Hindu texts, the Koran accords significant inheritance rights to women, though they are unequal to the rights of men. Daughters and widows can inherit in the presence of sons and are entitled to an absolute estate, though daughters inherit a one- third share while sons inherit two-thirds of the property, and a widow can receive one- fourth of her husband\u2019s estate if she is childless and one-eighth if there is a son. In parts of South West India and Sri Lanka, a few Muslim communities practised matrilineal inheritance under which the women inherited landed property to which the men had user rights. In the rest of South Asia, Muslims followed customary inheritance practices similar to those of the Hindu patrilineal communities wherein women\u2019s rights were limited as in Punjab, where Muslim widows could inherit the husband\u2019s ancestral land only in the absence of a son and only as a life interest (Agarwal 1996). In addition to inheritance practices, marriage is also an influencing factor (that facilitates or impedes) women\u2019s command over land. Through various customs in both West and South Asia, land ownership was limited or denied to married women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebe059a1-63aa-45ac-97c3-612ada585e3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ebe059a1-63aa-45ac-97c3-612ada585e3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f9bc9b303d3f2b8fbcf577ef5b4f1519b3772a9412fe55ee43529eb29c6019b"}, "2": {"node_id": "27c8a4f1-23e7-46db-9baa-85450716e50e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe02c640fdc56010e7de1ddfc4a88734b1f425cf0f00ee5ef4be653d11edcadc"}}, "hash": "860d459d1284a69b2def8492525dec4f46c1bb5377b0dbbaac9583333b9c3990", "text": "In South Asia, the practice of dowry and post-marital residence requirements are customary ways of controlling women and their land (McLeod-Simmons 2002).

In patriarchal societies, male domination of land is manifested in the practice of dowry. Although dowry lands may be protected, the husband has the liberty to sell, mortgage or give away his own land or joint land without his wife\u2019s approval. In matrilineal or bilateral cultures, wherein women were permitted greater access to inherited lands, a woman was encouraged to marry someone from within her kinship group (as seen among the Nayars of central and north Kerala in India, and also in Afghanistan) and live in her ancestral village in order for the family to retain the control of her land. Among the Hindu Tamils of Jaffna in Sri Lanka (who follow the practice of strong inheritance rights for women), though the daughters receive dowries from their mother\u2019s property and it is established in the wife\u2019s name in the dowry deed, its disposition still requires the husband\u2019s consent as long as she is in marital union (Agarwal 1996). Such practices have clearly subordinated women and made them economically disadvantaged. In Sri Lanka, among the Sinhalese women who had a \u2018binna marriage\u2019, the husband lived with his in-laws and managed the land which his wife had inherited, and the children also had rights on their mother\u2019s household and took her ancestral name. 26 Wherever women have customary ownership on land, it is also associated with their place of residence. In regions which follow matrilineal or bilateral systems of inheritance, women continue to reside in their matrilineal joint family estate throughout their lives even after marriage (as in the case of the Nayars of central Kerala and the Mappilas of Lakshadweep Islands, who practise duo-local residence; and also seen among the Nangudi Vellalars of Tamil Nadu and among certain tribal communities of Meghalaya in North East India who practise matrilocality). Across the region, women have limited ownership of land due to marriage-related practices. Post-marital residence resulting in village exogamy and patrilocality serves as a barrier for women in managing their lands, often even leading to what is claimed as the \u2018voluntary\u2019 giving up of claims to their lands (Agarwal 1996). In the case of the Sri Lankan Sinhalese, there is a strikingly close association between female inheritance and post-marital residence. Among the Kandyan Sinhalese, a \u2018binna\u2019 married daughter (continuing to reside in her natal home even after marriage) has an equal right to her father\u2019s estate as that of her brothers, than a daughter who has to forfeit her inheritance and stay virilocal if she is married to a \u2018diga\u2019. However, the non-Kandyan Sinhalese are governed by a general law, under which women, irrespective of the form of their marriage, have equal inheritance rights as men (Agarwal 1996). There are also illustrations wherein women do not lose their rights over the matrilineal estate even if they have moved elsewhere after marriage. Women of certain communities of Kerala in India (such as the Tiyars, Phadiyas and Chettis), move to their husbands\u2019 matrilineal estates after marriage, yet their property rights continue to be linked to their own matrilineal estates, which are managed and controlled by the eldest male members of the respective households. Apart from inheritance, the other factors that dictate women\u2019s command over estates include the right to acquire land and property, and whether women are in a position to retain control over these. The acquisition of property can be not only through inheritance but also through purchase, gifts or assignment (for instance, when land, housing plots or actual houses are provided by the State; or where user rights are given for designated periods to land, ponds or common properties through lease arrangements). Gifts in the form of assets are very often given to daughters as part of marriage alliances, as for instance, seen in the practice of dowry that is common in South Asia. However, land or property thus gifted remains subject to the benevolence of the families or social compulsions under which it is mandatory to do so. This does not take the form of women\u2019s rights and therefore remains a very distinct practice. It is only the purchase of direct assignment in the name of women with formal titles to that effect that serves as an entitlement beyond doubt.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d5b8724-494f-456d-9e92-ac4aa2a7e3ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d5b8724-494f-456d-9e92-ac4aa2a7e3ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5355f3bcb3af36463f3d0eb27c4715ef365ed9ad0d60f729cf10a5ed28f0ca26"}, "2": {"node_id": "93b1eb91-e95d-4108-b0e5-636d69db354b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b411375a78739d0245c1444389947368875177399fb56a2cc944e02363a5385"}}, "hash": "0299a9bfeae6b7eac91deb69d71a69cad7d7dea58792025e0b40fa88823c084d", "text": "In some cases (as in Bangladesh), female-headed households often lease out their lands on share cropping arrangements to their male kin, who then ultimately hope to acquire control over it (White 1992, cited in Rao 2006).

Since the earthquake of Latur in January 2001, the issuance of joint titles has become a common post-disaster situation in India as it offers a window of opportunity for advancing women\u2019s rights. But this opportunity is not seized at times as seen in 27 Sri Lanka (PDHRE 2006). The women who owned land (that was received as dowry) in their names prior to the tsunami of December 2004 were not considered eligible for compensation, but the government deposited the compensation payments in the names of their husbands. Studies from Thailand also report instances of women, who lost their husbands, not being compensated (even if they had been living together for years and had children) unless they produced marriage certificates (Lockley 2006). Evidence from India shows that joint titling of land has hindered women\u2019s control of the produce of land, and prevented them from exercising their priorities in land use if they differed from those of their husbands, in bequeathing a portion of land as they want to or in claiming their shares in the case of marital conflict (Agarwal 2002). Hence the assumption that joint titling of land would translate into access and control for the women still remains a controversial issue (Lockley 2006). Gender conflicts occur in the context of tribal women\u2019s land rights as illustrated here in the context of India, especially among tribal widows of Jharkhand. Although attempts for assertion of women\u2019s land rights are being made among the community, men have resisted it on the ground that it will undermine the very social organization of adivasis. Surprisingly, women have also resisted the transfer as it is difficult for them to comprehend that there can be a system different from the patrilineal one that they are used to and also because they feel that the demand for land cannot be a general demand for women (Kelkar and Dev 1991). Box 2.1.1.1: Degradation of Land Rights: Widows of Tribal Community in Jharkhand Among the tribal communities of Jharkhand, the widows become substitute fathers for their sons. In the event of partition, when her son(s) grow(s) up, she gets what her dead husband could have claimed and if she has only daughters, she inherits all land and movables. But all these stipulations were conditional to her remaining in the village and not re-marrying. She had the rights to manage the land, and even mortgage it temporarily, wherein both the interest and part of the principal are to be returned after harvest and the land reverts to the owner after a fixed number of years. However, the recent years have witnessed deterioration in the land rights of widows\u2014from the right to a plot of land to a right to maintain the land. This benefited the male inheritors who need give only the barest minimum as maintenance for the widows. It shows the growing ascendancy of male relatives whose interest is to take over the land as soon as possible and not to wait till the death of the widow for it. There are also instances in which widows (especially among the Santhals) without children are denounced as witches and then driven away or killed, which would result in the lands immediately being passed onto the hands of the husband\u2019s male agnates. Source: Kelkar and Dev 1991. Kelkar and Dev (1991) also point towards a situation in which the introduction of individualized landholdings resulted in the deprivation of indigenous women as is the case with the adivasis of Jharkhand state in India. With the alienation of indigenous land and the individualization of property, patriarchy has got reinforced in the familial relations and women have started losing their land rights and clan support which they formerly enjoyed. This study also exposes the extreme brutalities being practised 28 against childless widowed women, who make claims to the properties of their late husbands (see Box 2.1.1.1). The absence of asset ownership has implications for violence faced by women. There is considerable evidence to show that women without assets are subject to threats of violence in many parts of the globe (Rao 2005). The study by the International Centre for Research on Women (2006) reveals that women\u2019s access to and control of economic resources, especially immovable assets like land and house, play a critical role in protecting them from marital violence (Panda 2002; Panda and Agarwal 2005).

Among those who own no property, it was also found that 49.1 per cent experienced long-term physical violence and 84.2 per cent experienced long-term psychological violence. In contrast, those who owned both land and a house reported dramatically less physical as well as psychological violence (6.8 and 16.4 per cent, respectively). Even when a woman owned only land or only a house, the incidence of violence was much lower than if she owned neither. This indicates that if a woman owns a house or land, it serves as a deterrent to violence. A similar correlation is assumed in the context of HIV-infected women. If the woman has a secure home, a site for economic activity and collateral for credit, she can reduce the risk factors of violence (Strickland 2004). Box 2.1.1.2: Country with Progressive Legislation: Nepal\u2019s Experience The salient features of Nepal\u2019s eleventh amendment to the Country Code in 2002 can be summarized here (UNDP, 2008). Equal rights on ancestral property by birth for daughters: The previous law prescribed that only an unmarried daughter attaining the age of 35 was entitled to this right. Full inheritance rights to widows: It has removed the earlier provision that a widow could claim her share of property only after attaining the age of 30 and living separately. According to the amendment, a widow is entitled to use her share of property as she wishes even if she gets married. Wife\u2019s rights to husband\u2019s property: The amendment removes the condition that a woman must attain the age of 35 and complete 15 years of marriage to claim her share from her husband\u2019s property. Property rights of divorced women: A woman need not return her property to her divorced husband even if she remarries another man. Punishment of non-execution of court decisions: Any person not complying with court decisions related to property is liable to pay a fine of Rs. 5000 (US $ 84) or be imprisoned for up to one month or both. Source: UNDP 2008. Amidst the diversities and complications that characterize the issue of women\u2019s equal property rights in the region, there have been some noteworthy positive and welcome strides recently. The amendment to the Hindu Succession Act in 2004, which grants rights to women that are equal to those of men, is laudable. Another similar instance 29 is that of Nepal, wherein after a long struggle by women\u2019s activists, a progressive legislation safeguarding the rights of women has been introduced (see Box 2.1.1.2). 2.1.2 North East Asia Most countries of North East Asia are, by and large, legally egalitarian, or are making significant efforts to move in that direction. Cambodia passed the land law in 2001 giving equal rights to men and women, though educational backwardness and lack of information constrains women from benefiting in many cases (World Bank 2004). The gender gap in the educational attainment index (see Hausmann et al. 2008) for Cambodia is quite high and similar to that seen in parts of South Asia, and is, in fact, worse than that prevalent in West Asian countries. Benefits from access to land have been noted in the literature in the context of Chinese women involved in farming (de Brauw et al. 2008). Instances from other studies based on select communities may, however, question the interpretation of Chinese law into women having a voice in the management of the land (Judd 2007). Viet Nam instituted land reforms that emphasize the joint titling of land. Joint titling can be mandatory or voluntary for married couples (ICRW 2005). Mandatory joint land titling is, however, more secure for women than voluntary titling since the latter requires that women, registration personnel and legal services personnel should be educated. Of the Asia-Pacific countries, Viet Nam had a heated debate on Land Use Rights prior to the land legislation approved by their National Assembly in November 2003 which requires that the Land Use Right Certificate in the country must bear the names of both husband and wife, if the land belongs to both of them. Although hurdles arose during the local level implementation of this legislation, it can still be considered as a step forward in realizing gender equality in the country. In many developing countries, the security of tenure is guaranteed by the utilization of land. As long as a farmer cultivates the land, he/she enjoys security of tenure. However, under external pressures (population growth, competition for resources), use rights can", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "649d0332-7d9b-447a-9180-8c3756937838": {"__data__": {"id_": "649d0332-7d9b-447a-9180-8c3756937838", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e43c7960e6bf68cc457dc2b89f83b6f51f5ec91b4a870de7aaffcb9e105a0b7"}}, "hash": "7e43c7960e6bf68cc457dc2b89f83b6f51f5ec91b4a870de7aaffcb9e105a0b7", "text": "be eroded.

Initially the Land Tenure Certificates issued to households had only one signature, as a result of which the signature was usually of the male head of the household. Women could claim their rights only in the presence of their husbands or male relatives and had to lose their rights in the case of divorce or death. In 2001, the marriage and family law was revised so that the signatures of both the spouses are now required on any documents registering family assets and land use rights. Source: Grown et al. 2005:85. 30 enhance the potential of both women and men to use property for economic purposes. In many countries, however, land is disproportionately controlled by men, even when rural women work as agriculturalists and when the law dictates otherwise. The Chinese law (2003) on rural land contracts, guarantees long-term rights to farmers to use their contracted land for thirty years and also stipulates that women, whether they be married or unmarried, enjoy equal rights with respect to land distribution. Examining the feminization of agriculture in China (as noted in many other parts of the Asian region as well), de Brauw et al. (2008) note that policies ensuring equal access to land, open access to credit, and economic development strategies that encourage competitive and efficient markets have all contributed to the enhanced possibility of women farmers in succeeding in their work. The authors find that women fare better when they run their own farms. Yet, in terms of the thirty years provision, some studies find that there is still no explicit change for women as land is still not individually held but held by the effective head of the family. Field evidence from the three agricultural communities of China indicates that though the married daughter holds a complete set of documents related to the household land allocation naming her as the holder of land, she has never had a voice in the management or disposition of the land (Judd 2007). Other efforts at the formalization of property and progress towards achieving the pledge of the MDGs highlight the role of gender-progressive groups and other agencies. Since 1995, a collaborative effort by the Lao PDR government, the Australian Agency for International Development, and the World Bank have been making conscious efforts to include women\u2019s issues in land reform processes in the country, one of the least developed of the Asia-Pacific region (UNDP 2008). Hence, success stories from the region bear out that if the pledges of MDGs in relation to gender equity and empowerment are to be meaningful, gender-progressive groups will have to respond to the formalization of property. Also, there is a need to formulate policies for overcoming the human capital shortfalls as reflected in the poor educational attainments of women, for the egalitarian legal provisions to bear fruit. One concrete illustration of how this can work is by providing access to earning and wealth through employment, as seen in the case of Japan, where single, educated working women are gaining access to housing assets. Women and Housing Assets in Japan The asset status of Japanese women is characterized by the ideological ownership of housing without actual legal substance. Despite the New Civil Code defining children\u2019s equal rights to inheritance regardless of their gender and birth order, the practice of house ownership is still highly gendered in Japan (Izuhara 2004; 2005). Daughters are still less likely to receive housing assets from their parents, and more likely to receive cash gifts to compensate their \u2018voluntary\u2019 withdrawal from housing inheritance. Home ownership can be eventually granted to married men. Marriage has almost been the only secure means for Japanese women to access home ownership. Women\u2019s ownership of the property does not materialize until the death of their husbands and inheritance does not appear to contribute to housing asset accumulation for women. 31 With the demographic transformations (caused by rising marital age, falling fertility and increasing longevity), labour market re-organization and housing market volatility, it has become less affordable for single earner households to purchase a house and thus the number of dual earner households has been on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f0ccbc2-d5f7-41dd-b9f8-8e775a1e537d": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f0ccbc2-d5f7-41dd-b9f8-8e775a1e537d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68b84442799ff41e72d73d61665aecdd27e387ed190409c8faf694299e17a34e"}}, "hash": "68b84442799ff41e72d73d61665aecdd27e387ed190409c8faf694299e17a34e", "text": "the rise. The restructuring of the labour market has also led to the destabilization of employment and income among males. A new trend in women\u2019s home ownership has been created by an increasing number of dual income households wherein working wives tend to have a share of the housing property. The economic status of women is correlated to the level of home ownership in the household and to whether or not women have had a share in the property. The level of home ownership among women is thus clearly related to their employment status. With an improvement in their educational backgrounds, women have started entering the full-time labour force. Moreover, there has been a continuous increase in the number of non-conventional households, and consequently, an increase in the number of women now living outside the traditional family model. These new trends have reflected the fact that single career women have formed a visible new group that has access to urban home ownership in the country. Since the second half of the 1990s, the numbers of home purchases by women have been increasing. According to a Housing and Land Survey conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, home purchases by men declined between 1998 and 2003 by an average annual rate of 1.5 per cent, while those by women increased by an average annual rate of 2.2 per cent. Home purchases by women increased in all age groups, except in the late 40s age group. The increases in home ownership were particularly large for women in their 30s and their early 60s. While many of the home acquisitions by women in the latter group were tantamount to scrap and build, or the building of a new home on the land that they already owned, those by women in the former group (in the 30s age group) were primarily purchases of new or used condominiums or other forms of residence. Since Japan\u2019s \u201casset-price bubble\u201d burst in the early 1990s, home acquisitions have become easier than before. Not only have home prices declined relative to the rental properties (due to the decline in land prices), but the drop in interest rates has also reduced the size of home loans to be taken out. Is the economic power of women, which is a pre-requisite for purchasing a home, improving? Over the last ten years, there has been an upward trend in the levels of women\u2019s income in Japan. In terms of the employment situation, women in their 30s appear to have fared better than women in other age groups or men in general. Among married women, the higher the annual income and educational levels, the higher has been the ratio of those who have houses in their own names. In terms of employment status, the ratio was higher for regular employees (Hirayama and Izuhara 2007). This might suggest that if women\u2019s incomes continue to rise, so also will their home ownership ratio. 2.1.3 South East Asia The South East Asian countries are relatively more favourable to women as compared to other parts of Asia-Pacific. The gender gap index calculated by World Economic Forum (WEF) (Hausmann et al. 2008) reflects this in the case of the Philippines and 32 Thailand, with both these countries reporting high scores on economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment and health and survival. The latter two sub- indices display virtually no gender gap (see Table 1.2.3). Legal provisions in the context of land and property are fairly egalitarian, with some parts of the region following matriliny. Customary laws, as noted in South Asia, appear to be mostly unfavourable to women. Yet, not all customary laws discriminate against women. For example, in many parts of South East Asia (like the Philippines and Thailand), women have been traditionally and legally allowed to inherit property. The Minangkabau women of Sumatra in Indonesia have also been the beneficiaries of the matrilineal inheritance system. However, the gradual shift towards bilateral inheritance systems now ensures equal rights to both women and men. In Indonesia, where many families follow the Javanese inheritance customs, all children are granted equal rights to property, which is beneficial for daughters as compared to the Islamic law, which gives a larger share to sons (Brown and Purwanti 2002). However, evidences from many countries of the South East Asian region like Sumatra in Indonesia, the Philippines (see Box 2.1.3.1) and Thailand prove that the newly emerging inheritance laws are becoming egalitarian for both men and women. In recent years, these countries have witnessed a shift from the matrilineal system of inheritance to a bilateral, individualized system or rather to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbe0ee71-fca6-4643-a848-dd444bdc9ee4": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbe0ee71-fca6-4643-a848-dd444bdc9ee4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6e5f3b4fd1d221a8127baf2fd2ba01b7bf4bc6ba512ba0aebaa22bfd927b3d8"}}, "hash": "a6e5f3b4fd1d221a8127baf2fd2ba01b7bf4bc6ba512ba0aebaa22bfd927b3d8", "text": "a more egalitarian system under which sons and daughters can inherit the type of land on which in their own work effort is more intensive (Quisumbing et al. 2001). An interesting set of studies undertaken in the region, especially for the Philippines and Sumatra in Indonesia illustrate the gains for women in the inter-generational sense (Quisumbing et al. 2001, 2004). The closing of the gender gap in schooling in the children\u2019s generation as opposed to that of the respondent\u2019s generation highlights the potential gains that daughters derive from non-farm employment in the context of lower agricultural incomes. Inasmuch as the persistent gender gap in schooling contributes to the inequality in the income- earning capacities of men and women, educational gains help in narrowing these inequalities. Thus, Quisumbing (2003) points out that while sons inherit land, girls benefit from the investment in their schooling, which has the potential to narrow the gender asset gaps in the long run. Box 2.1.3.1: Rights versus Perception and Practice There are no longer any legal variations in the access to land and property for men and women in the Philippines, but in practice, men are still perceived as the primary property owners. The Agrarian Reform Department has been responsible for giving housewives equal rights to own land in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Family Code and the Civil Code on property relations, involving legally married and common-law spouses. The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law states that all qualified women members of the agricultural labour force must be guaranteed and assured equal rights to ownership of land, equal share of the farm\u2019s produce, and representation in advisory or appropriate decision-making bodies that are agrarian reform beneficiaries. Source: ADB 2004. 33 Various aspects of the issue of control over assets also raise many other issues relating to the management and operation of these assets. Both the region, in general, and the different countries within it, in particular, presents a diverse picture with regard to the female ownership of land. In South and South East Asia, though land may be registered in the name of the head of the household (usually the eldest male), women may have control over certain lands like homestead plots (Rao 2006). 2.1.4 The Pacific Region The Pacific region consists of the two developed countries of Australia and New Zealand, as also a host of islands, many of which are influenced by patriarchal structures. Many of the island countries have limited land resources, which are generally under state control and are governed by customary laws. The land ownership structures are governed by different customary and legal provisions across the countries of the Asia-Pacific region. Large segments of the region follow customary ownership laws for the inheritance of land and property. Social norms and customs go a long way in explaining gender disparities. Inheritance has been historically skewed towards men, in partly because agriculture has traditionally been a male activity and partly because legal headship status is conferred on males through marriage. Only 10 per cent of the population of the Pacific region traditionally follows the matrilineal transmission of land rights (Smiley 2006). Land owned under customary ownership is guided by a customary law. Customary law is a body of rules that derives its legitimacy from tradition. Customary laws thus evolve continually as a result of diverse factors like cultural interaction and also socio-economic processes (FAO 2004). Yet, the legal status of customary laws differs across countries. More than 90 per cent of the land in the Pacific region (that is, in Niue, Tokelau, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, the Cook Islands, Tuvalu, Nauru and the Marshall Islands) is under customary ownership (Levantis n.d.). Formerly, in certain parts of Vanuatu, if the daughter inherits the land rights, she confers the land rights on her eldest son, who is sent away to live with his mother\u2019s parents, and thereby the mother excludes herself from the land (see Box 2.1.4.1; Singh 2001). Although official land policies accord preference to equal rights for women on land, they may overlook female limitations of limited access to money wherein administrative payments are needed, and there is lack of knowledge and information due to illiteracy, among other things. In the Pacific countries with mostly patriarchal societies, daughters, after getting married to men in other villages, can utilize the produce from their parents\u2019 lands, depending on the relationship between the two villages and also the relationship between the daughter\u2019s husband and the dominant male member of her patrilineage (Kenneth and Silas 1986). 34 Box 2.1.4.1: User Rights to Land for Unmarried Vanuatuan Women In the patrilineal societies of Vanuatu, males", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7eb34b3-9abc-40cd-b952-3c631feea266": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7eb34b3-9abc-40cd-b952-3c631feea266", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36b77092aacab27520eb2fcbcc648d03fbb8cca0930b9b110e06b88bb4904d90"}}, "hash": "36b77092aacab27520eb2fcbcc648d03fbb8cca0930b9b110e06b88bb4904d90", "text": "hold major property rights.

In other parts of Vanuatu, if the daughter inherits the land rights, she confers the land rights onto her eldest son who is sent away to live with the mother\u2019s parents. He is given a new name and acquires all his mother\u2019s land rights. Thereafter, the mother is excluded from rights over the land. Source: Kenneth and Silas 1986. The situation of women in the Pacific region is pitiable, especially in Vanuatu, because of the patriarchal systems prevalent here, whereby women have no choice but to live on their husbands\u2019 lands without any property rights. On the death of the husband, the widow who has no male children does not inherit the land rights from the husband, but the land rights are instead reverted to the husband\u2019s nearest male kin and the widow is forced to return to her natal village. In some of the island countries in the Pacific region, land is owned by the state (or Crown, as in Tonga). Individuals have leasing rights, with stipulated restrictions on the bequeathing and gifting of land. Countries such as Samoa and Tonga have completely restricted the sale of their lands through the introduction of constitutional provisions, reflecting the role of the state in the alienation of land ownership among the indigenous peoples. Lease rights are also executed through the state machinery. Under the patriarchal structures of households, wherein men wield the power and have control over assets and resources, women have limited access and user rights. When the countries of the region were under the colonial administration, restrictions were imposed on the alienation of customary land, mainly, for economic reasons. Yet after the countries in the Pacific region (including Tonga, Samoa, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Tokelau, Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Vanuatu), gained independence from the colonial regime, restrictions were imposed on the alienation of land to non-indigenous peoples. Later, many countries of the Pacific region (including the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Fiji, Niue, Nauru and Tokelau) restricted the alienation of land to indigenous peoples as well. Tonga and Samoa completely restricted the sale of their lands through constitutional provisions. The approval of the State was necessary for the sale of land in the Cook Islands, Kiribati and Tuvalu. Fiji, Niue and Tokelau also restricted the alienation of customary land to the crown (Singh 2001). Although Vanuatu and Solomon Islands made customary land freely alienable to the indigenous peoples, the long-term leases of land to foreign developers and a few influential indigenous peoples snowballed into more worrisome concerns, as a result of which the demand for Land Policy Reform rapidly gathered momentum in the region. In the Pacific region, since 2005, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu (where access to land was restricted by custom and the state mechanism) have been on the road to 35 evolving successful processes of land policy reform (Holzknecht 2002; see Box 2.1.4.2). Box 2.1.4.2: On the Path to Land Policy Reform: Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu Papua New Guinea Formerly, access to land and natural resources in Papua New Guinea was restricted to custom and state mechanism. There was a wide range of customary practices in the country of which patrilineality was the most common. The customary practices were recognized and enshrined in the constitution and thereby 97 per cent of country\u2019s land area remained customary. As regards the State, it managed less than 3 per cent of the land purchased by the colonial administration and from customary resource owners. The State leased out areas of alienated land to individuals and companies, and they were subject to provisions of agriculture and urban land for housing, etc. The State and the citizens later recognized the need to maintain customary land management systems for cultural reasons. Although in 1986, the World Bank mission proposed for customary land registration and also for lease back systems, politicians claimed that customary landowners would lose their lands if the government defaulted on its loans to the World Bank. Consequently, a National Land Summit was held in the country involving persons from various grounds to discuss the issues in detail. The Summit recommended the alienation of land and customary land administration, which included the development of a National Land Development Task Force.

APPROACHES FOR IMPROVING WOMEN\u2019S COMMAND OVER ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES Among the various critical modes and approaches for improving women\u2019s command over economic and financial resources in the Asia-Pacific region, the major areas of discussion in this paper include ownership and operation of enterprises, microfinance, SHG formation and the role of women\u2019s organizations or collectives. Women have poor access to the ownership of enterprises due to their comparatively lower access to human and financial capital. At best, women are found to be managing micro or small enterprises. The major reason for the lack of accurate and detailed information on the ownership of enterprises by women has been the availability of poor or inadequate statistics on the issue. There are, however, at least two interesting sources which shed some light on the subject\u2014the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) on women and entrepreneurship, and the Global Gender Gap report of the WEF\u2014and form the basis for a brief discussion on women\u2019s enterprises, which could function as an approach for narrowing the gender asset gap and enhancing gender equity in the command over assets. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (2006) report (see Allen et al. 2007) on women and entrepreneurship, which is based on the GEM data from 40 countries, includes eight countries from the Asia-Pacific region. These are Australia, China, India, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. A profile of the entrepreneurship status of women is collated from this report for the purpose of this paper. A gradual recognition of women\u2019s role in entrepreneurship in many countries is gaining ground, especially in times of crises. The other source is the Global Gender Gap Report, which covered 130 countries in 2008 (Hausmann et al. 2008). This provides survey-based information on the ability of women to rise to the level of leading an enterprise in various countries, including 21 in the Asia-Pacific region. In the context of the total lack of information on this dimension, this paper provides an illustrative indicator for assessing how women are placed in different countries with regard to the potential enterprise leadership possibilities. Another significant approach for enabling women to utilize their social capital through group formation is pertaining to microfinance, and the formation of SHGs. These have the tremendous potential to address some of the central constraints for the establishment of businesses by women, thereby enhancing their prospects for commanding assets. There are numerous instances in the world, including in countries within the Asia-Pacific region that serve as examples for highlighting the gains made by women who have adopted these approaches. The mobilization of women or the formation of collectives with the help of governments, international agencies or even non-governmental organizations (NGOs), however, are often crucial for facilitating better operation and effective functioning of these initiatives. 37 3.1 Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship An illustration of how equal the corporate world has become for women\u2019s participation is reflected in the interesting statistic provided by the WEF Global Gender Gap Report 2008 (Hausmann et al. 2008). On the basis of a survey, the ability of women to rise to enterprise leadership has been ascertained on a scale of seven, with one being the worst score. Islamic Republic of Iran reports the lowest score, followed by the South Asian countries, except Sri Lanka, which records a high score of 5.5 (see Table 3.1.1).

As per the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (2006) (see Allen et al. 2007), women represent more than one-third of all people involved in entrepreneurial activity. Across Asia, up to 35 per cent of small or medium enterprises are headed by women. Further data pertaining to these findings are listed below. \u2022 In China, women account for 25 per cent of all new business start-ups. \u2022 In Viet Nam, women-owned businesses currently account for about 20 per cent of the total number of registered enterprises. 38 \u2022 In Japan, four out of five small business owners are women. \u2022 In Hong Kong, China (SAR), the same proportion is three to one. \u2022 Filipino women have the highest early stage entrepreneurship rate (22.5 per cent) as compared to that of their male counterparts. Women in China and Malaysia stand next to the Philippines in early stage entrepreneurship. \u2022 Malaysia exhibits the highest ratio (23.3 per cent) of opportunity to necessity- driven female entrepreneurship. Despite the growth of successful women entrepreneurs in some of the Asian countries, a significant gender gap in the rates of entrepreneurial activity still persists in a major chunk of the countries of the region. Tough institutional obstacles have hindered women\u2019s entrepreneurship, which was thought of as a deviation against the mainstream social norms. Moreover, in spite of the conceptual change in social institutions in many countries (like Japan and Singapore), family still remains the centre of pre-occupations and worries, and thereby only a marginal proportion of women entrepreneurs are ready to sacrifice their potential family life for the sake of business success. However, after the economic financial crisis that is currently plaguing the world, there has been a slow recognition of the fact that women could play an economic role as entrepreneurs, especially in Japan and Republic of Korea5, and gradually spreading to other countries. Market liberalization, new types of work organizations (like the Hong Kong Women Professional and Entrepreneur Association, and Women\u2019s Entrepreneur network in Singapore) have given more business opportunities to women who are eager to pursue a managerial career and create a business on their own. The wider use of outsourcing, sub-contracting and the use of ICT offers myriad new business opportunities without a large upfront investment. Moreover, pro-active public support of women\u2019s managerial participation and entrepreneurship, especially, \u2018positive discrimination\u2019 in favour of women in public services in Japan, Republic of Korea and Malaysia; strong pressure exerted on private businesses to give more access to managerial positions to women, specific financial support: soft loans and grants, public venture-capital in Republic of Korea and Japan, privileged access to some public markets in Republic of Korea and Malaysia, creation of start-up incubation centres for women entrepreneurs in Republic of Korea and Malaysia, targeting the ICT sector in Republic of Korea and biotechnology in Malaysia, reinforcement of support of national and regional organizations, strong emphasis placed on women-owned businesses, ICT literacy in Republic of Korea and Malaysia in order to improve export market access for the food, textile (garment) and IT industries, strong effort to encourage girls to enter engineering and natural science faculties, especially in Republic of Korea and Malaysia has opened prospects for more women entrepreneurs in the region (Debroux n.d.). 5 The source documents used for this section refer to Republic of Korea. 39 3.1.1 Micro-enterprises by Women Micro-enterprise constitutes another important asset-building strategy across the world to support poor women and their families (Moser and Dani 2008) besides functioning as a tool for bridging the gender asset gap.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f48768a-0b59-4570-85fe-24eb34469628": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f48768a-0b59-4570-85fe-24eb34469628", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "17e691caac2512bdf3773c0dbd14311b7852e56020b3ae49bab4d030a1875769"}, "2": {"node_id": "629e6d0c-e63c-4914-bc9c-d10e82f8b6ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b09a239feb091e81782a034d33e4dc26bf6e8ef0dbd718ce59dd2c75223bba92"}}, "hash": "033b47bcbbed654011d558e1af04dd5a4efbf998949a7b423030f13f6825a104", "text": "Although there is no universal definition of micro and small enterprises, there is some agreement as to their general characteristics in developing countries, which are: very small scale of operation, low level of technology, low access to credit and lack of managerial capacity, considerably low level of productivity and income, as well as their strong tendency to operate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7a28757-7eef-45db-a761-46f8c302a343": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7a28757-7eef-45db-a761-46f8c302a343", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1703faafe98bb36232452838ee1bf68a496b20db34e59abc552099f600ab186c"}}, "hash": "1703faafe98bb36232452838ee1bf68a496b20db34e59abc552099f600ab186c", "text": "in the informal sector where they have few linkages with the modern economy (ILO 2000). Various country studies reveal the significant involvement of women in micro- enterprises. The ADB Gender Assessment Report of China (2006b) points out that women entrepreneurs own 20 per cent of all enterprises in People\u2019s Republic of China. The Small and Micro enterprises Business Survey (Chandra and Lewai 2005) in Fiji indicated that of the 14560 registered business enterprises 19.2 per cent were operated by women. In Mongolia, of the 482 small micro-enterprises, one-third of the entrepreneurs are women (ADB and World Bank 2005). Nine out of ten enterprises in the Philippines are micro-enterprises and one out of two micro-entrepreneurs is a woman (ADB et al. 2008). Although a micro-enterprise is valued for its double impact in terms of empowerment and asset outcomes, evidences from countries highlight that only a small number of women survive or expand their businesses. ILO (2000) reveals that women usually face multiple obstacles at various stages of their business operation, namely, educational, infrastructural, socio-cultural, legal, lack of self-confidence and so on. Low level of education, lack of business skills, low level of group organization and also the paucity of time and mobility persuade Chinese women to take smaller loans and invest on a small scale without access to organized markets (ADB 2006b). The narrow focus of credit for some microfinance programmes coupled with low loan levels have posed obstacles to the growth of many micro-enterprises in the Philippines (ADB et al. 2008). Women entrepreneurs of Nepal have undergone severe social and customary restrictions, which limits their involvement to just home-based industries. These industries are, however, fizzling out due to the competition from imported products (ADB 1999). Obstacles to obtaining credit, lack of commercial skills and knowledge, and also the lack of collateral have hindered the professional growth of the rural and urban women of Thailand, who have been producing silks, garments, artificial flowers, wood carvings, umbrellas, basketry, sea foods, etc., thereby preventing their entry into formal businesses (ADB 1998). Even though supportive business organizations exist, women are discouraged from joining them, as seen in Mongolia (ADB and World Bank 2005). Moreover, low capitalization of enterprises has resulted from women\u2019s own preference for keeping the operations small in scale so as not to interfere with their familial responsibilities (ADB et al. 2008). Thus, to a great extent, asset accumulation through a micro-enterprise is closely related to the institutional and social setting in which the enterprise is embedded and also on the opportunities available to individuals living in that environment (Moser 40 and Dani 2008). Probing deeper into the problems faced by small and micro- enterprises, studies by the ILO conducted in the Philippines and Bangladesh identify lack of access to credit as a major constraint for small and micro-entrepreneurs among women (Hampel-Milagrosa 2008). Many have access to credit only through informal lenders who charge them high interest rates (ILO 2000). In addition, lack of information on the requirements of the bank, and limited understanding on how to approach the banks for a loan, result in lack of confidence among women borrowers. Many women do not own property that can be used as collateral because gender relationships play a significant role in the way in which land rights are determined. In Lao PDR, informal credit schemes, which constitute an important source of financing for rural villagers, are accessible only to men, who generally perform all duties related to loans. Besides, these loans are given to households and not to individuals, despite the fact that women have a monopoly in the work related to small animals (GRID 2005). Various other factors constrain women from gaining access to credit facilities. In countries like Papua New Guinea, the problems of geographical access to banks are more acute for women residing in less populated areas as most financial agencies have centralized offices in the larger centres. Yet, any earnings that come out of female investments are subject to the control or influence of their families and clans (Brouwer et al. 1998). The situation in Indonesia reveals the inherent bias against married women where the Civil Code impedes married women from entering into contracts on their own behalf and earning income from individual business activities. Tax regulations also do not allow married women to have a separate tax number, thereby forcing them to use their husbands\u2019 numbers (ADB 2006a). Traditionally, women in businesses have faced constraints that prevent them from flourishing professionally, enhancing productivity and accumulating surpluses since they have few economic resources and limited access to credit and their networks usually obtain little business or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ae51a0d-7e40-4813-a338-df26403c0ca1": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ae51a0d-7e40-4813-a338-df26403c0ca1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e6ecf9ea4790355692bfccc8292108ac6f11b3505c986d481134280b89e567c"}, "3": {"node_id": "39d123ff-1bcd-488a-a185-73d96cf75501", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c5f249addb8fb681c1240a18bf2e74fd4bf40e5e149455edf253b760aa0939b"}}, "hash": "85982a0653bea276d788c9bb7ce1261a1004f279f52fd545f74e0732ddc50ee5", "text": "political favours as compared to that of men. The introduction of women savings groups and microfinance as an alternative approach, amidst these myriad traditional and conservative restrictions on women\u2019s access to credit and operation of businesses, have revolutionized financial access for women in many ways and helped improve their command over assets as well. 3.2 Microfinance Social mobilization and collective agency (as poor women often lack the basic capabilities and self-confidence to counter and challenge the existing disparities and barriers they face) are beginning to be recognized as appropriate routes for working towards the empowerment of women (Quisumbing 2003; Deere and Doss 2006; Kay 2003). The use of approaches such as SHG formation wherein savings and credit are combined enable women to benefit economically by monetizing their contributions and, in the process, empower them to become agents of change (Putnam 2000). Microfinance promoted by Professor Yunus, Managing Director of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, and also by the BRAC, has spread all over the world with 25 million people now using microfinance to undertake income-generating or self-employment activities; of which 90 per cent are women (World Bank 2006). Loans are provided to individuals but the entire group is responsible for repayment. The borrower who does 41 not fulfil the commitment to repay the loan will lose the goodwill drawn from the social capital. The system of group guarantee combined with individual responsibility now enables credit to be extended to hundreds of millions of poor, asset-less women. Regular savings provide a fund to fall back upon in times of need for the poor women and promote capital accumulation for the poor women as well as their households. Repayment of loans in cash form necessarily requires that the loans should be invested in some form of cash-earning production. With the exception of a few specific communities and areas, the market has hitherto been a public arena that is not easily accessible for most women in both Asia as well as the Pacific region. Women have been selling minor items such as eggs and vegetables either at their doorsteps or by using their children to transport their products into the market. But when they start producing for the market, their economic role links them to the market, whereby production becomes more commercialized. As Kelkar and Nathan (2005) highlight, in Lao PDR, women who initially wove skirts for their own use and for gifts, began to produce for the market by becoming more agile in learning new and even innovative patterns. Similarly, Bangladeshi women, who earlier raised poultry for household consumption, subsequently started raising it for sale. As per the Micro Credit Summit Campaign Report (2007) (see Harris 2007), the global outreach of micro-credit proves that of the 92.9 million poorest clients reached at the end of 2006, 85.2 per cent or 79.1 million are women. The growth in the number of very poor women beneficiaries reached has gone up from 10.3 million at the end of 1999 to 79.1 million at the end of 2006. This signifies a 668 per cent increase in the number of poorest women reached during the period ranging from 31 December 1999 to 31 December 2006. Microcredit interventions by both the government and non-government organizations have increased enormously over the past two decades in many countries of the region. According to the global estimates, South Asia has the largest number of microfinance borrowers while East Asia and the Pacific stand next to it with a corresponding figure of 10.5 million borrowers. Microfinance in Asia has focused on women, who constitute 98 per cent of its borrowers as compared to 66 per cent in Africa and 61.8 per cent in Latin America (WSBI 2008). However, microfinance has not attained a significant spread in the Pacific region as compared to the Asian countries due to varied reasons. Although Fiji made an entry with 85 per cent of its borrowers being women beneficiaries, the region generally shows very poor success rates mainly due to the less density of population, high transaction costs and lack of sufficient trained staff to take up the work related to disbursement of microfinance. 42 Table 3.2.1: Regional Breakdown of Microfinance Beneficiaries Regions No. of poor clients (2005) No. of poor clients (2006) No. of poor women clients (2005) No.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39d123ff-1bcd-488a-a185-73d96cf75501": {"__data__": {"id_": "39d123ff-1bcd-488a-a185-73d96cf75501", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e6ecf9ea4790355692bfccc8292108ac6f11b3505c986d481134280b89e567c"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ae51a0d-7e40-4813-a338-df26403c0ca1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85982a0653bea276d788c9bb7ce1261a1004f279f52fd545f74e0732ddc50ee5"}}, "hash": "6c5f249addb8fb681c1240a18bf2e74fd4bf40e5e149455edf253b760aa0939b", "text": "of poor clients (2006) No. of poor women clients (2005) No. of poor women clients (2006) Sub-Saharan Africa 53,80,680 61,82,812 34,22,825 40,36,017 Asia and Pacific 74,330,516 83,755,659 63,934,812 72,934,477 Latin America and the Caribbean 17,60,405 19,78,145 12,58,668 13,84,338 Middle East and North Africa 3,87,951 7,55,682 3,21,004 6,21,111 North America and Western Europe 13,318 25,265 7862 11,767 Eastern Europe and Central Asia 76,166 2,25,011 47,856 1,42,873 Source: Micro", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e51cb3c0-ddca-400b-ab1f-99a7e84517ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "e51cb3c0-ddca-400b-ab1f-99a7e84517ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02035e246d6fbe7434a5605930829ce6835c0690f94404a2a082c82d079168f7"}, "3": {"node_id": "f9ca3b1e-bb92-4ecb-91da-64acd3417a36", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/10", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2143f4a10e318e2488499c648d1a204144b088a814701ece26253c65f4a07e89"}}, "hash": "bdfd9b1eed23e889644d4d36593e0b9ca87a81c84e852aa6fda7e90b3fa9f6ba", "text": "Credit Summit Campaign Report 2007, in Harris 2007. Regional data expose that of the total microfinance borrowers, women constitute a major segment and it is revealed that the Asia-Pacific region has the largest concentration of these borrowers. By 2005, the coverage of microfinance was impressive in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and the focus on engaging women as essential contributors had important spillover effects throughout the region. The potential of microfinance demonstrated by the experiences of Bangladesh captured the attention in many other countries with many of the potential MFI institutions catering to the poor borrowers of the region, including the Hatton National Bank of Sri Lanka, Viet Nam Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development, National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development in India, Postal Savings Bank in China, Government Savings Bank of Thailand, Bank Simpanan National of Malaysia, and so on. 3.2.1 Women\u2019s Access to Microfinance\u2014Experiences from Countries Cambodia: Although Cambodia has a well-regulated system of credit, it is not widely accessible to people. However, five institutions are now formal providers of microfinance covering 20 per cent of the households. About 75 to 80 per cent of its borrowers are women (World Bank 2004). Fiji: Various microfinance projects have been undertaken in the Fiji islands over the past 15 years. The longest in operation is the Women\u2019s Social and Economic Development Programme (1993), based on the Grameen Bank model. However, the programme lacks many components of the Grameen Bank model, for instance, it has no savings component, the interest rates offered are below the market rates etc. In 2002, the National Centre for Small and Micro Enterprise Development was started with a focus on women and youth. It became the apex organization for nine Micro- Finance Institutions (MFIs) by 2004, and was able to provide loans to 3000 women for starting micro enterprises (that is, 80 per cent of its borrowers were women). In 2004, the Australian New Zealand Banking Group established a rural banking service with six mobile banks in the rural areas where no banks exist. Financial literacy was provided to women through the women\u2019s groups (ADB 2006c). 43 China: The Tianjin Women\u2019s Association for Business and Development Promotion, which was established in 1999 with UNDP support, targets the poor and urban women workers who have been laid off their job. Up to 2005, the association issued credit to 2000 women (ADB, 2006b). This accelerated the growth of incubated businesses and provided re-employment and venture creation for women. Since its establishment in 2000, the centre has helped 58 women-owned businesses that employ more than 2700 people (80 per cent of which include women). Ten of these businesses have now \u2018graduated\u2019 from the incubator. They are now sustainable in their own right. The activity has also provided access to microfinance services for urban laid-off women workers, and by November 2002, it had delivered loans to 2586 clients (Rogers and O\u2019Farrell 2008). Pakistan: A study commissioned by the European Union, while tracking the socio- economic impacts of six sample MFIs (reaching at least 2000 active borrowers in the many regions of Pakistan) has proved that except for the Kashf Foundation, none of the MFIs produced a positive impact on women\u2019s empowerment. In spite of the efforts by the government signified in the setting up of the First Women\u2019s Bank, Khushhali Bank, and Jafakash Aurat, there are no links tracing asset creation by women. Women continue to rely on traditional income-generating activities like sewing, handicrafts, while the microcredit programmes have failed to incorporate adequate business development services, especially for the marketing of products (ADB 2008). Sri Lanka: An Australian-supported microfinance programme is helping people in the country recover from the impact of the 2004 tsunami on their livelihoods. The programme is supporting the grant of loans to 2100 people (mainly women) for carrying out small-scale activities such as preparing food, making lace, fishing, selling vegetables and making bricks (Rogers and O\u2019Farrell 2008).

Thus, while summarizing the benefits of microfinance for women, the impact assessment reports from a country like Bangladesh which has made a pioneering attempt in this field are worth mentioning. The impact assessment study of the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee undertaken in 2007 discloses that in spite of 53 per cent women handing over their loan money to their male household members, the overall women\u2019s participation was found to increase their self- 44 confidence and reduce their dependence on male household members (Rogers and O\u2019Farrell 2008). A fall in the number of divorce cases in Bangladesh due to the women availing of microcredit is another citation from the impact assessment studies. Also, the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh provided housing loans to members with a track record of three loan cycles with title deeds to land on which house is built. As most of the Grameen members are women, the result was that women got title deeds to be transferred to them, often from their husbands, to obtain these loans, which, in turn, improved their status in the family. There are also citations of women\u2019s access to household resources from Viet Nam. The Capital Aid Fund for Employment of the Poor (CEP), based in Ho Chi Minh City (Viet Nam), which formally targeted poor households without the specification of poor women, had to recognize that 75 per cent of its clients were women. The impact Assessment Survey of CEP in 2005 exposed that since joining the CEP programme, 52 per cent of women reported that they had gained more confidence and assumed a more significant role in decisions taken within the household and the community (Rogers and O\u2019Farrell 2008). In certain countries, SHGs were able to purchase land for themselves as a group, lease in land for vegetable cultivation, and acquire user rights for fishing ponds (as in Bangladesh) collectively for the sustenance of their livelihood (Kelkar 2005; Nathan and Apu 1998). An analysis of the microcredit programmes reveals that the Anand Milk Union Limited (AMUL) in India, a dairy cooperative of women who own cows and produce milk and milk-based products on profit, is also an interesting example whereby poor women own and operate enterprises, and add value to their products. However, there are also exceptional instances from Lao PDR, wherein the efforts of the Lao Women\u2019s Union in promoting micro-credit facilities for agriculture, animal husbandry and primary health projects became fruitless mainly due to the marginal role of women in decision-making in spite of their active role in economic activity (GRID 2003, as cited in GRID 2005). Box 3.2.1: A Filipino Woman\u2019s Experience of Asset Accumulation through Networks outside the Community A key factor to the success of ZSP Enterprises, a pioneering seaweed trading firm in the coastal province of Zamboanga del Sur in the Philippines, has been the founder\u2019s successful utilization of her social capital, in terms of friends, family, and other contacts. Zhuvaida Pantaran, a Muslim woman, persuaded her distant relatives in the seaside community of Pagadian City to supply her with seaweed. She also used her strong networking skills to link up with seaweed processing firms in Cebu, thereby completing the value chain for her business and the marketability of her products. The approach has proved successful. ZSP Enterprises has turned into one of the area\u2019s largest seaweed traders and become instrumental in developing the seaweed industry in the province. By now, the company has expanded beyond Zhuvaida\u2019s own initial social capital.

Major Findings, Lessons Learnt and Way Forward A detailed analysis of women\u2019s command over assets in the Asia-Pacific region illustrates the extent and nature of gender asset gaps that are prevalent in the region. The relative fluidity in the legal provisions across the countries as reforms are instituted or underway in response to the concerted efforts of various groups (including legal and women\u2019s organizations; the media; national and international agencies) add to the complexities of gender asset gaps. Systematic enquiry of the gender asset gap situation is further hampered by the availability of extremely limited and inadequate statistical information pertaining to the asset positions of individuals in a host of countries wherein households and the heads of these households are in control of the assets owned or community ownership is prevalent. The obstacles to equal access and ownership of assets by women are listed below along with the signs of progress and some of the innovative approaches that have been introduced to improve women\u2019s command over resources across the entire region. Finally, some recommendations are made. 4.1.1 Obstacles to Equal Access and Ownership \u2022 Although women\u2019s equal rights to access, ownership and control of land and housing are firmly recognized under international law, at the country level, the persistence of discriminatory laws, policies, patriarchal customs, traditions and attitudes is still preventing women from enjoying their rights. \u2022 Although legal reforms have changed women\u2019s legal rights in certain countries of the region, the co-existence of a divergent set of laws\u2014 formal, statutory and informal, customary or family law\u2014results in discrimination against women, as no single law exists for dealing with the situation. \u2022 Due to the individualization of land tenure, many customary laws and practices have eroded over time; the forms of solidarity that used to exist and that protected women from exclusion, have now disappeared in many areas of the region, especially among the indigenous communities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__":

"text": "limited mobility act as constraints for the ownership of enterprises by women. 47 \u2022 Objections from the tax regulation authorities to give a separate tax number to married women (as in Indonesia), or the requirement of the spouse\u2019s identity cards (as in China) or even the need for the husband\u2019s guarantee signature on loan documents despite possessing a collateral (as in the Philippines) have been preventing women from enhancing the earning potential from individual business activities. 4.1.2 Lack of Awareness \u2022 Low literacy levels limit women from exercising their rights on land (as in Cambodia). \u2022 Improper awareness of ownership and user rights on assets (especially in Lao PDR), and the lack of confidence to claim their rights (as seen among the Filipino women) have prevented women in accessing credit from formal institutions. \u2022 It has been seen that many women have faced partial roadblocks to their entry into the corporate world due to what has been perceived as their inadequate commercial skills. \u2022 Women\u2019s capabilities and earning potentials have also largely suffered because they lack the technical expertise that is otherwise available to men engaged in similar fields. 4.1.3 Improper Networking \u2022 There has been ineffective use of the media outlets for disseminating information on legal awareness. \u2022 The supportive policies fostering the accumulation of assets by women are inadequate. \u2022 Only very few business organizations cater to the needs of women entrepreneurs. \u2022 Poor social networks among women act as constraints, thereby preventing women-led enterprises from thriving. 4.2 Signs of Progress In the midst of these persistent obstacles, a few countries of the region have attempted to address many of the burning issues concerning women\u2019s unequal command over assets by way of legal reforms, government interventions and the implementation of some innovative and creative practices. With regard to progressive laws and policies, though the need for women\u2019s equal property rights is recognized, they are very difficult to implement because of the weak enforcement mechanism. However, constructive approaches at the policy level help in ensuring that women enjoy an equal right to claim their assets. 4.2.1 Legal Reforms \u2022 The amendment to Hindu Succession Act in 2004 codified the law relating to inter-state succession among Hindus by giving daughters rights equal to those that sons have. 48 \u2022 After witnessing a long struggle by women\u2019s activists, Nepal made an amendment to the country Code in 2002, granting equal rights for property ownership to men and women. However, country-specific evidences indicate that Nepal still has a long way to go for the smooth and effective implementation of these reforms. \u2022 A revision in the marriage and family law of Viet Nam in 2001, according to which the Land Use Certificates in the country should bear the names of both husband and wife if the land belongs to both of them, can prove to be a lesson for other countries of the region. Although the country faced hurdles in its local level implementation, the introduction of joint titling can be viewed as a step ahead in realizing gender equality. 4.2.2 Land Policies in Transition \u2022 After breaking the obstacles of custom and state mechanisms, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, in the Pacific region are at the crossroads for the successful implementation of land policy reforms, thereby paving the way for the access, control and ownership of land for women too. 4.2.3 Generation of Legal Awareness \u2022 The Women\u2019s Union in Lao PDR has championed the cause of generating legal literacy among females, which has resulted in the titling of land in women\u2019s names or in joint names with their husbands. 4.2.4 Innovative Approaches for Women\u2019s Access to Assets \u2022 Collectives of Women like SEWA in India, and HomeNets in Thailand and the Philippines mobilize women and assist them in gaining access to assets through wide social networking. \u2022 Positive discrimination favouring women\u2019s enterprises, which has been incorporated in the government policies in Malaysia, Japan and Republic of Korea has opened up prospects for business enterprises for more women entrepreneurs in the region. \u2022 Ensuring economic stability for women by according them an elevated educational and employment status, as cited by the respondents of the house ownership survey of women in Japan, can also prove to be another creative strategy enabling women to gain command over assets. 4.3 Policy Implications and Way Forward Legal reforms in inheritance and marital regimes have a critical role to play in the shift towards relatively egalitarian regimes.

The processes of formalization and land titling too lead to the practice of land and property being registered in the name of the male head of the household, unless efforts to implement joint titling are made. In order to address these practices and ensure equal access and control over assets by women as by men, a host of efforts are required. 49 Several measures are required to address gender inequalities and change the existing social and cultural norms, such as universalization of education, generation of awareness regarding individual rights and legal provisions through the promotion of legal literacy, advocacy for equal property rights for women, and the development of women\u2019s organizations that can help in making and pursuing land claims as well as in developing mechanisms to record women\u2019s share of land, assets or property. Formal legal provisions that follow the constitutional mandate of women\u2019s equality and stipulate equal ownership and access for women along with men are the necessary first steps, but they are not sufficient in themselves. In order to enable these provisions to be translated into operational command over assets for women, these rights still need to be established in practice so as to be able to address the prevalent gender asymmetries and disparities. There is a need to not only address the gender disparities and discrimination against women in the legal and cultural spheres, but also to introduce reforms to make the provisions more gender-egalitarian, and to focus on improving human capabilities, especially in the sphere of education and formal schooling in order to narrow the gender gaps in educational outcomes. This is because legal reforms cannot be beneficial to women without the additional support of improving their education levels, as seen in the case of Cambodia, Viet Nam or even Bhutan, wherein women\u2019s organizations have been advocating the need for education among women instead of the pursuit of matrilineal land rights, which exert pressure on girls to drop out of school and take care of their lands. The enhancement of human capital can aid women in terms of improving their access to credit, technical expertise and training, as well as networking and organizations, all of which can eventually help improve their chances for accumulation of wealth and assets. There is also a need to bring about legal reforms and awareness generation among women through all the available and locally popular media. The routes adopted for achieving the appropriate reforms may differ from place to place depending on the number of organizations, media agencies, women\u2019s groups, and collectives that are active in the particular region, in addition to the extent of international pressure being exerted in the region. One essential requirement is the need for generating gender disaggregated data on individual asset ownership; on landholdings, operational land and property; and on financial, economic and physical resources, among other things. Efforts to elicit information on the assets brought by men and women into marriage can also help generate useful data to enhance intra-familial and inter-personal bargaining and relationships. Finally, integrating gender perspectives into discussions on national development and research on areas of gender asset gaps will pave the way towards the introduction of more politically willed legal reforms, effective awareness building and legal aid support services. It will also be a source for advocacy, lobbying and networking to eliminate the constraints for equal access and effective command over assets by women. 50 REFERENCES ADB (Asian Development Bank). 1998.

Women have been embracing revolts, independence struggles, and war in many countries. They are in demand for \u201csupport\u201d roles like intelligence, logistics, food, nursing, as well as for combat, bombings and suicide missions. Their reasons for joining are many\u2014forced recruitment, fleeing oppression or abuse at home, a desire to feel valued. They receive military-type instruction-- training on ethics and attitude, strategy, guerilla tactics and use of weapons. Traditional gender roles are blurred, there being little hesitation in using women\u2019s services in conflict as per the demands of leadership. Though women are fundamental to the functioning of the war apparatus and accept the same danger and insecurity as men, they face specific vulnerabilities, including sexual exploitation. Post-conflict, some \u201cdisappear\u201d due to stigma for having stepped outside social norms. Others want participation in peacetime political processes. However, there is a policy gap in fully recognizing gender during disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. Skills acquired during conflict can be transferred to good use in peacetime, recognizing former roles. Successful reintegration of women, no less than men, into civil lives requires a better understanding of gender to enable everyone to lead fulfilled lives and reduce alienation, contributing to lasting peace and human development.

While debates about the legitimacy of full participation of females in state armed forces continue, the non-state arena is of particular interest for three reasons: one, the less formal institutional structures allow greater potential to push boundaries; two, the limited mechanisms for recognition, remuneration or redress during and after conflict generate near-irreversible gender-specific issues; and three, the transformation of combatants and the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6792724-c682-42de-bf0e-8af2c8e0f10e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6792724-c682-42de-bf0e-8af2c8e0f10e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/11", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/11", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6791fa31452aa6a40876eb0ead597e5c8e9d6dbbc03ddb971405eccdf4e5824"}, "3": {"node_id": "fe4e2804-ad00-4a7d-bdd3-89b0b3c5558a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/11", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a84146439d7b939b58959ca22abb319ce8c674ef9b80c3314b29aa890dd45585"}}, "hash": "8e4d4210db14339583017c01d625ee4abc434334ecb2cbf029d09bbcc83fd351", "text": "skills developed have the potential to be used productively in peacetime. In spite of a history of female pacificism, there are numerous examples of women embracing revolts, independence struggles, and war with enthusiasm. Previously in Asia, for example, women have been active participants during India\u2019s independence struggle against the British, and more recently in Nepal\u2019s Maoist movement, as volunteers in the Iraqi army, in the independence struggle of Timor-Leste, and in Sri Lanka\u2019s continuing Tamil conflict. The number of women combatants in armed conflicts is estimated to range between one-tenth to approximately one-third (Bouta et al. 2005). In Sri Lanka and in Nepal, for instance, women are estimated as constituting about one-third of the combatants (Manoharan 2003; Bannon and Bennet 2004). Worldwide, women\u2019s participation in armed conflicts is widely acknowledged in countries like Algeria, El Salvador, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Indonesia (Aceh), Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste, Viet Nam and Zimbabawe. Between 1990 and 2003, girls were part of fighting forces in 55 countries; in 38 of these countries1 girls were involved in armed conflicts (McKay and Mazurana 2004: 21). Women are in demand for particular \u2018support\u2019 roles and also as equal participants in combat, bombings and suicide missions. Women and girls face specific vulnerabilities and exploitation, during and after conflict. Gender roles in these circumstances are not static. Those in charge deliberately alter some aspects to achieve political or other goals, including back-and-forth manipulation depending upon the purpose of the conflict. While female combatants undergo intense physical, psychological and emotional experiences, they also pick up a variety of skills some of which are transferable to productive civil life. Post-war rehabilitation efforts that ignore these complexities, and predominantly focus on civilians, refugees and other displaced 5 populations, can miss out on the special needs and enormous potential of females who have worked within the armed forces, especially non-state ones. 2. Varied motivations, varied roles The reasons for joining non-state armies are multiple. Some women and girls are forcibly recruited, whilst others join to flee oppression and abuse at home, including forced marriages. Some join to gain better control over their lives and for their own protection. Others long to \u2018be someone\u2019 and feel valued. Armies can provide a career with perceptions of leadership and strength (Keairns 2002: 3). These factors are a reflection of the status of females in larger society (Brett 2002). Poverty is also a driver, applicable for males and females; access to basics like food and shelter are adequate inducements for the economically disadvantaged. Further notable motives for joining non-state armed forces include lack of education or other employment opportunities (S\u00f8rensen 1998). One incentive for recruiting women into the armed forces is their being considered more obedient and thus easier to train. Women and girls work in many critical support roles such as cooks, porters, messengers and health workers. On top of this, women are given roles as administrators and spies, as well as handling logistics, repairing equipment, distributing propaganda and fund-raising. In some non-state armies they are also used as partners and sex slaves, as supporters, and abductees forced to act as \u2018wives\u2019 of male combatants (Mazurana and Carlson 2004). Not forgetting, of course, that women are themselves armed combatants, including suicide bombers - though to a lesser extent than men (Bouta et al. 2005). In some cases, like in Eritrea, the symbol of a female fighter is considered very important (Bouta et al.2005), while in Aceh female warriors are traditionally seen as heroines of exceptional character (in contrast with the rest of Indonesia): noble, fearless and ready to die a martyr in the interest of society (Clav\u00e9- \u00c7elikn.d.). 3. In conflict: Inclusion and equity expectations Gender operates quite differently in the context of war. Armed conflicts and other political upheavals could present openings and power structures which are otherwise unavailable to the disadvantaged. For the poor and rural population, there are prospects for quick access to power. For females the leap is much more than males. In such settings both sexes tend to share danger, insecurity and living conditions.

This does not, of course, mean that the LTTE recruited women primarily or even predominantly to promote gender equality or strengthen social freedoms for all. It was after the organization faced severe manpower shortages in the mid-eighties and as the only option available, women were recruited and absorbed into the organization, voluntarily or even forcibly (Manoharan 2003). 6 Similarly, in Nepal women who joined the Maoist Army were full of a new liberation vocabulary and enjoyed new-found confidence, inducing ordinary village women to question traditional gender roles (Bannon and Bennett 2004). This did bring about some positive changes amongst the women, giving them a feeling of greater power and confidence. In fact, it was found that women tended to become \u201cmasculinized\u201d rather than their presence \u201cfeminizing\u201d the army. They wore combat-outfits, discarded all jewelry and cropped their hair. In Aceh female soldiers received military-type instruction including physical training, training on military ethics and attitude, strategy and guerilla tactics, and use of weapons like AK-47, M-16, grenades and pistols. They also received lectures on ideology, ethics and military attitude, strategy and guerilla tactics. After a formal ceremony they officially became Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM) Inong Balee (literally Free Aceh Movement Widows). The Inong Balee worked in both, women\u2019s units and mixed-gender units (Clav\u00e9-\u00c7elikn.d.). The resistance movement was dependent upon women\u2019s networks and courier duties, indispensable to the fighters (Scott 2003). Circumstances that females face however, can take on some contradictory forms; while their work is part of the backbone on which war is carried out, some of it tends to be trivialized when combat is prioritized over all else. Female participants are fundamental to the functioning of the war apparatus - armed action cannot be carried out in the absence of intelligence gathering, transporting supplies and arms, logistics, food, resistance, nursing facilities for the wounded, etc. Their combat and suicide bomber roles are sometimes seen as occasional or temporary. Moreover, female soldiers are not expected to look forward to rewards like authority or political power. Being required to perform roles as supporters and \u2018wives\u2019 can undermine women\u2019s bodily autonomy. Where the soldiers are still girls, traditional norms of respecting older males further bury their contributions and expose them to severe conditioning needed for the overall success of the war. Child soldiers (both sexes) Box 1: Women Tamil Tigers in Combat Roles While women initially performed paramilitary and support roles in the Tamil movement, after 1985 the situation changed. It is believed that by the early 2000s, three out of ten members of the Central Committee (the highest decision-making body of the LTTE) were women. Of the estimated total cadre strength of 10,000-15,000, females accounted for nearly one third. They were included in all units of the organization \u2013 combat, political, administration and intelligence. Reportedly, there was no sex-based discrimination in training and combat operations. Slogans like \u201cequity for the nation and equality at home\u201d were common. Since women are generally perceived as less dangerous in public places, they have been found useful in carrying out suicide attacks. Interestingly, the successful and much publicized 1991 suicide attack by a female LTTE associate on the then Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, seemed to heighten female motivation levels, encouraging women to join the organization.

Nevertheless, women and girls are not passive victims - many do expect and create change, resist abuse, demonstrate discipline, resilience and a variety of skills (Keairns 2002; Denov 2007). Some women, like those in the Inong Balee, have demonstrated that they do not want to disappear but want to continue to take part in shaping their lands and culture and be included in the peacetime political process. In Timor-Leste it was women activists who contributed to bringing women\u2019s efforts to the table (Scott 2003). Whilst many of the skills acquired can later be transferred to good use in peacetime, there is a policy gap in recognizing and leveraging such capacity of female combatants.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9cf4dda-700e-4ccc-bc1d-7704be36613c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9cf4dda-700e-4ccc-bc1d-7704be36613c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/11", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/11", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4cd729d5e00b313a66a475c2be052acb95f23a96080e6094b59c2edd37f34144"}, "2": {"node_id": "107e2a6b-8b35-4f8e-9b05-47759ba6994f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/11", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c849a4db77cb31dfa10f8213e9f408c86c4949685efe8bd0256607554c3cc660"}}, "hash": "5040734b0527a981286ce2096d953c0620f5b1b9f81ea6973c3dc07120626298", "text": "4.

Both female and male ex-combatants face many issues in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR), but females face very particular disadvantages. The immediate rationale behind DRR programmes is to bring normal security back. Longer term social considerations tend to take a back seat. In particular, gender dimensions are neither well enough understood nor explicitly recognized in each phase. Disarmament. Benefits of DDR programmes tend to be given to those who hand over weapons. It is far more common for men to be combatants than women, who are often non- combatants or are required to enact the occasional combatant role, Consequently, weapons are controlled by a male-dominated hierarchy, and fewer women have arms to lay down than men. For example, in Timor-Leste more than 10,000 male ex-combatants registered for DDR assistance, but women ex-combatants who had carried arms and occasionally fought were excluded (UNIFEM 2004; Niner 2008). This restricts their opportunities in benefitting from rehabilitation programmes. Moreover, female combatants are not directly regarded as a threat to security because of which there is less of a focus on them in identification of programme beneficiaries. As females, much more than males, expect to face stigma from their societies for having stepped out of the bounds of relatively rigid and mostly rural communities, they hesitate in participating openly in disarmament. Often this is due to experiences of a past marked not only by deprivation, but also torture or rape. Their ambiguous relationship to weapons is a complicating factor adding to social withdrawal and psychological stress. For males holding weapons is culturally accepted and considered \u2018manly\u2019, as in many parts of Africa (Kingma 1996). That could also complicate handing over of arms, more so when arms-related civilian work (guards, private security) is available to men post-conflict. Demobilisation. Changing over from a conflict situation to peace includes the formal downsizing, disbanding or discharging of troops, generally under time pressure. Combatants who have been previously mobilized through a long period of marshalling, organizing, training, and equipping are assembled, disarmed and provided pre-discharge briefing and resources to encourage transition to a new life as quickly as possible. Demobilization of non- state armies becomes particularly critical in post-conflict circumstances, say, once a peace accord is accepted, one of the parties is defeated, or political circumstances change. In spite 8 of women soldiers now on the agenda of demobilization planning, in moving towards peace and attempts to prioritize stability over all else, demobilization tends to focus on males as the \u2018default\u2019. Females are seen as less disruptive than males. It is often assumed that their interests are automatically taken care of as part of \u2018families\u2019, as kin to male combatants. Females are commonly excluded from decision-making in demilitarization (Farr 2002). Their security at the cantonment stage, need for autonomy, including independent bank accounts, separate resettlement packages, their needs as war widows, female soldiers, combatants\u2019 wives, and supporters are distinct and cannot be addressed by simply adding the words \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female\u2019 to planning documents. Demobilization camps where men and women are housed, if prolonged, can become sites for gender-based sexualized violence. Women are often not even asked to report, given the complications in defining combatant status, for example, when females do not continuously wield weapons but are used for specific and limited combat operations. Even when recognized, they are often at lower levels in hierarchies and over represented in troops that are dismissed, reducing their negotiating power (Farr 2002). They are sometimes sent to refugee rather than demobilization camps once they change from military attire to feminine clothing, which excludes them from benefits and counseling. Even though woman warriors have traditionally been valorized as exceptional in some cases, the actual experiences of deprivation and exploitation faced by female combatants result in disappointment, compounded by their non-recognition as combatants, but rather as widows or supporters.

Women\u2019s realization that in reintegrating into post-war society, they are expected to limit their spheres of activities to traditional female-specific \u2018support\u2019 roles is difficult to accept. The case of Namibia, for example, illustrates the seemingly widely held perspective that women, after war, will return to the domestic realm of home and family: \u201cmen appreciate women who cook for them and they respect women who fought in the war with them, but after independence they did not really consider women as part of the liberation struggle\u201d (Shikola 1998). Female combatants often have to face the consequences of rape, real or presumed sexual activity, pregnancy, domestic violence, fear, and negative stigmatization of being ex-combatants who have killed and generally lived lives outside of conventional social norms. Many opt not to return to their communities, preferring to live in relative isolation or even relocate to be in exile (Bouta 2005). There tends to be an avoidance or fear of reintegration. 9 5. Way forward: Accounting for gender, strengthening assimilation \u201cThere is one more unknown than the soldier, it\u2019s his wife.\u201d (Karam\u00e9 et al. 1999) Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes (DDR) aim to facilitate the smooth assimilation, back into political and social life, of men and women involved in armed conflicts. Many of them have been in conflict situations for years, some their entire life. The challenges faced by combatants have strong gender dimensions that are yet to be fully understood and accepted by the larger society. Particular circumstances of female combatants have been neglected for a number of reasons, as seen above. How can these phases and programmes better respond to gender-specific concerns in post-conflict settings to strengthen assimilation of all and provide opportunities for women as much as men to lead as fulfilling lives as possible? The UN Security Council Resolution 1325 of 2000 aims to remove barriers to equal participation (UN 2005) in peace building. The 2004 UN Secretary General\u2019s report on women, peace and security to the Security Council says: \u201cResolution 1325 (2000) holds out a promise to women across the globe that their rights will be protected and that barriers to their equal participation and full involvement in the maintenance and promotion of sustainable peace will be removed. We must uphold this promise.\u201d It is vital to include all female ex-combatants irrespective of how they describe themselves or their revealed roles in armies. The overwhelming focus on male ex-combatants in rehabilitation and re-integration should be corrected to include those identified as wives and dependants. The example of Liberia is of interest where female supporters were identified as \u2018women associated with the fighting forces\u2019 rather than \u2018camp followers\u2019 so as to be included in the DDR process; women represented 24 per cent of those demobilized (UN 2005). Drawing on the 1325 (2000) resolution women\u2019s groups and other CSOs working on conflict and peace can galvanize efforts to raise awareness among media, governments, parliamentarians, ex-combatants and the larger civil society of the human and economic costs of conflict. This can provide a basis for discussions to include women and civil society. It can also be used by national and local women\u2019s organizations as a tool for advocacy and training. After the adoption of this resolution Gender Advisors have become the norm in peacekeeping operations. In some post-conflict countries women\u2019s share of parliamentary positions at the national level tends to be significantly higher than the global average of 16 per cent. In Nepal, for example, the share of women in parliament increased from 5.9 percent in April 2003 to over 33 percent in April 2009. In the case of Timor-Leste however, the share increased from 26 to over 29 percent for the same period (IPU 2003 and 2009). Social consensus around ideas of equality and wider participation in nation-building has contributed to affirmative measures and legislation, reducing male-female gaps in a relatively short time. There have also been other factors like fewer men available to fill the positions after a devastating war. The higher presence of women in law-making positions can be leveraged through orientation training for all first timers to strengthen explicit recognition of gender issues among legislators.

Self-help of this kind needs to be supported through policy. Special emphasis should be given to women\u2019s specific psychological conditions. Conflicting and changing roles and expectations, abduction, abuse and deprivation in the prime of their life, followed by a devaluing of their work should be taken into account in counseling and other support programmes. It is important that assistance is provided in safe settings that the ex-combatants can trust. Orientation is also useful for both male and female colleagues. On top of this, efforts should be made to include families as far as possible. Moreover, providing attention to individual women, as well as group counseling could provide enormous dividends. The specific physiological and health related concerns of the women arising from sexual abuse, transactional sex, domestic violence, pregnancies, child bearing, abortions and miscarriages etc., also require special attention in reintegration efforts to restore physical health. Complementarily programs that include building of support groups as well as market skills could include social mobilization, educational activities and financial support. The ex- combatants already have experience and skills used in conflict conditions that include self- confidence, organization, logistics, capacity to work under stress, driving, nursing, etc. These can be leveraged and re-oriented towards peace-time activities that are income generating and complemented by financial support. Programmes should be conceptualized and developed with direct inputs from key stakeholders. Working very closely with existing local civil society organizations, formal and informal women\u2019s networks and, most importantly, with ex-combatants themselves can yield good results. It is the ex-combatants who can help in better identification of those who can fall through the cracks, and also help in identifying the different rehabilitation and reintegration needs. The identification of roles undertaken, different capabilities, and recognition of different needs of women can help in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of DDR programmes. For the individuals themselves, as well as for the communities, successful reintegration of women and men into normal civil lives can contribute to enabling all individuals to lead productive and fulfilled lives, reduce disaffection and alienation, thus contributing to lasting peace and human development. Many of the capabilities and skills built in conflict phases without material reward can be used in peace time for remunerative and social development work. Although the size of the problem is not the same in Asia Pacific as in Africa, its intensity is severe because of strong patriarchies. Policies that are based on an explicit understanding of the different dimensions of the problem have a far greater probability of success. Notes 1.

The author describes observed patterns of political participation in Asia and the Pacific vis-\u00e0-vis different types of prevalent governments, electoral and legal systems, and examines if the situation in this region supports general observations. Gains and setbacks in political participation are further analyzed through a gender lens. The paper concludes with policy recommendations for addressing unequal participation of women and gender minorities in political processes.

Despite global commitments to advance women\u2019s political participation, women\u2019s visibility in political life generally remains low. Women, disadvantaged men, and minorities, such as people with disabilities and sexual minorities, often do not have a voice in formal and informal decision-making processes at the national, sub-regional, provincial or local levels. The muting of their voices often means that they have very little control and influence in shaping the development of their communities and countries, which often leads to the perpetuation of legislation and policies that are gender-blind or even discriminatory. Within the framework of gender-responsive and sustainable human development, the participation of women and gender minorities in governance is enhanced by increasing their rights, entitlements and capacities; and by providing the means for them to make gender-sensitive, informed and responsible choices as citizens, local or national leaders, or even as prominent personalities on the global stage. The effective participation of women in decision-making bodies, including in political institutions, is a keystone in the effort to attain gender equality. This paper aims to describe gender inequalities in the political participation of men, women and gender minorities in formal political structures within the Asia- Pacific region, analyse the factors that have led to this situation, and identify possible courses of action that may minimize or eliminate gender inequalities. The paper presents the results of documentary research, based on an extensive review and analysis of the literature on gender-based inequalities in relation to political power and decision-making in Asia and Pacific Island nations.i 4 I. GENDER EQUALITY: THE BEDROCK OF DEVELOPMENT Gender inequality stems from discrimination arising on account of gender, by itself, or in intersection with other factors \u2013 such as age, class or ethnicity. As recently as 2004, it was noted that differentiated norms based on socially constructed notions of gender continue to favour men and boys in the 21st century, giving them more access than women and girls to the capabilities, resources, and opportunities that are important to the enjoyment of social, economic, and political power (Grown and Gupta 2004). Gender relations based on patriarchy often deprive women of the right to own property in their own name and to secure credit so that they can be economically independent. These circumstances impede their ability to seek redress against domestic violence, to stand on equal ground with their spouses and other men, and to speak out for their rights. Women\u2019s domestication also raises the expectation that their first responsibility is to their families, leaving little", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d052f44-9c93-4af0-a314-72fe9384c81b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d052f44-9c93-4af0-a314-72fe9384c81b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "920da5e3992c30787e6e02cd0f4c1ee27c2cf98811d7d3d2e819161cf8b4abe2"}}, "hash": "920da5e3992c30787e6e02cd0f4c1ee27c2cf98811d7d3d2e819161cf8b4abe2", "text": "time for the meetings, consultations and study that enable them to connect community and national problems to their personal lives. Gender minority groups, including the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transsexual community (LGBT), are also victims of patriarchal values. They are often subjected to cultural, societal and family discrimination, social stigmatisation and violence. Laying claim to their rights is a problem since their existence as a discriminated sector or group is not even fully acknowledged. Depriving gender minority groups the freedom to express their sexual orientation and gender identity has implications on their ability to exercise their economic, civil and political rights. A rights-based approach to development holds government accountable for the realisation of human rights and development. However, the participation of claimholders from all sectors of society is seen as expedient to this process. As observed by the Millennium Project Task Force on Education and Gender Equality, \u201cthe representation of women in legislative bodies serves as an indicator of society\u2019s commitment to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment and has the potential to trigger more fundamental changes in gender relations and beliefs about appropriate gender roles\u201d (Grown and Gupta 2004, ix). Hence, it is highly critical to move 5 forward with the full and equal participation of women, men and gender minorities in governance mechanisms. The Right to Political Participation Equal participation of women and men in politics and governance is guaranteed by several international instruments. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights expressly states that \u201ceveryone has the right to take part in the government of his (her) country, directly or through freely chosen representatives\u201d (UN \u2013 OHCHR, 1948: Article 21). It identifies the will of the people as the bases of governance, which is to be expressed in genuine and periodic elections through the exercise of universal and equal suffrage. The preamble of the Convention on the Political Rights of Women (entered into force7 July, 1954) asserts that \u201ceveryone has the right to take part in the government of his (her) country directly or indirectly through freely chosen representatives, and has the right to equal access to public service in his (her) country\u2026\u201d (UN-DAW). To equalize the status of men and women in the enjoyment and exercise of political rights, state parties agreed that women shall be entitled to vote in all elections, be eligible for election to all publicly elected bodies, be entitled to hold public office and to exercise all public functions on equal terms with men, without any discrimination. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW, Article 7) extends the scope of women\u2019s political participation. It obliges state parties to eliminate discrimination against women in political and public life, and to ensure to women, on equal terms with men, the following rights: (a) to vote in all elections and public referenda and to be eligible for election to all publicly elected bodies; (b) to participate in the formulation of government policy and the implementation thereof and to hold public office and perform all public functions at all levels of government; and (c) to participate in non-governmental organisations and associations concerned with the public and political life of the country (CEDAW, entered into force on 3 September 1981, from UN-DAW). Article 8 extends this right to the international plane. It instructs state parties \u201cto take all appropriate measures to ensure to women, on equal terms with men and without any discrimination, the 6 opportunity to represent their Governments at the international level and to participate in the work of international organizations\u201d. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (UN-DAW 1995) further lays down the foundations for women\u2019s effective political participation. It calls on governments, the international community and civil society, including non- governmental organizations and the private sector, to (a) take \"measures to ensure women's equal access to, and full participation in, power structures and decision- making\" (BPA Strategic Objective G.1, in UN-DAW 1995) and (b) \"increase women's capacity to participate in decision-making and leadership\" (BPA Strategic Objective G.2, in UN-DAW1995). To ensure women's equal access to and full participation in power structures and decision-making, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (BPA) recommends that governments take the following Actions (UN-DAW 1995): \u2022 Take measures that encourage political parties to integrate women in elective and non-elective public positions in the same proportion and levels as men; \u2022 Protect and promote the equal rights of women and men to engage in political activities and to freedom of association, including membership in political parties and trade unions; \u2022 Review the differential impact of electoral systems on the political representation of women in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf4a1ca2-6c5e-4d69-bee3-282cb5d29c67": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf4a1ca2-6c5e-4d69-bee3-282cb5d29c67", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f425f58a507b5f33147052c9c24cb8b88afa2eb1cc22ab0ef58e1bbe7f5658d"}, "3": {"node_id": "22544151-aaf7-491e-84b6-a020f179b030", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32372d78753e642d1941f7802aa89cfc4e0db9b8fba8fc6d3145f37573e4ed2b"}}, "hash": "503ce3e3a8cf5470ecb0a5b21a6f9117d279c0776820cab782187e632135eb51", "text": "elected bodies and consider, where appropriate, the adjustment or reform of those systems. Political parties are enjoined to remove all barriers that directly or indirectly discriminate against the participation of women in its structures, allow women to participate fully in all their internal policy-making structures and nominating processes, incorporate gender issues in their political agenda, and take measures to ensure that women can participate in party leadership on an equal basis with men. The BPA then directs \u201cGovernments, national bodies, the private sector, political parties, trade unions, employers' organizations, sub-regional and regional bodies, non-governmental and international organizations and educational institutions\u201d to take actions that would increase women\u2019s capacity to participate in 7 decision-making and assume political leadership (UN-DAW 1995). Among these steps are to mentor and train inexperienced women in leadership and decision- making, public speaking and self-assertion, as well as in political campaigning; and to develop mechanisms and training that would encourage women to participate in the electoral process, political activities and other areas of leadership. In September 2000, the United Nations adopted the Millennium Declaration, which upholds the principles of \u201chuman dignity, equality and equity at the global level\u201d. It articulates one of the fundamental values of development in the 21st century to be the right of men and women to \u201clive their lives and raise their children in dignity, free from hunger and from the fear of violence, oppression or injustice\u201d, and to assure these rights through the exercise of democratic and participatory governance (UN September 2000). The third of the Millennium Development Goals is \u201cto promote gender equality and empower women.\u201d Indicators for its successful attainment by 2015 include the following: \u2022 Ratio of girls to boys in primary, secondary and tertiary education, \u2022 Share of women in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector, and \u2022 Proportion of seats held by women in national parliament. The choice of indicators in Goal three emphasises the perspective that pervasive gender inequality is a product of multiple sources of discrimination, especially as they relate to women\u2019s visibility and capacity to take an active part in their development. Women and girls, in the same way as men and boys, are entitled to broaden their capabilities through knowledge and education, avail of non-traditional choices for productive endeavors, and take part in crucial decisions that affect their security and well-being. Other international conventions and declarations reiterate and reaffirm the principle that the participation of women in public and political life is an inherent right. Among these are the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), the Declaration on the Right to Development (1986), and the Vienna Declaration from the World Conference on Human Rights (1993). 8 Absence of Defined Rights for Gender Minorities The same amount of attention has yet to be given to the right to political participation of gender minorities. As one group of gender advocates states:\u2026one significant absence in international human rights law has been an express articulation of the specific interests of sexuality minorities (PUCL-Karnataka 2001). At best, organisations of gender minorities are represented in meetings of the United Nations. ILGA-Europe was granted consultative status on December 11, 2006 along with the Danish National Association for Gays and Lesbians and the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany. In 2008, ECOSOC granted consultative status to the COC Netherlands and the State Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Transsexuals and Bisexuals of Spain (FELGTB). Both are national organisations representing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in the Netherlands and Spain (ILGA 2008). Lately, on July 19, 2010, the ECOSOC voted to grant consultative status to the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC). IGLHRCisone ofonly ten organisations working primarily for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender human rights to gain consultative status at the United Nations (ILGA 2010). More recently, an instrument was formulated by an international panel of experts to promote individual rights without distinction on the basis of sex, sexual orientation or gender identity. It was convened by the International Commission of Jurists and the International Service for Human Rights. The principles of the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity affirm the primary obligation of states to implement human rights (Corr\u00eaa and Muntarbhorn 2007). Additional recommendations to promote and protect human rights are addressed to other actors, including the UN human rights system, national human rights institutions, the media, non-governmental organisations, and funders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22544151-aaf7-491e-84b6-a020f179b030": {"__data__": {"id_": "22544151-aaf7-491e-84b6-a020f179b030", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f425f58a507b5f33147052c9c24cb8b88afa2eb1cc22ab0ef58e1bbe7f5658d"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf4a1ca2-6c5e-4d69-bee3-282cb5d29c67", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "503ce3e3a8cf5470ecb0a5b21a6f9117d279c0776820cab782187e632135eb51"}}, "hash": "32372d78753e642d1941f7802aa89cfc4e0db9b8fba8fc6d3145f37573e4ed2b", "text": "The Accountability Principle of the instrument states: Everyone whose human rights, including rights addressed in these Principles, are violated is entitled to have those directly or indirectly responsible for the violation, whether", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f123c460-741d-47fe-a0b4-8e0f51fee86d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f123c460-741d-47fe-a0b4-8e0f51fee86d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c15b9ddaf5b55af3d0fcc49f4161f9490427aab4ca9383e1203e7f6c138ace3c"}}, "hash": "c15b9ddaf5b55af3d0fcc49f4161f9490427aab4ca9383e1203e7f6c138ace3c", "text": "they are government officials or not, held accountable for their actions in a manner that is proportionate to the seriousness of the violation. There should be no impunity for 9 perpetrators of human rights violations related to sexual orientation or gender identity (Corr\u00eaa and Muntarbhorn 2007, 31). What now needs to be done is to be able to translate these principles of international human rights law into national legislations and policies. Examining Political Participation through Gender Lenses Governance is the exercise of economic, political and administrative authority to manage a country\u2019s affairs at all levels. It comprises mechanisms through which citizens and citizen groups can articulate their interests, exercise their rights, meet their obligations and mediate their differences (UNDP 2000). Through political participation and advocacy, citizens can take part in the governance of their society. Political participation can encompass a wide range of actions and strategies: voting and voter education, candidacy in national and local elections, lending support to candidates who carry gender-sensitive agenda, campaigning against those who have policies that are 'anti-women's rights', and advocating for the integration of a women's rights agenda in the platforms of candidates and parties (Bello 2003). Women\u2019s right to take part in decision-making extends likewise to other aspects of national and global existence that have impacts on their lives, as in the family, the community, economy and culture. A comprehensive understanding of the nature and dynamics of the participation of women and gender minorities in political life needs to consider the various ways by which gender constructs and power relations between women, men and minorities influence their capacity to operate at different levels of societyfrom the most personal to the highly public. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action premises its call to action on this thesis: Inequality in the public arena can often start with discriminatory attitudes and practices and unequal power relations between women and men within the family\u2026. The unequal division of labour and responsibilities within households based on unequal power relations also limits women's potential to find the time and develop the skills required for participation in decision-making in wider public forums (BPA, Par. 187). 10 Gender and Gender Identity Gender refers to the social, cultural and psychological aspects of traits, roles, norms and stereotypes associated with masculine and feminine behavior. It pertains to the observed continuum of behaviors and relationships between women and men across different societies, whether young or old, and across historical periods. Gender affects the range of individual identities, sexual preferences, social roles, entitlements, and social-political status that women or men can enjoy. Gender identity may be construed to correspond to certain behaviors and sexual orientations labeled as either \u2018feminine\u2019, \u2019masculine\u2019, or, \u2018somewhere in between.\u2019 It pertains to a person's sense of identification with either the male or female sex, as manifested in appearance, style of behavior, and other aspects of a person's life (Samelius and Wagberg 2005; Wells 2006; Statistics Canada 2008). Gender roles are the culturally defined behaviors, values, attitudes and beliefs associated with being a woman or a man, feminine or masculine (Doyle and Paludi 1995; Bem 1993). Through socialisation in the family and other social institutions, gender traits, roles, orientations and identities become deeply internalised, so that they seem to be \u2018natural\u2019 processes and are left unquestioned. As Bem notes, \u201cthe historically crude perception that women and men are fundamentally different from one another [and] the insidious use of that perceived difference as an organising principle for the social life of the culture\u201d forges a cultural connection between sex and virtually every other aspect of human experience (Bem 1993, 2). Public and Private Lives Rosaldo (1974) developed a structural framework that differentiates between the institutions and activities within which women and men move about and interact with each other, or with other individuals of the same sex. She locates men and women within the domestic and public spheres of activity, and postulates that what they do therein \u201cshapes a number of relevant aspects of human social structure and psychology\u201d (Rosaldo 1974, 23). The domestic sphere of human activity in Rosaldo\u2019s theory pertains to minimal institutions and modes of activity organised around one or more mothers and their children. It includes childcare, household management, providing food through 11 poultry, livestock or vegetable-raising, family-based agricultural work, and other activities needed to promote the survival, health and security of family members. Women are accorded little or no powers beyond their respective households, since they are not considered important contributors beyond their domestic domains. As such, Delphy (1984) identifies domestic production as the economic base of patriarchy, and concludes that the \u2018feminine personality\u2019", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ccbe702f-08b0-492a-908d-dbe9f3e4bce3": {"__data__": {"id_": "ccbe702f-08b0-492a-908d-dbe9f3e4bce3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29a1d12a4bdcfa23e970f56c6cd3208bcbb6b780dd921182b042f3a3e06f845c"}, "3": {"node_id": "b3ce5329-a9aa-4ded-a8e1-e550b5f7f246", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88fcf385801cdc31c24150ee31f386cbb6f896e49d9696102ecec7c9da1d5b49"}}, "hash": "d4edcdad961465ba790106f108dde30fda3fb237e517a8a75a6294050c3849fc", "text": "results from women\u2019s domestication. The public domain, in turn, is conceptualised as including \u201cactivities, institutions, and forms of association that link, rank, organize or subsume particular mother-child groups\u201d (Rosaldo 1974, 23). Productive work in the public domain includes the cultivation, processing or manufacture of goods, or the provision of services, which can be exchanged for money or for other products. Production in the public domain is critical in the accumulation of wealth, achievement of social status, assumption of political authority, and other forms of power. The public domain is principally organised as a masculine system, including political structures and processes. Relations of production and reproduction are found within every society. With the advent of industrialisation, the division between the spheres of social production (the public domain) and reproduction (domestic domain) became more distinct, especially because the organisation and relations at work largely took place away from the domicile. This arrangement further marginalised women and intensified the role of the \u2018housewife\u2019 as a career for women (Oakley 1974). The needs of urban- industrial society to look after the care and welfare of its producers also led to the development of relations of social reproduction: the socially organised labour necessary for life to continue, including work in schools, health facilities, markets, food shops, housing and other establishments that promote family welfare (Brenner and Laslett 1996). Similar to pre-industrial society, work within the spheres of social production and reproduction is highly gendered, and states become centers of \u2018public patriarchy\u2019. Research demonstrates the extent to which state policies have been shaped by gender relations, including policies relative to the institutions of social provisions, such as social assistance and social insurance programmes, citizens\u2019 entitlements, and 12 public services (Orloff 1996; Brenner and Laslett 1996; Bagchi 2000). By the same token, state policies tend to provide obstacles to women\u2019s political participation. Citizenship becomes a gendered construct, and privileges men (productive citizens who contribute to economic progress) over women (unpaid domestic care-givers and housewives). Social and cultural practices, coupled with policies that perpetuate the gender division of labour, have impeded the capacity of women to take part more intensively in the political life of their communities and nations. Thus, a broader understanding of governance needs to scrutinise the ways in which traditional understandings of women\u2019s \u2018private\u2019 roles in the family hinder their activities and aspirations to move outside of the domicile and into the public realm (Nussbaum 2003). The dialectic between traditional gender norms and the mounting commitment to gender equality needs to be better understood to enable women to become more active and significant agents of governance. Patriarchy defines the home as the realm for women\u2019s governance, but leaves the administration of the rest of society to men. The challenge is for women to cross this boundary, and to share with men the privilege and responsibility for development and nation-building. Simultaneously, gender equality requires that men also share more fully in the management of the daily requirements of family life. From the Closet to the Rostrum Traditional notions of gender also have implications for society\u2019s treatment of gender minorities. Gender minority groups include lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals, intersex individuals, persons with unusual gender-personalities, individuals with unusual sex-scripts (paraphilias), people living as members of the other sex, transvestites, and everyone else commonly lumped together under the catch-all term \u2018transgender\u2019 (Samelius 2005; Park 2003). The term LGBT has often been used to categorize these groups. It usually refers to the modern/postmodern context of emerging sexual identity categories, and not to any traditional sexual minority groups/identities that predated its existence (Kole 2007), and which may have had circumscribed roles in their respective cultures. Socially accepted norms are built on the basis of the assumed correspondence yet distinction between sexual identity (born as male or female) and gender identity (exhibiting masculine or feminine traits). Across many cultures however, socially- 13 acceptable expressions of gender identities other than the stereotype of male-as- masculine and female-as-feminine may be found (Samelius 2005; Murray 2002;Doyle and Paludi 1995).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3ce5329-a9aa-4ded-a8e1-e550b5f7f246": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3ce5329-a9aa-4ded-a8e1-e550b5f7f246", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29a1d12a4bdcfa23e970f56c6cd3208bcbb6b780dd921182b042f3a3e06f845c"}, "2": {"node_id": "ccbe702f-08b0-492a-908d-dbe9f3e4bce3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4edcdad961465ba790106f108dde30fda3fb237e517a8a75a6294050c3849fc"}}, "hash": "88fcf385801cdc31c24150ee31f386cbb6f896e49d9696102ecec7c9da1d5b49", "text": "In India, for instance, traditional sexual minority groups (or identities) include the hijiras, kothis, kinnars, panthis, jogtas, dangas, alis, double-deckers, chhakkas, dhuranis, and other indigenous communities who identify and relate themselves by sexual practices (Kole 2007). Early accounts of gender identities in pre-Hispanic Philippine society likewise describes the presence of male transvestite shamans who dressed as women to perform spiritual rituals, and assumed stereotypical feminine behavior. They married other males, but there were also examples of male shamans marrying women even while maintaining homosexual relations (Brewer 2004).

In Melanesia, homosexual intercourse is prescribed, not just condoned (Murray 2002). It is an age-defined pattern, based on the belief that homosexual intercourse was necessary to pass on semen to young boys. In Tahiti, there are the mahu and the raerae. A man who lives a female role in the village and who does not engage in sexual activity would be a mahu, whereas somebody who does not perform a female's village role and who dresses and acts like a man, but who indulges in exclusive or preferred sexual behavior with other men would be raerae (Murray 2002, 938). Between women, homosexuality was common, and lesbians were generally known as nimomogh iap nimomogh, meaning 'woman has intercourse with woman' (Deacon 1934, cited in Murray 2002). Javanese warriors were said to have kept boys who were young and effeminate (gemblakan). In Korea, the hwarang were age-stratified, but apparently not effeminised. In Japan, \u2018love between comrades\u2019 was said to have flourished among samurai warriors. Mahayana Buddhist monks also had their own forms of relationships with novices (Samelius 2005; Murray 2002, 939). Outside of these contexts, in modern times, preference for same-sex partners or other forms of sexual gratification and orientation have generally remained hidden in the sphere of \u2018private lives\u2019. It is when these preferences emerge into the public eye that such behavior is met with ridicule, discrimination, ostracism, abuse and neglect. 14 Suicide and murder have not too infrequently resulted from social reactions to unacceptable gender identity behaviors. Since public political life is a highlymasculine domain, it has been difficult for members of gender minorities to emerge from \u2018the closet\u2019 and to find acceptance as political leaders. Patriarchy, or masculine norms, works against the interests of gender minorities as much it does against women\u2019s rights. This has become the basis for sexual (or gender) identity politics, the quest for the recognition of the rights and entitlements of atypical (or minority) gender groups. Given these realities, it is important to examine how gender ideology influences the ability of women, men and gender minorities to take part in the public realm of politics and state management so that they are able to promote their interests and rights. II. THE POLITICAL PROGESS OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES Development, Democratisation, Human Rights and Political Participation A rights-based approach to the promotion of human-development is based on the normative assumption that people worldwide subscribe to the values of democracy. Democratic processes are deemed important, since they entail the active, free and meaningful participation of all citizens in development and in the fair distribution of the resulting benefits (Novak 2005). Implicit in the Millennium Declaration are values linked to democratisation. It identifies the fundamental values essential to international relations in the twenty-first century to include the following: freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature and shared responsibility (United Nations Millennium Declaration 2000, 2). Good governance, therefore, is democratic governance. It applies democratic principles, norms and institutions for economic growth and the development of human potentials. It is people-centered and participatory, ensures freedom from discrimination based on race, ethnicity, class, gender or any other attribute, and guarantees that women are equal partners with men in private and public spheres of life and decision-making (Welch and Nuru 2006). Democratic governance becomes gender-responsive when it takes into account the economic, social, and cultural conditions that influence the opportunities of women and gender minorities to take part in a wide range of governance-related activities (Nussbaum 2003). 15 Enlarging the capacity of women to become involved in the political life and decision-making processes of their nations is a key feature of human development. Signatories to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action recognised this: Women's equal participation in political life plays a pivotal role in the general process of the advancement of women. Women's equal participation in decision-making is not only a demand for simple justice or democracy but can also be seen as a necessary condition for women's interests to be taken into account (BPA, Par. 183). Parliamentarians have affirmed the importance of women\u2019s participation in politics.

Democratic freedoms such as freedom of expression, opinion, assembly, association and other civil and political rights coincide with the possession of suffrage rights. Progress in achieving political and civil rights have increased substantially since the eighties. 82 countries, representing 57 percent of the world\u2019s population, are now fully democratic. 81 countries have taken significant steps in democratisation, various coups have overthrown 46 elected governments, and 33 military regimes have been replaced by civilian governments. Consequently, multiparty elections are now held in 140 of the world\u2019s 193 countries, or in 75 percent of all nation-states (UNDP 2007). In contrast, in absolute or constitutional monarchies or sultanates, both women and men many be barred from enjoying the right to vote or to be voted in as public officials. This is the case in Brunei, a constitutional sultanate, where both women and men have been denied the right to vote or to stand for election since 1962. In August 16 2000, a review of the Constitution was submitted to the Sultan for approval, and \"an element of an election\" was included in the report (US Department of State 2002). Despite this, popular elections have not been held. In the United Arab Emirates, parliament is appointed by the sultan, and in Saudi Arabia, men (but not women) were allowed to vote for the first time only in 2005 (IWDC 2008). With the exception of Brunei, women in other Asia-Pacific nations have won the right to suffrage. It was also in this region where women were first given the right to vote: New Zealand gave women suffrage rights in 1893 (IPU 2008). A brief summary of this historic moment is reproduced in Box 1 (from NZHistory 2009): Box 1. 'The Summit at Last' The suffrage campaign in New Zealand began as part of a broad movement for women's rights in Europe toward the end of the 19th-century. It spread through Britain and its colonies, the United States and northern Europe. The women\u2019s suffrage movement was shaped by a strong desire among the feminists of the period to attain equal political rights for women, and a determination to use them for the moral reform of society, as for example, for the prohibition of alcohol use (NZHistory 2009). In 1869, Mary Ann M\u00fcller, using the name 'Femina' wrote \u201cAn appeal to the men of New Zealand\u201d, advocating political rights for women. She said (NZHistory 2009): \u2018[What] can be said for a Government that deliberately inflicts injury upon a great mass of its intelligent and respectable subjects; that virtually ignores their existence in all that can contribute to their happiness as subjects; that takes a special care to strike at the root of their love of country by teaching them that they have no part in forming or maintaining its glory, while it rigidly exerts from them all penalties; even unto death? \u2026 This is a question that has of late been agitated in England, and women in this colony read, watch, and reflect. \u2026 [It] has struck the writer of these few pages that I might not be wholly vain to make an appeal to the men of this our adopted land.\u2019 Femina was only one of several women in New Zealand who began to write about women\u2019s rights, especially on their right to vote. A number of New Zealand's leading male politicians also supported women's suffrage. In 1878, 1879 and 1887, several bills or amendments extending the vote to women were introduced and only narrowly failed to pass in parliament. Figure 1. Typical Anti Suffrage Cartoon, Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand. NZHistory.2009. [http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/ photo/anti-womens-suffrage- cartoon]. 17 Meanwhile, the suffrage movement gathered momentum, especially following the establishment in 1885 of a New Zealand Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Its leaders organised a series of signature campaigns on the women\u2019s right to vote, and submitted these petitions to parliament. In 1893, nearly 32,000 signatures were obtained \u2013 representing almost a quarter of the adult European female population in New Zealand. Despite divisions in the legislature over women\u2019s suffrage rights, and a petition from the liquor industry to reject it, an Electoral Bill containing provisions on women's suffragewas easily passed in the house following the presentation of the massive third petition to the legislative council.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82d46cdd-e7ec-42b5-8be7-273d057e8585": {"__data__": {"id_": "82d46cdd-e7ec-42b5-8be7-273d057e8585", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e380e712be9b1ecdd6bec4a032641166c1d63b2915a707bfa5749d67c65f474"}, "2": {"node_id": "787fa101-e172-46c6-9ca6-90bedba62488", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a9dbe5a677df565814b144a25e8c93d942c32ad6e776377fa89d6732ac12f9b"}}, "hash": "33a611da8fe9351bc82f016087a530f5b7109e3431c272e88ba6748593de334a", "text": "The battle was still not over however, as new anti- suffrage petitions were circulated, and some members of the Legislative Council petitioned the governor to withhold his consent.

Following the Second World War, many more Asia-Pacific nations granted suffrage to women (Table 1, adapted from IPU 2008). Figure 2.

Last accessed October 2008. Like their counterparts in New Zealand, Australian and Filipino women engaged in actively organising local women also came into contact with feminists from Europe and the United States. These early advocates were among those who led the campaign for women\u2019s rights in their respective countries. In other states, suffrage rights coincided with the release of a nation from colonialism, as in Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Laos and Cambodia. In other Asian nations, suffrage was part of the democratic rights granted under a socialist or communist government, as in the Central Asian republics, China and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. In Japan, it was one of the rights included in the post-war Constitution, which was heavily influenced by American libertarian ideals. In other countries, as in Tonga and Nepal, women\u2019s suffrage rights followed a shift from an absolute or descendant monarchy to a constitutional monarchy.

Constitutional Guarantees to Equality in Political Rights State parties, in their reports to the Commission on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, emphasise that political rights are part of the basic law of their states (from CEDAW State Parties Reports): o The Constitution of Bangladesh guarantees equal opportunities for women in politics and public life. o It is stipulated in the Constitution of China that women enjoy the same rights to vote and to stand for election as men, and these provisions are being implemented accordingly. o The Constitution of India guarantees equal political rights to women and men. They include the right to vote, right to contest elections, right to hold public office and right to form associations and unions. It also provides for positive discrimination in favour of women. o Article 24 of the Laos Constitution (1991) states \u201cLao citizens of both sexes enjoy equal rights in political, economic, cultural, social and family affairs\u201d.

Source: State Party Reports to CEDAW The grant of suffrage is a first step to enable women to take part in the governance of their nations. To what extent have women taken advantage of this right 20 in Asia and Pacific nations? Reports for CEDAW provide a few insights (from CEDAW State Parties Reports): o Bangladesh: In 1997, half-a-million women voters took part in the Union Parishad election (local elections) (CEDAW, 3 January 2003); o Malaysia: In 1999, there were a total of 9,509,332 registered voters, of which 49.8 percent were women and 50.2 percent were men (CEDAW, 12 April 2004); o Philippines: The turn out rate for women voters in the May 2001 national and local elections was 76.7 percent versus 75.9 percent among the men CEDAW, 2 August 2004); o Thailand: Data collected from 1995 to 2004 indicate that 52.32 percent of women at all levels exercised their right to vote (CEDAW, 24 June 2004). o India: Voter turnout of women in national elections has increased steadily over three decades: from 46.63 percent in 1962 to 49.11 percent in 1971; 51.35 percent in 1991; and 58.88 percent in 1998. Voter turnout of the men also increased within the same period, but not at the same rate, rising only from 63.31percent in 1962 to 65.75 percent in 1998 (from IDEA, accessed 2008-a). Additionally, state parties\u2019 reports reveal that more women tend to take part in local than in national election processes. In Thailand, for example, more than half of the votes cast in municipal and provincial council elections were from women. Yet in Bangladesh, whilst many more women participate in the elections for the rural-based Union Parishad, there has been a remarkable increase in women voters\u2019 participation in parliamentary elections from 1996 and 2001(UN DAW 2000). Women\u2019s Representation across Political Systems An important aspect of political participation is the right of women to be able to \u2018stand for elections\u2019 or to be voted into office. In some nations, the grant of the right to vote did not automatically include the right to be voted to political positions. At times, restrictions were also placed on who could take part in elections, considering factors such as women\u2019s land ownership or education. 21 For example, while New Zealand granted suffrage rights to women in 1893, the right to stand for elections was given only in 1919. Australia lifted all restrictions to the right to vote and to be voted upon only in 1962 (see Table 1). Myanmar granted women suffrage in 1935 but they could stand for election only in 1946. Women of Papua New Guinea won the right to stand for elections in 1963, but were allowed to vote only the following year (IPU 2008). Similarly, in North America, Canada gave women the right to vote in 1918 but they could only be voted into office in 1920, and this was subject to certain restrictions that were lifted only as recently as 1960. There is no information, however, that sexual orientation or gender identity has been a restricting factor for enfranchisement. The opportunity for women to be voted into parliaments or legislatures, or to occupy executive positions of governance, may vary in relation to the forms of government and their attendant political institutions, such as the electoral system and political parties. Moreover, stereotypes attached to the public-private divide in gender identities which locates women within the private sphere (see section entitled Examining Political Participation through Gender Lenses) may reproduce women\u2019s powerlessness in governance and political life (Nussbaum 2003). Trends in the political participation of women will now be analysed in the context of the political systems present within the Asia-Pacific Region. Forms of Government in Asia and the Pacific There are many systems of government present in the contemporary world.

Instead, capsule biographies taken from various sources, including their official websites, are presented here, to provide some insights on the character and performance of three women CEOs of government and one head of state in the Asia- Pacific Region (see Boxes 3-6). 25 Box 3. \u2018Ate Glo\u2019 (Sister Glo) Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (often referred to as GMA) is the 14th President of the Republic of the Philippines, acting as both Head of State and Head of Government. She is the daughter of a past president (Diosdado Macapagal), graduated magna cum laude with a degree in commerce, and has a Ph.D. in Economics. She won as Senator in 1992, and was re-elected in 1995. She then ran as Vice- President in a coalition ticket of the LAKAS-NUCD-KAMPI and won by a landslide vote in 1998. She was appointed Secretary of Social Welfare and Development by President Joseph Estrada until 2001. In January of that year, President Estrada was removed from office on charges of massive corruption through a people\u2019s power revolution. As the constitutional successor, Vice-President Macapagal\u2013Arroyo was sworn into office as President on January 20, 2001. During her first term, Macapagal-Arroyo declared her priorities to include four strategies to \u201cwin the war against poverty within a decade\u201d (KGMA 2009): free enterprise appropriate to the 21st century, a modernised agriculture sector, a \u201csocial biastowards the disadvantaged\u201d and morality in government. In none of her speeches on the state of the nation however, did she articulate a clear agenda for empowering women. Her first cabinet included women in strategic positions: as secretaries of Social Welfare, Labour and Employment, Science and Technology, Trade and Industry, Budget and Management. Women known for their gender advocacy also led the National Anti-Poverty Commission and the Peace Panel. Following Macapagal- Arroyo\u2019s re-election in 2004 however, a majority of these women executives resigned out of indignation for alleged vote-rigging in the presidential elections. GMA supported the Philippines\u2019 Framework Plan for Women, which focuses on the economic empowerment of women, good governance and respect for women\u2019s rights. Under her administration, three important legislations have been passed: the Anti-Violence against Women and Children Act, the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, and the Magna Carta of Women (an omnibus law which translates the provisions of CEDAW). GMA\u2019s religious convictions was an obstacle to the implementation of a clearly- defined reproductive health program, a fact that did not escape the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 2007 (CEDAW Concluding Comments 2007). Her administration has also been accused of an escalating record of human rights violations, including the arrest and even elimination of women human rights activists. In the official Mid-Term Report on the MDGs, it was admitted that the nation may be unable to meet the goals set for equalising access to primary education (the indicator for gender equality), reducing maternal mortality and providing access to reproductive healthcare (NEDA-UNCT 2007). GMA is married to lawyer and businessman Jose Miguel Arroyo. They have three children, two sons and a daughter. Their sons sit in the lower house as representatives of different electoral districts.

As Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina adopted a number of policies for the overall development of the nation, focusing on poverty alleviation. Her leadership led to the adoption for the first time by UN General Assembly of a resolution on the role of microcredit in the eradication of poverty. She has also been a strong advocate for the Culture of Peace, and was instrumental in pushing for the declaration by the UN of the period 2001 - 2010 as the International Decade for Culture of Peace and Non- Violence for the Children of the World. Along with poverty eradication, Prime Minister Hasina highlighted the importance of the empowerment of women. She passed legislation to ensure adequate representation of women in local government bodies, leading to the election of more than 14,000 women to these bodies in 1997. She took major initiatives to stop violence against women and children. She provided leadership in the field of education, particularly for the education of girls in her own country, as well as advocating for global support on the issue. She paid special attention to healthcare, family planning, nutrition, women\u2019s rights and survival and development of children. She has been a major voice in the UN in support of the cause of children and their rights. At the Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in South Africa in 1998, her proposal for a convention on the right to development was endorsed by the heads of state and governments. She initiated the establishment of a National Human Rights Commission and the office of Ombudsperson as well as Bangladesh\u2019s recent accession to six major human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. She is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilise women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women's development. Despite these apparent achievements, Sheikh Hasina was accused of bribery and corruption while in government, and of masterminding the killing of political rivals. She was arrested on charges of extortion in 2008 but later released for medical reasons. 27 On December 29, 2008, the Bangladesh Awami League led a grand alliance to a landslide victory in the Ninth Parliamentary Election, winning 262 of 299 seats in the National Parliament.

Helen Clark: Mother of the House Helen Clark was the eldest of four daughters of a farming family. She graduated with honours in 1974 and wrote on political behavior and representation for her Ph.D. dissertation. She was a lecturer in political studies at Auckland University before she entered politics, although her involvement in political work started during her college days, as a member of the Labour Party (Rt Hon Helen Clark 2009). Clark was first elected as a member of parliament in 1981, and constantly distinguished herself in this position. She was chairperson of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Select Committee, the ad hoc Disarmament and Arms Control Select Committee, and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. She was a member of the Government Administration Select Committee and convened the External Affairs and Security Committee. She served as a government delegate to the 1985 World Conference in Nairobi to mark the end of the United Nations Decade for Women. In 1986, she was awarded the annual Peace Prize of the Danish Peace Foundation for her efforts toward international peace and disarmament. Later in her career as minister of parliament, Clark held three important portfolios in the New Zealand government: as minister of conservation, housing, labour and health. In 1989, she became the first female New Zealander to become deputy prime minister, and in 1990, was the first woman member of the Privy Council. Helen Clark first became prime minister on November 27, 1999 as a candidate of the coalition formed by the Labour Party and the Alliance Party. By that time, she held the distinction of being the longest running female MP in parliament, earning for herself the moniker\u2018Mother of the House\u2019.

She had set up hostels for working women in Mumbai and Delhi, an Engineering College for rural youth, the Shram Sadhana Trust which engages in multifarious welfare activities for development of women, an Industrial Training School for the visually handicapped, schools for poor children, a Farmers\u2019 Training Centre, and the Mahila Vikas Mahamandal, a Maharashtra State Government undertaking for the development of women. As president, Smt. Pratil has only a constitutional role in Indian politics. Nevertheless, she has not hesitated to voice her opinion on sensitive social issues. In the wake of spiraling crimes like rape and molestation against Indian women, the president emphasised the need for women's security at work places and insists on strict penalties against sexual harassment. She asserts that women should learn self- defence techniques like judo and karate, in order to build their self-confidence to face life's challenges. She has said, \"I am deeply committed to the cause of education and would like to see every person, man and woman, boy and girl, be touched by the light of modern education. Empowerment of women is particularly important to me as I believe this leads to the empowerment of the nation\" (Lal 2008). Smt. Patil was the niece of an influential progressive social activist from northern Maharashtra. She is married to Dr. Devisingh Ramsingh Shekhawat, who earned a Ph.D. in Chemistry. An educator and social worker in his own right, he became the first Mayor of Amravati Municipal Corporation, and represented the Amravati constituency as its MLA. They have two children, a daughter and a son. Source: Extracted from The President of India. Pratibha Devisingh Patil. [http://presidentofindia.nic.in/profile.html].

The profile of the women heads of state from Asia tends to confirm the observation that most women leaders in the region are from the privileged classes, who trace their ascent to power to relationships with male political leaders: as wife of a slain leader or daughter of an older, if not a deceased politician (CAPWIP 1999; 29 Lithgow 2000). The three women heads of government featured here, President Arroyo, PM Hasina and PM Clark (Boxes 3 to 5), and the lone head of state, Smt.

These range from India\u2019s caste system and Pakistan\u2019s feudal landlords to Sri Lanka\u2019s strong Buddhist dependent-arising culture and the Marian culture of the predominantly Roman Catholic Philippines\u201d (Lithgow 2000, 4). In their younger years, both Macapagal-Arroyo and Clark worked as professors, and they applied their academic background in their work as Chief Executives: the first by focusing on economic programmes and the second on political representation and foreign policy. PMs Hasina and Clark were political activists in their early careers, and this helped propel them to the leadership position in their respective parties, which for some time represented the opposition in their nation- states. President Pratil was a practicing lawyer who devoted herself to the defence of poor women before becoming a politician. In all cases, the top women leaders in Asia and the Pacific were catapulted to their positions through political alliances and coalitions. Two different political parties put up Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as a coalition candidate in 1998. Helen Clark first became Prime Minister when the coalition between the Labour Party and several smaller parties through the Alliance Party won a majority in 1999. Sheikh Hasina became Prime Minister in January 2009 after the Bangladesh Awami League led a grand alliance to a landslide victory. Smt. Pratil was a compromise candidate of the United Progressive Alliance and its allies. Prior to their election to the highest positions in their respective countries, these women served as legislators, often as members of the opposition. They became distinguished through assuming leadership in legislative and executive committees or departments. Most of them worked in departments associated with women\u2019s concerns: 30 health, housing, social welfare and education. It was only Helen Clark who chaired committees often led by men: disarmament, arms control, and labour. In all cases, the spouses of these women politicians have been supportive of their careers. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo\u2019s husband avers: \"I saw how bored she was, wasting away that intelligence (as a homemaker). So I told her she could go back to school, do what she wanted and I'd support her. I've supported her ever since\" (from KGMA 2009). Helen Clark, an avowed feminist, married her partner of five years shortly before she first ran for politics (reluctantly, it is said). He remained in academe even while Clark maintained a high-profile public life, and achieved international recognition in the field of medical sociology (Univ. of Aukland 2004).Hasina\u2019s spouse, Dr. Wazed Miah, was a nuclear scientist and former head of the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission. He did not take any undue favour, even when his wife was the most powerful person of the country. But his health suffered considerably when Shiekh Hasina was incarcerated. He passed away in May 2009 (Asian Tribune 2009).Dr. Shekhawat, husband of Smt. Pratil is a scientist but also a public official in his own right. He is an educationist and a social worker who became the first Mayor of the Amravati Municipal Corporation (The President of India 2008). In 2006, three women Heads of Government from Asia were ranked as among the World\u2019s Most Powerful Women (MacDonald & Schoenberger 2006): Helen Clark (#20), Kaleda Zia, former Prime Minister of Bangladesh (#33) and Gloria Macapagal\u2013Arroyo (#45). The annual ranking represents a composite measure: \u201cThe economic component of the ranking considers job title and past career accomplishments, as well as the amount of money the woman controls\u201d (Egan and Schoenberger 2008). In 2008, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo again made it to the list, this time occupying rank #41 (Egan and Schoenberger 2008). In different ways, all the women heads of government imbued developmental goals into their policies. Both Macapagal-Arroyo and Hasina have focused on anti- poverty programmes, and all three have been concerned with peace, non-violence against women, health and education. Neo-liberal policies characterised the governments of Macapagal-Arroyo and Clark, with emphasis on the development of business, tourism and other programmes that can attract foreign investments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aecf4911-e85a-4179-8be0-0b637d962524": {"__data__": {"id_": "aecf4911-e85a-4179-8be0-0b637d962524", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db35158d6dd4c92ae0c422c2c97125264269c0bb940b7b13ca4efe92f6fc8561"}, "2": {"node_id": "1cef67d8-d917-489d-bad0-b59946a3facb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d0522d17deb6e81450ed8b719d683db20b5368897def50bc70e49d836fdd459"}}, "hash": "e68d5ffb1c609b93fc77354d1c67f4da396c9e94a678f40553d08ab0fba3ce1f", "text": "Clark\u2019s 31 liberal government is also remembered for its policies to reduce inequalities in New Zealand, especially with respect to Maori rights.

Thus, having a woman head of state or of government does not automatically provide an advantage to the agenda for women\u2019s advancement and gender equality. In the developing nations of Asia, aid dependence and a neo-liberal policy environment also serve as additional constraints to the promotion of a gender equality agenda. As noted by the UNRISD (2005): Like male politicians, women address the issues of concern to their constituents and their parties, and for those representing traditional social groups or conservative parties, gender equality may not be on their agenda (UNRISD 2005, 162)\u2026 [S]traitened economic circumstances and aid dependence limit resources available for progressive gender-related policies, and tend to sideline social concerns in favour of promoting national economic growth and improving the investment environment (UNRISD 2005,163). Gender and Gender-Responsive Governance While having women as heads of state is an achievement, it does not mean that male-led governments cannot work for the attainment of a gender equality agenda. President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines, for instance, was instrumental in passing the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development in 1995, and for strengthening the women\u2019s national machinery, two measures which provided the national machinery greater influence in mainstreaming gender within government. Prime Minister Junichuro Koizumi pushed for, and his cabinet approved a gender equality plan to put more women in leadership positions (Lewis 2005). Known as the 32 \u201cfemale re-challenge plan,\u201d it is composed of a series of measures to improve employment conditions for women and encourage their return to work after maternity leave. The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dato' Sri Mohd Najib Bin Tun HajI AbdulRazaksubscribed to the incorporation of women in the process of development, and the equitable sharing of resources and access to opportunities, since the Sixth Malaysia Plan. He also supported legislation to protect the rights and dignity of women, and the establishment of institutional and administrative machinery to plan, coordinate, implement and monitor the development of women (from the official website of the Prime Minister 2009). President Kim Dae-Jung of the Republic of Korea identified the creation of the Ministry of Gender Equality as one of his most important achievements, along with winning the Nobel Peace Prize, during his term in office. The Ministry is charged with handling discrimination issues as well as developing policies to improve opportunities for women (MOGEF 2010). In the final analysis, it is not the gender identity of a head of government that matters, but the extent to which he or she pushes forward the agenda of gender equality and development in policy, legislation and political action. In addition, the espousal of gender equality by heads of state or government should be analysed in relation to the continuing struggle for political empowerment waged by the women\u2019s movement, whose groups lobby and advocate incessantly until they attain their goals, by putting pressure on politicians to sit up and take notice. Women in Chambers The parliament (or the legislature) is a key institution in promoting citizens\u2019 representation and guaranteeing their equal participation. The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) identifies representativeness of the membership in parliament as a key characteristic of a democratic institution, that it has to be socially and politically representative of the diversity of the people, as well as ensuring equal opportunities and protection for all its members (IPU 2005). Diversity transcends gender; it refers to women and men of different classes, ethnic and geographic origins, interests, productive capacities and gender identities. 33 Women parliamentarians assert that equity in the representation of women in parliament is \u201ca matter of equality and justice\u201d and that a government where women are only marginally represented cannot be a true democracy. Women in parliament can transform the patriarchal culture of politics, from that of being adversarial to one of greater consensus. Their presence in parliaments can also re-direct legislative priorities to deriving solutions to problems of poverty, education, health and other social concerns (Waring,Greenwood, and Pintat 2000). The question to be addressed in this section is: to what extent have states been democratic, in terms of embodying equal representation of women and men in decision-making institutions and processes of governance? Legislative Mechanisms In any one of the systems of government, the legislatureiii is the deliberative assembly with the responsibility and power to make laws (UNDP 2009). Unicameral assemblies dominate the structure of legislative assemblies in Asia and Oceania by almost two to one, which conforms to the general observation that this is the preferred legislative form in small countries (IPU 2009).

Among 44 countries within the region, only 13, or close to 30 percent, have bicameral assemblies. These states are mainly the constitutional monarchies (Bhutan, Thailand, and Cambodia), federal and parliamentary democracies (Malaysia, Australia, Japan, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and the Cook Islands), two republics (Philippines and Fiji) and a constitutional government in free association with the United States (Palau). All the communist governments in North East Asia govern through unicameral assemblies, as do most of the nations in the Pacific and South East Asia. There is no elected legislature in Brunei, a constitutional sultanate, or in 35 Myanmar where a Military Junta governs through the State Peace and Development Council. Women\u2019s Visibility in the Legislature The UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) recommended in 1990 that a critical 30 percent participation threshold be regarded as the minimum level essential to women's ability to influence key decisions and be taken seriously as equal participants in these decisions (UNDP 1995). In 2005, CSW presided over an intergovernmental meeting to review and appraise progress made in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (UN DAW 2005). The increased presence of women in formal political institutions and elected assemblies was noted as an area where significant advances had occurred since 1995. It was reported that the average proportion of women in national assemblies, within the period from 1995 to 2004, had almost doubled, reaching 16 percent worldwide (Molyneux and Rasavi 2006; IPU 2005). While this was a welcome indicator of progress in the quest for gender equality, it was still far from achieving the desired \u2018critical mass\u2019 of at least 30 percent of the seats in parliaments being filled by women.

Towards the end of 2008, the total number of women in legislative houses per country was as follows: in the Americas - 21.5 percent, in Europe (excluding Nordic countries) - 19.5 percent, in Asia \u2013 18.1 percent, in Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 18.2 percent, in the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42bf0048-ac84-4038-bb11-48627ba13607": {"__data__": {"id_": "42bf0048-ac84-4038-bb11-48627ba13607", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c61b4ead960b672211fef6ce877577d0f8fc30e3321aaada2dbf67d037f4b7aa"}, "3": {"node_id": "3c030c9f-0b70-4201-bd91-64b8342405b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "396cda95c8274f386e8557e447229d1b7145ef9eebb1bb5a5f2f45631a5fb518"}}, "hash": "e05f3374af77ec29f822b37dbe22b908c00eb2ed3b9cf273da4e0adaf89ef59c", "text": "Pacific \u2013 15.2 percent, and in Arab states - 9.1 percent (IPU 2008-a). 36 Table 4.

Among 189 countries who submitted data on the composition of their national parliaments by the end of November 2008, Rwanda occupies the first rank in terms of the percentage of women in parliament (IPU 2009).There were more women than men occupying the lower house of Rwandan Parliament (56.3 percent), while 35 percent of the seats in the upper house were held by women. This is an improvement over women\u2019s participation in Rwanda\u2019s Parliament in 2003: 48.8 percent of seats in the lower house were won in that election by women along with 34.6 percent of those in the upper house. Sweden and Cuba occupy the next two ranks (in that order) and 10 other European states are in the 1st quartile,iv including the other Nordic countries, Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Iceland, Germany, Switzerland and Portugal. Two Latin American nations have also overcome the critical threshold, namely Argentina, ranked sixth with 40 percent women in its lower house and 39 percent in the upper house; and Costa Rica, ranked ninth with 37 percent women parliamentarians in its unicameral assembly. Two African states also belong to the uppermost quartile: Angola, ranked eighth with 37.3 percent women in parliament, and Mozambique, 37 ranked thirteenth with 34.8 percent of the seats in its unicameral assembly occupied by women (IPU 2008-a). In contrast, only two countries in Asia and the Pacific are in the uppermost quartile, and have attained the recommended critical threshold (see Table 5): Rank 14 New Zealand 33.6 percent [Unicameral Assembly] Rank 16 Nepal 33.2 percent [Unicameral Assembly] Table 5.

Note: There were tied ranks in the table, ending at rank no. 137 (Guinea-Bissau). Bangladesh is not included in the table, since its parliament had remained dissolved by this date, & elections occurred only in December 2008. 1 No women were elected in 2008, but one woman was appointed to the cabinet, and she also seats in the parliament. Other Asian nations in the first quartile, but which have yet to reach the critical threshold in both houses, are the following: Timor-Leste, Afghanistan, Australia and Viet Nam. Six Asian states are in the second quartile, beginning with Lao PDR and ending with the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. In all these countries, the number of women in lower chambers exceeded 20 percent. Among the Western nations, Canada (#46), Italy (#52), the United Kingdom (#60) and France (#65) are also in the second quartile. The United States tops the list of countries in the third quartile, ranked 69, with only 17 percent of seats in both legislative chambers occupied by women (IPU 2008). Chile is also in this quartile (#79), has 15 percent women in the lower chamber and only five percent in the upper chamber. There are six Asian countries in this category, with ranks from #73-Cambodia, to #101-Malaysia (Table 5). Women in chambers within this grouping ranged from 10 percent to 16 percent. However, the percentage of women in Malaysia\u2019s upper house was close to 29 percent. 39 Half of the nations of the region (17 countries) are in the lowermost quartile, starting with Japan and India (Table 5). Mongolia and other nations of South and West Asia, including all of the Pacific island groups are also in the lowest quartile. The proportion of women sitting in the lower chamber or unicameral parliaments within the fourth quartile ranges from \u2018none at all\u2019 to 9.4 percent. Only men sit in the unicameral assemblies of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. In Palau, however, two women have been elected to the upper chamber. Women\u2019s Representation in Houses of Parliament Globally, the percentage of women sitting in single houses of unicameral assemblies, or lower houses of bicameral legislatures, was only 18.6 percent in November 2008. In the senates or upper houses of bicameral governments, there were even fewer women: 17.6 percent (Table 4; from IPU 2008-a). Women\u2019s political representation in national legislative chambers within the Asia-Pacific region is among the lowest in the world. There is a wide variability however, in the proportions of women sitting in different national legislatures/ assemblies/ parliaments (IPU 2008-a). In Asian nations, the visibility of women during this period in a single or lower house of parliament was higher than it was in the upper house or the senate (18.3 percent and 16.5 percent respectively). The opposite was observed among Pacific nations. In these countries, women composed close to 33 percent of senate seats, while only 13 percent sat in the lower house (see Table 4). When women\u2019s political representation is viewed according to Asia-Pacific sub-regions (Table 6), more specific observations can be made as of 2009 (IPU 2008). 40 Table 6.

In both the Lao Democratic People\u2019s Republic and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, women sitting in parliament exceed 25 percent, coming close to the critical threshold. In the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, 138 of 687 seats (20.1 percent) are held by women, but only 13.7 percent of the elected officials in the National Assembly of the non-communist Republic of Korea are women. This difference in the representation of women within the two Korean states suggests that there are factors other than culture and tradition which can influence women\u2019s political representation in parliament. In Japan, the representation of women in Japan\u2019s bicameral legislature, known as the Diet, is comparatively lower than that achieved by the countries in transition: only 9.4 percent of the members of the House of Representatives (lower house) are women, along with 18.2 percent in the House of Councilors (upper house). Lower levels of women\u2019s representation are also evident in Cambodia, where only 6.3 percent of the legislators are women in the National Assembly and 14.75 percent in the Senate. Finally, Mongolia, a republic in transition from communism, has only three women sitting in the Great Hural (four percent). 2. In South East Asia, the representation of women in the legislature is associated with the structure of the legislative assembly. Two countries with unicameral legislatures are close to attaining the critical mass. These are Timor Leste (29.2 percent) and Singapore (24.5 percent). The exception is Indonesia, where the representation of women in the unicameral assembly is only 11.6 percent. It appears more difficult for women in this sub-region to achieve a critical level of representation within bicameral legislatures, especially in the lower house. For example, the representation of women in the Senate of Malaysia increased from 25.7 percent in 1998 to 28.8 percent in their latest elections (2008), coming close to reaching a critical mass. Despite this, only 10.8 percent of seats in the lower house are held by Malaysian women, although this represents an improvement from 2004 (9.13 percent).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54d0c786-ed51-42d0-88c0-eef0906afd17": {"__data__": {"id_": "54d0c786-ed51-42d0-88c0-eef0906afd17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d1e39117a33616747202fd5d02ded851486e7ca14de43b9310486040f3e283a"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e8bd6ca-cf83-4b7b-9640-4bbd30ac599a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1fb5c3612f3464eeea875d4b31894a74bdd4d41b6e4fe1dd4272c5a10f1c671"}}, "hash": "c20a790c48da236efd7df6cae355d4ac43562b2ce85470a72bc9ae6ef409cbaa", "text": "Similarly in Thailand, more women have been elected to the Senate than to the House of Representatives: 16 percent and 11.7 percent, respectively, although neither group attained a critical number.

Only Nepalese women have succeeded in attaining a critical mass: 33 percent representation in the Constituent Assembly as of 2008.

Women politicians in Pakistan experience mixed results. They have fared better in the lower than in the upper house: 22.5 percent of the seats in the National Assembly but only 17 percent of the Senate. The opposite result is seen in Bhutan, where 8.5 percent of positions in the National Assembly are held by women along with 24 percent of those in the National Council. In India, however, only a little over nine percent of the positions of either legislative chamber are occupied by women. Women\u2019s representation in the unicameral assemblies of Bangladesh, Iran, the Maldives and Sri Lanka are relatively low. Women\u2019s participation in Bangladesh\u2019s Parliament has reached only 15 percent, while in the Maldives, women make up a mere 12 percent of the People\u2019s Majilis. In Sri Lanka, only 5.8 percent of the seats in Parliament are held by women. The lowest representation of women in this sub-region is in Iran\u2019s Islamic Consultative Assembly, where the percentage of women in parliament dropped from 4.14 percent in 2004 to 2.8 percent in the 2008 elections. 4. The political representation of women in the Pacific Sub-region is at extremes. In the two developed states of this region, women have succeeded in reaching the critical threshold: 35.5 percent of the members of the Australian Senate are women, along with 26.7 percent of those in the House of Representatives. Elected women in New Zealand have reached a critical mass as well: 33.1 percent of the elected members of the House of Representatives are women. By contrast, the proportion of women in single houses of parliament across 11 Pacific nations included in the IPU Database is only 5.2 percent (computed from Table 6). In Palau, while there are no women in the House of Delegates, 15.4 percent 44 of those elected to the Senate are women. (No data was available for the Cook Islands or Fiji, which also have bicameral legislatures; refer to Table 4.) Other interesting observations that can be gleaned from Table 6 include: o In Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Philippines, greater proportions of women are represented in the lower house. Women\u2019s representation in a bicameral assembly\u2019s lower house is significant, to the extent that it is the one that is representative of the population distribution, and may have the last say on legislative bills. Nevertheless, the proportion of women parliamentarians in the lower houses of these nations still fail to reach the critical threshold. o Two countries emerging from conflict, and which have benefited from UN presence in the past several decades, have attained moderately high levels of women\u2019s representation - Afghanistan and Timor-Leste, although the same has not been true for Cambodia. o Women leaders in Nepal lobbied hard with the Maoist party to ensure that at least 40 percent of Maoist seats are reserved for women.As a result, about a third of the 200 women deputies who sit in the new Parliamentary Assembly are Maoists, the party which took about half of the seats in the 2007 elections (Zeenews 2007; Advocacy Project 2008). o India, which has a long history of an active women\u2019s movement, has been able to occupy less than 10 percent of the seats in either the House of People or the House of States. Similarly, in the Philippines, the percentages of women in either the lower or upper houses of Congress remain below the critical threshold, even if it has been accorded the sixth rank in the Gender Gap Index of the World Economic Forum for 2007 and 2008. Accounting for Women\u2019s Political Representation Numerous studies have been undertaken to interpret the outcomes of elections vis-\u00e0-vis women\u2019s representation in legislative bodies. Among the factors that have been identified as important in understanding levels of women\u2019s political participation are the following: 45 o The electoral system, most importantly the manner of being elected or designated to posts; o Political parties and women\u2019s opportunities to be selected as candidates; o Affirmative actions taken by governments, political parties and women\u2019s organisations to raise the visibility and share of women in political positions; o International cooperation in relation to the introduction of strategies for gender equality; o The masculinised and patriarchal culture of politics, o The persistence of gender stereotypes in relation to the public-private divide between women and men, and, o The influence, achievements and stature of elected women. Many times, these different factors interact in a single situation, and it is difficult to tease out their separate effects.

Women Presiding over Parliament The members of parliament appoint leaders to preside over and manage their proceedings. In republican or presidential systems, the Speaker, Chairperson, or President of either chamber may have succession to the highest position in government. Given the role and status accorded to the presiding officer of a legislative chamber, the assumption of a woman to this position should make a difference in the processes and directions of governance. The election of a woman to this position represents a symbol, embodying the capacity of women to lead and manage public affairs as well as, if not better than, male legislators. It can change the culture of interaction and the conduct of business in parliament. Male parliamentarians may make less sexist remarks at the expense of women, force them to pay attention and be more respectful of their female colleagues. The organisational culture can change if a woman presiding officer proposes arrangements which take into account the fact that members of parliament have 46 families that require their presence and attention (Pintat 2001). Facilities that respond to women's needs (as much as men's needs) can be instituted within the parliamentary grounds, including daycare facilities, separate toilets, breastfeeding rooms, grooming salons, launderettes and convenience stores. From the viewpoint of women in the IPU such amenities can actually improve their sense of equality with men and strengthen their position and self-confidence (Waring, Greenwood and Pintat 2000, 108-109). Most importantly, women presiding officers who effectively manage the affairs of parliament serve as role models for other political aspirants. Their work and visibility can embolden other women to run for candidacy, speak out in parliamentary sessions, challenge the male majority opinion, and initiate legislations attuned to their interests and expertise. Women as leaders of Congress, the House of Representatives, the Senate, or the National Assembly are also in the advantageous position of mobilising women and creating voting blocs around issues relevant to women\u2019s rights and gender equality. Potential and Performance: Women Presiding over Parliament Since the end of the Second World War, only 42 of 186 states with a legislative institution have at one time or another selected a woman to preside over Parliament or a House of Parliament. This has occurred 78 times in all (IPU 2009-b). As of October 2008, only 31 women were presiding over one of the houses of 189 existing parliaments, 76 of which are bicameral. In Asia and the Pacific region under study, the following countries have had a woman as presiding officer of a house of parliament. Only one is in place as of February 2009: Fehmida Mirza of Pakistan (see Table 7): 47 Table 7.

Her father was a medical doctor, while her mother is described as an \u201cactive free-spirited feminist\u201d (Cleary 1996, 69). Her parents were Protestants and raised their three daughters and two sons alike, allowing all of them to have the education they desired. Takako Doi exemplifies many extraordinary achievements as a Japanese woman. In college, she was only one of two females (out of a class of 150) attending the faculty of law in Doshisha University, and the sole member of the student council. She later became an instructor of constitutional law in the same university, and organised groups around the country for the preservation of the Japanese Constitution. She was the first Japanese woman to serve as chair of any political party (as leader of the Japan Socialist Party) and the first woman to become Speaker of the Diet, or Japan\u2019s lower house of Parliament. She held that post from 1993 to 1996, when she was selected as the party's chair under its new name, the Social Democratic Party (Encyclopedia Britannica 2009-b). Takako Doi is well-known as a human rights advocate and guardian of the Constitution of Japan. She is a pacifist, environmentalist, consumer advocate, and friend of the oppressed. She worked hard for the rights of women and children, and won the support of labour unions, farmers, fishers, ordinary workers, and owners of small businesses. From the beginning of her parliamentary career she specialized mainly in foreign and defence policy issues, serving continuously on the Foreign Affairs Committee of the lower house. As a champion of women\u2019s rights, she introduced legislation that would grant nationality to the children of Japanese women married to non-Japanese men, as well as to those born of Japanese fathers and foreign mothers. She wanted to end discrimination against Japanese women in employment and education, and fought to abolish the rule that only girls should take up home economics in secondary school. She also organised women to oppose nuclear development and to organise a nuclear-free zone in Japan. The success of Takako Doi was followed by the entrance of several other women into prominent positions in various political parties. More women ran as candidates, more of them won, and most of the winners ran on the ticket of the Japan Socialist Party.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e49aff88-08cc-4204-8ef4-3b0af1a4a4d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e49aff88-08cc-4204-8ef4-3b0af1a4a4d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9b435f1778da697fd7c6dfbf1a73ae8eed71927b13add8ddb90106a654fc243"}, "2": {"node_id": "05b0c611-dae7-4ce8-8a73-452334686f02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16011435a8244affb9bc6b23596565d91e4619b3e9357c6c46cda88f3f5d26ad"}}, "hash": "3dfd5c11a573991331d6b7bf7196334edca2240d3421a045ebf94e336f1fdae0", "text": "\"The day has arrived for the mountain to move\", Doi declared in the wake of the 1989 upper house election, reciting the opening line of the verse penned by Yosano Akiko, a renowned woman poet (Questia 2009).

[http://www.britannica.com/women/article-9030808. Accessed February 2009; Hendry, Joy. 2003. Understanding Japanese Society. New York: Routledge. Fehmida Mirza and Takako Doi are well-educated women; a profile shared by many other women presiding officers in parliament. They are \u2018veteran parliamentarians,\u2019 having been elected to their respective legislatures for several terms before their assumption into office as Speaker of the House. Like many other 50 women heads of parliamentary bodies, these two women hold the distinction of having been the first women elected as presiding officers of their respective parliaments. There have also been four women in Asia who have presided over upper houses of parliament as deputy leaders (see Table 7) \u2013 Violet Alva, Pratibha Patel, and Najma Heptulla of India all held the position of Deputy Chair of the Rajya Sabha; while Leticia Ramos-Shahani was acting President of the Philippine Senate. Dr. Mirza may be considered as a member of Pakistan\u2019s political elite, with close ties to the leadership of her party, and belonging to a family that has other elected (or formerly elected) officials. The same may be said of other presiding officers. For instance, Mongolia\u2019s Yanjamaa Nemendeyen Subaataryn previously served on the politburo of the People's Revolutionary Party and was Secretary of the Party's Central Committee. She was also acting President of Mongolia from 23 September 1953 to 7 July 1954. Samanunu Cakobau Tolakuli of Fiji is a High Chief and was Chairperson of the Council of Chiefs in 2000. Dr. Najma Heptulla is the grand-niece of a prominent Indian freedom fighter. Leticia Ramos-Shahani was Senate President- Pro tempore when her brother, Fidel Ramos, was President of the Philippines. In a similar way to Takako Doi however, there are other women leaders of parliament who rose to prominence because of their political activism: former Speaker Joan Child of Australia and former Speaker Margaret Wilson of New Zealand. By and large, all these women leaders have been outspoken political activists both before and throughout their career as parliamentarians. Both Dr. Mirza and Takako Doi have been outright in their support for gender equality and women\u2019s advancement. This is a characteristic shared by other presiding officers. Leticia Ramos-Shahani was one of the key personalities in the United Nations Secretariat actively engaged in advocacy on women's issues, until she became the Head of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. In 1985, she was appointed Secretary-General of the Third World Conference on Women in Nairobi, Kenya. Hon. Margaret Wilson, in a speech she gave in 2001, revealed that she had run for elections as part of the \u201cstruggle of women to achieve the liberty to live lives unconstrained by a world that has been constructed and governed within the male experience\u201d (2001). Dr. Najma Heptulla, former Deputy Chair of India\u2019s Rajya Sabha, was elected President of 51 the IPU from 1999 to 2002, after having presided over the women parliamentarians' group of the IPU in 1993. Thus,even while women in parliament have remained a minority bloc until 2008, among the few who have breached the \u2018silk ceiling\u2019 of political leadership in Asia and the Pacific have been compelling personalities who have endeavored to direct national policy, global action and legislation towards the promotion of women\u2019s rights and political participation. III. COUNTING NUMBERS: DO THEY COUNT? A Critical Mass:Do Numbers Count? The use of the term \u2018critical mass\u2019 was popularised by Drude Dahlerup (1988) as part of her analysis of the impact of having women elected to Scandinavian parliaments. At the time she first proposed her theory, 30 percent of those seated in Nordic parliaments were women. In nuclear physics, the concept of a critical mass refers to a threshold value beyond which significant irreversible changes will be observed. When applying the analogy to political participation, it predicts that at a particular critical level of women\u2019s participation, qualitative changes in political behavior, institutions, and public policy will ensue and radically transform legislatures (Grey 2001).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee3790da-7190-4a7c-83cc-b493111d3d1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee3790da-7190-4a7c-83cc-b493111d3d1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a0ad615d18f249d4920cb5195b687fdb151d715631c2c261b6ec33cc65467c77"}, "2": {"node_id": "81aabc42-79ed-445f-be12-56e0a8a82696", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67a6b8e48e84c00a061aef4fa6ae299645f31ca31820ef9bfbdaf97f38d36167"}}, "hash": "c4518e10add03f0ad4210aec0588889e9849ffc1da2ffc2fcca4c225155e0cfc", "text": "Dahlerup\u2019s work had been inspired by Kanter\u2019s observations on the behavior of minority groups in American organizations (Kanter 1976; 1977a; 1977b).

Dahlerup adopted this framework in analysing what would constitute a significant minority size for women politicians, tentatively proposing that when women in parliament reached a proportion of about 30 percent, they would constitute a critical mass and enable the occurrence of a qualitative shift in the assembly (1988).

The importance of a critical mass has been affirmed by other political scientists. In the United States for example, St. Germain (as cited by Studlar and McAlister 2001) argued that once women occupied at least 15 percent of legislative seats, they would be more inclined to push for women\u2019s issues. Thomas, (as cited by Studlar and McAlister 2001) described the favourable impacts of increasing women\u2019s presence in the legislature on legislative style, policy priorities, and policy outcomes. In legislatures with over 20 percent women, they were more likely both to sponsor and shepherd bills concerning women, children, and the family (Studlar and McAllister 2001). Later studies arrived at contradictory and inconsistent findings however, and have failed to unequivocally confirm the theory of a critical mass. Studlar and McAllister, for instance, found little cross-national evidence that having a critical mass of women legislators is a substantial contributing factor to either women\u2019s representational levels or changes in those levels. Instead, they observed that the process of women gaining more seats across Western democracies was incremental, and not an accelerated one engineered by a critical mass (Studlar and McAllister 2001). Consistent with several other studies however, they learned that the electoral system is the strongest contributor to women\u2019s representation, followed by an egalitarian political culture. Bratton (2005) argues that in legislatures in which women make up less than 15 percent of the membership, their presence can still make a difference. Even in extremely skewed state legislatures where men are the dominant majority, she observed that women were generally more active than men in sponsoring legislation that focused on women's interests; they were as successful as men (or even more) in passing the legislation that they sponsored; and were appointed to leadership positions. Grey (2001), on the other hand, concludes that \u2018numbers count\u2019 in the New Zealand Parliament. She states: \u2026there was evidence of increased feminisation of the political agenda at a time when the gender balance in the House of Representatives rose 53 to almost reach Kanter\u2019s skewed ratio of 15:85. Female politicians were more actively involved in debates on child care and parental leave and spoke more proudly of their gender and their intent to represent women as a group once they reached 14.4 percent of the seats in the New Zealand parliament (Grey 2001,15). Nonetheless, she goes on to say that it may be more important to consider different critical masses depending on what we wish to achieve through group representation. Representation of as low as 15 percent in a political body allows women to have a voice, although it could take a far greater proportion of women throughout the different arms of legislatures to change policy outcomes and the political culture. More than a decade after proposing her theory of the critical mass, Dahlerup re-examined her original propositions (2005). She now maintains that the notion of \u2018critical acts\u2019 rather than of a \u2018critical mass\u2019 is more important in interpreting the dramatic changes that had taken place in the eighties within Nordic legislatures. She avers that \u201cit is impossible to isolate the effect of the increasing proportion of women from what happens outside the parliament in this period, which was characterized by a strong feminist movement and extensive debates about gender\u201d (Dahlerup 2005, 4). Dahlerup also realised that having a significant number of women in the legislature did not necessarily lead to dramatic, irreversible changes in public policy and legislation. Comparing differences in the political behavior of only women and men, and not between women, is another logical fallacy that studies on the critical mass suffered from, because there are also differences in attitudes, political priorities and party positions among women politicians themselves. Consequently, Dahlerup (2005) reduces the critical mass theory to only two research questions (from her original six): o The policy outcome perspective: does the proportion of women in political institutions make a difference for the content of political decisions? o The politics as a workplace perspective:does the proportion of women in political institutions make a difference for the possibility of the women parliamentarians to perform their tasks as representatives the way they want? 54 Dahlerup confirms what other scholars and advocates have been saying.

It has to be viewed in relation to institutional factors such as the electoral system and the internal dynamics of political parties. It also needs to be examined in the context of socio-economic, political and cultural events: including a nation\u2019s history, gender values, the prevailing political situation, the strength of the women\u2019s organisations and its networks, and the level of feminist consciousness of politicians \u2013 both women and men (Dahlerup 2005). We will now examine women\u2019s political representation in political structures in relation to electoral systems and party life, and determine to what extent the situation in Asia and the Pacific supports Dahlerup\u2019s hypotheses. Electoral Processes and Women\u2019sPolitical Participation The electoral system determines how votes translate into political representation in the legislature and for the chief executive position of the government. Among 193 countries, the plurality/majority system is the most popular electoral system in use today (UNDP 2005). In Asia, half of its nations elect officials through a majority system, with only about a fifth using proportional representation, while 17 percent engage in indirect elections.v In Pacific countries, the majority/plurality system is the general rule in voting for elected officials (80 percent). 66 percent of the members of legislative assemblies in Asian countries obtain their seats through direct elections; 28 percent are indirectly elected and only five percent are appointed. In countries of Oceania, almost all political representatives are directly elected: 97 percent (IPU 2008). Electoral Systems and Women\u2019s Political Representation Scholars have consistently asserted that the electoral system is the best predictor of the numbers of women in politics (UNRISD 2005; CAPWIP 1999; Pintat 2001). Provided a number of safeguards are applied, the proportional system is deemed more flexible than the majority system, and has been found to be the most conducive avenue to the election of women, since it results in a more diverse composition of a legislative body. It enables more of the traditionally 55 underrepresented groups, including minority groups and women, to get elected (CAPWIP 1999; Pintat 2001; Dahlerup 2002; Ballington and Karam 2005; Krook 2006; UNIFEM 2008/2009). Until 1970, the difference in women\u2019s representation across the different systems was three percent or less. After 1970, however, there was a marked change and there has been a consistent and substantial divergence in women\u2019s representation across electoral systems (Figure 2). This transformation is attributed to the active advocacy of organised women for equal representation in political structures. Between the two broad categories of electoral systems, proportional representation (PR) apparently provides more spaces for women to be elected to office: the percentage of women elected in PR systems across 24 legislatures surveyed in 2004 was 27.49 percent, compared to 18.24 percent in nations using plurality/majority elections, also referred to as \u2018First-Past-The-Post\u2019 (FPTP).

The advantage of PR systems is linked to several factors (Ballington and Karam 2005; Krook 2006). Proportional representation systems, especially those with closed party lists and higher district magnitudes, tend to have much higher numbers of women in parliament than FPTP systems, which involve direct election of candidates in single-member districts. Women have a greater probability of being included in a party ticket, and be voted in, in electoral districts that vote for more than one representative (district magnitude). This likelihood increases with a closed party list, 56 whereelected candidates are ranked, and the ranking determines in which order candidates will accede to office. With a closed party list, party leaders may choose to divide winning slots on the party list among various internal party interests, including those of women\u2019s groups or party blocs. Other studies further show that closed lists increase female representation if women are placed near the top, but not if they are placed near the bottom of the list (Krook 2006; Ballington and Karam 2005).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbc1423f-01bd-43ac-a0c4-3438fd62cb6b": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbc1423f-01bd-43ac-a0c4-3438fd62cb6b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f050b797618d4d0415f13ab4630b3b848fbc08bffd1c1639abebc8fc7937ea36"}, "2": {"node_id": "48c2f06d-0408-4f5d-ae10-fc602c3a7538", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63d0f8d8c6c7077ded9e73c887b97bc079b38751130e8160395d001dc6ab56a8"}}, "hash": "9b8dde6689e8ab7949c599919f5d94e97df874faed72e446f9540ea67698211c", "text": "In a majority system, a woman candidate usually has to compete against a bigger number of male aspirants, and only one will emerge the winner in a single member electoral district.

Insights from Asia and the Pacific It was previously noted that a majority of nations in Asia and the Pacific employ the plurality/majority system and only around 20 percent have proportional allocation systems. Does this make it more difficult for women to be elected into parliament? Can it partially explain the dismal profile of political participation in the region?

PR, mixed systems, and designations through indirect elections have worked more favourably for women in some South East Asian states. Timor-Leste has close to 30 percent women in its National Parliament using PR. In Malaysia, 29 percent of seats in the Senate have been given to women, either through indirect elections or through appointments - twice as many as has been achieved in the lower house using an FPTP system. In the Philippines, members of the House of Representatives are elected using mixed elections, comprising of plurality/majority and PR through closed party lists. As of 2007, 20.5 percent of its seats were held by women, as opposed to the low percentage of seven percent in the Senate, which functions through a majority system. Thailand and Indonesia have not fared so well. Thailand employs a mixed system for electing the members of its lower house (majority and closed party list) and Senate (majority system and indirect designation). The seats given to women in either house have not exceeded 16 percent- too far from the desired proportion of 33 percent. Similarly, the proportion of women voted through PR in Indonesia is slightly less than 17 percent. 58 Australia has two electoral systems: majority votes for the House of Representatives and PR for the Senate. The number of seats occupied by women in the lower house is 27 percent, but has reached the desired threshold of 35.5 percent in the Senate. New Zealand applies both a majority vote and party list system in selecting members of its House of Representatives. In doing so, close to 34 percent of its parliamentary seats are held by women. Other nations in the Pacific use the majority system. The proportions of elected women in any one of their legislative chambers range from \u2018none at all\u2019 to 15 percent. Overall, when the data is recast in terms of electoral systems, it becomes apparent that PR has not proven to be advantageous to the representation of women in national parliaments (Table 8). Mixed systems however, have led to higher percentages of women represented in legislatures (especially in Nepal and New Zealand), and indirect designations have resulted in the largest proportions of women able to seat in parliament. Shortlists, closed party lists, legislative and constitutional provisions, and other mechanisms that mandate the inclusion of women in political agencies, have been proposed as tools to increase the representation of women in governance. Linked to the call for attaining a critical mass in political representation, these mechanisms are translated into gender quotas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "167f4ef5-25b5-4e32-8e76-45f77bd01381": {"__data__": {"id_": "167f4ef5-25b5-4e32-8e76-45f77bd01381", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d175a84b7b24bd75ea99e5b6b02827ca7c71e2c4ebc3cca8f05e1699ab537c3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "080726b6-7b88-4a05-a7db-1b3af6057883", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1427827a14b3ef67b81d3c8305b5b109d006d6b8d35b5e595420102fdd4d718a"}}, "hash": "143022dd014208aa5813beede1ddb41d19b040e4edb12e99b1d576c1065958a6", "text": "The Gender Quota The latest volume of Progress of the World\u2019s Women 2008/2009 focuses on the theme \u2018Who Answers to Women?

Thus, the report recommends three points for affirmative action to increase women's political representation in legislatures: voluntary political party and media codes of conduct, campaign finance controls to level the playing field for women candidates, and quota systems (Dopplick 2008; UNIFEM 2008/2009). Almost all political systems apply some kind of geographical quotas to ensure a minimum representation for densely populated areas, islands and the like. Gender quotas may intersect with these types, as well as with other electoral quotas used by certain states, such as those applied to minorities based on regional, ethnic, linguistic or religious cleavages (IDEA 2009). Regardless of this, it remains unclear whether there is any state that has a quota explicitly for the political participation of gender minorities. Quotas for women are a form of affirmative action to help them overcome the obstacles that prevent them from entering politics in the same way as their male colleagues (Larserud and Taphorn 2007). The institution of a gender quota means that women must constitute a certain number or percentage of the members of a body, whether it is a candidate list, a parliamentary assembly, a committee or a government (Dahlerup 2005). The value of the quota may vary across states, but many countries presently aim to attain gender parity in legislative structures. Austria and Germany, for instance, voluntarily impose a 50 percent minimum quota for women. Increasingly, there are also countries that have quotas which stipulate that neither men nor women can comprise more than 60 percent or less than 40 percent of the national legislature (Robinson 2008). Quotas can be set by law, such as through the constitution or in special electoral laws. They have been introduced at various levels of the political system - federal, national, regional or local. France for example, has instituted a 50 percent gender quota at the local level. Local councils in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have legislated gender quotas ranging between 20-33 percent. In India, this gender quota 60 system is combined with the older system of quotas for the scheduled castes (IDEA 2009). Gender quotas can be classified in several ways. From one perspective, gender quotas include three broad categories of measures: reserved seats, legislative quotas, and party quotas (Krook 2006). Reserved seatsset aside a certain number of seats for women among representatives in a legislature, specified either in the constitution or by legislation. Legislative quotasrevise definitions of equality and representation to require political parties to nominate a certain percentage of women among their political candidates. Party quotasestablish new standards for candidate selection that require the inclusion of a certain proportion of women among their own parties\u2019 candidates.Party quotas are adopted voluntarily by political parties to guarantee the nomination of a certain number or proportion of women. Such quotas are not legally binding and there are no sanctions to enforce them (Larserud and Taphorn 2007). Dahlerup adds three categories to this framework: candidate quotas, gender- neutral quotas, and fast-track quotas. Candidate quotas specify the minimum percentage of candidates for election that must be women, as applied to political parties\u2019 lists of candidates for election. Two types of candidate quotas have been identified by Dahlerup: (a) Legal candidate quotas which are legislated in the constitution or in electoral laws and require political parties to recruit the mandated percentage of women candidates; (b) voluntary party quotas that are adopted by the political parties on their own volition as part of their party philosophy (IDEA 2005, 142).Internal voluntary party quotas are targets set by political parties to include a certain percentage of disadvantaged groups (women, scheduled castes, peasants, or national minorities) as candidates (ACE 2009). Gender-neutral quotas create a maximum limit for both sexes, such as for example, legislating that neither sex should occupy more than 60 percent of seats in parliament. These rules are instituted to refute the arguments of opponents of quotas that they are discriminatory against men (Dahlerup 2005). Fast track quotas may be introduced where women historically have been almost totally excluded", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5588eeb2-d3db-41ac-969c-f2fc46aa8f9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5588eeb2-d3db-41ac-969c-f2fc46aa8f9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "17293c7fad37b1c5791cb9212ccd03649a34f9763e1e1307b62715adbfa1ddcc"}, "3": {"node_id": "ddd871fc-6bb1-4577-8cb9-b242d511b38b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aac82f908517ee5dd6ba9c7128161d4bd87242dbdb06949f07763fb5d5fbb881"}}, "hash": "11fe867837a636d00919ef52c4a05dc35bac12cf27686c818a96177fbe05a5e6", "text": "from politics, and represent a \u2018kick-start\u2019 for women to gain entry to politics. Rwanda is one country that implemented a fast-track quota for women successfully. Such quotas may also be 61 introduced to consolidate and further strengthen the gains women have made in accessing decision-making positions\u2014or to prevent a backlash (Dahlerup 2005). The 2008/2009 Progress of the World\u2019s Women Report further divides quotas into five categories: (1) constitutional, (2) election law with legally enforceable sanctions and without legally enforceable sanctions, (3) sub-national level, (4) political party, and (5) no quota (Dopplick 2008). It recommends the use of legally mandated constitutional or electoral law quotas because they are compulsory and the strongest means of increasing women's engagement in political competition, regardless of political system (UNIFEM 2008/2009, 22). The discourse on gender quotas has been varied, complex and contradictory (Dahlerup 2005). Various arguments have been given for and against the introduction of quotas as a means to increase the political presence of women. A summary of these arguments is as follows (from IDEA 2009): Arguments favouring gender quotas: o Quotas for women do not discriminate, but compensate for actual barriers that prevent women from their fair share of political seats. o Quotas imply that there are several women together in a committee or assembly, thus minimising the stress often experienced by the token women. o Women have the right as citizens to equal representation. o Women's experiences are needed in political life. o Election is about representation, not educational qualifications. o Women are just as qualified as men, but women's qualifications are downgraded and minimised in a male-dominated political system. o It is political parties that control the nominations, not primarily the voters who decide who gets elected. Therefore, quotas are not violations of voters' rights. o Introducing quotas may cause conflicts, though perhaps only temporarily. Arguments against gender quotas: 62 o Quotas are against the principle of equal opportunity for all, since women are given preference over men. o Quotas are undemocratic, because voters should be able to decide who is elected. o Quotas imply that politicians are elected because of their gender, not because of their qualifications and that more qualified candidates are pushed aside. o Many women do not want to get elected just because they are women. o Introducing quotas creates significant conflicts within the party organisation. Quotas work differently under different electoral systems, but they may be more easily introduced in proportional representation systems. This does not preclude the fact, however, that quotas have also been implemented in some plurality/majority systems.Difficulties in instituting quotas may arise when political parties view the quota as interference in their usual prerogatives to select their own candidates. Dahlerup reminds us that, \u201cin almost all political systems, no matter what electoral regime, it is the political parties, not the voters, that constitute the real gatekeepers into elected offices. Consequently, the party nomination practices should be kept in focus\u201d (IDEA 2010). As of 2008, there were 15 countries worldwide with constitutional quotas for the national parliament, 46 had electoral laws on quota systems, 33 with constitutional or legislative quotas for sub-national legislative assemblies, and 169 political parties (from 69 countries) with voluntary party quotas (Table 9; IDEA 2009). In many instances, a country may apply a combination of any two or several of these quota systems. Mixed systems that combine majority systems with quota\u2013bound proportional representation systems also exist. 63 Table 9.

Quotas for National Legislatures The countries of Asia and the Pacific which have instituted one or several gender quota systems for national parliaments are almost evenly divided in terms of their electoral processes (see Table 8). Members of six national legislative chambers across the region are designated through direct elections using majority/plurality votes, while the other chambers with quotas are filled-up through either proportional representation (two houses) or mixed systems (four chambers). Two of these nations have constitutional quota regulations: Afghanistan and Bangladesh (Table 10). Afghanistan employs a constitutional quota for voting in members of the House of the People and a legislated quota regulation for the House of Elders. These quotas, combined with proportional and mixed electoral systems, have provided more than 20 percent of Afghan women the chance to be included in either Government Southeast Asia Indonesia Election Law Quota Regulation, National Parliament House of Representatives 64 of 550 16.84 Philippines Election Law Quota Regulation, National Parliament; Constitutional or Legislative Quota, Local Government; Political Party Quota for Electoral Candidates House of Representatives Senate 49 of 239 4 of 23 20.50 7.39 Thailand Political Party Quota for Electoral Candidates House of Representatives Senate 56 of 480 24 of 150 11.67 16.00 Pacific Australia Political Party Quota for Electoral Candidates House of Representatives Senate 40 of 150 27 of 76 26.67 35.52 New Zealand - No gender quotas- House of Representatives 40 of 121 33.613 66 of its chambers. The same cannot be said for Bangladesh however, which has a constitutional quota provision that reserved 13 percent of seats in Parliament to women; women only got 6.33 percent of the seats. Aside from Afghanistan, there are election law quota regulations in China, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Indonesia, and the Philippines (IDEA 2009). China, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and Pakistan have exceeded the gender quotas in their electoral laws, and all of them employ the plurality/majority system. China set a quota of 22 percent and the percentage of women elected to its National Congress in 2008 comes close to this value (21.3 percent). The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea set the electoral law quota of 20 percent for women to be elected to its Supreme People\u2019s Assembly; it successfully voted in 20.09 percent.

The impact of the electoral quota in the Philippines is more difficult to interpret in terms of women\u2019s representation. The electoral quota law allocates 20 percent of 250 seats in the House of Representatives to party lists representing marginalised sectors of society, and makes it compulsory for these parties to include women in their lists. To elect one candidate in a party list, each sector must get at 67 least two percent of the total number of votes cast for the party list system.

This is an increase of almost five percent from the results obtained in 2004 (15.7 percent), and more than three percent of the percentage of women elected to the House of Representatives in 2001 (17.1 percent). Since a mixed electoral system is employed however, many of these parliamentarians have been elected through a plurality vote, and not because of party quotas. Other factors besides the electoral system apparently influence the successful application of the gender quota or of the election of women to national legislatures. The boxed narratives that follow tell the \u2018stories\u2019 behind the gender quotas for national parliaments in selected countries (Boxes 9-11). The experiences narrated, as well as the previous interpretations we have made, fail to depict a clear relationship between proportional representation and the successful use of gender quotas. In some instances, countries with plurality systems and mixed systems have been able to meet and even surpass the set quotas for women\u2019s representation, while those applying PR have not succeeded in meeting their legislated quotas. In addition, it is worth noting that while New Zealand has no legislated gender quotas, it has been successful in having 33 percent of women elected to parliament (Table 10). Box 9. Afghanistan: Success with Gender Quotas The Afghan Constitution of 2004 stipulates a quota provision for each of the two main chambers of its national parliament. The lower house, the Wolesi Jirga, consists of 220-250 parliamentarians, which is proportional to the population of each of the nation\u2019s 34 provinces. The quota provision states that, from each of the 34 provinces, an average of at least two female candidates should become a member of the Wolesi Jirga. This guarantees the inclusion of at least 27 percent women in the assembly, occupying 68 seats. The seats for women in the Wolesi Jirga are reserved seats. In case there are not enough women on the list of candidates to fill the seat(s) allocated to women in a particular constituency, the seat(s) in question remain vacant until the next intended Wolesi Jirga election. For the House of Elders, the Meshrano Jirga, a mixed electoral system is used (see Table 6). The President appoints one-third of the members, and the gender quota regulation stipulates that 50 percent of these should be women. As a consequence, at least 17 percent of the seats of the Meshrano Jirga must be occupied by women. In the 2005 elections, women occupied 68 out of 249 seats in the Wolesi Jirga, or 27.3 percent, complying completely with the gender quota provision. In the Meshrano Jirga, 23 of 102 seats (22.5 percent) were held by women, exceeding the gender quota regulation of 17 percent women for this chamber. 68 Box 10. Re-claiming the Gender Quota in Bangladesh The quota system in Bangladesh was first introduced in the 1972 Constitution. It provided reserved seats for 15 women in the Jatiyo Sangshad, or National Parliament, for a period of 10 years, or five percent of 315 seats in parliament. In 1978, a presidential proclamation increased the number of reserved seats to 30, and extended the period of reservation to 15 years from the date of promulgation of the constitution of the Republic in December 1972. The women werechosen through indirect elections by the 300 directly-elected members of parliament. This constitutional provision lapsed in 1987 but was re-incorporated in the Constitution by an amendment in 1990, to be effective for 10 years from the first meeting of the next elected legislature. This provision also lapsed in 2001, and the Parliament which was elected in October 2001 did not have", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3833c230-7544-4bb5-935f-357ff8c78045": {"__data__": {"id_": "3833c230-7544-4bb5-935f-357ff8c78045", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac17da84e5d4ab438dc9401f0dd62aec5d045018b379fe45031304271703b6c3"}, "3": {"node_id": "fa68562e-0a18-4b96-8cbb-3f9759f8e007", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca96404ce6578b991b90cf672d0e19d0bbb0ec2302e3c54aeb1411c0797b515a"}}, "hash": "935a1520c086092930479d752f1f8619d2ef4fcef0671d1286c459e73cfb7ed6", "text": "reserved seats for women. On May 16, 2004, the Jatiyo Sangshad reintroduced quotas for women through the 14th Constitutional Amendment. It increased the number of seats in parliament to 345, and stipulated that 45 seats (13 percent) would be reserved for women in the next parliament. The seats were allocated to parties in proportion to their overall share of the vote (IDEA 2009). In September 2005, these reserved seats were distributed to the political parties represented in parliament in proportion to each party's performance in the 2001 election. The Awami League did not endorse any candidates for the nine seats to which it was entitled, so these were filled by the BNP and three other parties in October 2005. In December 2008, Bangladesh held general elections for the first time since 2001. Of 281 seats in the National Parliament, only 19 were won by women, or 6.3 percent, through majority elections. This is higher than the proportion of women in parliament in 2001 (two percent) but considerably less than the 30 seats held by women in 1996, or in 1991 (34 seats) and who were designated through indirect elections. Box 11. Electoral Quotas in East Asia Two nations in East Asia, governing through two different forms of government, have instituted gender quotas through electoral laws. In March 2007, the 10th National People's Congress (NPC) of China declared that there should be no less than 22 percent of women deputies elected in the forthcoming 11th election of the Congress. Apart from the National People\u2019s Congress, the electoral law of China stated that local people's congresses should all have women deputies and that the percentages of women should be increased gradually. In its last elections, 637 women were elected to the NPC, constituting 21.3 percent of the assembly (IDEA 2009; IPU 2009). This represents a small increase in the number of women sitting in the NPC, which was 20.3 percent in the 2003 elections (604 of 2381 seats) On 12 March 2004, the Republic of Korea reformed its Political Party Law of 2000 to include a quota for women. The quota was applied to both its PR and majority electoral systems for the lower house. For the party list PR portion, whereby 56 deputies are elected to the House of the People, political parties were mandated to include 50 percent women in its candidates' lists. For the majority portion of the election, whereby 243 representatives are elected in single-member districts, it was recommended that political parties include 30 percent women candidates in their slates. The law resulted in an increase of women elected, from 5.9 percent in the previous legislature to 13 percent in the April 2004 election, and then again to 13.7 percent in April 2008. 69 The proportions of women constituting the parliaments of China and the Republic of Korea still fall below the desired critical threshold. Still, the gradual increase in the election of women, if sustained, augurs well for the use of the gender quota.

Legislated Quotas in Sub-National Elections Previous research indicates that women\u2019s political participation and representation in legislative bodies have been more successful in local level elections. What do the reports say of the countries in Asia and the Pacific? \u2022 Bangladesh: In 1993, an electoral law was passed in Bangladesh for the direct election of reserved seats for women in the union parishad (union councils). The first elections under this system were held in 1997. Women could be elected for these reserved seats from each of three respective wards, and also run for any of the other general seats in the parishad. In the elections, around 12,828 women were elected as members of the union parishad. In addition, 20 were elected as chairpersons and 110 successfully won the general seats (ADB 2001). \u2022 India: The passage of the \u2018Panchayati Raj\u2019 in India was part of the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992. The amendments stipulate that 33 percent of seats in all local bodies (panchayats and municipalities) are to be reserved for women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa68562e-0a18-4b96-8cbb-3f9759f8e007": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa68562e-0a18-4b96-8cbb-3f9759f8e007", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac17da84e5d4ab438dc9401f0dd62aec5d045018b379fe45031304271703b6c3"}, "2": {"node_id": "3833c230-7544-4bb5-935f-357ff8c78045", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "935a1520c086092930479d752f1f8619d2ef4fcef0671d1286c459e73cfb7ed6"}}, "hash": "ca96404ce6578b991b90cf672d0e19d0bbb0ec2302e3c54aeb1411c0797b515a", "text": "In addition, 33 percent of the seats reserved for the scheduled classes should also be for women (OnlineWomeninpolitics.org 2009).

As a consequence of this Act, more than 100,000 women participated in Village Development Committee elections as candidates and more than 36,000 were elected to the village assemblies (ADB 2008). 70 \u2022 Pakistan:An important feature of the Local Government Plan introduced in March 2000 was the provision of a 33 percent quota for women at the district, municipality (tehsil) and union councils, and a 20 percent reservation for workers/peasants on all local councils. These reserved seats are directly elected at village level for union councils and indirectly elected at district and sub-district levels for Zila and Tehsil councils (UN ESCAP 2009).In the local elections held between December 2000 and August 2001, women contested not only the reserved seats but also the open seats in the union, tehsil and district councils and the posts of Nazim and Naib Nazim. In the Northwest Frontier Province however, women were not allowed to vote or run for office because of pressure from religious groups and political parties. This resulted in the loss of approximately 650 seats for women in this region. Out of the total 40,049 seats reserved for women in the local councils, 36,187 were elected. Additionally, 11 were elected as union council Nazim, one as Naib Nazim, and two as district Nazim (Reyes 2002). \u2022 Papua New Guinea: The Organic Law on Provincial and Local Level Government in Papua New Guinea provides for 566 women to be nominated in all 296 local-level governments nationwide, two in each rural local-level government and one in each urban local-level government. In all of its 19 provincial assemblies, with the exception of Bougainville and the national capital district, there should be one appointed woman. It is not known how many women are in local-level governments at present, but it is a well-established fact that they have failed to implement the provision on nominated women (Sepoe 2002). \u2022 Philippines: The Philippines\u2019 Local Government Code of 1991requires that a woman be one of three sectoral representatives that sit in every municipal, city, and provincial legislative council. In 1993, 3,000 women's organisations were accredited for the holding of elections to elect sectoral representatives to the Local Development Councils. Despite this, no elections for sectoral representatives had been held until 2007. 71 Information on the successful application of sub-national legislative gender quotas again vary across countries. Those in South Asia have had relative success in its application. The same cannot be said of Papua New Guinea however, and the Philippines still has to implement the legislated quota system for the election of women to local assemblies. Developing Capabilities for Public Life Despite these limited gains, much can be said for the reservation of seats for women in local governments. The initiative to put up women candidates has often been the handiwork of organised women, who are most active in local level organisations (Tambiah 2003). It enables them to engage government from within the established system, and to bring into formal political discourse the interests and aspirations of women\u2019s groups and other minorities (Raman 2003). Supported by her organisation, a local woman politician is able to verbalise and address the interests of her constituents in the ward or district, gain experience and confidence in political decision-making, and enlarge her understanding of the dynamics of representation in governance. The quota system has opened doors for socially disadvantaged and marginalised groups that otherwise stand no chance of winning positions of formal political authority traditionally obtained through the politics of money, family influence and party patronage (Reyes 2002). It has also provided local women with the opportunity and determination to go beyond their traditional gender roles in the private domain, and to assume the task of community leadership as active agents of social change (Reyes 2002; Raman 2003; Chowdhury 2003). Local political representation serves as an \u2018incubation period\u2019 for women politicians. It enables them to learn about the culture of politics, and prepares them for open elections against male candidates. As a result of their improved self-confidence, some Indian states now have parity in the number of women and men councilors in local assemblies (UN ESCAP 2007). The number of women candidates for parliamentary elections has increased, including women who were former mayors, district presidents or councilors. 72 Another perceived advantage (using the women\u2019s own accounts) is that participation in local governance better enables elected women officials to straddle their multiple roles: to take part in the political system and at the same time to have time for home", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fecc098a-f76f-4267-8c16-a475a74d5b61": {"__data__": {"id_": "fecc098a-f76f-4267-8c16-a475a74d5b61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2788072f4313bc5c117c84a6d279080682aa6aa043d5fbd19533fdd7dc5892a"}, "3": {"node_id": "00afa89f-e4b1-412d-8134-1a1051fd8f35", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da6a1b3247acbcfdfe184f86a7837efd305026ad9d29d8250e16f1f188635860"}}, "hash": "5c57320ea7c8f8722bd509f47a5665775f2ff8f65bbe9332f1a60e54bc751fc6", "text": "and family responsibilities, rather than be forced to relocate to the national capital (UN ESCAP 2007). This diminishes the objections of spouses and family members to their continuing role in politics. While this \u2018advantage\u2019 does not alter gender constructs, it may eventually lead to the transformation of gender relations, as the women become more self-confident and their effectiveness as public officials leave their husbands no choice but to share in household responsibilities (Raman 2003). This is not always the case however, and women politicians may in fact become more laden with responsibilities. As one woman barangay captain (village head) in the Philippines put it: \u201cEmpowerment can be dis-empowering\u201d, referring to the conflicting demands on her time from her constituents and from her family (Torres, de la Cruz & Magcuro 2002). Contradictions, Co-optations and Challenges Research on the profile of local women politicians indicate that they are generally young, of low income, inexperienced in politics, and are poorly educated (Reyes 2002; Raman 2003;Tambiah 2003). While women\u2019s organisations have used their collective power to put up candidates, the more frequent source of power for candidature has been patriarchy. In many instances, it is the men folk who have \u2018instructed\u2019 the women in their families to run for reserved seats, in order to maintain or consolidate their influence and status in the local community (Basu 2003; Hust 2002). In such cases, unless the elected women gain a gender-responsive perspective, it is unlikely that their political participation will lead to marked improvements in gender equality (Chowdhury 2003: Raman 2003). In small island countries of the Pacific such as Papua New Guinea, the institution of legislated quotas has not led to the improved representation of women in local governance. While women\u2019s groups have waged struggles to attain gender equality, these have been unable to transform a state that has been perceived as weak, unstable, faced with a continuing economic crisis and increasing poverty. Women\u2019s participation in Papua New Guinea has been hindered by the poor conduct of the elections, the increasing incidence of electoral violence and general insecurity, the 73 prevalence of corruption and other factors that characterise the state (Sepoe 2002). In addition, cultural factors have served as constraints. The status of women in Papua New Guinea has diminished from the past, and they are now perceived to have little influence over decisions in the family or community (Brouwer 1998). In the Philippines, devolution of powers to local governments and the decentralisation of authority have served as hindrances rather than opportunities for women\u2019s representation in local assemblies. While the law for quotas representing marginalised sectors in local governments is in place, local officials have been reluctant to enforce them, because the local governments will have to shoulder the salaries and other expenses to be incurred by the sectoral representatives (UN ESCAP 2009-a). As part of their effort, NGOs and people\u2019s organisations have sought to be accredited as legitimate representatives of their respective sectors in local councils \u2013 a first step towards gaining a seat in local institutions of governance. Despite this, enabling rules will still have to be devised covering the reservation of sectoral seats in local councils, including at least three for women. Gender Quotas and Political Parties One of the main obstacles to women\u2019s representation in political institutions is the process of candidate selection: comprising aspects of seeking, nominating, financially supporting, campaigning, and including elective candidates in the ballot. Political parties have the structure, resources and networks to mobilise votes, so that independent candidates often have slimmer chances of successfully winning seats in legislative assemblies. Opportunities for women to be represented in legislative bodies therefore, improve if they are selected as candidates by political parties. Similar to many other features of political systems however, political parties and their dynamics tend to be patriarchal, owing to long years of domination or monopoly by male politicians. Thus, in many nations worldwide, getting a woman selected as a candidate has been a real challenge (UNIFEM 2008/2009).The imposition of gender quotas in political parties serves as a response to this discrimination. Research has generally shown that, without mandatory quotas, the number of women enlisted as candidates by political parties has invariably been much smaller than that of male candidates (Sacchet 2008).

Voluntary party quotas are more commonly implemented by centre-left-leaning parties, while liberal and conservative parties generally tend to be reluctant about or strongly oppose the adoption of quotas (IDEA 2005, 142). Voluntary Party Quotas and Women\u2019s Political Participation As of 2008, there were 169 parties in 69 nations worldwide that have installed voluntary party quotas for women\u2019s representation (IDEA 2009). Nonetheless, only 6.5 percent of all states with voluntary party quotas have women occupying at least one-third of the seats in parliament. These states with party quotas and which have attained the goal of at least 30 percent women in the legislature include - in Europe: Austria, Belgium, Iceland, Macedonia, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden; in Latin America: Argentina and Costa Rica; and in Africa: Mozambique. In the Asia- Pacific region, political parties in the following states have gender quotas: Australia, India, Korea, the Philippines and Thailand. The voluntary party quota provisions in these countries are as follows (IDEA 2009): o Australia: In 2002, the Australian Labour Party introduced a 40 percent quota for party positions, union delegations, and for pre-selection for public office and positions at state and federal level, building on a 35 percent quota introduced in 1994. o India: The Indian National Congress has a 15 percent quota for women candidates. o Republic of Korea: The Grand National Party supports quotas of 30 percent for women candidates. 75 o Philippines: It has a women\u2019s party, the Gabriela Women's Party, which represents 250 women's organisations. Another party-list group is the Philippine Democratic Socialist Party, which has a 25 percent quota for women but there are no voluntary gender quotas in the major political parties. o Thailand: Its Democrat Party has a target of 30 percent women candidates for election. The level of women\u2019s representation in these countries with voluntary party quotas is seen in Table 10. Only Australia and Nepal have been able to use party quotas to the advantage of women. For the rest, the results have been mixed. Clearly, existing party quotas have not successfully raised women\u2019s representation in the countries where these commitments have been made. Even so, the presence of political party quotas has enabled women to gain ground in the legislature, as described in the boxed narratives below (Boxes 12 and 13). Moreover, the experience of the Gabriela Women\u2019s Party in the Philippines demonstrates the possibility of winning seats through a \u2018woman\u2019s vote\u2019. Gabriela\u2019s success in winning two seats in the last elections means a sizable number of voters wanted to have the women\u2019s party become part of the House of Representatives. Box 12. Applying a Gender Quota in the Australian Labour Party At the National Conference of the Australian Labour Party (ALP) in 1994, a party gender quota was adopted. This was in compliance with Rule 12 of the Constitution of Australia which stipulated that 35 percent of the parliamentary party, members of party committees and conference delegates were to be women by 2002, at both federal and state levels. In 2002, a Special Rules Conference extended the quota target to 40 percent, to be achieved by 2012. These targets were put into place largely as the result of women\u2019s action within the party and by party women working within the independent organisation \u2018Emily\u2019s List\u2019. Since the adoption of the 1994 gender quota, the number of female candidates nominated by the ALP has more than doubled - from 26 to 59. The number of those selected for winnable seats almost quadrupled - from four to 15. In 2002, women composed 30 percent of Labour Ministers of Parliament (MPs) at the Commonwealth level, despite Labour being in opposition (Curtin and Sexton 2004). In the 2007 elections, women won 26.7 percent of seats in the lower house. 76 Box 13.

Its representatives have been active exponents of bills and resolutions that affect various aspects of women\u2019s lives, yet they continue to engage in advocacy efforts for women\u2019s rights outside of Congress. There is also a bill pending in Congress which proposes to raise the number of women in government until gender parity is attained (HOR 2009). If the bill is passed, 30 percent of elective and appointive positions should be held by women starting in 2010, 40 percent by 2013, and 50 percent by 2016. Gender Quotas \u2013 Path to Equality in Political Participation? The analysis of women\u2019s representation in political bodies in relation to electoral systems and quota rules, within Asia and the Pacific, lead to the following conclusions: o There has been no clear advantage in the use of proportional allocation systems in relation to the number of women who have been able to secure seats in parliamentary bodies. In fact, there are states that apply plurality/majority systems that are closer to attaining (or have obtained) a third of the seats in the legislature. o It is countries with mixed electoral systems that appear to have the best performance in terms of women\u2019s representation. Indirect elections, reservations or designations have also led to better chances for women to sit in parliament. o Only a fourth of the nations in the region have any form of gender quotas in place, be it through constitutional or electoral regulation, or through voluntary quotas. While these rules have generally led to increased representation of women in chambers, both in national and local assemblies, this has not translated into generating a \u2018critical mass\u2019 of women in many of the legislatures. In fact, there are states which have 77 repeatedly failed to elect women at the quota levels they set for themselves. Even while the United Nations and many political scientists have previously spoken of the gender quota as a significant factor for improving women\u2019s political participation, recent assessments of its application have been more cautious. Larserud and Taphorn posit that, regardless of electoral system, it is quota reservations for women that provide the best chances for getting women into parliament. In their analysis, \u201creserving a tier where only women can stand is guaranteed to elect as many women as the quota makes provisions for\u201d (Larserud and Taphorn 2007, 27). Voluntary party quotas, using percentage regulations with rank-order rules during the nomination process, coupled with list PR elections, also increase the likelihood of a woman being included in a party slate. In the latter case, strict rules would be applied to place women in the first ranks, so that they have a better chance of being included among the elected candidates, rather than if they were placed at the end of the party list. Given the data previously described on the use of voluntary party quotas however, it appears that this avenue for increasing women\u2019s political representation remains underutilised, not only in Asia but also in other parts of the world. Larserud and Taphorn also assert that the least favourable conditions for getting women elected are in the plurality/majority or two-round systems of voting (Larserud and Taphorn 2007). In their view, such systems are apt to discriminate against women. Figures from Asia and the Pacific belie this supposition. Women\u2019s organised advocacy for political representation, the influence of the United Nations, and other social and political factors, probably have been as instrumental in states using majority votes to enable critical numbers of women to obtain seats in legislatures. Most recently, Mona Krook spoke of the \u2018mixed results\u2019 obtained through gender quotas (Ireland 2009). She notes that while the presence of gender quotas may have significant effects in some states, there are parliaments where the proportions of women have \u2018stagnated\u2019 or even decreased. Women elected through quotas have not always been able to influence government policy or changed the patriarchal culture of politics. Notwithstanding, women elected through quotas may have been responsible 78 for the introduction and legislation of bills that specifically deal with women\u2019s concerns. Positively, Krook asserts that gender quotas and reserved seats, especially in local governments, have encouraged more women to run as candidates, including young and poor women, even while elite women from \u2018political dynasties\u2019 continue to run as candidates. In addition, the presence of more women in legislatures has encouraged more", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0c4e657-8d3e-4651-bcf0-cc43e7b2e5f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0c4e657-8d3e-4651-bcf0-cc43e7b2e5f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3cb12a943dec5109a7c445b65397e958a2e3d6431eb4ced27bf6fe63f590b809"}, "3": {"node_id": "121e65b4-fc99-475f-83ed-4094844eefbf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29c16e173d5a7df5ccb0eef6520c7423c97c57a2f08a56f87b7fb77b4ccc6ad2"}}, "hash": "2ef9dd2c8534892c45d4b33b2e19cb157642c51064fca90a5eec2041f0d6aee8", "text": "women constituents to contact their representatives (Ireland 2009). Our own analyses support these observations. Thus far, gender quotas \u2013 whether legislated or applied voluntarily - have not proven to be the magic wand that opens the doors to women\u2019s representation in Asian and Pacific nations where they are applied. This is not to say however, that gender quotas have no value. A comparison of the proportion of women directly or indirectly elected in nations with quotas, with the corresponding percentages in states without quota systems, describes a clear advantage for its application rather than having no quotas (Figure 3): Figure 3.

Furthermore, when the average representation of women is studied in relation to the type of quota regulation, it is seen that the biggest percentages of women are elected (24 percent) in chambers that have constitutional quota regulations, followed by legislated electoral quotas. On the other hand, political party quota regulations have been least associated with getting women into parliament (14 percent), equivalent to the probability of being elected without quotas (see Figure 4). The present findings are consistent with those reported by the UNDP, where the observation was made that \u201chaving a certain portion of parliamentary seats reserved for women helps raise the numbers of women in national parliaments\u201d (UNDP 2008, 29). Given these results, it is clear that there is some significant degree of association between the likelihood of women being elected to legislative chambers and the presence of gender quotas. Moreover, legislated quota regulations appear more effective instruments for promoting women\u2019s representation than voluntary party quotas. These findings however, do not diminish the fact that there could be other factors that increase the possibilities of women\u2019s political representation. 80 Figure 4.
