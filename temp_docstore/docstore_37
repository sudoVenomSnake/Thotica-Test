It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of 1,400 Member organisations and some 15,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples\u2019 organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ IUCN Species Survival Commission With over 10,500 Members, the Species Survival Commission (SSC) is the largest of the six expert Commissions of IUCN and enables IUCN to influence, encourage and assist societies to conserve biodiversity by building knowledge on the status and threats to species, providing advice, developing policies and guidelines, facilitating conservation planning, and catalysing conservation action. Members of SSC belong to one or more of the 160+ Specialist Groups, Red List Authorities, Task Forces and Conservation Committees, each focusing on a taxonomic group (plants, fungi, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and invertebrates), or a disciplinary issue, such as sustainable use and livelihoods, reintroduction of species, wildlife health, climate change and conservation planning. https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/species-survival-commission https://twitter.com/iucnssc IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation (IUCN-Med) opened in Malaga (Spain) in October 2001 with the core support of the Spanish Ministry of Environment and the regional Government of Junta de Andaluc\u00eda. The Centre\u2019s mission is to influence, encourage and assist Mediterranean societies to conserve and use sustainably the natural resources of the region and work with IUCN Members and cooperate with all other agencies that share the objectives of IUCN. www.iucn.org/mediterranean The conservation status of freshwater species and habitats in Key Biodiversity Areas at the Douro river basin The designation of geographical entities in this report, and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of IUCN or other participating organisations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

These sites, either identified as Key Biodiversity Areas1 (KBA) or potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) were assessed on their effectiveness in containing important populations of KBA trigger species2 and threatened species. For this, biodiversity surveys of the taxa used to identify freshwater KBA sites (fishes, molluscs, odonates, and aquatic plants) were undertaken in selected sampling sites. A total of 122 species were recorded in 43 sampling sites, including 82 aquatic plant species, 15 fish species, 12 dragonflies and damselflies species, 2 crayfish species, 5 bivalve species, and 6 gastropod species. Eleven of these species (8 fish, 1 bivalve, 1 odonate and 1 aquatic plant) are classified as threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM. A total of 7 non-native species were also recorded. Among the 14 investigated sites, the KBA sites Malcata and Montesinho e Nogueira were the sites with the highest total species richness (45 and 42 species, respectively). Taking out the aquatic plant species richness (observed only in a few KBA sites) the highest total species richness was still found in KBA sites Malcata and Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira, but also in the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the KBA Sierra de Gredos y Candelario. Five investigated sites sheltered the highest number of threatened species: potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the 4 KBA sites Malcata, El Rebollar, Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Sierra de la Cabrera. The highest number of non-native species were found in the KBA sites Fuentes Carrionas and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52b707fb-913c-44e8-88e2-dcd9246882cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "52b707fb-913c-44e8-88e2-dcd9246882cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-thailand-case-study-net-fisheries", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MARPLASTICCs Economic Briefs - Thailand - Case study on net fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-thailand-case-study-net-fisheries", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88317abae25a2240a147adf52d6286600e0a24d704a1a6e57127501fa87c74b4"}, "3": {"node_id": "4616de6d-1765-48ca-8ba4-31fd13736c0a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-thailand-case-study-net-fisheries", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99f50ca52ac83b66b7d74ced8b3c0c72c501dc16d386f7bed9c9510ac04d04fa"}}, "hash": "122909b0ae15de132e62600b5de245cdd8d29a8cd46dae96f652d86b1645d479", "text": "y del Cordel, with KBA Fuentes Carrionas having a higher number of non-native than native species. Concerning Habitat Quality (HQA) from the River Habitat Survey (RHS), the KBA El Rebollar and the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes recorded the highest habitat quality. However, these investigated sites (El Rebollar and R\u00edo Yeltes) did also show high scores of Habitat Modification (HMI), only being outnumbered by the KBAs Malcata and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel. Lowest Habitat Modification scores (HMI) were found in KBAs Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos. The study shows worrying results on the status of freshwater biodiversity. No trigger species was found in 43% of all investigated sites surveyed in the Douro river basin. Recognizing that freshwater KBAs have high conservation importance, we identify the shortcomings, which mainly relate to either flawed or lack of distribution data for the trigger species. Trigger species were found in all four investigated sites that were considered as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017), but that are not included as such in the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. The results of this study support the need for the incorporation of these sites as KBA to help focus conservation efforts and promote management actions that allow the persistence of the biodiversity elements present. On the other hand, no trigger species were detected in several KBA sites, particularly in the northern part of the Douro river basin. In two KBAs (Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Malcata), the trigger species were not recorded because the habitat where the species normally occurs was not sampled. In 5 KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Fuentes Carrionas, Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel, Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos) no trigger species was found even after intensive sampling.

V | V | V | other threatened species were detected, which should be added as biodiversity elements in the KBA profiles. A total of 11 threatened species were found in the investigated sites, including 8 fish species: Achondrostoma arcasii (VU), Achondrostoma salmantinum (EN), Anguilla anguilla (CR), Cobitis calderoni (EN), Cobitis paludica (VU), Cobitis vettonica (EN), Pseudochondrostoma duriense (VU), Squalius alburnoides (VU), 1 bivalve species Margaritifera Margaritifera (EN), 1 odonate species Macromia splendens (VU) and 1 aquatic plant species Eryngium viviparum (EN). Besides the ones that were already identified as trigger species for the freshwater KBA sites, including the gastropod species Iberhoratia aurorae (DD), there were 3 threatened species that could qualify as trigger species: 2 fish species Anguilla anguilla (CR), Squalius alburnoides (VU) and 1 odonate species Macromia splendens (VU). The presence of the Critically Endangered european eel (Anguilla anguilla) is however puzzling since two specimens were detected in one of the KBA sites (Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira). Possible explanations are that it is either specimens introduced by man or some eels were able to pass all the dams in the Douro river basin and travel until the Sanabria lake. Further investigation is needed to better understand the current distribution of the european eel in the Douro river basin.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4616de6d-1765-48ca-8ba4-31fd13736c0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4616de6d-1765-48ca-8ba4-31fd13736c0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-thailand-case-study-net-fisheries", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MARPLASTICCs Economic Briefs - Thailand - Case study on net fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-thailand-case-study-net-fisheries", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88317abae25a2240a147adf52d6286600e0a24d704a1a6e57127501fa87c74b4"}, "2": {"node_id": "52b707fb-913c-44e8-88e2-dcd9246882cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-thailand-case-study-net-fisheries", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "122909b0ae15de132e62600b5de245cdd8d29a8cd46dae96f652d86b1645d479"}}, "hash": "99f50ca52ac83b66b7d74ced8b3c0c72c501dc16d386f7bed9c9510ac04d04fa", "text": "The highest number of threatened species was found in the southwestern part of the Douro river basin, including in one potential KBA (R\u00edo Yeltes).

Non-native species were identified as an important threat for the native freshwater biodiversity. A total of 7 non-native species were found during this study in the Douro river basin: 2 crayfish species (Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii), 1 bivalve species (Corbicula fluminea) and 4 fish species (Barbatula barbatula, Gambusia holbrooki, Gobio lozanoi and Phoxinus bigerri).

These findings suggest that some of the endemic species remaining in sub-basins are being replaced by non-native species.

The rivers and streams of the southern and eastern part of the Douro river basin suffer mostly from water shortage. In potential KBA R\u00edo Adaja, where a high number of the 2 trigger species was found, the rivers are completely dry in the summer. Since these potential KBAs form no part of other protective zones, incentives are necessary to safeguard the survival of the freshwater biodiversity that is crucial for the rest of the Douro river basin. On the other side, the western part of the Douro river basin suffers greatly from the large dams along the border between Spain and Portugal. Many of the populations of fish are isolated from the middle and lower sections of the Douro river basin, with an especially large impact on potamodromous migratory fish (species whose entire migration takes place in freshwater). KBA sites have high conservation importance but additional measures are necessary in order to preserve the freshwater biodiversity. Steps should be taken for the inclusion of KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection figures) and the inclusion of KBA sites in river basin management plans. This will ensure more appropriate planning and correct allocation of funds for nature conservation. Furthermore, management plans to control or even eradicate non-native species should be designed promplty and implemented. Finally, obsolete dams and barriers should be selected for decommissioning, and building fish passages on barriers impermeable to fish should be promoted.

Finally, 64 Key Biodiversity Areas have been delineated in the Douro river basin, 9 are located in Portugal and 55 in Spain. Of these sites, only 2 have been identified as freshwater KBA with a focus on the conservation of freshwater biodiversity (BirdLife International, 2021). During the years 2018 and 2019, a team of experts on freshwater biodiversity surveyed several sampling sites in the entire Douro river basin to assess the status of freshwater biodiversity (Figure 1). The aim was to understand the current situation of the freshwater biodiversity in 10 Key Biodiversity Areas and 4 sites identified as potential KBAs (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). These experts assessed the presence of freshwater trigger species, recorded the occurrence of fish, odonates, bivalves, crayfish and aquatic plants and determined the potential threats for these species (Table 1). Finally, they assessed the status of each site and gave recommendations on possible measures to better conserve freshwater biodiversity.

The microclimate allow for the cultivation of olives, almonds and grapes, the latter being used for the production of the famous Ribera del Duero and port wines (Louren\u00e7o-Gomes et al., 2015). The river also forms the natural border line between Spain and Portugal for 112 kilometers, and many important cities have been built along its river banks, including Valladolid, Zamora, Vila Nova de Gaia and Porto (Bordalo et al., 2006). Once a wild river bursting with wildlife, the Douro has been undergoing quite a change due to human intervention. Fifteen hydrodams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. Consequently, river connectivity was highly impaired (Cortes et al., 2019). The lower part of the Portuguese drainage is influenced by the Atlantic climate. The upper-middle part of the Portuguese and Spanish section is used for agriculture (mainly vineyards) with some tributaries subject to a semi-arid (Mediterranean climate) while others in mountain areas have more water availability (Andresen et al., 2004). The main threats are posed by big urban areas and severe pollution. 1 Introduction \u00a9 Manuel Lopes-Lima BIOPOLIS-CIBIO/InBIO 2 | Figure 1.

As for the disappearance of the trigger species, the many dams and barriers that are hindering their migratory seasonal patterns and the many stresses on the middle and lower sections of the R\u00edo Pisuerga should be the main impacts. Sedimentation caused by agriculture activities is probably also one of the main threats to the freshwater diversity. Conservation guidance This KBA site needs to be revaluated and surveyed in more detail seasonally for the presence of P. duriense. Trigger species should include A. arcasii, another threatened fish detected here. The management of non-native species, such as the fish Phoxinus bigerri and Gobio lozanoi, and the crayfish P. leniusculus; as well as the increase of the riparian buffer to avoid sedimentation in streams should be pursued as the main conservation measures.

Most of the fish communities of the remaining river sub-basins are declining fast and being replaced by non-native species. Here, we did not find any non-native species, but prevention measures should be developed given the presence of non-native species in the lower section of the river Tormes and the Douro watershed. Conservation guidance Although the site with the trigger species population was not visited, we contacted the authors that had described the species in 2007 and got confirmation about the population status. Therefore, the KBA site seems to be well evaluated but should include other fish trigger species such as Pseudochondrostoma duriense and Squalius alburnoides, both rarely found in other Douro KBA sites in Spain. Management plans for non- native crayfish and fish species should be implemented.

These dams might be disruptive for potamodromous migratory fish such as P. duriense or L. bocagei. The recent introduction of the signal crayfish might also have an important impact on the future of aquatic species in these basins. Conservation guidance The site is already protected. However a recent study mentions that the park should be extended downstream to include areas richer in diversity and abundance of threatened fish species. Therefore, ideally the KBA site should be extended 10-15 km downstream. The KBA should also include the Iberian Nase P. duriense as a trigger species, which has dramatically declined in the whole basin.

However, barriers in the lower Tera and Esla basin are now isolating freshwater species populations, making them more prone to genetic erosion and exposure to local extinction. Additionally, non-native species such as the signal crayfish P. leniusculus and the fish species P. bigerri and B. barbatula are already in other upper catchments of the Douro river basin and should arrive to this area shortly. Conservation guidance Management plans for potential non-native crayfish and fish should be implemented. An effort should be made to increase the connectivity of the River Tera to the River Douro, by selecting obsolete dams and barriers for decommissioning and building fish passages on barriers impermeable to fish.

The water consumption by agricultural practices should be tightly controlled to maintain water levels in riverine and wetland systems.

Furthermore, these KBA sites suffer from siltation and increased conductivity caused by eutrophication due to nutrients and sediment loads from agriculture practices. T here is quite a difference in the freshwater biodiversity found in the distinct investigated sites. Consequently, the necessary measures to conserve the threatened biodiversity can be quite different between regions. An overview of identified threats can be found here: \u2022 Agricultural and forestry effluents: Eutrophication happening as a consequence of agricultural activities. \u2022 Droughts: mainly occurring in the tributaries in the middle part of the drainages (upper part in Portugal). \u2022 Dams and water management/use: several dams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. \u2022 Non-native species: several non-native fishes have invaded this river basin (Lepomis gibbosus, Gambusia holbrooki, Ameiurus melas, Sander lucioperca, Alburnus alburnus, Phoxinus bigerri and Barbatula barbatula). \u2022 Housing and urban areas. \u2022 Annual and perennial non-timber crops: the Spanish River Douro valley has great relevance from the point of view of agriculture with important cereal crops (wheat and barley), legumes, vineyards, sugar beets and alfalfa. \u2022 Livestock farming and ranching: in the Spanish River Douro valley, livestock is an important resource. It includes the exploitation of extensive sheep, pigs and cows. \u2022 Shipping lanes: the main Douro River in the Portuguese part, has a series of navigable locks, that impairs the river connectivity and has a severe impact on the migratory species populations (Petromyzon marinus, Alosa sp., Anguilla anguilla, Salmo trutta). \u2022 Hunting terrestrial animals: Hunting is an important activity in the region of Castilla. 5 Threats 37 | Finally, the southern KBA site Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and the southern potential KBA sites of R\u00edo Yeltes, R\u00edo Adaja, R\u00edo Corneja and R\u00edo Eresma exhibited high numbers of threatened species, with a relatively lower number of non-native species, except for some invertebrate species. Trigger species were found in all of the potential KBA sites. This part of the Douro river basin regions seem to be more affected by water shortage and sediment inputs from agriculture activities. Special attention should be given to the potential KBA site R\u00edo Adaja, that is mostly dry during the summer months, but the few permanent pools that remain, concentrate large abundances of fish. The pool numbers seem to be decreasing and the river will possibly dry completely over the course of the following years. The eastern part of the Douro river basin is equally alarming, not solely for the presence of non-native species but particularly for the high occurrence of freshwater threatened species. The northeastern KBA sites Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira and Sierra de la Cabrera are mostly threatened by the physical barriers that were built along the Spanish-Portuguese border, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and exposure to local extinction. In the southeastern KBA sites El Rebollar and Malcata, increased water usage and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, and sedimentation caused by summer fires is negatively affecting the freshwater diversity in these sites. \u00a9 Manuel Lopes-Lima BIOPOLIS-CIBIO/InBIO 38 | of Salamanca.

A water management plan is needed to avoid part of river Ulcero within the KBA site Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos to dry out in the summer. This study provided an overview of the status of freshwater biodiversity in the Douro river basin, and on the effectiveness of KBA sites in conserving the trigger species and other threatened freshwater species. In the majority of sampling sites the freshwater trigger species were not recorded, and in half of the KBA sites the freshwater trigger species were not detected at all. In contrast, trigger species were detected in all four potential KBA sites (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). A more detailed and comprehensive survey on trigger species is needed to detect and assess the abundance of these species for each KBA site. An update of the status of the KBA sites is necessary if the results show an absence or low abundance of the trigger species or any other threatened species. Furthermore, the investigated sites that were delineated as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) should be nominated as KBA sites to conserve the high number of threatened freshwater species present. Other threatened species found in the KBA sites should be added as additional trigger species during the updating. Additionally, the area for some KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Malcata, Serras de Motesinho e Nogueira) has to be extended to include locations where trigger species occur. Further recognition of the high conservation importance of freshwater KBA sites is needed to strengthen the measures to preserve the freshwater biodiversity in the KBA sites. An intial step should be to include the KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection schemes). It would be good to analyse the feasibility and convenience of including their monitoring as an indicator of conservation status of the site. KBA sites should also be included in the River Basin Management Plans, either as water bodies or as protected areas, to ensure that an appropriate planning of the basin is done and to ensure that enough water is allocated for the conservation of these sites and that no other measures in the plan harm these sites. One project in the Douro river basin already started with the protection and the recovery of native endemic fish populations: the Project Cipriver in the southwest 6 Conservation guidance 39 | No trigger species were found in 43% of all investigated sites. Especially, the situation of the KBA sites in the northwestern part of the Douro river basin is alarming and a further investigation is needed to assess trigger species abundance and to re-evaluate their status as KBA site. The southwestern part of the Douro basin is characterized by a high number of trigger and threatened species, and several investigated regions in this part of the Douro basin should be recognized as KBA site to protect the existing freshwater biodiversity. Freshwater KBA sites have a high conservation importance, but clear distribution data for the trigger species is necessary and active monitoring and coordination are needed to better conserve the present biodiversity. This study assessed the status of freshwater biodiversity in ten Key Biodiverisity Areas of the Douro river basin and four potential Key Biodiversity Areas (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). The findings paint a somber picture of the situation in the Douro river basin. The native and endemic species are being outcompeted by non-native species, and suffering from habitat eutrophication and sedimentation due to agricultural and forestry activities. High water consumption and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, leaving several streams and pools dry during the summer months. Physical barriers and dams are blocking the migration of many endemic species, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and local extinction. 7 Conclusions Sampling along the Douro river \u00a9 Ronaldo Sousa 40 | References Instituto da \u00c1gua (INAG), I.P.

Case studies can be a useful tool to illustrate the value of NbS interventions. They demonstrate the elements that are essential for the successful design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NbS and thus enable learning from experiences in different contexts. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is particular suited to document the positive contributions of NbS. Based on its science-based and widely consulted criteria and indicators, the Standard helps verify NbS applications and promotes comparability as well as a coherent and consistent framework for benchmarking interventions.

NbS emerged from this deeper understanding as a way to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach, with the primary goal of applying conservation approaches to safeguard society (see Figure 1).[1, 2, 3] Figure 1: Nature-based Solutions to address societal challenges. The seven societal challenges indicators are climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, economic and social development, human health, food security, water security and environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. (\u00a9 IUCN) More recently, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 1 This IUCN definition was endorsed by IUCN\u2019s 1,400 members at the 2016 World Conservation Congress in Resolution 069; an expanded definition was recently adopted at UNEA-5.2 in the resolution entitled Nature-based Solutions for supporting sustainable development 2 Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognised NbS and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and contributions to people.[4] Moreover, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), held in Nairobi in the first quarter of 2022, adopted a resolution on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development.[5] An assessment of NbS requires a consistent and common framework that helps document the positive contributions of NbS to green economic development, ecosystem management, climate change and other societally desirable outcomes. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is a valuable tool to verify a range of NbS applications. [6] The eight criteria (see Figure 2) and 28 indicators of the Standard provide clear, science-based and widely consulted parameters for benchmarking NbS interventions.[6, 7] The interdependent and non-hierarchical nature of its eight criteria implies that to be in adherence an intervention has to at least partially address each criterion. As a result, inadequacy in just one criterion means that the intervention in question is not in adherence with the Standard and therefore cannot be verified as an NbS. Figure 2: The eight criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 (\u00a9 IUCN) Adherence with the Standard means that the NbS action sufficiently addresses critical environmental, social and economic dimensions (aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), legal and policy considerations, inclusive governance and participation aspects. Due to its compatibility with the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, the Standard provides the necessary focus on achieving impact at scale, preventing misuse and applying safeguards for the verification and/or subsequent improvement of interventions to be considered NbS. The process-oriented quality of the Standard also provides additional value for analysing and extracting key lessons learned from case studies. It allows reflection on and increases understanding of challenges and opportunities, differentiates between strong and weak NbS interventions, and provides room for corrective and adaptive management and learning throughout the intervention cycle. 3 The international case studies presented here provide insights into particular success factors and challenges for NbS interventions and, thus, promote and enhance uptake, implementation and financing of NbS. Further, they support an effort to build a prototype database of NbS cases using the Standard as a lens through which to understand verification and lessons learned. 4 2 Methodology The prototype database of NbS cases was conceived through an agreed documentation framework, the selection of illustrative international case studies, and the analysis and presentation of five international case studies in accordance with the documentation framework. Inclusivity and gender considerations were given particular attention and wherever possible, disaggregated data is provided. By highlighting the inclusion of different knowledge systems and participation in decision-making of those affected by NbS interventions (including Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth), the case studies demonstrate the critical importance of inclusive governance for the success of an NbS intervention.

To facilitate this, a combined template \u2013 the documentation framework \u2013 was developed to ensure that the required information would be collected and collated. In order to ensure this framework was complementary with the most relevant databases, a mapping of NbS resources from the EU project NetworkNature was utilised (not yet publicly available).[10] Subsequently, relevant information from the case studies related to the documentation framework was gathered. The case study documentation framework captures key information about each of the case studies. It was designed to combine inputs from the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39 and the information required by the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database to help classify each of the case studies (see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions[11]). 5 2.2 Case study selection and documentation The case study selection process focussed on identifying and agreeing on the five most relevant international case studies. It was agreed that the selected cases should provide a good representation across societal challenges, ecosystems and sectors. The initial longlist of international case studies was drawn from cases that had already undergone a full assessment with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39. In accordance with the classification discussed in Section 2 of the CCICED Special Policy Study Report on \u201cValue Assessment of Nature- based Solutions\u201d, discussions with the Special Policy Study team and the availability of sufficient qualitative and quantitative information, five case studies were selected, analysed and documented. The results can be found below and on the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database.[12] Identify priority databases \u2022 Use NetworkNature mapping to identify three priority databases (e.g. PANORAMA) Extract documentation framework \u2022 Collect the documentation required for PANORAMA, finding gender disaggregated data where possible \u2022 In addition, gather gender relevant data inspired by the questions supplied by the CCICED Toolkit on Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability Combine into standardized template \u2022 Combine these frameworks to create an overarching template for the selected case studies.

An increase in the number of coastal flooding events and overwashing occurring several times per year, exacerbated by sea level rise and climate change, established that the existing shingle bank was insufficient to protect against floods. This posed significant actual and potential risks to life and caused damage to property and infrastructure. Additionally, coastal squeeze caused losses of coastal habitat. In response, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom delivered a GBP 27 million project to realign the defences inland, providing significantly improved flood defences to allow for managed flooding. The intervention created 300 hectares of habitat (183 of which is intertidal, including mudflat, salt marsh and transitional grassland), protection of more than 300 homes, road infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant and a boom to local tourism and recreation, with 22,000 visitors each year. The main positive impacts of the Figure 5: Aerial view of the intervention area taken in September 2013 (\u00a9 Environment Agency of the United Kingdom) 8 Medmerry managed coastal realignment include improved flood risk management, creation of wildlife habitats, enhanced landscape quality and provision of recreational facilities. Table 2: Characteristics and benefits of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Strong adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status All major NbS restoration activities have been completed and monitored. The focus is now on the continuous sustainable management of the intervention area. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges At the project planning stage, local communities, government representatives and statutory organisations were involved in the development of a vision for Medmerry, highlighting a wide range of impacts, including societal and environmental. The vision exercise highlighted disaster risk reduction, especially flooding, as a major priority. Additionally, environmental assessment data of flood events (the most serious recent event before the start of the project occurred in 2008 and caused over GBP 5 million in economic damage and required evacuation due to risk of life[14]), flood risk mapping and modelling confirmed flooding as the main societal challenge. These assessments were based on global best practices. Impacts of climate change were found to be an exacerbating factor. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale During the planning phase, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out and a full risk register developed. To achieve flood reduction and environmental improvement, 200 miles of the UK coast were assessed to determine the most promising opportunities for NbS, considering landscape, impacts on people and surrounding habitats. In addition, wider impacts across the region were assessed in accordance with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, including people, businesses, infrastructure and environments. While the coastal realignment provided many new business opportunities, these were not considered in depth during the planning phase. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The expected impacts on the ecosystems in the intervention areas were captured in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).

Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The project placed particular emphasis on stakeholder engagement and participation of local communities in all phases of the project. This included proactively providing information about the benefits of the coastal realignment, gaining widespread support for the intervention and seeking community views and inputs. A comprehensive stakeholder analysis allowed a mapping of how best to engage with the different stakeholders. The Medmerry Stakeholder Advisory Group was established, made up of key individuals of the local community, including Parish Councils, local businesses and residents most affected by the coastal realignment. The Advisory Group helped shape the 10 design of the project and met regularly to discuss any issues and concerns. Although a complaints procedure was in place, which enabled affected individuals to raise concerns through an independent ombudsman, more could have been done to ease the associated bureaucratic burden. The active and intentional involvement of the local community and subsequent support generated, contributed significantly to the success of the project. [15] Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The costs and benefits of the NbS intervention were mapped in line with UK government assessment criteria and included the surrounding areas of the intervention site (landscape level). Annual meetings with stakeholders ensured that the NbS intervention provided the expected benefits. Public access (footpaths, cycle paths and bridleway) to the newly established nature reserve was enhanced and recreational areas provided, while maintaining a balance between recreational activities and undisturbed conservation areas. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The expected benefits were documented in the planning phase and baselines established. These informed the ongoing monitoring of NbS impacts. Immediately after project completion, a five-year monitoring programme was implemented. Annual reports summarised findings and lessons learned, which were shared and discussed with local stakeholders, external consultants, academia and risk management authorities in south England. Approaches to project planning and implementation were adjusted as needed. For instance, the approach applied to engaging the local community was adapted based on early experiences and analysis of challenges and barriers. [15] Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context While lessons learned have been captured in annual reports and through the monitoring framework, these have only been shared with a limited audience. The main benefits that have been communicated relate to reduced flood risk and created habitat. The success of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment along with other NbS interventions informed the organisational national strategy and increased the focus on NbS nationally. The project was characterised by comprehensively considering climate change and biodiversity throughout the design, implementation and monitoring phases. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Participatory and collaborative approaches. Inclusive governance and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, especially the local community, ensured effective assessment of societal challenges and priorities in the given context, increased understanding and acceptability of the proposed solution and enabled effective planning, implementation and maintenance/management of the NbS intervention, with a possibility for creative problem-solving. 11 Transparency.

The negative impacts caused by increased flood risk also caused transboundary challenges between Vietnam and Cambodia. Based on documented farmer knowledge and experience, IUCN promoted and improved locally-practiced, flood-based (wetland) agriculture and livelihood models in the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap and Long An. Flood-based livelihoods were encouraged as a financially viable, low risk alternative to triple rice cropping, to enhance economic and social resilience as well as to conserve and restore the biodiversity found in Mekong Delta freshwater wetlands/floodplains. The NbS intervention considered three systems - floating rice systems, lotus farming systems and rice aquaculture systems. Due to increasing weather extremes, hybrid solutions were also explored (combination of dykes and floodplains), to enable controlled flooding and adaptive approaches to overcome risks of drought and to manage the arrival and recession of floods. While the main focus of the NbS intervention was on farmers adding an additional flood-based crop in open flood (no dyke) and flood control zones (low dyke), the utility of replacing low value irrigated crops with higher value flood-based crops in closed control zones (high dyke) was also considered. In order to achieve the full set of biodiversity and human wellbeing benefits derived from moderated floods, interventions need to be scaled up across the entirety of the Mekong Delta floodplain. To do so, a follow-up project is currently being developed under the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Initial studies of farmer initiatives and proof of concept in IUCN pilot sites were completed between 2015 and 2018. These fed into the design and implementation of similar projects in the region (e.g. those by the World Bank, IUCN and FAO).

The economic component was not sufficiently considered in the design of the initial intervention, though marketable products were identified. While initial IUCN pilot interventions remained limited and small-scale, collaboration across similar projects and recent policy developments currently support the development of a large-scale intervention across the 1.4 million ha of the Upper Mekong Delta floodplain. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The focus of the intervention was on modified wetland ecosystems (formally zoned as agricultural land under private tenure) and thus excluded practices carried out in protected and conserved areas. In light of the extensive scientific evidence on the risks of rice intensification, it was possible to assess the status of ecosystems as well as drivers of change and biodiversity loss. Due to the rather small scale of the IUCN pilot interventions, no concrete data or monitoring frameworks to capture the positive biodiversity outcomes were implemented. Instead, outcomes were captured in general terms, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural functions of the floodplain. Detailed 14 monitoring for potential, unintended adverse consequences on nature arising from the intervention was not carried out. Key investments in biodiversity outcomes[16]: \uf0b7 Investments into 450 ha of flood-based livelihoods to enhance ecosystem functions of floodplains, which resulted in the conservation or restoration of approx. 6.7 million m\u00b3 of flood retention capacity supporting aquifer recharge, the reduction in land subsidence and the conservation or restoration of aquatic habitat/biodiversity; \uf0b7 additional benefits were observed from wild fisheries, mitigation of river erosion through the re-establishment of natural hydrology of seasonal flooding and increased land fertility, including through sediment deposition due to the seasonal flooding. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable A feasibility study for a GCF proposal revealed that several hundred thousand farmers and a number of downstream towns would benefit financially from flooding if seasonal flood-based agriculture were applied. In addition, cost- benefit analyses were carried out on the profitability of flood-based crops and the cropping system as a whole in comparison to mono-rice cropping. The NbS intervention did not consider the development of clear value chains and business models, which hampered securing long-term funding sources to maintain the NbS. Instead, the intervention relied on short-term, project-based grant funding. The planned GCF project could help overcome some of these shortcomings. Key expected economic benefits[16]: \uf0b7 flood-based livelihoods have the potential to be 1.5 to five times more profitable than intensive rice cropping; \uf0b7 floating rice systems could generate around USD 6,400 per ha per year, while triple rice cropping systems generate only USD 3,100 per ha per year; \uf0b7 where farmers add a flood-based crop in open flood or flood control zones, additional income between USD 2,293 \u2013 USD 5,744 per ha per year could be generated depending on the flood-based agriculture system applied[17]; \uf0b7 in open flood and flood control zones, no investments need to be made towards flood management, while in closed control zones (high dykes), sluice coordination by the local government is necessary; flood-based agriculture could serve as an incentive to stop conversion of low dykes to high dykes, which in turn helps preserve the floodplains in the Upper Mekong Delta. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and No grievance mechanism was put in place for the IUCN pilot NbS interventions, due to the small-scale and limited number of farmers involved. A grievance 15 empowering governance processes mechanism was put in place for the larger scale World Bank ICRSL project implementation as was required by World Bank safeguard policies. A stakeholder analysis provided insights into which stakeholders were directly and indirectly affected. Stakeholders provided inputs into the regional vision and plans for phasing out intensive triple rice crop farming. In addition, since farmers have private tenure over their land, farmer participation in decision-making and ownership of such decisions was essential. National Resolution 120 entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d and Decision 593 defined the roles and responsibilities of different actors in decision-making processes and recognised the need for policy reform rather than small-scale community- based solutions.

However, it is not yet operational. This constitutes a shortcoming for the NbS intervention. For the World Bank ICRSL project, social and environmental safeguards were put in place. However, the limits of trade-offs were not discussed in detail. In some areas a hybrid model was used, with low dykes controlling the timing of flood arrival/recession to support double-cropping and flood-based cropping (instead of the traditional third rice crop). In the case of lotus farming systems, flood-based agriculture enabled diversification of activities, including fish raising, ecotourism and recreational opportunities. In the future, value chains, especially for rice production, will need to be considered in more detail to support the new flood-based agriculture model and gain support from rice exporters. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence While National Resolution 120 provided an enabling policy environment for flood-based agriculture, examples of interventions that ran counter to the resolution remained. This weakened the impact of the NbS intervention and underlined that monitoring needed to be improved. There is no evidence as to whether there has been a government response to adapt the approach. Limited technical and institutional capacity was identified as a key factor. Lessons learned from the IUCN pilots and experiences from other similar initiatives are shared regularly at the Mekong Delta Development Partners Working Group and Annual Mekong Delta Forums. Further, the emerging interest from academia in flood-based agriculture is already producing relevant data and information. Additionally, the preparation of the planned Green Climate Fund 16 proposal considers the above challenges. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The NbS intervention built on the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which recommended high-value double rice cropping in combination with seasonal flood-based agriculture/aquaculture to manage flood risks. This influenced the promulgation of National Resolution 120, entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d; this policy was adopted in November 2017 and stipulates that nature-based adaptation models should be selected that are environmentally sound and achieve sustainable development based on \u2018actively living with the floods\u2019. The Mekong Delta Forum provided a space for knowledge exchange on lessons learned and endorsement of a common vision for the Upper Mekong Delta, including a move to more natural land and water uses. An IUCN-led Green Climate Fund proposal is under preparation to ensure continuity of efforts and to address transboundary challenges. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Legal and regulatory framework. Supportive legal and policy frameworks opened up opportunities for a change in land use and facilitated partnerships across related initiatives for the adoption of flood-based agriculture in open flood and flood control zones. A need for market incentives. The NbS intervention in Vietnam could have profited from a more holistic approach regarding the diversification of marketable products derived from flood-based agriculture to provide additional market incentives. Through consultations and analysis of lessons learned, market access and a lack of value chain development were identified as the greatest challenges for scaling up flood-based agriculture. This is influencing the design of the future Green Climate Fund project. Overcoming small-scale and time-bound interventions. A hybrid system of flood-based agriculture with some flooding control system of low dykes could help manage risks of early/heavy floods and droughts. The highest potential lies in the closed flood zones with high dykes through the opening of sluices during seasonal floods to restore the flood retention area. However, existing projects have not yet addressed this potential. This demonstrates that for NbS interventions to achieve positive impacts at scale, small-scale (often focussed on pilots), project-based and time- bound interventions are not sufficient to address complex societal challenges.

The proposed NbS intervention focussed on creating an integrated management model offering a long-term management strategy for the coastal wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano \u2013 a new regional park. It contributed to balancing social and environmental needs and paved the way to recognise the economic and cultural potential of the wetlands. Since the implementation of activities is still ongoing, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment was used Figure 7: Area archeologica di tharros, San Giovanni di Sinis, Cabras, Italy (\u00a9 L\u00e9onard Cotte, Unsplash) 18 to identify entry points to strengthen the NbS intervention. This analysis was carried out by the UNEP Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the UN Environment Programme and recommendations published in a report.[18] Table 4: Characteristics and benefits of the Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status Implementation of the NbS intervention is ongoing. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped identify the key societal challenges that needed addressing. These management plans also provided insights into human activities in the region, such as aquaculture and fishing. General information on drivers and responses of the identified societal challenges was gathered; however, there was no data specific to the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. An area for improvement identified as part of the self- assessment relates to strengthening the links to human wellbeing outcomes. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The aim of the intervention was to overcome fragmentation between the various wetland ecosystems in the Gulf of Oristano. The collaboration established among 11 municipalities through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract helped advance coordination, including across sectors. Further, interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems fed into the design of the intervention and considered various activities, including fishing, flood risk management, agriculture and tourism among others. Vulnerability and risk maps were developed. However, it was recommended that additional data be gathered to understand risks across the catchment and better define the adaptation and resilience actions to climate change, including related to connectivity between wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped understand the current state of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity in the region. Regular monitoring is 19 ecosystem integrity ensured through an integrated information system, the Oristano Wetland Observatory. In addition, the implementation of a Wetland Index is planned. Options to enhance integrity of the wetland ecosystems were implemented. These included the restoration of ecological connections, creation of buffer zones and preservation of native habitats. Key biodiversity outcomes: \uf0b7 Strengthened conservation of coastal and marine habitats; \uf0b7 Reinforced resilience to climate change impacts; \uf0b7 Reduced water consumption, abstraction, pollution and contamination. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable This criterion turned out to be the weakest for this NbS intervention. No specific cost-effectiveness study was conducted. Cost-benefit analyses and consideration of alternatives were conducted only for a limited number of the wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano. The long-term resourcing of the NbS was partially secured through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract. Additional resourcing is expected through the new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 as well as through the new funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan that is currently being developed. Moreover, the institution of a new protected area (regional park) will be an instrument to attract new funds and ensure the ongoing management of wetlands. A full economic analysis was suggested as a priority action going forward to secure the continuity and sustainability of the NbS intervention.

It revealed that the regional government owns the wetlands, while surrounding areas are either under public or private ownership. Concessions are given to fisher cooperatives. The results of the self-assessment revealed a major shortcoming in agreeing limits of trade-offs and related safeguards. This aspect was included as a priority action moving forward.

The collected information will be used for regular monitoring over time. However, no concrete plan of how the monitoring may trigger an adaptive management response was prepared. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract is an important document supporting the implementation of integrated, coordinated and collaborative approaches at scale. The Contract is an important legal instrument as it reinforces the commitment towards joint policy action to overcome fragmentation of coastal wetlands management, looking towards the establishment of a new regional protected area, which is the first aim of the Action Plan attached to the Contract. It provides the foundation for NbS actions in the Gulf of Oristano. In addition, national and global targets were key reference points for the design of the NbS intervention and Ramsar information sheets were updated for the six Ramsar sites. A new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 is under preparation by the regional government. Steps will be taken to integrate the results of the NbS intervention into the strategy to promote its long-term continuity. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Defining priority and corrective actions to strengthen the intervention. An analysis of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 indicators that have been insufficiently or only partially addressed helped to make recommendations for improvement and to identify concrete corrective actions to strengthen the implementation of the NbS intervention.[18] This demonstrates how the self-assessment can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of NbS interventions. Strong legal basis. The adoption of the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract by the 11 municipalities provided an important legal basis and framework to advance integrated management of six wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. It provided strategies and actions that support ongoing efforts toward the establishment of a new regional park. 3.4 Sustainable aquaculture and innovative seaweed farming in Zanzibar Location: Zanzibar, Tanzania Main implementing organisation: International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Other implementing organisation: Ecosystem-based Aquaculture Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Commission on Ecosystem Management (IUCN CEM) Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 2 (solution for sustainable management of restored and managed ecosystems, including innovative land-use planning protocols) 21 Case overview: Since 1990, Zanzibar has become a primary seaweed producer in Africa. Seaweed farming activities are usually small-scale and carried out in the intertidal zones largely in marine conservation areas, near mangroves and coral reefs. Eighty-eight per cent of seaweed farmers are women, making this an important activity to elevate their economic status and role in the community.[19] Climate change, the absence of producer associations, difficulties in accessing international markets and insufficient protection of coastal ecosystems have contributed to a decline in the production of higher-valued seaweeds.

It should also be noted that the self-assessment was carried out as a desk review. Further, means of verification were not always available, as data relating to certain indicators were not gathered. To conduct a more comprehensive assessment, local stakeholders should be involved as key informants. Nevertheless, the self-assessment provided insights into areas for improvement as to how interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. It also provided insights into knowledge and data gaps, which prompted critical questions and corrective actions that need to be addressed going forward. Intervention status Initial activities are completed. Future actions, research and knowledge needs are being assessed. Figure 8: Women working in seaweed farms in Pemba, Zantibar (\u00a9 R. le Gouvello) 22 Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges were identified, documented and prioritised through a theory of change exercise. This included a stakeholder workshop and engagement with local authorities to verify the information. Several studies provided insights into the positive outcomes of mariculture and seaweed farming, which included gender equality, economic revenues provided to women and the consequences on their life, including increased autonomy, empowerment and role in the communities. Although there was an understanding of the internal and external risks of the intervention, the SWOT analysis carried out for the Zanzibar case showed that a number of weaknesses and threats have not yet been addressed. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The application of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) ensured a recognition of interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems. A more holistic approach should be applied in future interventions to take into account the impact of value chains and access to markets for local livelihoods. Some synergies across sectors were identified. However, since the theory of change exercise was not completed due to time constraints, complementary interventions were not integrated fully into the design of the intervention. It was recommended to work with stakeholders to complete this exercise and achieve synergies for future interventions, especially between aquaculture, marine conservation and other relevant sectors. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. The analysis of the biodiversity benefits achieved through this intervention were largely based on a desk review of existing literature and information rather than a specific assessment, monitoring framework or thorough and collective effort with key informants and stakeholders. As was highlighted in a recent study published by IUCN, criterion 3 is the most difficult to achieve for seaweed farming and aquaculture.[19] There is a clear need to establish measures to reduce, control and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, better documentation of the ecological state of the ecosystem, ecosystem connectivity and assessment of impacts is required. In this regard, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is an important tool to call attention to these issues and helps improve interventions that would otherwise cause harm to coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable Seaweed farming is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. The intervention did not carry out a global value chain assessment or detailed 23 assessment of climate change impacts. These could have provided insights into the economic feasibility and sustainability of the intervention, especially with regards to supporting the livelihoods of local women, who predominantly engage in seaweed farming. In addition, alternative scenarios and options need to be explored going forward to identify the most suitable, sustainable and economically viable solution in the specific context. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Co-management approaches were applied in marine conservation areas. These involved the government and local communities, often with international support. They demonstrated the willingness of the Government of Zanzibar to implement blue growth strategies that are inclusive of local communities and aim to build a sustainable future. The need to further increase and improve the participation of women and aquaculture farmers in decision-making, to enhance transparency and to provide access to information, was highlighted. There are also opportunities to enhance cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. While there was a reported willingness from the Government of Zanzibar to consider relevant trade-offs, the limits of these trade-offs and associated safeguards were not clarified. Existing cost-benefit analyses have not yet considered environmental aspects that would trigger corrective action.

By completing the self-assessment under the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39, it was possible to make concrete recommendations on how to improve the balancing of trade-offs, while ensuring the sustainability of the intervention. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Government of Zanzibar put in place a blue growth strategy, which considers the challenges of seaweed farming, including related sustainability concerns. However, there is as yet no evidence of a formal mechanism to monitor and evaluate interventions on a regular basis to determine adaptive management responses. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Since the 1980s, the Government of Zanzibar encouraged multi-use marine protected zones, which were included in relevant sectoral laws and policies. A blue growth strategy and regulations support seaweed farming practices and the achievement of global targets. The means by which lessons learned are captured and communicated have been highlighted as an area for improvement. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) 24 Lessons learned: Taking corrective action. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 served as an important tool to reflect on Nature-based Solution design, implementation and monitoring challenges. It provided insights into areas that require corrective action, the collection of additional evidence and means of verification and involvement of local stakeholders. In this manner, the self- assessment results will inform future work on aquaculture and seaweed farming in Zanzibar (and elsewhere) and help improve intervention design, implementation and monitoring frameworks. Reviewing the understanding of the NbS criteria and indicators. Several rounds of discussions, guided by IUCN expert reviewers, were held on the rationale and means of verification provided per indicator. These revealed that the criteria were sometimes understood and interpreted differently by different people, impacting the assigned rating. This demonstrated the complexities associated with assessing whether an intervention can be considered a Nature-based Solution and the need for thorough and guided consideration of each indicator. Continued engagement. A new agenda of research and development work has emerged, including dialogues around NbS criteria and indicators with stakeholders in Zanzibar and local communities. This could contribute to a future roadmap for Zanzibar and a framework for regular self- evaluation. 25 4 Summary of results First, case studies offer important opportunities for exchange of experiences, reflection on different approaches applied in different contexts as well as lessons learned with regards to opportunities, challenges and needed corrective actions. The agreed documentation framework and resulting prototype database of case studies based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 and elements from the PANORAMA: solutions for a healthy planet case study database, greatly support the analysis and comparability of experiences by offering common and robust parameters for benchmarking interventions.5 Second, there is tremendous strength in inclusive governance and open, transparent and participatory approaches that draw on local and/or traditional knowledge, engage Indigenous people, local communities and traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and youth. As illustrated in the Guatemala and Zanzibar cases, women in particular can benefit from enhanced opportunities, social status and income generated through NbS, when the design accounts for their role and inherent gender gaps. Third, scale is an important success factor. Small-scale, time-bound, pilot and project-based interventions often fail to address the full complexity of societal challenges and rarely produce the biodiversity and human wellbeing outcomes expected from the NbS. Finally, an enabling institutional, legal and policy environment provides the backbone for the implementation of and investments in NbS by making nature an ally in addressing societal challenges. Supportive, clear and coherent legal and policy frameworks can further enhance and facilitate coordination across relevant sectors and actors as well as protect the rights of affected and vulnerable communities that benefit directly or indirectly from an intervention. 5 More reflections on the benefits of the prototype database see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions, reference [11] 26 References [1] Mace, G.M.

Case studies can be a useful tool to illustrate the value of NbS interventions. They demonstrate the elements that are essential for the successful design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NbS and thus enable learning from experiences in different contexts. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is particular suited to document the positive contributions of NbS. Based on its science-based and widely consulted criteria and indicators, the Standard helps verify NbS applications and promotes comparability as well as a coherent and consistent framework for benchmarking interventions.

NbS emerged from this deeper understanding as a way to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach, with the primary goal of applying conservation approaches to safeguard society (see Figure 1).[1, 2, 3] Figure 1: Nature-based Solutions to address societal challenges. The seven societal challenges indicators are climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, economic and social development, human health, food security, water security and environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. (\u00a9 IUCN) More recently, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 1 This IUCN definition was endorsed by IUCN\u2019s 1,400 members at the 2016 World Conservation Congress in Resolution 069; an expanded definition was recently adopted at UNEA-5.2 in the resolution entitled Nature-based Solutions for supporting sustainable development 2 Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognised NbS and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and contributions to people.[4] Moreover, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), held in Nairobi in the first quarter of 2022, adopted a resolution on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development.[5] An assessment of NbS requires a consistent and common framework that helps document the positive contributions of NbS to green economic development, ecosystem management, climate change and other societally desirable outcomes. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is a valuable tool to verify a range of NbS applications. [6] The eight criteria (see Figure 2) and 28 indicators of the Standard provide clear, science-based and widely consulted parameters for benchmarking NbS interventions.[6, 7] The interdependent and non-hierarchical nature of its eight criteria implies that to be in adherence an intervention has to at least partially address each criterion. As a result, inadequacy in just one criterion means that the intervention in question is not in adherence with the Standard and therefore cannot be verified as an NbS. Figure 2: The eight criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 (\u00a9 IUCN) Adherence with the Standard means that the NbS action sufficiently addresses critical environmental, social and economic dimensions (aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), legal and policy considerations, inclusive governance and participation aspects. Due to its compatibility with the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, the Standard provides the necessary focus on achieving impact at scale, preventing misuse and applying safeguards for the verification and/or subsequent improvement of interventions to be considered NbS. The process-oriented quality of the Standard also provides additional value for analysing and extracting key lessons learned from case studies. It allows reflection on and increases understanding of challenges and opportunities, differentiates between strong and weak NbS interventions, and provides room for corrective and adaptive management and learning throughout the intervention cycle. 3 The international case studies presented here provide insights into particular success factors and challenges for NbS interventions and, thus, promote and enhance uptake, implementation and financing of NbS. Further, they support an effort to build a prototype database of NbS cases using the Standard as a lens through which to understand verification and lessons learned. 4 2 Methodology The prototype database of NbS cases was conceived through an agreed documentation framework, the selection of illustrative international case studies, and the analysis and presentation of five international case studies in accordance with the documentation framework. Inclusivity and gender considerations were given particular attention and wherever possible, disaggregated data is provided. By highlighting the inclusion of different knowledge systems and participation in decision-making of those affected by NbS interventions (including Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth), the case studies demonstrate the critical importance of inclusive governance for the success of an NbS intervention. They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8edbe3d-8df5-49aa-ab6e-9baf6ca769fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8edbe3d-8df5-49aa-ab6e-9baf6ca769fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-recognising-reporting-and-supporting-oecms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Recognising, Reporting And Supporting OECMs", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-recognising-reporting-and-supporting-oecms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8fa187c5dc798f39670cfca2179fb87916d7286bacdfcc03022efa8bff5688f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b6535a5-7ab7-4800-b634-e8703095f444", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-recognising-reporting-and-supporting-oecms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62c2d7dc10984a59c203c53d60c514bff5b4c0ae020993ce0aa8d2db74993518"}}, "hash": "fd6d324c20d5099161716b0277dad701ec5c54733d90000bfb0385dfa9209ad0", "text": "They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture. Especially concerning the role of women, the case studies highlight multiple dimensions of gender and gender-responsive approaches in the design and implementation of NbS interventions to understand and overcome gender-based gaps.

To facilitate this, a combined template \u2013 the documentation framework \u2013 was developed to ensure that the required information would be collected and collated. In order to ensure this framework was complementary with the most relevant databases, a mapping of NbS resources from the EU project NetworkNature was utilised (not yet publicly available).[10] Subsequently, relevant information from the case studies related to the documentation framework was gathered. The case study documentation framework captures key information about each of the case studies. It was designed to combine inputs from the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39 and the information required by the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database to help classify each of the case studies (see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions[11]). 5 2.2 Case study selection and documentation The case study selection process focussed on identifying and agreeing on the five most relevant international case studies. It was agreed that the selected cases should provide a good representation across societal challenges, ecosystems and sectors. The initial longlist of international case studies was drawn from cases that had already undergone a full assessment with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39. In accordance with the classification discussed in Section 2 of the CCICED Special Policy Study Report on \u201cValue Assessment of Nature- based Solutions\u201d, discussions with the Special Policy Study team and the availability of sufficient qualitative and quantitative information, five case studies were selected, analysed and documented. The results can be found below and on the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database.[12] Identify priority databases \u2022 Use NetworkNature mapping to identify three priority databases (e.g. PANORAMA) Extract documentation framework \u2022 Collect the documentation required for PANORAMA, finding gender disaggregated data where possible \u2022 In addition, gather gender relevant data inspired by the questions supplied by the CCICED Toolkit on Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability Combine into standardized template \u2022 Combine these frameworks to create an overarching template for the selected case studies.

An increase in the number of coastal flooding events and overwashing occurring several times per year, exacerbated by sea level rise and climate change, established that the existing shingle bank was insufficient to protect against floods. This posed significant actual and potential risks to life and caused damage to property and infrastructure. Additionally, coastal squeeze caused losses of coastal habitat. In response, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom delivered a GBP 27 million project to realign the defences inland, providing significantly improved flood defences to allow for managed flooding. The intervention created 300 hectares of habitat (183 of which is intertidal, including mudflat, salt marsh and transitional grassland), protection of more than 300 homes, road infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant and a boom to local tourism and recreation, with 22,000 visitors each year. The main positive impacts of the Figure 5: Aerial view of the intervention area taken in September 2013 (\u00a9 Environment Agency of the United Kingdom) 8 Medmerry managed coastal realignment include improved flood risk management, creation of wildlife habitats, enhanced landscape quality and provision of recreational facilities. Table 2: Characteristics and benefits of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Strong adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status All major NbS restoration activities have been completed and monitored. The focus is now on the continuous sustainable management of the intervention area. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges At the project planning stage, local communities, government representatives and statutory organisations were involved in the development of a vision for Medmerry, highlighting a wide range of impacts, including societal and environmental. The vision exercise highlighted disaster risk reduction, especially flooding, as a major priority. Additionally, environmental assessment data of flood events (the most serious recent event before the start of the project occurred in 2008 and caused over GBP 5 million in economic damage and required evacuation due to risk of life[14]), flood risk mapping and modelling confirmed flooding as the main societal challenge. These assessments were based on global best practices. Impacts of climate change were found to be an exacerbating factor. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale During the planning phase, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out and a full risk register developed. To achieve flood reduction and environmental improvement, 200 miles of the UK coast were assessed to determine the most promising opportunities for NbS, considering landscape, impacts on people and surrounding habitats. In addition, wider impacts across the region were assessed in accordance with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, including people, businesses, infrastructure and environments. While the coastal realignment provided many new business opportunities, these were not considered in depth during the planning phase. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The expected impacts on the ecosystems in the intervention areas were captured in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). These included mitigation measures for any risks to biodiversity during construction. For 9 instance, water voles were translocated prior to the start of the works.

Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The project placed particular emphasis on stakeholder engagement and participation of local communities in all phases of the project. This included proactively providing information about the benefits of the coastal realignment, gaining widespread support for the intervention and seeking community views and inputs. A comprehensive stakeholder analysis allowed a mapping of how best to engage with the different stakeholders. The Medmerry Stakeholder Advisory Group was established, made up of key individuals of the local community, including Parish Councils, local businesses and residents most affected by the coastal realignment. The Advisory Group helped shape the 10 design of the project and met regularly to discuss any issues and concerns. Although a complaints procedure was in place, which enabled affected individuals to raise concerns through an independent ombudsman, more could have been done to ease the associated bureaucratic burden. The active and intentional involvement of the local community and subsequent support generated, contributed significantly to the success of the project. [15] Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The costs and benefits of the NbS intervention were mapped in line with UK government assessment criteria and included the surrounding areas of the intervention site (landscape level). Annual meetings with stakeholders ensured that the NbS intervention provided the expected benefits. Public access (footpaths, cycle paths and bridleway) to the newly established nature reserve was enhanced and recreational areas provided, while maintaining a balance between recreational activities and undisturbed conservation areas. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The expected benefits were documented in the planning phase and baselines established. These informed the ongoing monitoring of NbS impacts. Immediately after project completion, a five-year monitoring programme was implemented. Annual reports summarised findings and lessons learned, which were shared and discussed with local stakeholders, external consultants, academia and risk management authorities in south England. Approaches to project planning and implementation were adjusted as needed. For instance, the approach applied to engaging the local community was adapted based on early experiences and analysis of challenges and barriers. [15] Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context While lessons learned have been captured in annual reports and through the monitoring framework, these have only been shared with a limited audience. The main benefits that have been communicated relate to reduced flood risk and created habitat. The success of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment along with other NbS interventions informed the organisational national strategy and increased the focus on NbS nationally. The project was characterised by comprehensively considering climate change and biodiversity throughout the design, implementation and monitoring phases. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Participatory and collaborative approaches. Inclusive governance and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, especially the local community, ensured effective assessment of societal challenges and priorities in the given context, increased understanding and acceptability of the proposed solution and enabled effective planning, implementation and maintenance/management of the NbS intervention, with a possibility for creative problem-solving. 11 Transparency. Transparent and structured engagement and participation of the local community throughout the project and in decision-making processes \u2013 starting with the design stage \u2013 helped to address concerns, build trust and create ownership.

Flood-based livelihoods were encouraged as a financially viable, low risk alternative to triple rice cropping, to enhance economic and social resilience as well as to conserve and restore the biodiversity found in Mekong Delta freshwater wetlands/floodplains. The NbS intervention considered three systems - floating rice systems, lotus farming systems and rice aquaculture systems. Due to increasing weather extremes, hybrid solutions were also explored (combination of dykes and floodplains), to enable controlled flooding and adaptive approaches to overcome risks of drought and to manage the arrival and recession of floods. While the main focus of the NbS intervention was on farmers adding an additional flood-based crop in open flood (no dyke) and flood control zones (low dyke), the utility of replacing low value irrigated crops with higher value flood-based crops in closed control zones (high dyke) was also considered. In order to achieve the full set of biodiversity and human wellbeing benefits derived from moderated floods, interventions need to be scaled up across the entirety of the Mekong Delta floodplain. To do so, a follow-up project is currently being developed under the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Initial studies of farmer initiatives and proof of concept in IUCN pilot sites were completed between 2015 and 2018. These fed into the design and implementation of similar projects in the region (e.g. those by the World Bank, IUCN and FAO).

The economic component was not sufficiently considered in the design of the initial intervention, though marketable products were identified. While initial IUCN pilot interventions remained limited and small-scale, collaboration across similar projects and recent policy developments currently support the development of a large-scale intervention across the 1.4 million ha of the Upper Mekong Delta floodplain. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The focus of the intervention was on modified wetland ecosystems (formally zoned as agricultural land under private tenure) and thus excluded practices carried out in protected and conserved areas. In light of the extensive scientific evidence on the risks of rice intensification, it was possible to assess the status of ecosystems as well as drivers of change and biodiversity loss. Due to the rather small scale of the IUCN pilot interventions, no concrete data or monitoring frameworks to capture the positive biodiversity outcomes were implemented. Instead, outcomes were captured in general terms, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural functions of the floodplain. Detailed 14 monitoring for potential, unintended adverse consequences on nature arising from the intervention was not carried out. Key investments in biodiversity outcomes[16]: \uf0b7 Investments into 450 ha of flood-based livelihoods to enhance ecosystem functions of floodplains, which resulted in the conservation or restoration of approx. 6.7 million m\u00b3 of flood retention capacity supporting aquifer recharge, the reduction in land subsidence and the conservation or restoration of aquatic habitat/biodiversity; \uf0b7 additional benefits were observed from wild fisheries, mitigation of river erosion through the re-establishment of natural hydrology of seasonal flooding and increased land fertility, including through sediment deposition due to the seasonal flooding. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable A feasibility study for a GCF proposal revealed that several hundred thousand farmers and a number of downstream towns would benefit financially from flooding if seasonal flood-based agriculture were applied. In addition, cost- benefit analyses were carried out on the profitability of flood-based crops and the cropping system as a whole in comparison to mono-rice cropping. The NbS intervention did not consider the development of clear value chains and business models, which hampered securing long-term funding sources to maintain the NbS. Instead, the intervention relied on short-term, project-based grant funding. The planned GCF project could help overcome some of these shortcomings. Key expected economic benefits[16]: \uf0b7 flood-based livelihoods have the potential to be 1.5 to five times more profitable than intensive rice cropping; \uf0b7 floating rice systems could generate around USD 6,400 per ha per year, while triple rice cropping systems generate only USD 3,100 per ha per year; \uf0b7 where farmers add a flood-based crop in open flood or flood control zones, additional income between USD 2,293 \u2013 USD 5,744 per ha per year could be generated depending on the flood-based agriculture system applied[17]; \uf0b7 in open flood and flood control zones, no investments need to be made towards flood management, while in closed control zones (high dykes), sluice coordination by the local government is necessary; flood-based agriculture could serve as an incentive to stop conversion of low dykes to high dykes, which in turn helps preserve the floodplains in the Upper Mekong Delta. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and No grievance mechanism was put in place for the IUCN pilot NbS interventions, due to the small-scale and limited number of farmers involved. A grievance 15 empowering governance processes mechanism was put in place for the larger scale World Bank ICRSL project implementation as was required by World Bank safeguard policies. A stakeholder analysis provided insights into which stakeholders were directly and indirectly affected. Stakeholders provided inputs into the regional vision and plans for phasing out intensive triple rice crop farming. In addition, since farmers have private tenure over their land, farmer participation in decision-making and ownership of such decisions was essential. National Resolution 120 entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d and Decision 593 defined the roles and responsibilities of different actors in decision-making processes and recognised the need for policy reform rather than small-scale community- based solutions.

However, it is not yet operational. This constitutes a shortcoming for the NbS intervention. For the World Bank ICRSL project, social and environmental safeguards were put in place. However, the limits of trade-offs were not discussed in detail. In some areas a hybrid model was used, with low dykes controlling the timing of flood arrival/recession to support double-cropping and flood-based cropping (instead of the traditional third rice crop). In the case of lotus farming systems, flood-based agriculture enabled diversification of activities, including fish raising, ecotourism and recreational opportunities. In the future, value chains, especially for rice production, will need to be considered in more detail to support the new flood-based agriculture model and gain support from rice exporters. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence While National Resolution 120 provided an enabling policy environment for flood-based agriculture, examples of interventions that ran counter to the resolution remained. This weakened the impact of the NbS intervention and underlined that monitoring needed to be improved. There is no evidence as to whether there has been a government response to adapt the approach. Limited technical and institutional capacity was identified as a key factor. Lessons learned from the IUCN pilots and experiences from other similar initiatives are shared regularly at the Mekong Delta Development Partners Working Group and Annual Mekong Delta Forums. Further, the emerging interest from academia in flood-based agriculture is already producing relevant data and information. Additionally, the preparation of the planned Green Climate Fund 16 proposal considers the above challenges. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The NbS intervention built on the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which recommended high-value double rice cropping in combination with seasonal flood-based agriculture/aquaculture to manage flood risks. This influenced the promulgation of National Resolution 120, entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d; this policy was adopted in November 2017 and stipulates that nature-based adaptation models should be selected that are environmentally sound and achieve sustainable development based on \u2018actively living with the floods\u2019. The Mekong Delta Forum provided a space for knowledge exchange on lessons learned and endorsement of a common vision for the Upper Mekong Delta, including a move to more natural land and water uses. An IUCN-led Green Climate Fund proposal is under preparation to ensure continuity of efforts and to address transboundary challenges. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Legal and regulatory framework. Supportive legal and policy frameworks opened up opportunities for a change in land use and facilitated partnerships across related initiatives for the adoption of flood-based agriculture in open flood and flood control zones. A need for market incentives. The NbS intervention in Vietnam could have profited from a more holistic approach regarding the diversification of marketable products derived from flood-based agriculture to provide additional market incentives. Through consultations and analysis of lessons learned, market access and a lack of value chain development were identified as the greatest challenges for scaling up flood-based agriculture. This is influencing the design of the future Green Climate Fund project. Overcoming small-scale and time-bound interventions. A hybrid system of flood-based agriculture with some flooding control system of low dykes could help manage risks of early/heavy floods and droughts. The highest potential lies in the closed flood zones with high dykes through the opening of sluices during seasonal floods to restore the flood retention area. However, existing projects have not yet addressed this potential. This demonstrates that for NbS interventions to achieve positive impacts at scale, small-scale (often focussed on pilots), project-based and time- bound interventions are not sufficient to address complex societal challenges. Nevertheless, partnerships between related interventions in the region contributed to institutional and policy development as well as supported greater cross-sectoral coordination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac276250-5c55-4d24-862e-8185729eb6b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac276250-5c55-4d24-862e-8185729eb6b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-recognising-reporting-and-supporting-oecms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Recognising, Reporting And Supporting OECMs", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-recognising-reporting-and-supporting-oecms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a7b68d4ced58417e63766121202b1a8a7d5b7a6e7b07cd5df59b42d4f07df22"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4d79bee-db5c-4dfb-a952-85a5f4056d9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-recognising-reporting-and-supporting-oecms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b5929b2543edf5b0ffae227de89f97ec3c310dd3d26656cfde7ce761eb029c7"}}, "hash": "c47f2fb4d887e3bddd07d091a0760a9f9c5053e509e663a43c25e59e5d1d7092", "text": "17 3.3 Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management Location: Gulf of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy Main implementing organisation: MEDSEA Mediterranean Sea and Coast Foundation Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 1 (solution that makes better use of existing natural and protected ecosystems) Case overview: The Gulf of Oristano is home to a number of freshwater and coastal wetlands.

It contributed to balancing social and environmental needs and paved the way to recognise the economic and cultural potential of the wetlands. Since the implementation of activities is still ongoing, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment was used Figure 7: Area archeologica di tharros, San Giovanni di Sinis, Cabras, Italy (\u00a9 L\u00e9onard Cotte, Unsplash) 18 to identify entry points to strengthen the NbS intervention. This analysis was carried out by the UNEP Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the UN Environment Programme and recommendations published in a report.[18] Table 4: Characteristics and benefits of the Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status Implementation of the NbS intervention is ongoing. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped identify the key societal challenges that needed addressing. These management plans also provided insights into human activities in the region, such as aquaculture and fishing. General information on drivers and responses of the identified societal challenges was gathered; however, there was no data specific to the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. An area for improvement identified as part of the self- assessment relates to strengthening the links to human wellbeing outcomes. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The aim of the intervention was to overcome fragmentation between the various wetland ecosystems in the Gulf of Oristano. The collaboration established among 11 municipalities through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract helped advance coordination, including across sectors. Further, interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems fed into the design of the intervention and considered various activities, including fishing, flood risk management, agriculture and tourism among others. Vulnerability and risk maps were developed. However, it was recommended that additional data be gathered to understand risks across the catchment and better define the adaptation and resilience actions to climate change, including related to connectivity between wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped understand the current state of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity in the region. Regular monitoring is 19 ecosystem integrity ensured through an integrated information system, the Oristano Wetland Observatory. In addition, the implementation of a Wetland Index is planned. Options to enhance integrity of the wetland ecosystems were implemented. These included the restoration of ecological connections, creation of buffer zones and preservation of native habitats. Key biodiversity outcomes: \uf0b7 Strengthened conservation of coastal and marine habitats; \uf0b7 Reinforced resilience to climate change impacts; \uf0b7 Reduced water consumption, abstraction, pollution and contamination. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable This criterion turned out to be the weakest for this NbS intervention. No specific cost-effectiveness study was conducted. Cost-benefit analyses and consideration of alternatives were conducted only for a limited number of the wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano. The long-term resourcing of the NbS was partially secured through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract. Additional resourcing is expected through the new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 as well as through the new funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan that is currently being developed. Moreover, the institution of a new protected area (regional park) will be an instrument to attract new funds and ensure the ongoing management of wetlands.

Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits A basic analysis of the rights, usage of and access to land and resources was done. It revealed that the regional government owns the wetlands, while surrounding areas are either under public or private ownership. Concessions are given to fisher cooperatives. The results of the self-assessment revealed a major shortcoming in agreeing limits of trade-offs and related safeguards. This aspect was included as a priority action moving forward. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract defined guidelines and actions that steered the definition of intended outcomes and actions and informed 20 on evidence monitoring and evaluation of the intervention. The Integrated Information System developed as part of the initiative provided uniform and regular data on the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. The collected information will be used for regular monitoring over time. However, no concrete plan of how the monitoring may trigger an adaptive management response was prepared. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract is an important document supporting the implementation of integrated, coordinated and collaborative approaches at scale. The Contract is an important legal instrument as it reinforces the commitment towards joint policy action to overcome fragmentation of coastal wetlands management, looking towards the establishment of a new regional protected area, which is the first aim of the Action Plan attached to the Contract. It provides the foundation for NbS actions in the Gulf of Oristano. In addition, national and global targets were key reference points for the design of the NbS intervention and Ramsar information sheets were updated for the six Ramsar sites. A new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 is under preparation by the regional government. Steps will be taken to integrate the results of the NbS intervention into the strategy to promote its long-term continuity. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Defining priority and corrective actions to strengthen the intervention. An analysis of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 indicators that have been insufficiently or only partially addressed helped to make recommendations for improvement and to identify concrete corrective actions to strengthen the implementation of the NbS intervention.[18] This demonstrates how the self-assessment can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of NbS interventions. Strong legal basis. The adoption of the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract by the 11 municipalities provided an important legal basis and framework to advance integrated management of six wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. It provided strategies and actions that support ongoing efforts toward the establishment of a new regional park. 3.4 Sustainable aquaculture and innovative seaweed farming in Zanzibar Location: Zanzibar, Tanzania Main implementing organisation: International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Other implementing organisation: Ecosystem-based Aquaculture Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Commission on Ecosystem Management (IUCN CEM) Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 2 (solution for sustainable management of restored and managed ecosystems, including innovative land-use planning protocols) 21 Case overview: Since 1990, Zanzibar has become a primary seaweed producer in Africa. Seaweed farming activities are usually small-scale and carried out in the intertidal zones largely in marine conservation areas, near mangroves and coral reefs. Eighty-eight per cent of seaweed farmers are women, making this an important activity to elevate their economic status and role in the community.[19] Climate change, the absence of producer associations, difficulties in accessing international markets and insufficient protection of coastal ecosystems have contributed to a decline in the production of higher-valued seaweeds. While the co-management approach applied in Zanzibar aims to protect coastal ecosystems and habitats, enhance artisanal fisheries and mariculture, shortcomings in the management remain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2df23977-a78e-453a-805e-01777a1df637": {"__data__": {"id_": "2df23977-a78e-453a-805e-01777a1df637", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-recognising-reporting-and-supporting-oecms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Recognising, Reporting And Supporting OECMs", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-recognising-reporting-and-supporting-oecms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4af071d5b2525b17ef859b35f1bb43e1e7914e7f2ac12bb550f270b70229431"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e0a8b40-5822-4bf4-9912-1777a6c3739f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-recognising-reporting-and-supporting-oecms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "861953db5cfe1b5ec1a3b2a1453c0d0395c5d0b16099381b2e5d7b8dfb73b42a"}}, "hash": "728d4863ee40b3081ea04d80bfb83454855cd054fe7d6bf27562defcb0c4240c", "text": "New approaches to aquaculture and marine conservation have emerged only recently (in terms of concrete projects since 2014), with the case in Zanzibar serving as a first attempt to test the level of adherence of seaweed farming with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39.

It should also be noted that the self-assessment was carried out as a desk review. Further, means of verification were not always available, as data relating to certain indicators were not gathered. To conduct a more comprehensive assessment, local stakeholders should be involved as key informants. Nevertheless, the self-assessment provided insights into areas for improvement as to how interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. It also provided insights into knowledge and data gaps, which prompted critical questions and corrective actions that need to be addressed going forward. Intervention status Initial activities are completed. Future actions, research and knowledge needs are being assessed. Figure 8: Women working in seaweed farms in Pemba, Zantibar (\u00a9 R. le Gouvello) 22 Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges were identified, documented and prioritised through a theory of change exercise. This included a stakeholder workshop and engagement with local authorities to verify the information. Several studies provided insights into the positive outcomes of mariculture and seaweed farming, which included gender equality, economic revenues provided to women and the consequences on their life, including increased autonomy, empowerment and role in the communities. Although there was an understanding of the internal and external risks of the intervention, the SWOT analysis carried out for the Zanzibar case showed that a number of weaknesses and threats have not yet been addressed. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The application of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) ensured a recognition of interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems. A more holistic approach should be applied in future interventions to take into account the impact of value chains and access to markets for local livelihoods. Some synergies across sectors were identified. However, since the theory of change exercise was not completed due to time constraints, complementary interventions were not integrated fully into the design of the intervention. It was recommended to work with stakeholders to complete this exercise and achieve synergies for future interventions, especially between aquaculture, marine conservation and other relevant sectors. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. The analysis of the biodiversity benefits achieved through this intervention were largely based on a desk review of existing literature and information rather than a specific assessment, monitoring framework or thorough and collective effort with key informants and stakeholders. As was highlighted in a recent study published by IUCN, criterion 3 is the most difficult to achieve for seaweed farming and aquaculture.[19] There is a clear need to establish measures to reduce, control and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, better documentation of the ecological state of the ecosystem, ecosystem connectivity and assessment of impacts is required. In this regard, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is an important tool to call attention to these issues and helps improve interventions that would otherwise cause harm to coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable Seaweed farming is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. The intervention did not carry out a global value chain assessment or detailed 23 assessment of climate change impacts. These could have provided insights into the economic feasibility and sustainability of the intervention, especially with regards to supporting the livelihoods of local women, who predominantly engage in seaweed farming. In addition, alternative scenarios and options need to be explored going forward to identify the most suitable, sustainable and economically viable solution in the specific context. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Co-management approaches were applied in marine conservation areas. These involved the government and local communities, often with international support. They demonstrated the willingness of the Government of Zanzibar to implement blue growth strategies that are inclusive of local communities and aim to build a sustainable future. The need to further increase and improve the participation of women and aquaculture farmers in decision-making, to enhance transparency and to provide access to information, was highlighted. There are also opportunities to enhance cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. While there was a reported willingness from the Government of Zanzibar to consider relevant trade-offs, the limits of these trade-offs and associated safeguards were not clarified. Existing cost-benefit analyses have not yet considered environmental aspects that would trigger corrective action.

By completing the self-assessment under the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39, it was possible to make concrete recommendations on how to improve the balancing of trade-offs, while ensuring the sustainability of the intervention. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Government of Zanzibar put in place a blue growth strategy, which considers the challenges of seaweed farming, including related sustainability concerns. However, there is as yet no evidence of a formal mechanism to monitor and evaluate interventions on a regular basis to determine adaptive management responses. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Since the 1980s, the Government of Zanzibar encouraged multi-use marine protected zones, which were included in relevant sectoral laws and policies. A blue growth strategy and regulations support seaweed farming practices and the achievement of global targets. The means by which lessons learned are captured and communicated have been highlighted as an area for improvement. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) 24 Lessons learned: Taking corrective action. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 served as an important tool to reflect on Nature-based Solution design, implementation and monitoring challenges. It provided insights into areas that require corrective action, the collection of additional evidence and means of verification and involvement of local stakeholders. In this manner, the self- assessment results will inform future work on aquaculture and seaweed farming in Zanzibar (and elsewhere) and help improve intervention design, implementation and monitoring frameworks. Reviewing the understanding of the NbS criteria and indicators. Several rounds of discussions, guided by IUCN expert reviewers, were held on the rationale and means of verification provided per indicator. These revealed that the criteria were sometimes understood and interpreted differently by different people, impacting the assigned rating. This demonstrated the complexities associated with assessing whether an intervention can be considered a Nature-based Solution and the need for thorough and guided consideration of each indicator. Continued engagement. A new agenda of research and development work has emerged, including dialogues around NbS criteria and indicators with stakeholders in Zanzibar and local communities. This could contribute to a future roadmap for Zanzibar and a framework for regular self- evaluation. 25 4 Summary of results First, case studies offer important opportunities for exchange of experiences, reflection on different approaches applied in different contexts as well as lessons learned with regards to opportunities, challenges and needed corrective actions. The agreed documentation framework and resulting prototype database of case studies based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 and elements from the PANORAMA: solutions for a healthy planet case study database, greatly support the analysis and comparability of experiences by offering common and robust parameters for benchmarking interventions.5 Second, there is tremendous strength in inclusive governance and open, transparent and participatory approaches that draw on local and/or traditional knowledge, engage Indigenous people, local communities and traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and youth. As illustrated in the Guatemala and Zanzibar cases, women in particular can benefit from enhanced opportunities, social status and income generated through NbS, when the design accounts for their role and inherent gender gaps. Third, scale is an important success factor. Small-scale, time-bound, pilot and project-based interventions often fail to address the full complexity of societal challenges and rarely produce the biodiversity and human wellbeing outcomes expected from the NbS. Finally, an enabling institutional, legal and policy environment provides the backbone for the implementation of and investments in NbS by making nature an ally in addressing societal challenges. Supportive, clear and coherent legal and policy frameworks can further enhance and facilitate coordination across relevant sectors and actors as well as protect the rights of affected and vulnerable communities that benefit directly or indirectly from an intervention. 5 More reflections on the benefits of the prototype database see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions, reference [11] 26 References [1] Mace, G.M.

Case studies can be a useful tool to illustrate the value of NbS interventions. They demonstrate the elements that are essential for the successful design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NbS and thus enable learning from experiences in different contexts. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is particular suited to document the positive contributions of NbS. Based on its science-based and widely consulted criteria and indicators, the Standard helps verify NbS applications and promotes comparability as well as a coherent and consistent framework for benchmarking interventions.

NbS emerged from this deeper understanding as a way to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach, with the primary goal of applying conservation approaches to safeguard society (see Figure 1).[1, 2, 3] Figure 1: Nature-based Solutions to address societal challenges. The seven societal challenges indicators are climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, economic and social development, human health, food security, water security and environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. (\u00a9 IUCN) More recently, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 1 This IUCN definition was endorsed by IUCN\u2019s 1,400 members at the 2016 World Conservation Congress in Resolution 069; an expanded definition was recently adopted at UNEA-5.2 in the resolution entitled Nature-based Solutions for supporting sustainable development 2 Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognised NbS and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and contributions to people.[4] Moreover, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), held in Nairobi in the first quarter of 2022, adopted a resolution on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development.[5] An assessment of NbS requires a consistent and common framework that helps document the positive contributions of NbS to green economic development, ecosystem management, climate change and other societally desirable outcomes. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is a valuable tool to verify a range of NbS applications. [6] The eight criteria (see Figure 2) and 28 indicators of the Standard provide clear, science-based and widely consulted parameters for benchmarking NbS interventions.[6, 7] The interdependent and non-hierarchical nature of its eight criteria implies that to be in adherence an intervention has to at least partially address each criterion. As a result, inadequacy in just one criterion means that the intervention in question is not in adherence with the Standard and therefore cannot be verified as an NbS. Figure 2: The eight criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 (\u00a9 IUCN) Adherence with the Standard means that the NbS action sufficiently addresses critical environmental, social and economic dimensions (aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), legal and policy considerations, inclusive governance and participation aspects. Due to its compatibility with the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, the Standard provides the necessary focus on achieving impact at scale, preventing misuse and applying safeguards for the verification and/or subsequent improvement of interventions to be considered NbS. The process-oriented quality of the Standard also provides additional value for analysing and extracting key lessons learned from case studies. It allows reflection on and increases understanding of challenges and opportunities, differentiates between strong and weak NbS interventions, and provides room for corrective and adaptive management and learning throughout the intervention cycle. 3 The international case studies presented here provide insights into particular success factors and challenges for NbS interventions and, thus, promote and enhance uptake, implementation and financing of NbS. Further, they support an effort to build a prototype database of NbS cases using the Standard as a lens through which to understand verification and lessons learned. 4 2 Methodology The prototype database of NbS cases was conceived through an agreed documentation framework, the selection of illustrative international case studies, and the analysis and presentation of five international case studies in accordance with the documentation framework. Inclusivity and gender considerations were given particular attention and wherever possible, disaggregated data is provided. By highlighting the inclusion of different knowledge systems and participation in decision-making of those affected by NbS interventions (including Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth), the case studies demonstrate the critical importance of inclusive governance for the success of an NbS intervention.

To facilitate this, a combined template \u2013 the documentation framework \u2013 was developed to ensure that the required information would be collected and collated. In order to ensure this framework was complementary with the most relevant databases, a mapping of NbS resources from the EU project NetworkNature was utilised (not yet publicly available).[10] Subsequently, relevant information from the case studies related to the documentation framework was gathered. The case study documentation framework captures key information about each of the case studies. It was designed to combine inputs from the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39 and the information required by the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database to help classify each of the case studies (see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions[11]). 5 2.2 Case study selection and documentation The case study selection process focussed on identifying and agreeing on the five most relevant international case studies. It was agreed that the selected cases should provide a good representation across societal challenges, ecosystems and sectors. The initial longlist of international case studies was drawn from cases that had already undergone a full assessment with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39. In accordance with the classification discussed in Section 2 of the CCICED Special Policy Study Report on \u201cValue Assessment of Nature- based Solutions\u201d, discussions with the Special Policy Study team and the availability of sufficient qualitative and quantitative information, five case studies were selected, analysed and documented. The results can be found below and on the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database.[12] Identify priority databases \u2022 Use NetworkNature mapping to identify three priority databases (e.g. PANORAMA) Extract documentation framework \u2022 Collect the documentation required for PANORAMA, finding gender disaggregated data where possible \u2022 In addition, gather gender relevant data inspired by the questions supplied by the CCICED Toolkit on Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability Combine into standardized template \u2022 Combine these frameworks to create an overarching template for the selected case studies.

An increase in the number of coastal flooding events and overwashing occurring several times per year, exacerbated by sea level rise and climate change, established that the existing shingle bank was insufficient to protect against floods. This posed significant actual and potential risks to life and caused damage to property and infrastructure. Additionally, coastal squeeze caused losses of coastal habitat. In response, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom delivered a GBP 27 million project to realign the defences inland, providing significantly improved flood defences to allow for managed flooding. The intervention created 300 hectares of habitat (183 of which is intertidal, including mudflat, salt marsh and transitional grassland), protection of more than 300 homes, road infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant and a boom to local tourism and recreation, with 22,000 visitors each year. The main positive impacts of the Figure 5: Aerial view of the intervention area taken in September 2013 (\u00a9 Environment Agency of the United Kingdom) 8 Medmerry managed coastal realignment include improved flood risk management, creation of wildlife habitats, enhanced landscape quality and provision of recreational facilities. Table 2: Characteristics and benefits of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Strong adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status All major NbS restoration activities have been completed and monitored. The focus is now on the continuous sustainable management of the intervention area. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges At the project planning stage, local communities, government representatives and statutory organisations were involved in the development of a vision for Medmerry, highlighting a wide range of impacts, including societal and environmental. The vision exercise highlighted disaster risk reduction, especially flooding, as a major priority. Additionally, environmental assessment data of flood events (the most serious recent event before the start of the project occurred in 2008 and caused over GBP 5 million in economic damage and required evacuation due to risk of life[14]), flood risk mapping and modelling confirmed flooding as the main societal challenge. These assessments were based on global best practices. Impacts of climate change were found to be an exacerbating factor. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale During the planning phase, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out and a full risk register developed. To achieve flood reduction and environmental improvement, 200 miles of the UK coast were assessed to determine the most promising opportunities for NbS, considering landscape, impacts on people and surrounding habitats. In addition, wider impacts across the region were assessed in accordance with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, including people, businesses, infrastructure and environments. While the coastal realignment provided many new business opportunities, these were not considered in depth during the planning phase. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The expected impacts on the ecosystems in the intervention areas were captured in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). These included mitigation measures for any risks to biodiversity during construction. For 9 instance, water voles were translocated prior to the start of the works.

Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The project placed particular emphasis on stakeholder engagement and participation of local communities in all phases of the project. This included proactively providing information about the benefits of the coastal realignment, gaining widespread support for the intervention and seeking community views and inputs. A comprehensive stakeholder analysis allowed a mapping of how best to engage with the different stakeholders. The Medmerry Stakeholder Advisory Group was established, made up of key individuals of the local community, including Parish Councils, local businesses and residents most affected by the coastal realignment. The Advisory Group helped shape the 10 design of the project and met regularly to discuss any issues and concerns. Although a complaints procedure was in place, which enabled affected individuals to raise concerns through an independent ombudsman, more could have been done to ease the associated bureaucratic burden. The active and intentional involvement of the local community and subsequent support generated, contributed significantly to the success of the project. [15] Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The costs and benefits of the NbS intervention were mapped in line with UK government assessment criteria and included the surrounding areas of the intervention site (landscape level). Annual meetings with stakeholders ensured that the NbS intervention provided the expected benefits. Public access (footpaths, cycle paths and bridleway) to the newly established nature reserve was enhanced and recreational areas provided, while maintaining a balance between recreational activities and undisturbed conservation areas. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The expected benefits were documented in the planning phase and baselines established. These informed the ongoing monitoring of NbS impacts. Immediately after project completion, a five-year monitoring programme was implemented. Annual reports summarised findings and lessons learned, which were shared and discussed with local stakeholders, external consultants, academia and risk management authorities in south England. Approaches to project planning and implementation were adjusted as needed. For instance, the approach applied to engaging the local community was adapted based on early experiences and analysis of challenges and barriers. [15] Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context While lessons learned have been captured in annual reports and through the monitoring framework, these have only been shared with a limited audience. The main benefits that have been communicated relate to reduced flood risk and created habitat. The success of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment along with other NbS interventions informed the organisational national strategy and increased the focus on NbS nationally. The project was characterised by comprehensively considering climate change and biodiversity throughout the design, implementation and monitoring phases. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Participatory and collaborative approaches. Inclusive governance and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, especially the local community, ensured effective assessment of societal challenges and priorities in the given context, increased understanding and acceptability of the proposed solution and enabled effective planning, implementation and maintenance/management of the NbS intervention, with a possibility for creative problem-solving. 11 Transparency. Transparent and structured engagement and participation of the local community throughout the project and in decision-making processes \u2013 starting with the design stage \u2013 helped to address concerns, build trust and create ownership.

The negative impacts caused by increased flood risk also caused transboundary challenges between Vietnam and Cambodia. Based on documented farmer knowledge and experience, IUCN promoted and improved locally-practiced, flood-based (wetland) agriculture and livelihood models in the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap and Long An. Flood-based livelihoods were encouraged as a financially viable, low risk alternative to triple rice cropping, to enhance economic and social resilience as well as to conserve and restore the biodiversity found in Mekong Delta freshwater wetlands/floodplains. The NbS intervention considered three systems - floating rice systems, lotus farming systems and rice aquaculture systems. Due to increasing weather extremes, hybrid solutions were also explored (combination of dykes and floodplains), to enable controlled flooding and adaptive approaches to overcome risks of drought and to manage the arrival and recession of floods. While the main focus of the NbS intervention was on farmers adding an additional flood-based crop in open flood (no dyke) and flood control zones (low dyke), the utility of replacing low value irrigated crops with higher value flood-based crops in closed control zones (high dyke) was also considered. In order to achieve the full set of biodiversity and human wellbeing benefits derived from moderated floods, interventions need to be scaled up across the entirety of the Mekong Delta floodplain. To do so, a follow-up project is currently being developed under the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Initial studies of farmer initiatives and proof of concept in IUCN pilot sites were completed between 2015 and 2018. These fed into the design and implementation of similar projects in the region (e.g. those by the World Bank, IUCN and FAO).

The economic component was not sufficiently considered in the design of the initial intervention, though marketable products were identified. While initial IUCN pilot interventions remained limited and small-scale, collaboration across similar projects and recent policy developments currently support the development of a large-scale intervention across the 1.4 million ha of the Upper Mekong Delta floodplain. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The focus of the intervention was on modified wetland ecosystems (formally zoned as agricultural land under private tenure) and thus excluded practices carried out in protected and conserved areas. In light of the extensive scientific evidence on the risks of rice intensification, it was possible to assess the status of ecosystems as well as drivers of change and biodiversity loss. Due to the rather small scale of the IUCN pilot interventions, no concrete data or monitoring frameworks to capture the positive biodiversity outcomes were implemented. Instead, outcomes were captured in general terms, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural functions of the floodplain. Detailed 14 monitoring for potential, unintended adverse consequences on nature arising from the intervention was not carried out. Key investments in biodiversity outcomes[16]: \uf0b7 Investments into 450 ha of flood-based livelihoods to enhance ecosystem functions of floodplains, which resulted in the conservation or restoration of approx. 6.7 million m\u00b3 of flood retention capacity supporting aquifer recharge, the reduction in land subsidence and the conservation or restoration of aquatic habitat/biodiversity; \uf0b7 additional benefits were observed from wild fisheries, mitigation of river erosion through the re-establishment of natural hydrology of seasonal flooding and increased land fertility, including through sediment deposition due to the seasonal flooding. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable A feasibility study for a GCF proposal revealed that several hundred thousand farmers and a number of downstream towns would benefit financially from flooding if seasonal flood-based agriculture were applied. In addition, cost- benefit analyses were carried out on the profitability of flood-based crops and the cropping system as a whole in comparison to mono-rice cropping. The NbS intervention did not consider the development of clear value chains and business models, which hampered securing long-term funding sources to maintain the NbS. Instead, the intervention relied on short-term, project-based grant funding. The planned GCF project could help overcome some of these shortcomings. Key expected economic benefits[16]: \uf0b7 flood-based livelihoods have the potential to be 1.5 to five times more profitable than intensive rice cropping; \uf0b7 floating rice systems could generate around USD 6,400 per ha per year, while triple rice cropping systems generate only USD 3,100 per ha per year; \uf0b7 where farmers add a flood-based crop in open flood or flood control zones, additional income between USD 2,293 \u2013 USD 5,744 per ha per year could be generated depending on the flood-based agriculture system applied[17]; \uf0b7 in open flood and flood control zones, no investments need to be made towards flood management, while in closed control zones (high dykes), sluice coordination by the local government is necessary; flood-based agriculture could serve as an incentive to stop conversion of low dykes to high dykes, which in turn helps preserve the floodplains in the Upper Mekong Delta. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and No grievance mechanism was put in place for the IUCN pilot NbS interventions, due to the small-scale and limited number of farmers involved. A grievance 15 empowering governance processes mechanism was put in place for the larger scale World Bank ICRSL project implementation as was required by World Bank safeguard policies. A stakeholder analysis provided insights into which stakeholders were directly and indirectly affected. Stakeholders provided inputs into the regional vision and plans for phasing out intensive triple rice crop farming. In addition, since farmers have private tenure over their land, farmer participation in decision-making and ownership of such decisions was essential.

However, it is not yet operational. This constitutes a shortcoming for the NbS intervention. For the World Bank ICRSL project, social and environmental safeguards were put in place. However, the limits of trade-offs were not discussed in detail. In some areas a hybrid model was used, with low dykes controlling the timing of flood arrival/recession to support double-cropping and flood-based cropping (instead of the traditional third rice crop). In the case of lotus farming systems, flood-based agriculture enabled diversification of activities, including fish raising, ecotourism and recreational opportunities. In the future, value chains, especially for rice production, will need to be considered in more detail to support the new flood-based agriculture model and gain support from rice exporters. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence While National Resolution 120 provided an enabling policy environment for flood-based agriculture, examples of interventions that ran counter to the resolution remained. This weakened the impact of the NbS intervention and underlined that monitoring needed to be improved. There is no evidence as to whether there has been a government response to adapt the approach. Limited technical and institutional capacity was identified as a key factor. Lessons learned from the IUCN pilots and experiences from other similar initiatives are shared regularly at the Mekong Delta Development Partners Working Group and Annual Mekong Delta Forums. Further, the emerging interest from academia in flood-based agriculture is already producing relevant data and information. Additionally, the preparation of the planned Green Climate Fund 16 proposal considers the above challenges. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The NbS intervention built on the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which recommended high-value double rice cropping in combination with seasonal flood-based agriculture/aquaculture to manage flood risks. This influenced the promulgation of National Resolution 120, entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d; this policy was adopted in November 2017 and stipulates that nature-based adaptation models should be selected that are environmentally sound and achieve sustainable development based on \u2018actively living with the floods\u2019. The Mekong Delta Forum provided a space for knowledge exchange on lessons learned and endorsement of a common vision for the Upper Mekong Delta, including a move to more natural land and water uses. An IUCN-led Green Climate Fund proposal is under preparation to ensure continuity of efforts and to address transboundary challenges. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Legal and regulatory framework. Supportive legal and policy frameworks opened up opportunities for a change in land use and facilitated partnerships across related initiatives for the adoption of flood-based agriculture in open flood and flood control zones. A need for market incentives. The NbS intervention in Vietnam could have profited from a more holistic approach regarding the diversification of marketable products derived from flood-based agriculture to provide additional market incentives. Through consultations and analysis of lessons learned, market access and a lack of value chain development were identified as the greatest challenges for scaling up flood-based agriculture. This is influencing the design of the future Green Climate Fund project. Overcoming small-scale and time-bound interventions. A hybrid system of flood-based agriculture with some flooding control system of low dykes could help manage risks of early/heavy floods and droughts. The highest potential lies in the closed flood zones with high dykes through the opening of sluices during seasonal floods to restore the flood retention area. However, existing projects have not yet addressed this potential. This demonstrates that for NbS interventions to achieve positive impacts at scale, small-scale (often focussed on pilots), project-based and time- bound interventions are not sufficient to address complex societal challenges.

The proposed NbS intervention focussed on creating an integrated management model offering a long-term management strategy for the coastal wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano \u2013 a new regional park. It contributed to balancing social and environmental needs and paved the way to recognise the economic and cultural potential of the wetlands. Since the implementation of activities is still ongoing, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment was used Figure 7: Area archeologica di tharros, San Giovanni di Sinis, Cabras, Italy (\u00a9 L\u00e9onard Cotte, Unsplash) 18 to identify entry points to strengthen the NbS intervention. This analysis was carried out by the UNEP Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the UN Environment Programme and recommendations published in a report.[18] Table 4: Characteristics and benefits of the Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status Implementation of the NbS intervention is ongoing. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped identify the key societal challenges that needed addressing. These management plans also provided insights into human activities in the region, such as aquaculture and fishing. General information on drivers and responses of the identified societal challenges was gathered; however, there was no data specific to the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. An area for improvement identified as part of the self- assessment relates to strengthening the links to human wellbeing outcomes. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The aim of the intervention was to overcome fragmentation between the various wetland ecosystems in the Gulf of Oristano. The collaboration established among 11 municipalities through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract helped advance coordination, including across sectors. Further, interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems fed into the design of the intervention and considered various activities, including fishing, flood risk management, agriculture and tourism among others. Vulnerability and risk maps were developed. However, it was recommended that additional data be gathered to understand risks across the catchment and better define the adaptation and resilience actions to climate change, including related to connectivity between wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped understand the current state of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity in the region. Regular monitoring is 19 ecosystem integrity ensured through an integrated information system, the Oristano Wetland Observatory. In addition, the implementation of a Wetland Index is planned. Options to enhance integrity of the wetland ecosystems were implemented. These included the restoration of ecological connections, creation of buffer zones and preservation of native habitats. Key biodiversity outcomes: \uf0b7 Strengthened conservation of coastal and marine habitats; \uf0b7 Reinforced resilience to climate change impacts; \uf0b7 Reduced water consumption, abstraction, pollution and contamination. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable This criterion turned out to be the weakest for this NbS intervention. No specific cost-effectiveness study was conducted. Cost-benefit analyses and consideration of alternatives were conducted only for a limited number of the wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano. The long-term resourcing of the NbS was partially secured through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract. Additional resourcing is expected through the new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 as well as through the new funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan that is currently being developed. Moreover, the institution of a new protected area (regional park) will be an instrument to attract new funds and ensure the ongoing management of wetlands. A full economic analysis was suggested as a priority action going forward to secure the continuity and sustainability of the NbS intervention.

Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits A basic analysis of the rights, usage of and access to land and resources was done. It revealed that the regional government owns the wetlands, while surrounding areas are either under public or private ownership. Concessions are given to fisher cooperatives. The results of the self-assessment revealed a major shortcoming in agreeing limits of trade-offs and related safeguards. This aspect was included as a priority action moving forward. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract defined guidelines and actions that steered the definition of intended outcomes and actions and informed 20 on evidence monitoring and evaluation of the intervention. The Integrated Information System developed as part of the initiative provided uniform and regular data on the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. The collected information will be used for regular monitoring over time. However, no concrete plan of how the monitoring may trigger an adaptive management response was prepared. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract is an important document supporting the implementation of integrated, coordinated and collaborative approaches at scale. The Contract is an important legal instrument as it reinforces the commitment towards joint policy action to overcome fragmentation of coastal wetlands management, looking towards the establishment of a new regional protected area, which is the first aim of the Action Plan attached to the Contract. It provides the foundation for NbS actions in the Gulf of Oristano. In addition, national and global targets were key reference points for the design of the NbS intervention and Ramsar information sheets were updated for the six Ramsar sites. A new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 is under preparation by the regional government. Steps will be taken to integrate the results of the NbS intervention into the strategy to promote its long-term continuity. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Defining priority and corrective actions to strengthen the intervention. An analysis of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 indicators that have been insufficiently or only partially addressed helped to make recommendations for improvement and to identify concrete corrective actions to strengthen the implementation of the NbS intervention.[18] This demonstrates how the self-assessment can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of NbS interventions. Strong legal basis. The adoption of the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract by the 11 municipalities provided an important legal basis and framework to advance integrated management of six wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. It provided strategies and actions that support ongoing efforts toward the establishment of a new regional park. 3.4 Sustainable aquaculture and innovative seaweed farming in Zanzibar Location: Zanzibar, Tanzania Main implementing organisation: International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Other implementing organisation: Ecosystem-based Aquaculture Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Commission on Ecosystem Management (IUCN CEM) Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 2 (solution for sustainable management of restored and managed ecosystems, including innovative land-use planning protocols) 21 Case overview: Since 1990, Zanzibar has become a primary seaweed producer in Africa. Seaweed farming activities are usually small-scale and carried out in the intertidal zones largely in marine conservation areas, near mangroves and coral reefs. Eighty-eight per cent of seaweed farmers are women, making this an important activity to elevate their economic status and role in the community.[19] Climate change, the absence of producer associations, difficulties in accessing international markets and insufficient protection of coastal ecosystems have contributed to a decline in the production of higher-valued seaweeds. While the co-management approach applied in Zanzibar aims to protect coastal ecosystems and habitats, enhance artisanal fisheries and mariculture, shortcomings in the management remain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54af2990-1301-4181-a465-6432a470a524": {"__data__": {"id_": "54af2990-1301-4181-a465-6432a470a524", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/using-case-studies-enhance-guidance-other-effective-area-based", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Using Case Studies to Enhance Guidance on Other Effective Area Based Conservation Measures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/using-case-studies-enhance-guidance-other-effective-area-based", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc67c6f6e6ede08a7db24c4d8c17c569411dbfee408bf3982704fdaf4153a146"}, "2": {"node_id": "2be4c923-3888-458b-a406-3dcf18aaeac2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/using-case-studies-enhance-guidance-other-effective-area-based", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a45d34b9b0442f32a3f6b60d9e09a6b046fd85192bf32d5675b529b6eb2fc082"}}, "hash": "8a7008c918fb177e2de86ce225780880e0acf0083fbebc7e1324023f2bee1543", "text": "New approaches to aquaculture and marine conservation have emerged only recently (in terms of concrete projects since 2014), with the case in Zanzibar serving as a first attempt to test the level of adherence of seaweed farming with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39.

It should also be noted that the self-assessment was carried out as a desk review. Further, means of verification were not always available, as data relating to certain indicators were not gathered. To conduct a more comprehensive assessment, local stakeholders should be involved as key informants. Nevertheless, the self-assessment provided insights into areas for improvement as to how interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. It also provided insights into knowledge and data gaps, which prompted critical questions and corrective actions that need to be addressed going forward. Intervention status Initial activities are completed. Future actions, research and knowledge needs are being assessed. Figure 8: Women working in seaweed farms in Pemba, Zantibar (\u00a9 R. le Gouvello) 22 Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges were identified, documented and prioritised through a theory of change exercise. This included a stakeholder workshop and engagement with local authorities to verify the information. Several studies provided insights into the positive outcomes of mariculture and seaweed farming, which included gender equality, economic revenues provided to women and the consequences on their life, including increased autonomy, empowerment and role in the communities. Although there was an understanding of the internal and external risks of the intervention, the SWOT analysis carried out for the Zanzibar case showed that a number of weaknesses and threats have not yet been addressed. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The application of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) ensured a recognition of interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems. A more holistic approach should be applied in future interventions to take into account the impact of value chains and access to markets for local livelihoods. Some synergies across sectors were identified. However, since the theory of change exercise was not completed due to time constraints, complementary interventions were not integrated fully into the design of the intervention. It was recommended to work with stakeholders to complete this exercise and achieve synergies for future interventions, especially between aquaculture, marine conservation and other relevant sectors. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. The analysis of the biodiversity benefits achieved through this intervention were largely based on a desk review of existing literature and information rather than a specific assessment, monitoring framework or thorough and collective effort with key informants and stakeholders. As was highlighted in a recent study published by IUCN, criterion 3 is the most difficult to achieve for seaweed farming and aquaculture.[19] There is a clear need to establish measures to reduce, control and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, better documentation of the ecological state of the ecosystem, ecosystem connectivity and assessment of impacts is required. In this regard, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is an important tool to call attention to these issues and helps improve interventions that would otherwise cause harm to coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable Seaweed farming is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. The intervention did not carry out a global value chain assessment or detailed 23 assessment of climate change impacts. These could have provided insights into the economic feasibility and sustainability of the intervention, especially with regards to supporting the livelihoods of local women, who predominantly engage in seaweed farming. In addition, alternative scenarios and options need to be explored going forward to identify the most suitable, sustainable and economically viable solution in the specific context. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Co-management approaches were applied in marine conservation areas. These involved the government and local communities, often with international support. They demonstrated the willingness of the Government of Zanzibar to implement blue growth strategies that are inclusive of local communities and aim to build a sustainable future. The need to further increase and improve the participation of women and aquaculture farmers in decision-making, to enhance transparency and to provide access to information, was highlighted. There are also opportunities to enhance cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. While there was a reported willingness from the Government of Zanzibar to consider relevant trade-offs, the limits of these trade-offs and associated safeguards were not clarified. Existing cost-benefit analyses have not yet considered environmental aspects that would trigger corrective action.

By completing the self-assessment under the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39, it was possible to make concrete recommendations on how to improve the balancing of trade-offs, while ensuring the sustainability of the intervention. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Government of Zanzibar put in place a blue growth strategy, which considers the challenges of seaweed farming, including related sustainability concerns. However, there is as yet no evidence of a formal mechanism to monitor and evaluate interventions on a regular basis to determine adaptive management responses. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Since the 1980s, the Government of Zanzibar encouraged multi-use marine protected zones, which were included in relevant sectoral laws and policies. A blue growth strategy and regulations support seaweed farming practices and the achievement of global targets. The means by which lessons learned are captured and communicated have been highlighted as an area for improvement. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) 24 Lessons learned: Taking corrective action. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 served as an important tool to reflect on Nature-based Solution design, implementation and monitoring challenges. It provided insights into areas that require corrective action, the collection of additional evidence and means of verification and involvement of local stakeholders. In this manner, the self- assessment results will inform future work on aquaculture and seaweed farming in Zanzibar (and elsewhere) and help improve intervention design, implementation and monitoring frameworks. Reviewing the understanding of the NbS criteria and indicators. Several rounds of discussions, guided by IUCN expert reviewers, were held on the rationale and means of verification provided per indicator. These revealed that the criteria were sometimes understood and interpreted differently by different people, impacting the assigned rating. This demonstrated the complexities associated with assessing whether an intervention can be considered a Nature-based Solution and the need for thorough and guided consideration of each indicator. Continued engagement. A new agenda of research and development work has emerged, including dialogues around NbS criteria and indicators with stakeholders in Zanzibar and local communities. This could contribute to a future roadmap for Zanzibar and a framework for regular self- evaluation. 25 4 Summary of results First, case studies offer important opportunities for exchange of experiences, reflection on different approaches applied in different contexts as well as lessons learned with regards to opportunities, challenges and needed corrective actions. The agreed documentation framework and resulting prototype database of case studies based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 and elements from the PANORAMA: solutions for a healthy planet case study database, greatly support the analysis and comparability of experiences by offering common and robust parameters for benchmarking interventions.5 Second, there is tremendous strength in inclusive governance and open, transparent and participatory approaches that draw on local and/or traditional knowledge, engage Indigenous people, local communities and traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and youth. As illustrated in the Guatemala and Zanzibar cases, women in particular can benefit from enhanced opportunities, social status and income generated through NbS, when the design accounts for their role and inherent gender gaps. Third, scale is an important success factor. Small-scale, time-bound, pilot and project-based interventions often fail to address the full complexity of societal challenges and rarely produce the biodiversity and human wellbeing outcomes expected from the NbS. Finally, an enabling institutional, legal and policy environment provides the backbone for the implementation of and investments in NbS by making nature an ally in addressing societal challenges. Supportive, clear and coherent legal and policy frameworks can further enhance and facilitate coordination across relevant sectors and actors as well as protect the rights of affected and vulnerable communities that benefit directly or indirectly from an intervention. 5 More reflections on the benefits of the prototype database see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions, reference [11] 26 References [1] Mace, G.M.

Case studies can be a useful tool to illustrate the value of NbS interventions. They demonstrate the elements that are essential for the successful design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NbS and thus enable learning from experiences in different contexts. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is particular suited to document the positive contributions of NbS. Based on its science-based and widely consulted criteria and indicators, the Standard helps verify NbS applications and promotes comparability as well as a coherent and consistent framework for benchmarking interventions.

NbS emerged from this deeper understanding as a way to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach, with the primary goal of applying conservation approaches to safeguard society (see Figure 1).[1, 2, 3] Figure 1: Nature-based Solutions to address societal challenges. The seven societal challenges indicators are climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, economic and social development, human health, food security, water security and environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. (\u00a9 IUCN) More recently, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 1 This IUCN definition was endorsed by IUCN\u2019s 1,400 members at the 2016 World Conservation Congress in Resolution 069; an expanded definition was recently adopted at UNEA-5.2 in the resolution entitled Nature-based Solutions for supporting sustainable development 2 Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognised NbS and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and contributions to people.[4] Moreover, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), held in Nairobi in the first quarter of 2022, adopted a resolution on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development.[5] An assessment of NbS requires a consistent and common framework that helps document the positive contributions of NbS to green economic development, ecosystem management, climate change and other societally desirable outcomes. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is a valuable tool to verify a range of NbS applications. [6] The eight criteria (see Figure 2) and 28 indicators of the Standard provide clear, science-based and widely consulted parameters for benchmarking NbS interventions.[6, 7] The interdependent and non-hierarchical nature of its eight criteria implies that to be in adherence an intervention has to at least partially address each criterion. As a result, inadequacy in just one criterion means that the intervention in question is not in adherence with the Standard and therefore cannot be verified as an NbS. Figure 2: The eight criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 (\u00a9 IUCN) Adherence with the Standard means that the NbS action sufficiently addresses critical environmental, social and economic dimensions (aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), legal and policy considerations, inclusive governance and participation aspects. Due to its compatibility with the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, the Standard provides the necessary focus on achieving impact at scale, preventing misuse and applying safeguards for the verification and/or subsequent improvement of interventions to be considered NbS. The process-oriented quality of the Standard also provides additional value for analysing and extracting key lessons learned from case studies. It allows reflection on and increases understanding of challenges and opportunities, differentiates between strong and weak NbS interventions, and provides room for corrective and adaptive management and learning throughout the intervention cycle. 3 The international case studies presented here provide insights into particular success factors and challenges for NbS interventions and, thus, promote and enhance uptake, implementation and financing of NbS. Further, they support an effort to build a prototype database of NbS cases using the Standard as a lens through which to understand verification and lessons learned. 4 2 Methodology The prototype database of NbS cases was conceived through an agreed documentation framework, the selection of illustrative international case studies, and the analysis and presentation of five international case studies in accordance with the documentation framework. Inclusivity and gender considerations were given particular attention and wherever possible, disaggregated data is provided. By highlighting the inclusion of different knowledge systems and participation in decision-making of those affected by NbS interventions (including Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth), the case studies demonstrate the critical importance of inclusive governance for the success of an NbS intervention. They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c717f8da-5847-49a5-9cae-4db7808fd020": {"__data__": {"id_": "c717f8da-5847-49a5-9cae-4db7808fd020", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-guidance-other-effective-area-based-conservation-measures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ADVANCING GUIDANCE ON OTHER EFFECTIVE AREA-BASED CONSERVATION MEASURES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-guidance-other-effective-area-based-conservation-measures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4899413c61bc89a9b6e7e1df2e395a47ca154e4e7cb26ee645fa40a6a3bea1c3"}, "2": {"node_id": "51fb0f20-53bf-4abb-a4ce-b61aca875f25", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-guidance-other-effective-area-based-conservation-measures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f99653b30969d64b8a2f3ac012cc0b720807ba8e943424a36d611d674fbd065d"}}, "hash": "c8f6468e70cfc47378e633b777b2f7b87ed1be6bc349294e5cd3e26e9235543b", "text": "They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.

To facilitate this, a combined template \u2013 the documentation framework \u2013 was developed to ensure that the required information would be collected and collated. In order to ensure this framework was complementary with the most relevant databases, a mapping of NbS resources from the EU project NetworkNature was utilised (not yet publicly available).[10] Subsequently, relevant information from the case studies related to the documentation framework was gathered. The case study documentation framework captures key information about each of the case studies. It was designed to combine inputs from the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39 and the information required by the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database to help classify each of the case studies (see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions[11]). 5 2.2 Case study selection and documentation The case study selection process focussed on identifying and agreeing on the five most relevant international case studies. It was agreed that the selected cases should provide a good representation across societal challenges, ecosystems and sectors. The initial longlist of international case studies was drawn from cases that had already undergone a full assessment with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39. In accordance with the classification discussed in Section 2 of the CCICED Special Policy Study Report on \u201cValue Assessment of Nature- based Solutions\u201d, discussions with the Special Policy Study team and the availability of sufficient qualitative and quantitative information, five case studies were selected, analysed and documented. The results can be found below and on the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database.[12] Identify priority databases \u2022 Use NetworkNature mapping to identify three priority databases (e.g. PANORAMA) Extract documentation framework \u2022 Collect the documentation required for PANORAMA, finding gender disaggregated data where possible \u2022 In addition, gather gender relevant data inspired by the questions supplied by the CCICED Toolkit on Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability Combine into standardized template \u2022 Combine these frameworks to create an overarching template for the selected case studies.

An increase in the number of coastal flooding events and overwashing occurring several times per year, exacerbated by sea level rise and climate change, established that the existing shingle bank was insufficient to protect against floods. This posed significant actual and potential risks to life and caused damage to property and infrastructure. Additionally, coastal squeeze caused losses of coastal habitat. In response, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom delivered a GBP 27 million project to realign the defences inland, providing significantly improved flood defences to allow for managed flooding. The intervention created 300 hectares of habitat (183 of which is intertidal, including mudflat, salt marsh and transitional grassland), protection of more than 300 homes, road infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant and a boom to local tourism and recreation, with 22,000 visitors each year. The main positive impacts of the Figure 5: Aerial view of the intervention area taken in September 2013 (\u00a9 Environment Agency of the United Kingdom) 8 Medmerry managed coastal realignment include improved flood risk management, creation of wildlife habitats, enhanced landscape quality and provision of recreational facilities. Table 2: Characteristics and benefits of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Strong adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status All major NbS restoration activities have been completed and monitored. The focus is now on the continuous sustainable management of the intervention area. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges At the project planning stage, local communities, government representatives and statutory organisations were involved in the development of a vision for Medmerry, highlighting a wide range of impacts, including societal and environmental. The vision exercise highlighted disaster risk reduction, especially flooding, as a major priority. Additionally, environmental assessment data of flood events (the most serious recent event before the start of the project occurred in 2008 and caused over GBP 5 million in economic damage and required evacuation due to risk of life[14]), flood risk mapping and modelling confirmed flooding as the main societal challenge. These assessments were based on global best practices. Impacts of climate change were found to be an exacerbating factor. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale During the planning phase, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out and a full risk register developed. To achieve flood reduction and environmental improvement, 200 miles of the UK coast were assessed to determine the most promising opportunities for NbS, considering landscape, impacts on people and surrounding habitats. In addition, wider impacts across the region were assessed in accordance with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, including people, businesses, infrastructure and environments. While the coastal realignment provided many new business opportunities, these were not considered in depth during the planning phase. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The expected impacts on the ecosystems in the intervention areas were captured in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). These included mitigation measures for any risks to biodiversity during construction. For 9 instance, water voles were translocated prior to the start of the works.

Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The project placed particular emphasis on stakeholder engagement and participation of local communities in all phases of the project. This included proactively providing information about the benefits of the coastal realignment, gaining widespread support for the intervention and seeking community views and inputs. A comprehensive stakeholder analysis allowed a mapping of how best to engage with the different stakeholders. The Medmerry Stakeholder Advisory Group was established, made up of key individuals of the local community, including Parish Councils, local businesses and residents most affected by the coastal realignment. The Advisory Group helped shape the 10 design of the project and met regularly to discuss any issues and concerns. Although a complaints procedure was in place, which enabled affected individuals to raise concerns through an independent ombudsman, more could have been done to ease the associated bureaucratic burden. The active and intentional involvement of the local community and subsequent support generated, contributed significantly to the success of the project. [15] Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The costs and benefits of the NbS intervention were mapped in line with UK government assessment criteria and included the surrounding areas of the intervention site (landscape level). Annual meetings with stakeholders ensured that the NbS intervention provided the expected benefits. Public access (footpaths, cycle paths and bridleway) to the newly established nature reserve was enhanced and recreational areas provided, while maintaining a balance between recreational activities and undisturbed conservation areas. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The expected benefits were documented in the planning phase and baselines established. These informed the ongoing monitoring of NbS impacts. Immediately after project completion, a five-year monitoring programme was implemented. Annual reports summarised findings and lessons learned, which were shared and discussed with local stakeholders, external consultants, academia and risk management authorities in south England. Approaches to project planning and implementation were adjusted as needed. For instance, the approach applied to engaging the local community was adapted based on early experiences and analysis of challenges and barriers. [15] Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context While lessons learned have been captured in annual reports and through the monitoring framework, these have only been shared with a limited audience. The main benefits that have been communicated relate to reduced flood risk and created habitat. The success of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment along with other NbS interventions informed the organisational national strategy and increased the focus on NbS nationally. The project was characterised by comprehensively considering climate change and biodiversity throughout the design, implementation and monitoring phases. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Participatory and collaborative approaches. Inclusive governance and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, especially the local community, ensured effective assessment of societal challenges and priorities in the given context, increased understanding and acceptability of the proposed solution and enabled effective planning, implementation and maintenance/management of the NbS intervention, with a possibility for creative problem-solving. 11 Transparency.

The negative impacts caused by increased flood risk also caused transboundary challenges between Vietnam and Cambodia. Based on documented farmer knowledge and experience, IUCN promoted and improved locally-practiced, flood-based (wetland) agriculture and livelihood models in the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap and Long An. Flood-based livelihoods were encouraged as a financially viable, low risk alternative to triple rice cropping, to enhance economic and social resilience as well as to conserve and restore the biodiversity found in Mekong Delta freshwater wetlands/floodplains. The NbS intervention considered three systems - floating rice systems, lotus farming systems and rice aquaculture systems. Due to increasing weather extremes, hybrid solutions were also explored (combination of dykes and floodplains), to enable controlled flooding and adaptive approaches to overcome risks of drought and to manage the arrival and recession of floods. While the main focus of the NbS intervention was on farmers adding an additional flood-based crop in open flood (no dyke) and flood control zones (low dyke), the utility of replacing low value irrigated crops with higher value flood-based crops in closed control zones (high dyke) was also considered. In order to achieve the full set of biodiversity and human wellbeing benefits derived from moderated floods, interventions need to be scaled up across the entirety of the Mekong Delta floodplain. To do so, a follow-up project is currently being developed under the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Initial studies of farmer initiatives and proof of concept in IUCN pilot sites were completed between 2015 and 2018. These fed into the design and implementation of similar projects in the region (e.g. those by the World Bank, IUCN and FAO). Efforts towards an IUCN-led large-scale and transformative GCF-funded project for the Mekong Delta will build on and scale up the results of the various initiatives and enhance 4 Between 2000 and 2011, the volume of flood storage has halved from 9,200 billion m\u00b3 to 4,700 billion m\u00b3 (ICEM (2015) A Guide to Resilient Decision Making in the Mekong Delta.

The economic component was not sufficiently considered in the design of the initial intervention, though marketable products were identified. While initial IUCN pilot interventions remained limited and small-scale, collaboration across similar projects and recent policy developments currently support the development of a large-scale intervention across the 1.4 million ha of the Upper Mekong Delta floodplain. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The focus of the intervention was on modified wetland ecosystems (formally zoned as agricultural land under private tenure) and thus excluded practices carried out in protected and conserved areas. In light of the extensive scientific evidence on the risks of rice intensification, it was possible to assess the status of ecosystems as well as drivers of change and biodiversity loss. Due to the rather small scale of the IUCN pilot interventions, no concrete data or monitoring frameworks to capture the positive biodiversity outcomes were implemented. Instead, outcomes were captured in general terms, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural functions of the floodplain. Detailed 14 monitoring for potential, unintended adverse consequences on nature arising from the intervention was not carried out. Key investments in biodiversity outcomes[16]: \uf0b7 Investments into 450 ha of flood-based livelihoods to enhance ecosystem functions of floodplains, which resulted in the conservation or restoration of approx. 6.7 million m\u00b3 of flood retention capacity supporting aquifer recharge, the reduction in land subsidence and the conservation or restoration of aquatic habitat/biodiversity; \uf0b7 additional benefits were observed from wild fisheries, mitigation of river erosion through the re-establishment of natural hydrology of seasonal flooding and increased land fertility, including through sediment deposition due to the seasonal flooding. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable A feasibility study for a GCF proposal revealed that several hundred thousand farmers and a number of downstream towns would benefit financially from flooding if seasonal flood-based agriculture were applied. In addition, cost- benefit analyses were carried out on the profitability of flood-based crops and the cropping system as a whole in comparison to mono-rice cropping. The NbS intervention did not consider the development of clear value chains and business models, which hampered securing long-term funding sources to maintain the NbS. Instead, the intervention relied on short-term, project-based grant funding. The planned GCF project could help overcome some of these shortcomings. Key expected economic benefits[16]: \uf0b7 flood-based livelihoods have the potential to be 1.5 to five times more profitable than intensive rice cropping; \uf0b7 floating rice systems could generate around USD 6,400 per ha per year, while triple rice cropping systems generate only USD 3,100 per ha per year; \uf0b7 where farmers add a flood-based crop in open flood or flood control zones, additional income between USD 2,293 \u2013 USD 5,744 per ha per year could be generated depending on the flood-based agriculture system applied[17]; \uf0b7 in open flood and flood control zones, no investments need to be made towards flood management, while in closed control zones (high dykes), sluice coordination by the local government is necessary; flood-based agriculture could serve as an incentive to stop conversion of low dykes to high dykes, which in turn helps preserve the floodplains in the Upper Mekong Delta. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and No grievance mechanism was put in place for the IUCN pilot NbS interventions, due to the small-scale and limited number of farmers involved. A grievance 15 empowering governance processes mechanism was put in place for the larger scale World Bank ICRSL project implementation as was required by World Bank safeguard policies. A stakeholder analysis provided insights into which stakeholders were directly and indirectly affected. Stakeholders provided inputs into the regional vision and plans for phasing out intensive triple rice crop farming. In addition, since farmers have private tenure over their land, farmer participation in decision-making and ownership of such decisions was essential. National Resolution 120 entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d and Decision 593 defined the roles and responsibilities of different actors in decision-making processes and recognised the need for policy reform rather than small-scale community- based solutions.

However, it is not yet operational. This constitutes a shortcoming for the NbS intervention. For the World Bank ICRSL project, social and environmental safeguards were put in place. However, the limits of trade-offs were not discussed in detail. In some areas a hybrid model was used, with low dykes controlling the timing of flood arrival/recession to support double-cropping and flood-based cropping (instead of the traditional third rice crop). In the case of lotus farming systems, flood-based agriculture enabled diversification of activities, including fish raising, ecotourism and recreational opportunities. In the future, value chains, especially for rice production, will need to be considered in more detail to support the new flood-based agriculture model and gain support from rice exporters. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence While National Resolution 120 provided an enabling policy environment for flood-based agriculture, examples of interventions that ran counter to the resolution remained. This weakened the impact of the NbS intervention and underlined that monitoring needed to be improved. There is no evidence as to whether there has been a government response to adapt the approach. Limited technical and institutional capacity was identified as a key factor. Lessons learned from the IUCN pilots and experiences from other similar initiatives are shared regularly at the Mekong Delta Development Partners Working Group and Annual Mekong Delta Forums. Further, the emerging interest from academia in flood-based agriculture is already producing relevant data and information. Additionally, the preparation of the planned Green Climate Fund 16 proposal considers the above challenges. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The NbS intervention built on the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which recommended high-value double rice cropping in combination with seasonal flood-based agriculture/aquaculture to manage flood risks. This influenced the promulgation of National Resolution 120, entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d; this policy was adopted in November 2017 and stipulates that nature-based adaptation models should be selected that are environmentally sound and achieve sustainable development based on \u2018actively living with the floods\u2019. The Mekong Delta Forum provided a space for knowledge exchange on lessons learned and endorsement of a common vision for the Upper Mekong Delta, including a move to more natural land and water uses. An IUCN-led Green Climate Fund proposal is under preparation to ensure continuity of efforts and to address transboundary challenges. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Legal and regulatory framework. Supportive legal and policy frameworks opened up opportunities for a change in land use and facilitated partnerships across related initiatives for the adoption of flood-based agriculture in open flood and flood control zones. A need for market incentives. The NbS intervention in Vietnam could have profited from a more holistic approach regarding the diversification of marketable products derived from flood-based agriculture to provide additional market incentives. Through consultations and analysis of lessons learned, market access and a lack of value chain development were identified as the greatest challenges for scaling up flood-based agriculture. This is influencing the design of the future Green Climate Fund project. Overcoming small-scale and time-bound interventions. A hybrid system of flood-based agriculture with some flooding control system of low dykes could help manage risks of early/heavy floods and droughts. The highest potential lies in the closed flood zones with high dykes through the opening of sluices during seasonal floods to restore the flood retention area. However, existing projects have not yet addressed this potential. This demonstrates that for NbS interventions to achieve positive impacts at scale, small-scale (often focussed on pilots), project-based and time- bound interventions are not sufficient to address complex societal challenges. Nevertheless, partnerships between related interventions in the region contributed to institutional and policy development as well as supported greater cross-sectoral coordination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84603032-54d3-458d-bd3e-7b92d0939f5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "84603032-54d3-458d-bd3e-7b92d0939f5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-guidance-other-effective-area-based-conservation-measures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ADVANCING GUIDANCE ON OTHER EFFECTIVE AREA-BASED CONSERVATION MEASURES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-guidance-other-effective-area-based-conservation-measures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fc9a31d3353cde6c7e3907e74e6c4202215485b34308d3139bef7dba7c9c733"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f9c0660-57c6-4abb-bf4e-cefa80203252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-guidance-other-effective-area-based-conservation-measures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb4de15ce8adb0126957edbc56660b2fe499cc6498dce797b36857f76e247019"}}, "hash": "89533a1670f0d0b8e6079df94b2318445ac7576e5ed840b929c76d6ee6689091", "text": "17 3.3 Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management Location: Gulf of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy Main implementing organisation: MEDSEA Mediterranean Sea and Coast Foundation Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 1 (solution that makes better use of existing natural and protected ecosystems) Case overview: The Gulf of Oristano is home to a number of freshwater and coastal wetlands.

It contributed to balancing social and environmental needs and paved the way to recognise the economic and cultural potential of the wetlands. Since the implementation of activities is still ongoing, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment was used Figure 7: Area archeologica di tharros, San Giovanni di Sinis, Cabras, Italy (\u00a9 L\u00e9onard Cotte, Unsplash) 18 to identify entry points to strengthen the NbS intervention. This analysis was carried out by the UNEP Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the UN Environment Programme and recommendations published in a report.[18] Table 4: Characteristics and benefits of the Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status Implementation of the NbS intervention is ongoing. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped identify the key societal challenges that needed addressing. These management plans also provided insights into human activities in the region, such as aquaculture and fishing. General information on drivers and responses of the identified societal challenges was gathered; however, there was no data specific to the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. An area for improvement identified as part of the self- assessment relates to strengthening the links to human wellbeing outcomes. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The aim of the intervention was to overcome fragmentation between the various wetland ecosystems in the Gulf of Oristano. The collaboration established among 11 municipalities through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract helped advance coordination, including across sectors. Further, interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems fed into the design of the intervention and considered various activities, including fishing, flood risk management, agriculture and tourism among others. Vulnerability and risk maps were developed. However, it was recommended that additional data be gathered to understand risks across the catchment and better define the adaptation and resilience actions to climate change, including related to connectivity between wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped understand the current state of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity in the region. Regular monitoring is 19 ecosystem integrity ensured through an integrated information system, the Oristano Wetland Observatory. In addition, the implementation of a Wetland Index is planned. Options to enhance integrity of the wetland ecosystems were implemented. These included the restoration of ecological connections, creation of buffer zones and preservation of native habitats. Key biodiversity outcomes: \uf0b7 Strengthened conservation of coastal and marine habitats; \uf0b7 Reinforced resilience to climate change impacts; \uf0b7 Reduced water consumption, abstraction, pollution and contamination. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable This criterion turned out to be the weakest for this NbS intervention. No specific cost-effectiveness study was conducted. Cost-benefit analyses and consideration of alternatives were conducted only for a limited number of the wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano. The long-term resourcing of the NbS was partially secured through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract. Additional resourcing is expected through the new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 as well as through the new funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan that is currently being developed. Moreover, the institution of a new protected area (regional park) will be an instrument to attract new funds and ensure the ongoing management of wetlands. A full economic analysis was suggested as a priority action going forward to secure the continuity and sustainability of the NbS intervention.

In addition, national and global targets were key reference points for the design of the NbS intervention and Ramsar information sheets were updated for the six Ramsar sites. A new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 is under preparation by the regional government. Steps will be taken to integrate the results of the NbS intervention into the strategy to promote its long-term continuity. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Defining priority and corrective actions to strengthen the intervention. An analysis of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 indicators that have been insufficiently or only partially addressed helped to make recommendations for improvement and to identify concrete corrective actions to strengthen the implementation of the NbS intervention.[18] This demonstrates how the self-assessment can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of NbS interventions. Strong legal basis. The adoption of the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract by the 11 municipalities provided an important legal basis and framework to advance integrated management of six wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. It provided strategies and actions that support ongoing efforts toward the establishment of a new regional park. 3.4 Sustainable aquaculture and innovative seaweed farming in Zanzibar Location: Zanzibar, Tanzania Main implementing organisation: International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Other implementing organisation: Ecosystem-based Aquaculture Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Commission on Ecosystem Management (IUCN CEM) Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 2 (solution for sustainable management of restored and managed ecosystems, including innovative land-use planning protocols) 21 Case overview: Since 1990, Zanzibar has become a primary seaweed producer in Africa. Seaweed farming activities are usually small-scale and carried out in the intertidal zones largely in marine conservation areas, near mangroves and coral reefs. Eighty-eight per cent of seaweed farmers are women, making this an important activity to elevate their economic status and role in the community.[19] Climate change, the absence of producer associations, difficulties in accessing international markets and insufficient protection of coastal ecosystems have contributed to a decline in the production of higher-valued seaweeds. While the co-management approach applied in Zanzibar aims to protect coastal ecosystems and habitats, enhance artisanal fisheries and mariculture, shortcomings in the management remain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "286f37f4-b860-45ab-b12e-b07ef71f9015": {"__data__": {"id_": "286f37f4-b860-45ab-b12e-b07ef71f9015", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-guidance-other-effective-area-based-conservation-measures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ADVANCING GUIDANCE ON OTHER EFFECTIVE AREA-BASED CONSERVATION MEASURES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-guidance-other-effective-area-based-conservation-measures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09c571b7f09f4cfba2100ffef30db7dc5a02b96b554564793471df3e0d05b8c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a721e2c-a1cb-48a1-867f-3a8cd923ad9a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/advancing-guidance-other-effective-area-based-conservation-measures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e60ddb2af271593cf639a7df06afef7453dfe2c1f9f91f36341bdbade2a8d83"}}, "hash": "20a8c4184ff47884fb1bd5adcd6c674120328cf6b6caa9cfdecdcfc242636e08", "text": "New approaches to aquaculture and marine conservation have emerged only recently (in terms of concrete projects since 2014), with the case in Zanzibar serving as a first attempt to test the level of adherence of seaweed farming with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39.

It should also be noted that the self-assessment was carried out as a desk review. Further, means of verification were not always available, as data relating to certain indicators were not gathered. To conduct a more comprehensive assessment, local stakeholders should be involved as key informants. Nevertheless, the self-assessment provided insights into areas for improvement as to how interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. It also provided insights into knowledge and data gaps, which prompted critical questions and corrective actions that need to be addressed going forward. Intervention status Initial activities are completed. Future actions, research and knowledge needs are being assessed. Figure 8: Women working in seaweed farms in Pemba, Zantibar (\u00a9 R. le Gouvello) 22 Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges were identified, documented and prioritised through a theory of change exercise. This included a stakeholder workshop and engagement with local authorities to verify the information. Several studies provided insights into the positive outcomes of mariculture and seaweed farming, which included gender equality, economic revenues provided to women and the consequences on their life, including increased autonomy, empowerment and role in the communities. Although there was an understanding of the internal and external risks of the intervention, the SWOT analysis carried out for the Zanzibar case showed that a number of weaknesses and threats have not yet been addressed. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The application of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) ensured a recognition of interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems. A more holistic approach should be applied in future interventions to take into account the impact of value chains and access to markets for local livelihoods. Some synergies across sectors were identified. However, since the theory of change exercise was not completed due to time constraints, complementary interventions were not integrated fully into the design of the intervention. It was recommended to work with stakeholders to complete this exercise and achieve synergies for future interventions, especially between aquaculture, marine conservation and other relevant sectors. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. The analysis of the biodiversity benefits achieved through this intervention were largely based on a desk review of existing literature and information rather than a specific assessment, monitoring framework or thorough and collective effort with key informants and stakeholders. As was highlighted in a recent study published by IUCN, criterion 3 is the most difficult to achieve for seaweed farming and aquaculture.[19] There is a clear need to establish measures to reduce, control and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, better documentation of the ecological state of the ecosystem, ecosystem connectivity and assessment of impacts is required. In this regard, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is an important tool to call attention to these issues and helps improve interventions that would otherwise cause harm to coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable Seaweed farming is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. The intervention did not carry out a global value chain assessment or detailed 23 assessment of climate change impacts. These could have provided insights into the economic feasibility and sustainability of the intervention, especially with regards to supporting the livelihoods of local women, who predominantly engage in seaweed farming. In addition, alternative scenarios and options need to be explored going forward to identify the most suitable, sustainable and economically viable solution in the specific context. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Co-management approaches were applied in marine conservation areas. These involved the government and local communities, often with international support. They demonstrated the willingness of the Government of Zanzibar to implement blue growth strategies that are inclusive of local communities and aim to build a sustainable future. The need to further increase and improve the participation of women and aquaculture farmers in decision-making, to enhance transparency and to provide access to information, was highlighted. There are also opportunities to enhance cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. While there was a reported willingness from the Government of Zanzibar to consider relevant trade-offs, the limits of these trade-offs and associated safeguards were not clarified. Existing cost-benefit analyses have not yet considered environmental aspects that would trigger corrective action.

By completing the self-assessment under the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39, it was possible to make concrete recommendations on how to improve the balancing of trade-offs, while ensuring the sustainability of the intervention. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Government of Zanzibar put in place a blue growth strategy, which considers the challenges of seaweed farming, including related sustainability concerns. However, there is as yet no evidence of a formal mechanism to monitor and evaluate interventions on a regular basis to determine adaptive management responses. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Since the 1980s, the Government of Zanzibar encouraged multi-use marine protected zones, which were included in relevant sectoral laws and policies. A blue growth strategy and regulations support seaweed farming practices and the achievement of global targets. The means by which lessons learned are captured and communicated have been highlighted as an area for improvement. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) 24 Lessons learned: Taking corrective action. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 served as an important tool to reflect on Nature-based Solution design, implementation and monitoring challenges. It provided insights into areas that require corrective action, the collection of additional evidence and means of verification and involvement of local stakeholders. In this manner, the self- assessment results will inform future work on aquaculture and seaweed farming in Zanzibar (and elsewhere) and help improve intervention design, implementation and monitoring frameworks. Reviewing the understanding of the NbS criteria and indicators. Several rounds of discussions, guided by IUCN expert reviewers, were held on the rationale and means of verification provided per indicator. These revealed that the criteria were sometimes understood and interpreted differently by different people, impacting the assigned rating. This demonstrated the complexities associated with assessing whether an intervention can be considered a Nature-based Solution and the need for thorough and guided consideration of each indicator. Continued engagement. A new agenda of research and development work has emerged, including dialogues around NbS criteria and indicators with stakeholders in Zanzibar and local communities. This could contribute to a future roadmap for Zanzibar and a framework for regular self- evaluation. 25 4 Summary of results First, case studies offer important opportunities for exchange of experiences, reflection on different approaches applied in different contexts as well as lessons learned with regards to opportunities, challenges and needed corrective actions. The agreed documentation framework and resulting prototype database of case studies based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 and elements from the PANORAMA: solutions for a healthy planet case study database, greatly support the analysis and comparability of experiences by offering common and robust parameters for benchmarking interventions.5 Second, there is tremendous strength in inclusive governance and open, transparent and participatory approaches that draw on local and/or traditional knowledge, engage Indigenous people, local communities and traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and youth. As illustrated in the Guatemala and Zanzibar cases, women in particular can benefit from enhanced opportunities, social status and income generated through NbS, when the design accounts for their role and inherent gender gaps. Third, scale is an important success factor. Small-scale, time-bound, pilot and project-based interventions often fail to address the full complexity of societal challenges and rarely produce the biodiversity and human wellbeing outcomes expected from the NbS. Finally, an enabling institutional, legal and policy environment provides the backbone for the implementation of and investments in NbS by making nature an ally in addressing societal challenges. Supportive, clear and coherent legal and policy frameworks can further enhance and facilitate coordination across relevant sectors and actors as well as protect the rights of affected and vulnerable communities that benefit directly or indirectly from an intervention. 5 More reflections on the benefits of the prototype database see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions, reference [11] 26 References [1] Mace, G.M.

Case studies can be a useful tool to illustrate the value of NbS interventions. They demonstrate the elements that are essential for the successful design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NbS and thus enable learning from experiences in different contexts. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is particular suited to document the positive contributions of NbS. Based on its science-based and widely consulted criteria and indicators, the Standard helps verify NbS applications and promotes comparability as well as a coherent and consistent framework for benchmarking interventions.

NbS emerged from this deeper understanding as a way to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach, with the primary goal of applying conservation approaches to safeguard society (see Figure 1).[1, 2, 3] Figure 1: Nature-based Solutions to address societal challenges. The seven societal challenges indicators are climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, economic and social development, human health, food security, water security and environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. (\u00a9 IUCN) More recently, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 1 This IUCN definition was endorsed by IUCN\u2019s 1,400 members at the 2016 World Conservation Congress in Resolution 069; an expanded definition was recently adopted at UNEA-5.2 in the resolution entitled Nature-based Solutions for supporting sustainable development 2 Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognised NbS and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and contributions to people.[4] Moreover, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), held in Nairobi in the first quarter of 2022, adopted a resolution on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development.[5] An assessment of NbS requires a consistent and common framework that helps document the positive contributions of NbS to green economic development, ecosystem management, climate change and other societally desirable outcomes. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is a valuable tool to verify a range of NbS applications. [6] The eight criteria (see Figure 2) and 28 indicators of the Standard provide clear, science-based and widely consulted parameters for benchmarking NbS interventions.[6, 7] The interdependent and non-hierarchical nature of its eight criteria implies that to be in adherence an intervention has to at least partially address each criterion. As a result, inadequacy in just one criterion means that the intervention in question is not in adherence with the Standard and therefore cannot be verified as an NbS. Figure 2: The eight criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 (\u00a9 IUCN) Adherence with the Standard means that the NbS action sufficiently addresses critical environmental, social and economic dimensions (aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), legal and policy considerations, inclusive governance and participation aspects. Due to its compatibility with the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, the Standard provides the necessary focus on achieving impact at scale, preventing misuse and applying safeguards for the verification and/or subsequent improvement of interventions to be considered NbS. The process-oriented quality of the Standard also provides additional value for analysing and extracting key lessons learned from case studies. It allows reflection on and increases understanding of challenges and opportunities, differentiates between strong and weak NbS interventions, and provides room for corrective and adaptive management and learning throughout the intervention cycle. 3 The international case studies presented here provide insights into particular success factors and challenges for NbS interventions and, thus, promote and enhance uptake, implementation and financing of NbS. Further, they support an effort to build a prototype database of NbS cases using the Standard as a lens through which to understand verification and lessons learned. 4 2 Methodology The prototype database of NbS cases was conceived through an agreed documentation framework, the selection of illustrative international case studies, and the analysis and presentation of five international case studies in accordance with the documentation framework. Inclusivity and gender considerations were given particular attention and wherever possible, disaggregated data is provided. By highlighting the inclusion of different knowledge systems and participation in decision-making of those affected by NbS interventions (including Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth), the case studies demonstrate the critical importance of inclusive governance for the success of an NbS intervention. They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8cca76ac-83d9-463e-9124-61918c253fcf": {"__data__": {"id_": "8cca76ac-83d9-463e-9124-61918c253fcf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-co-chairs-report-first-meeting-international-experts", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "OECMs: CO-\u00adCHAIRS\u2019 REPORT OF THE FIRST MEETING OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-co-chairs-report-first-meeting-international-experts", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f736e1cbc432f345600c7208818d07a32243c19d8dad53b588a0ec78b4c3f88"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7e1e132-658b-40b4-af23-76df0acfa4a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-co-chairs-report-first-meeting-international-experts", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e241092c6cc31e26addc850c13df4e3a4de552c3f9ac71859e29ee93a8d9db87"}}, "hash": "acb39573d2bb0e7fbb4944f62949c69bc4029c4068d845711e5a76f050d76872", "text": "They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture. Especially concerning the role of women, the case studies highlight multiple dimensions of gender and gender-responsive approaches in the design and implementation of NbS interventions to understand and overcome gender-based gaps.

To facilitate this, a combined template \u2013 the documentation framework \u2013 was developed to ensure that the required information would be collected and collated. In order to ensure this framework was complementary with the most relevant databases, a mapping of NbS resources from the EU project NetworkNature was utilised (not yet publicly available).[10] Subsequently, relevant information from the case studies related to the documentation framework was gathered. The case study documentation framework captures key information about each of the case studies. It was designed to combine inputs from the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39 and the information required by the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database to help classify each of the case studies (see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions[11]). 5 2.2 Case study selection and documentation The case study selection process focussed on identifying and agreeing on the five most relevant international case studies. It was agreed that the selected cases should provide a good representation across societal challenges, ecosystems and sectors. The initial longlist of international case studies was drawn from cases that had already undergone a full assessment with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39. In accordance with the classification discussed in Section 2 of the CCICED Special Policy Study Report on \u201cValue Assessment of Nature- based Solutions\u201d, discussions with the Special Policy Study team and the availability of sufficient qualitative and quantitative information, five case studies were selected, analysed and documented. The results can be found below and on the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database.[12] Identify priority databases \u2022 Use NetworkNature mapping to identify three priority databases (e.g. PANORAMA) Extract documentation framework \u2022 Collect the documentation required for PANORAMA, finding gender disaggregated data where possible \u2022 In addition, gather gender relevant data inspired by the questions supplied by the CCICED Toolkit on Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability Combine into standardized template \u2022 Combine these frameworks to create an overarching template for the selected case studies.

An increase in the number of coastal flooding events and overwashing occurring several times per year, exacerbated by sea level rise and climate change, established that the existing shingle bank was insufficient to protect against floods. This posed significant actual and potential risks to life and caused damage to property and infrastructure. Additionally, coastal squeeze caused losses of coastal habitat. In response, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom delivered a GBP 27 million project to realign the defences inland, providing significantly improved flood defences to allow for managed flooding. The intervention created 300 hectares of habitat (183 of which is intertidal, including mudflat, salt marsh and transitional grassland), protection of more than 300 homes, road infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant and a boom to local tourism and recreation, with 22,000 visitors each year. The main positive impacts of the Figure 5: Aerial view of the intervention area taken in September 2013 (\u00a9 Environment Agency of the United Kingdom) 8 Medmerry managed coastal realignment include improved flood risk management, creation of wildlife habitats, enhanced landscape quality and provision of recreational facilities. Table 2: Characteristics and benefits of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Strong adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status All major NbS restoration activities have been completed and monitored. The focus is now on the continuous sustainable management of the intervention area. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges At the project planning stage, local communities, government representatives and statutory organisations were involved in the development of a vision for Medmerry, highlighting a wide range of impacts, including societal and environmental. The vision exercise highlighted disaster risk reduction, especially flooding, as a major priority. Additionally, environmental assessment data of flood events (the most serious recent event before the start of the project occurred in 2008 and caused over GBP 5 million in economic damage and required evacuation due to risk of life[14]), flood risk mapping and modelling confirmed flooding as the main societal challenge. These assessments were based on global best practices. Impacts of climate change were found to be an exacerbating factor. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale During the planning phase, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out and a full risk register developed. To achieve flood reduction and environmental improvement, 200 miles of the UK coast were assessed to determine the most promising opportunities for NbS, considering landscape, impacts on people and surrounding habitats. In addition, wider impacts across the region were assessed in accordance with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, including people, businesses, infrastructure and environments. While the coastal realignment provided many new business opportunities, these were not considered in depth during the planning phase. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The expected impacts on the ecosystems in the intervention areas were captured in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). These included mitigation measures for any risks to biodiversity during construction. For 9 instance, water voles were translocated prior to the start of the works.

Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The project placed particular emphasis on stakeholder engagement and participation of local communities in all phases of the project. This included proactively providing information about the benefits of the coastal realignment, gaining widespread support for the intervention and seeking community views and inputs. A comprehensive stakeholder analysis allowed a mapping of how best to engage with the different stakeholders. The Medmerry Stakeholder Advisory Group was established, made up of key individuals of the local community, including Parish Councils, local businesses and residents most affected by the coastal realignment. The Advisory Group helped shape the 10 design of the project and met regularly to discuss any issues and concerns. Although a complaints procedure was in place, which enabled affected individuals to raise concerns through an independent ombudsman, more could have been done to ease the associated bureaucratic burden. The active and intentional involvement of the local community and subsequent support generated, contributed significantly to the success of the project. [15] Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The costs and benefits of the NbS intervention were mapped in line with UK government assessment criteria and included the surrounding areas of the intervention site (landscape level). Annual meetings with stakeholders ensured that the NbS intervention provided the expected benefits. Public access (footpaths, cycle paths and bridleway) to the newly established nature reserve was enhanced and recreational areas provided, while maintaining a balance between recreational activities and undisturbed conservation areas. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The expected benefits were documented in the planning phase and baselines established. These informed the ongoing monitoring of NbS impacts. Immediately after project completion, a five-year monitoring programme was implemented. Annual reports summarised findings and lessons learned, which were shared and discussed with local stakeholders, external consultants, academia and risk management authorities in south England. Approaches to project planning and implementation were adjusted as needed. For instance, the approach applied to engaging the local community was adapted based on early experiences and analysis of challenges and barriers. [15] Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context While lessons learned have been captured in annual reports and through the monitoring framework, these have only been shared with a limited audience. The main benefits that have been communicated relate to reduced flood risk and created habitat. The success of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment along with other NbS interventions informed the organisational national strategy and increased the focus on NbS nationally. The project was characterised by comprehensively considering climate change and biodiversity throughout the design, implementation and monitoring phases. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Participatory and collaborative approaches. Inclusive governance and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, especially the local community, ensured effective assessment of societal challenges and priorities in the given context, increased understanding and acceptability of the proposed solution and enabled effective planning, implementation and maintenance/management of the NbS intervention, with a possibility for creative problem-solving. 11 Transparency.

The negative impacts caused by increased flood risk also caused transboundary challenges between Vietnam and Cambodia. Based on documented farmer knowledge and experience, IUCN promoted and improved locally-practiced, flood-based (wetland) agriculture and livelihood models in the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap and Long An. Flood-based livelihoods were encouraged as a financially viable, low risk alternative to triple rice cropping, to enhance economic and social resilience as well as to conserve and restore the biodiversity found in Mekong Delta freshwater wetlands/floodplains. The NbS intervention considered three systems - floating rice systems, lotus farming systems and rice aquaculture systems. Due to increasing weather extremes, hybrid solutions were also explored (combination of dykes and floodplains), to enable controlled flooding and adaptive approaches to overcome risks of drought and to manage the arrival and recession of floods. While the main focus of the NbS intervention was on farmers adding an additional flood-based crop in open flood (no dyke) and flood control zones (low dyke), the utility of replacing low value irrigated crops with higher value flood-based crops in closed control zones (high dyke) was also considered. In order to achieve the full set of biodiversity and human wellbeing benefits derived from moderated floods, interventions need to be scaled up across the entirety of the Mekong Delta floodplain. To do so, a follow-up project is currently being developed under the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Initial studies of farmer initiatives and proof of concept in IUCN pilot sites were completed between 2015 and 2018. These fed into the design and implementation of similar projects in the region (e.g. those by the World Bank, IUCN and FAO).

The economic component was not sufficiently considered in the design of the initial intervention, though marketable products were identified. While initial IUCN pilot interventions remained limited and small-scale, collaboration across similar projects and recent policy developments currently support the development of a large-scale intervention across the 1.4 million ha of the Upper Mekong Delta floodplain. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The focus of the intervention was on modified wetland ecosystems (formally zoned as agricultural land under private tenure) and thus excluded practices carried out in protected and conserved areas. In light of the extensive scientific evidence on the risks of rice intensification, it was possible to assess the status of ecosystems as well as drivers of change and biodiversity loss. Due to the rather small scale of the IUCN pilot interventions, no concrete data or monitoring frameworks to capture the positive biodiversity outcomes were implemented. Instead, outcomes were captured in general terms, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural functions of the floodplain. Detailed 14 monitoring for potential, unintended adverse consequences on nature arising from the intervention was not carried out. Key investments in biodiversity outcomes[16]: \uf0b7 Investments into 450 ha of flood-based livelihoods to enhance ecosystem functions of floodplains, which resulted in the conservation or restoration of approx. 6.7 million m\u00b3 of flood retention capacity supporting aquifer recharge, the reduction in land subsidence and the conservation or restoration of aquatic habitat/biodiversity; \uf0b7 additional benefits were observed from wild fisheries, mitigation of river erosion through the re-establishment of natural hydrology of seasonal flooding and increased land fertility, including through sediment deposition due to the seasonal flooding. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable A feasibility study for a GCF proposal revealed that several hundred thousand farmers and a number of downstream towns would benefit financially from flooding if seasonal flood-based agriculture were applied. In addition, cost- benefit analyses were carried out on the profitability of flood-based crops and the cropping system as a whole in comparison to mono-rice cropping. The NbS intervention did not consider the development of clear value chains and business models, which hampered securing long-term funding sources to maintain the NbS. Instead, the intervention relied on short-term, project-based grant funding. The planned GCF project could help overcome some of these shortcomings. Key expected economic benefits[16]: \uf0b7 flood-based livelihoods have the potential to be 1.5 to five times more profitable than intensive rice cropping; \uf0b7 floating rice systems could generate around USD 6,400 per ha per year, while triple rice cropping systems generate only USD 3,100 per ha per year; \uf0b7 where farmers add a flood-based crop in open flood or flood control zones, additional income between USD 2,293 \u2013 USD 5,744 per ha per year could be generated depending on the flood-based agriculture system applied[17]; \uf0b7 in open flood and flood control zones, no investments need to be made towards flood management, while in closed control zones (high dykes), sluice coordination by the local government is necessary; flood-based agriculture could serve as an incentive to stop conversion of low dykes to high dykes, which in turn helps preserve the floodplains in the Upper Mekong Delta. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and No grievance mechanism was put in place for the IUCN pilot NbS interventions, due to the small-scale and limited number of farmers involved. A grievance 15 empowering governance processes mechanism was put in place for the larger scale World Bank ICRSL project implementation as was required by World Bank safeguard policies. A stakeholder analysis provided insights into which stakeholders were directly and indirectly affected. Stakeholders provided inputs into the regional vision and plans for phasing out intensive triple rice crop farming. In addition, since farmers have private tenure over their land, farmer participation in decision-making and ownership of such decisions was essential.

However, it is not yet operational. This constitutes a shortcoming for the NbS intervention. For the World Bank ICRSL project, social and environmental safeguards were put in place. However, the limits of trade-offs were not discussed in detail. In some areas a hybrid model was used, with low dykes controlling the timing of flood arrival/recession to support double-cropping and flood-based cropping (instead of the traditional third rice crop). In the case of lotus farming systems, flood-based agriculture enabled diversification of activities, including fish raising, ecotourism and recreational opportunities. In the future, value chains, especially for rice production, will need to be considered in more detail to support the new flood-based agriculture model and gain support from rice exporters. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence While National Resolution 120 provided an enabling policy environment for flood-based agriculture, examples of interventions that ran counter to the resolution remained. This weakened the impact of the NbS intervention and underlined that monitoring needed to be improved. There is no evidence as to whether there has been a government response to adapt the approach. Limited technical and institutional capacity was identified as a key factor. Lessons learned from the IUCN pilots and experiences from other similar initiatives are shared regularly at the Mekong Delta Development Partners Working Group and Annual Mekong Delta Forums. Further, the emerging interest from academia in flood-based agriculture is already producing relevant data and information. Additionally, the preparation of the planned Green Climate Fund 16 proposal considers the above challenges. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The NbS intervention built on the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which recommended high-value double rice cropping in combination with seasonal flood-based agriculture/aquaculture to manage flood risks. This influenced the promulgation of National Resolution 120, entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d; this policy was adopted in November 2017 and stipulates that nature-based adaptation models should be selected that are environmentally sound and achieve sustainable development based on \u2018actively living with the floods\u2019. The Mekong Delta Forum provided a space for knowledge exchange on lessons learned and endorsement of a common vision for the Upper Mekong Delta, including a move to more natural land and water uses. An IUCN-led Green Climate Fund proposal is under preparation to ensure continuity of efforts and to address transboundary challenges. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Legal and regulatory framework. Supportive legal and policy frameworks opened up opportunities for a change in land use and facilitated partnerships across related initiatives for the adoption of flood-based agriculture in open flood and flood control zones. A need for market incentives. The NbS intervention in Vietnam could have profited from a more holistic approach regarding the diversification of marketable products derived from flood-based agriculture to provide additional market incentives. Through consultations and analysis of lessons learned, market access and a lack of value chain development were identified as the greatest challenges for scaling up flood-based agriculture. This is influencing the design of the future Green Climate Fund project. Overcoming small-scale and time-bound interventions. A hybrid system of flood-based agriculture with some flooding control system of low dykes could help manage risks of early/heavy floods and droughts. The highest potential lies in the closed flood zones with high dykes through the opening of sluices during seasonal floods to restore the flood retention area. However, existing projects have not yet addressed this potential. This demonstrates that for NbS interventions to achieve positive impacts at scale, small-scale (often focussed on pilots), project-based and time- bound interventions are not sufficient to address complex societal challenges.

The main economic activities in the region include artisanal fishing, agriculture and tourism. The proposed NbS intervention focussed on creating an integrated management model offering a long-term management strategy for the coastal wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano \u2013 a new regional park. It contributed to balancing social and environmental needs and paved the way to recognise the economic and cultural potential of the wetlands. Since the implementation of activities is still ongoing, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment was used Figure 7: Area archeologica di tharros, San Giovanni di Sinis, Cabras, Italy (\u00a9 L\u00e9onard Cotte, Unsplash) 18 to identify entry points to strengthen the NbS intervention. This analysis was carried out by the UNEP Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the UN Environment Programme and recommendations published in a report.[18] Table 4: Characteristics and benefits of the Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status Implementation of the NbS intervention is ongoing. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped identify the key societal challenges that needed addressing. These management plans also provided insights into human activities in the region, such as aquaculture and fishing. General information on drivers and responses of the identified societal challenges was gathered; however, there was no data specific to the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. An area for improvement identified as part of the self- assessment relates to strengthening the links to human wellbeing outcomes. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The aim of the intervention was to overcome fragmentation between the various wetland ecosystems in the Gulf of Oristano. The collaboration established among 11 municipalities through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract helped advance coordination, including across sectors. Further, interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems fed into the design of the intervention and considered various activities, including fishing, flood risk management, agriculture and tourism among others. Vulnerability and risk maps were developed. However, it was recommended that additional data be gathered to understand risks across the catchment and better define the adaptation and resilience actions to climate change, including related to connectivity between wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped understand the current state of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity in the region. Regular monitoring is 19 ecosystem integrity ensured through an integrated information system, the Oristano Wetland Observatory. In addition, the implementation of a Wetland Index is planned. Options to enhance integrity of the wetland ecosystems were implemented. These included the restoration of ecological connections, creation of buffer zones and preservation of native habitats. Key biodiversity outcomes: \uf0b7 Strengthened conservation of coastal and marine habitats; \uf0b7 Reinforced resilience to climate change impacts; \uf0b7 Reduced water consumption, abstraction, pollution and contamination. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable This criterion turned out to be the weakest for this NbS intervention. No specific cost-effectiveness study was conducted. Cost-benefit analyses and consideration of alternatives were conducted only for a limited number of the wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano. The long-term resourcing of the NbS was partially secured through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract. Additional resourcing is expected through the new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 as well as through the new funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan that is currently being developed. Moreover, the institution of a new protected area (regional park) will be an instrument to attract new funds and ensure the ongoing management of wetlands. A full economic analysis was suggested as a priority action going forward to secure the continuity and sustainability of the NbS intervention.

Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits A basic analysis of the rights, usage of and access to land and resources was done. It revealed that the regional government owns the wetlands, while surrounding areas are either under public or private ownership. Concessions are given to fisher cooperatives. The results of the self-assessment revealed a major shortcoming in agreeing limits of trade-offs and related safeguards. This aspect was included as a priority action moving forward. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract defined guidelines and actions that steered the definition of intended outcomes and actions and informed 20 on evidence monitoring and evaluation of the intervention. The Integrated Information System developed as part of the initiative provided uniform and regular data on the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. The collected information will be used for regular monitoring over time. However, no concrete plan of how the monitoring may trigger an adaptive management response was prepared. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract is an important document supporting the implementation of integrated, coordinated and collaborative approaches at scale. The Contract is an important legal instrument as it reinforces the commitment towards joint policy action to overcome fragmentation of coastal wetlands management, looking towards the establishment of a new regional protected area, which is the first aim of the Action Plan attached to the Contract. It provides the foundation for NbS actions in the Gulf of Oristano. In addition, national and global targets were key reference points for the design of the NbS intervention and Ramsar information sheets were updated for the six Ramsar sites. A new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 is under preparation by the regional government. Steps will be taken to integrate the results of the NbS intervention into the strategy to promote its long-term continuity. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Defining priority and corrective actions to strengthen the intervention. An analysis of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 indicators that have been insufficiently or only partially addressed helped to make recommendations for improvement and to identify concrete corrective actions to strengthen the implementation of the NbS intervention.[18] This demonstrates how the self-assessment can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of NbS interventions. Strong legal basis. The adoption of the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract by the 11 municipalities provided an important legal basis and framework to advance integrated management of six wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. It provided strategies and actions that support ongoing efforts toward the establishment of a new regional park. 3.4 Sustainable aquaculture and innovative seaweed farming in Zanzibar Location: Zanzibar, Tanzania Main implementing organisation: International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Other implementing organisation: Ecosystem-based Aquaculture Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Commission on Ecosystem Management (IUCN CEM) Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 2 (solution for sustainable management of restored and managed ecosystems, including innovative land-use planning protocols) 21 Case overview: Since 1990, Zanzibar has become a primary seaweed producer in Africa. Seaweed farming activities are usually small-scale and carried out in the intertidal zones largely in marine conservation areas, near mangroves and coral reefs. Eighty-eight per cent of seaweed farmers are women, making this an important activity to elevate their economic status and role in the community.[19] Climate change, the absence of producer associations, difficulties in accessing international markets and insufficient protection of coastal ecosystems have contributed to a decline in the production of higher-valued seaweeds. While the co-management approach applied in Zanzibar aims to protect coastal ecosystems and habitats, enhance artisanal fisheries and mariculture, shortcomings in the management remain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd322f29-beac-4bc6-864e-788967ca6a7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd322f29-beac-4bc6-864e-788967ca6a7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-co-chairs-report-first-meeting-international-experts", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "OECMs: CO-\u00adCHAIRS\u2019 REPORT OF THE FIRST MEETING OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-co-chairs-report-first-meeting-international-experts", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac468910e10cda450cf700d8f9ff35f0b436d24649242a67462fc6fb27739d99"}, "2": {"node_id": "0acce76b-f8e3-486e-a809-96d5ab1fa8b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-co-chairs-report-first-meeting-international-experts", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6cf3576d7916b418c43da5603a4021a23b0e3e5dba2edb5bf77d246648c73be8"}}, "hash": "44a5a10ab8a54966617eca941f404baa1a30566cbab8b9b2617e862eb2dd411e", "text": "New approaches to aquaculture and marine conservation have emerged only recently (in terms of concrete projects since 2014), with the case in Zanzibar serving as a first attempt to test the level of adherence of seaweed farming with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39.

It should also be noted that the self-assessment was carried out as a desk review. Further, means of verification were not always available, as data relating to certain indicators were not gathered. To conduct a more comprehensive assessment, local stakeholders should be involved as key informants. Nevertheless, the self-assessment provided insights into areas for improvement as to how interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. It also provided insights into knowledge and data gaps, which prompted critical questions and corrective actions that need to be addressed going forward. Intervention status Initial activities are completed. Future actions, research and knowledge needs are being assessed. Figure 8: Women working in seaweed farms in Pemba, Zantibar (\u00a9 R. le Gouvello) 22 Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges were identified, documented and prioritised through a theory of change exercise. This included a stakeholder workshop and engagement with local authorities to verify the information. Several studies provided insights into the positive outcomes of mariculture and seaweed farming, which included gender equality, economic revenues provided to women and the consequences on their life, including increased autonomy, empowerment and role in the communities. Although there was an understanding of the internal and external risks of the intervention, the SWOT analysis carried out for the Zanzibar case showed that a number of weaknesses and threats have not yet been addressed. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The application of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) ensured a recognition of interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems. A more holistic approach should be applied in future interventions to take into account the impact of value chains and access to markets for local livelihoods. Some synergies across sectors were identified. However, since the theory of change exercise was not completed due to time constraints, complementary interventions were not integrated fully into the design of the intervention. It was recommended to work with stakeholders to complete this exercise and achieve synergies for future interventions, especially between aquaculture, marine conservation and other relevant sectors. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. The analysis of the biodiversity benefits achieved through this intervention were largely based on a desk review of existing literature and information rather than a specific assessment, monitoring framework or thorough and collective effort with key informants and stakeholders. As was highlighted in a recent study published by IUCN, criterion 3 is the most difficult to achieve for seaweed farming and aquaculture.[19] There is a clear need to establish measures to reduce, control and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, better documentation of the ecological state of the ecosystem, ecosystem connectivity and assessment of impacts is required. In this regard, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is an important tool to call attention to these issues and helps improve interventions that would otherwise cause harm to coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable Seaweed farming is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. The intervention did not carry out a global value chain assessment or detailed 23 assessment of climate change impacts. These could have provided insights into the economic feasibility and sustainability of the intervention, especially with regards to supporting the livelihoods of local women, who predominantly engage in seaweed farming. In addition, alternative scenarios and options need to be explored going forward to identify the most suitable, sustainable and economically viable solution in the specific context. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Co-management approaches were applied in marine conservation areas. These involved the government and local communities, often with international support. They demonstrated the willingness of the Government of Zanzibar to implement blue growth strategies that are inclusive of local communities and aim to build a sustainable future. The need to further increase and improve the participation of women and aquaculture farmers in decision-making, to enhance transparency and to provide access to information, was highlighted. There are also opportunities to enhance cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. While there was a reported willingness from the Government of Zanzibar to consider relevant trade-offs, the limits of these trade-offs and associated safeguards were not clarified. Existing cost-benefit analyses have not yet considered environmental aspects that would trigger corrective action.

Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Government of Zanzibar put in place a blue growth strategy, which considers the challenges of seaweed farming, including related sustainability concerns. However, there is as yet no evidence of a formal mechanism to monitor and evaluate interventions on a regular basis to determine adaptive management responses. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Since the 1980s, the Government of Zanzibar encouraged multi-use marine protected zones, which were included in relevant sectoral laws and policies. A blue growth strategy and regulations support seaweed farming practices and the achievement of global targets. The means by which lessons learned are captured and communicated have been highlighted as an area for improvement.

The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 served as an important tool to reflect on Nature-based Solution design, implementation and monitoring challenges. It provided insights into areas that require corrective action, the collection of additional evidence and means of verification and involvement of local stakeholders. In this manner, the self- assessment results will inform future work on aquaculture and seaweed farming in Zanzibar (and elsewhere) and help improve intervention design, implementation and monitoring frameworks.

Several rounds of discussions, guided by IUCN expert reviewers, were held on the rationale and means of verification provided per indicator. These revealed that the criteria were sometimes understood and interpreted differently by different people, impacting the assigned rating. This demonstrated the complexities associated with assessing whether an intervention can be considered a Nature-based Solution and the need for thorough and guided consideration of each indicator. Continued engagement. A new agenda of research and development work has emerged, including dialogues around NbS criteria and indicators with stakeholders in Zanzibar and local communities. This could contribute to a future roadmap for Zanzibar and a framework for regular self- evaluation. 25 4 Summary of results First, case studies offer important opportunities for exchange of experiences, reflection on different approaches applied in different contexts as well as lessons learned with regards to opportunities, challenges and needed corrective actions. The agreed documentation framework and resulting prototype database of case studies based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 and elements from the PANORAMA: solutions for a healthy planet case study database, greatly support the analysis and comparability of experiences by offering common and robust parameters for benchmarking interventions.5 Second, there is tremendous strength in inclusive governance and open, transparent and participatory approaches that draw on local and/or traditional knowledge, engage Indigenous people, local communities and traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and youth. As illustrated in the Guatemala and Zanzibar cases, women in particular can benefit from enhanced opportunities, social status and income generated through NbS, when the design accounts for their role and inherent gender gaps. Third, scale is an important success factor. Small-scale, time-bound, pilot and project-based interventions often fail to address the full complexity of societal challenges and rarely produce the biodiversity and human wellbeing outcomes expected from the NbS. Finally, an enabling institutional, legal and policy environment provides the backbone for the implementation of and investments in NbS by making nature an ally in addressing societal challenges. Supportive, clear and coherent legal and policy frameworks can further enhance and facilitate coordination across relevant sectors and actors as well as protect the rights of affected and vulnerable communities that benefit directly or indirectly from an intervention. 5 More reflections on the benefits of the prototype database see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions, reference [11] 26 References [1] Mace, G.M.

Case studies can be a useful tool to illustrate the value of NbS interventions. They demonstrate the elements that are essential for the successful design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NbS and thus enable learning from experiences in different contexts. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is particular suited to document the positive contributions of NbS. Based on its science-based and widely consulted criteria and indicators, the Standard helps verify NbS applications and promotes comparability as well as a coherent and consistent framework for benchmarking interventions.

NbS emerged from this deeper understanding as a way to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach, with the primary goal of applying conservation approaches to safeguard society (see Figure 1).[1, 2, 3] Figure 1: Nature-based Solutions to address societal challenges. The seven societal challenges indicators are climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, economic and social development, human health, food security, water security and environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. (\u00a9 IUCN) More recently, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 1 This IUCN definition was endorsed by IUCN\u2019s 1,400 members at the 2016 World Conservation Congress in Resolution 069; an expanded definition was recently adopted at UNEA-5.2 in the resolution entitled Nature-based Solutions for supporting sustainable development 2 Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognised NbS and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and contributions to people.[4] Moreover, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), held in Nairobi in the first quarter of 2022, adopted a resolution on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development.[5] An assessment of NbS requires a consistent and common framework that helps document the positive contributions of NbS to green economic development, ecosystem management, climate change and other societally desirable outcomes. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is a valuable tool to verify a range of NbS applications. [6] The eight criteria (see Figure 2) and 28 indicators of the Standard provide clear, science-based and widely consulted parameters for benchmarking NbS interventions.[6, 7] The interdependent and non-hierarchical nature of its eight criteria implies that to be in adherence an intervention has to at least partially address each criterion. As a result, inadequacy in just one criterion means that the intervention in question is not in adherence with the Standard and therefore cannot be verified as an NbS. Figure 2: The eight criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 (\u00a9 IUCN) Adherence with the Standard means that the NbS action sufficiently addresses critical environmental, social and economic dimensions (aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), legal and policy considerations, inclusive governance and participation aspects. Due to its compatibility with the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, the Standard provides the necessary focus on achieving impact at scale, preventing misuse and applying safeguards for the verification and/or subsequent improvement of interventions to be considered NbS. The process-oriented quality of the Standard also provides additional value for analysing and extracting key lessons learned from case studies. It allows reflection on and increases understanding of challenges and opportunities, differentiates between strong and weak NbS interventions, and provides room for corrective and adaptive management and learning throughout the intervention cycle. 3 The international case studies presented here provide insights into particular success factors and challenges for NbS interventions and, thus, promote and enhance uptake, implementation and financing of NbS. Further, they support an effort to build a prototype database of NbS cases using the Standard as a lens through which to understand verification and lessons learned. 4 2 Methodology The prototype database of NbS cases was conceived through an agreed documentation framework, the selection of illustrative international case studies, and the analysis and presentation of five international case studies in accordance with the documentation framework. Inclusivity and gender considerations were given particular attention and wherever possible, disaggregated data is provided. By highlighting the inclusion of different knowledge systems and participation in decision-making of those affected by NbS interventions (including Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth), the case studies demonstrate the critical importance of inclusive governance for the success of an NbS intervention. They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b89361a3-ae96-4711-b5ea-64853021d762": {"__data__": {"id_": "b89361a3-ae96-4711-b5ea-64853021d762", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-discussion-paper-framing-issues", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "OECMs Discussion Paper: Framing the Issues ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-discussion-paper-framing-issues", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "959510148852907ab5ed4df909b31643b1f1977ccaa311602b9b537727feb5d5"}, "2": {"node_id": "3cdf3676-d359-4507-b92d-f96a5162afe9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-discussion-paper-framing-issues", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ccffa077dbab1b0eed2847741b2af995865579678363bb14736322c445daf334"}}, "hash": "aad5d7bc77054459fe7b03da78001b581acc7314e965d95c0453205f08f95ebd", "text": "They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.

To facilitate this, a combined template \u2013 the documentation framework \u2013 was developed to ensure that the required information would be collected and collated. In order to ensure this framework was complementary with the most relevant databases, a mapping of NbS resources from the EU project NetworkNature was utilised (not yet publicly available).[10] Subsequently, relevant information from the case studies related to the documentation framework was gathered. The case study documentation framework captures key information about each of the case studies. It was designed to combine inputs from the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39 and the information required by the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database to help classify each of the case studies (see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions[11]). 5 2.2 Case study selection and documentation The case study selection process focussed on identifying and agreeing on the five most relevant international case studies. It was agreed that the selected cases should provide a good representation across societal challenges, ecosystems and sectors. The initial longlist of international case studies was drawn from cases that had already undergone a full assessment with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39. In accordance with the classification discussed in Section 2 of the CCICED Special Policy Study Report on \u201cValue Assessment of Nature- based Solutions\u201d, discussions with the Special Policy Study team and the availability of sufficient qualitative and quantitative information, five case studies were selected, analysed and documented. The results can be found below and on the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database.[12] Identify priority databases \u2022 Use NetworkNature mapping to identify three priority databases (e.g. PANORAMA) Extract documentation framework \u2022 Collect the documentation required for PANORAMA, finding gender disaggregated data where possible \u2022 In addition, gather gender relevant data inspired by the questions supplied by the CCICED Toolkit on Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability Combine into standardized template \u2022 Combine these frameworks to create an overarching template for the selected case studies. Collate long list of case studies \u2022 Prepare a long-list of international case studies \u2022 International case studies limited to those already assessed with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS Screen long list and identify 5 priority case studies \u2022 Gather preliminary data required \u2022 Hold consultations to finalise five international case studies Gather information for 5 priority case studies \u2022 Based on agreed documentation framework, gather required data including gender-disaggregated where possible. \u2022 Upload to global databases (PANORAMA) Figure 3: Workflow for the development of the documentation framework of case studies (Source: Figure developed by the authors of this report) Figure 4: Workflow for the selection and documentation of case studies (Source: Figure developed by the authors of this report) 6 3 International case studies The following five international case studies were analysed: (1) Agroforestry systems for sustainable cocoa farming in the Lachu\u00e1 Ecoregion, Guatemala, (2) Medmerry managed coastal realignment, (3) Flood-based agriculture in the upper Mekong delta floodplain, (4) Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management, and (5) Sustainable aquaculture and innovative seaweed farming in Zanzibar.

An increase in the number of coastal flooding events and overwashing occurring several times per year, exacerbated by sea level rise and climate change, established that the existing shingle bank was insufficient to protect against floods. This posed significant actual and potential risks to life and caused damage to property and infrastructure. Additionally, coastal squeeze caused losses of coastal habitat. In response, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom delivered a GBP 27 million project to realign the defences inland, providing significantly improved flood defences to allow for managed flooding. The intervention created 300 hectares of habitat (183 of which is intertidal, including mudflat, salt marsh and transitional grassland), protection of more than 300 homes, road infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant and a boom to local tourism and recreation, with 22,000 visitors each year. The main positive impacts of the Figure 5: Aerial view of the intervention area taken in September 2013 (\u00a9 Environment Agency of the United Kingdom) 8 Medmerry managed coastal realignment include improved flood risk management, creation of wildlife habitats, enhanced landscape quality and provision of recreational facilities. Table 2: Characteristics and benefits of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Strong adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status All major NbS restoration activities have been completed and monitored. The focus is now on the continuous sustainable management of the intervention area. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges At the project planning stage, local communities, government representatives and statutory organisations were involved in the development of a vision for Medmerry, highlighting a wide range of impacts, including societal and environmental. The vision exercise highlighted disaster risk reduction, especially flooding, as a major priority. Additionally, environmental assessment data of flood events (the most serious recent event before the start of the project occurred in 2008 and caused over GBP 5 million in economic damage and required evacuation due to risk of life[14]), flood risk mapping and modelling confirmed flooding as the main societal challenge. These assessments were based on global best practices. Impacts of climate change were found to be an exacerbating factor. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale During the planning phase, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out and a full risk register developed. To achieve flood reduction and environmental improvement, 200 miles of the UK coast were assessed to determine the most promising opportunities for NbS, considering landscape, impacts on people and surrounding habitats. In addition, wider impacts across the region were assessed in accordance with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, including people, businesses, infrastructure and environments. While the coastal realignment provided many new business opportunities, these were not considered in depth during the planning phase. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The expected impacts on the ecosystems in the intervention areas were captured in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). These included mitigation measures for any risks to biodiversity during construction. For 9 instance, water voles were translocated prior to the start of the works.

Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The project placed particular emphasis on stakeholder engagement and participation of local communities in all phases of the project. This included proactively providing information about the benefits of the coastal realignment, gaining widespread support for the intervention and seeking community views and inputs. A comprehensive stakeholder analysis allowed a mapping of how best to engage with the different stakeholders. The Medmerry Stakeholder Advisory Group was established, made up of key individuals of the local community, including Parish Councils, local businesses and residents most affected by the coastal realignment. The Advisory Group helped shape the 10 design of the project and met regularly to discuss any issues and concerns. Although a complaints procedure was in place, which enabled affected individuals to raise concerns through an independent ombudsman, more could have been done to ease the associated bureaucratic burden. The active and intentional involvement of the local community and subsequent support generated, contributed significantly to the success of the project. [15] Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The costs and benefits of the NbS intervention were mapped in line with UK government assessment criteria and included the surrounding areas of the intervention site (landscape level). Annual meetings with stakeholders ensured that the NbS intervention provided the expected benefits. Public access (footpaths, cycle paths and bridleway) to the newly established nature reserve was enhanced and recreational areas provided, while maintaining a balance between recreational activities and undisturbed conservation areas. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The expected benefits were documented in the planning phase and baselines established. These informed the ongoing monitoring of NbS impacts. Immediately after project completion, a five-year monitoring programme was implemented. Annual reports summarised findings and lessons learned, which were shared and discussed with local stakeholders, external consultants, academia and risk management authorities in south England. Approaches to project planning and implementation were adjusted as needed. For instance, the approach applied to engaging the local community was adapted based on early experiences and analysis of challenges and barriers. [15] Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context While lessons learned have been captured in annual reports and through the monitoring framework, these have only been shared with a limited audience. The main benefits that have been communicated relate to reduced flood risk and created habitat. The success of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment along with other NbS interventions informed the organisational national strategy and increased the focus on NbS nationally. The project was characterised by comprehensively considering climate change and biodiversity throughout the design, implementation and monitoring phases. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Participatory and collaborative approaches. Inclusive governance and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, especially the local community, ensured effective assessment of societal challenges and priorities in the given context, increased understanding and acceptability of the proposed solution and enabled effective planning, implementation and maintenance/management of the NbS intervention, with a possibility for creative problem-solving. 11 Transparency.

The negative impacts caused by increased flood risk also caused transboundary challenges between Vietnam and Cambodia. Based on documented farmer knowledge and experience, IUCN promoted and improved locally-practiced, flood-based (wetland) agriculture and livelihood models in the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap and Long An. Flood-based livelihoods were encouraged as a financially viable, low risk alternative to triple rice cropping, to enhance economic and social resilience as well as to conserve and restore the biodiversity found in Mekong Delta freshwater wetlands/floodplains. The NbS intervention considered three systems - floating rice systems, lotus farming systems and rice aquaculture systems. Due to increasing weather extremes, hybrid solutions were also explored (combination of dykes and floodplains), to enable controlled flooding and adaptive approaches to overcome risks of drought and to manage the arrival and recession of floods. While the main focus of the NbS intervention was on farmers adding an additional flood-based crop in open flood (no dyke) and flood control zones (low dyke), the utility of replacing low value irrigated crops with higher value flood-based crops in closed control zones (high dyke) was also considered. In order to achieve the full set of biodiversity and human wellbeing benefits derived from moderated floods, interventions need to be scaled up across the entirety of the Mekong Delta floodplain. To do so, a follow-up project is currently being developed under the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Initial studies of farmer initiatives and proof of concept in IUCN pilot sites were completed between 2015 and 2018. These fed into the design and implementation of similar projects in the region (e.g. those by the World Bank, IUCN and FAO).

The economic component was not sufficiently considered in the design of the initial intervention, though marketable products were identified. While initial IUCN pilot interventions remained limited and small-scale, collaboration across similar projects and recent policy developments currently support the development of a large-scale intervention across the 1.4 million ha of the Upper Mekong Delta floodplain. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The focus of the intervention was on modified wetland ecosystems (formally zoned as agricultural land under private tenure) and thus excluded practices carried out in protected and conserved areas. In light of the extensive scientific evidence on the risks of rice intensification, it was possible to assess the status of ecosystems as well as drivers of change and biodiversity loss. Due to the rather small scale of the IUCN pilot interventions, no concrete data or monitoring frameworks to capture the positive biodiversity outcomes were implemented. Instead, outcomes were captured in general terms, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural functions of the floodplain. Detailed 14 monitoring for potential, unintended adverse consequences on nature arising from the intervention was not carried out. Key investments in biodiversity outcomes[16]: \uf0b7 Investments into 450 ha of flood-based livelihoods to enhance ecosystem functions of floodplains, which resulted in the conservation or restoration of approx. 6.7 million m\u00b3 of flood retention capacity supporting aquifer recharge, the reduction in land subsidence and the conservation or restoration of aquatic habitat/biodiversity; \uf0b7 additional benefits were observed from wild fisheries, mitigation of river erosion through the re-establishment of natural hydrology of seasonal flooding and increased land fertility, including through sediment deposition due to the seasonal flooding. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable A feasibility study for a GCF proposal revealed that several hundred thousand farmers and a number of downstream towns would benefit financially from flooding if seasonal flood-based agriculture were applied. In addition, cost- benefit analyses were carried out on the profitability of flood-based crops and the cropping system as a whole in comparison to mono-rice cropping. The NbS intervention did not consider the development of clear value chains and business models, which hampered securing long-term funding sources to maintain the NbS. Instead, the intervention relied on short-term, project-based grant funding. The planned GCF project could help overcome some of these shortcomings. Key expected economic benefits[16]: \uf0b7 flood-based livelihoods have the potential to be 1.5 to five times more profitable than intensive rice cropping; \uf0b7 floating rice systems could generate around USD 6,400 per ha per year, while triple rice cropping systems generate only USD 3,100 per ha per year; \uf0b7 where farmers add a flood-based crop in open flood or flood control zones, additional income between USD 2,293 \u2013 USD 5,744 per ha per year could be generated depending on the flood-based agriculture system applied[17]; \uf0b7 in open flood and flood control zones, no investments need to be made towards flood management, while in closed control zones (high dykes), sluice coordination by the local government is necessary; flood-based agriculture could serve as an incentive to stop conversion of low dykes to high dykes, which in turn helps preserve the floodplains in the Upper Mekong Delta. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and No grievance mechanism was put in place for the IUCN pilot NbS interventions, due to the small-scale and limited number of farmers involved. A grievance 15 empowering governance processes mechanism was put in place for the larger scale World Bank ICRSL project implementation as was required by World Bank safeguard policies. A stakeholder analysis provided insights into which stakeholders were directly and indirectly affected. Stakeholders provided inputs into the regional vision and plans for phasing out intensive triple rice crop farming. In addition, since farmers have private tenure over their land, farmer participation in decision-making and ownership of such decisions was essential. National Resolution 120 entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d and Decision 593 defined the roles and responsibilities of different actors in decision-making processes and recognised the need for policy reform rather than small-scale community- based solutions.

However, it is not yet operational. This constitutes a shortcoming for the NbS intervention. For the World Bank ICRSL project, social and environmental safeguards were put in place. However, the limits of trade-offs were not discussed in detail. In some areas a hybrid model was used, with low dykes controlling the timing of flood arrival/recession to support double-cropping and flood-based cropping (instead of the traditional third rice crop). In the case of lotus farming systems, flood-based agriculture enabled diversification of activities, including fish raising, ecotourism and recreational opportunities. In the future, value chains, especially for rice production, will need to be considered in more detail to support the new flood-based agriculture model and gain support from rice exporters. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence While National Resolution 120 provided an enabling policy environment for flood-based agriculture, examples of interventions that ran counter to the resolution remained. This weakened the impact of the NbS intervention and underlined that monitoring needed to be improved. There is no evidence as to whether there has been a government response to adapt the approach. Limited technical and institutional capacity was identified as a key factor. Lessons learned from the IUCN pilots and experiences from other similar initiatives are shared regularly at the Mekong Delta Development Partners Working Group and Annual Mekong Delta Forums. Further, the emerging interest from academia in flood-based agriculture is already producing relevant data and information. Additionally, the preparation of the planned Green Climate Fund 16 proposal considers the above challenges. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The NbS intervention built on the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which recommended high-value double rice cropping in combination with seasonal flood-based agriculture/aquaculture to manage flood risks. This influenced the promulgation of National Resolution 120, entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d; this policy was adopted in November 2017 and stipulates that nature-based adaptation models should be selected that are environmentally sound and achieve sustainable development based on \u2018actively living with the floods\u2019. The Mekong Delta Forum provided a space for knowledge exchange on lessons learned and endorsement of a common vision for the Upper Mekong Delta, including a move to more natural land and water uses. An IUCN-led Green Climate Fund proposal is under preparation to ensure continuity of efforts and to address transboundary challenges. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Legal and regulatory framework. Supportive legal and policy frameworks opened up opportunities for a change in land use and facilitated partnerships across related initiatives for the adoption of flood-based agriculture in open flood and flood control zones. A need for market incentives. The NbS intervention in Vietnam could have profited from a more holistic approach regarding the diversification of marketable products derived from flood-based agriculture to provide additional market incentives. Through consultations and analysis of lessons learned, market access and a lack of value chain development were identified as the greatest challenges for scaling up flood-based agriculture. This is influencing the design of the future Green Climate Fund project. Overcoming small-scale and time-bound interventions. A hybrid system of flood-based agriculture with some flooding control system of low dykes could help manage risks of early/heavy floods and droughts. The highest potential lies in the closed flood zones with high dykes through the opening of sluices during seasonal floods to restore the flood retention area. However, existing projects have not yet addressed this potential. This demonstrates that for NbS interventions to achieve positive impacts at scale, small-scale (often focussed on pilots), project-based and time- bound interventions are not sufficient to address complex societal challenges. Nevertheless, partnerships between related interventions in the region contributed to institutional and policy development as well as supported greater cross-sectoral coordination. 17 3.3 Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management Location: Gulf of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy Main implementing organisation: MEDSEA Mediterranean Sea and Coast Foundation Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 1 (solution that makes better use of existing natural and protected ecosystems) Case overview: The Gulf of Oristano is home to a number of freshwater and coastal wetlands.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "291ec204-0668-4bda-91c0-6c414243ceeb": {"__data__": {"id_": "291ec204-0668-4bda-91c0-6c414243ceeb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-discussion-paper-framing-issues", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "OECMs Discussion Paper: Framing the Issues ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-discussion-paper-framing-issues", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b71946857ca3ff119e77bc9cbaf0c81ab1d913ede6a52d54cf8a7f74154625a"}, "2": {"node_id": "a434f09f-878d-4fca-b839-dd320fbe9ea6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-discussion-paper-framing-issues", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1dbd9d67d95ba0a23c0f789f09cc6794868f82dbeb9470f62150d109a435696a"}}, "hash": "4e2d7098e674ef277ab15c96b67c3b46c5801396691eba4438c2819fb9263630", "text": "Overexploitation, land-use changes, hydrological alterations, pollution and anthropogenic pressures pose risks to ecosystem health and biodiversity as well as the economic, social and cultural benefits derived from the wetland ecosystems.

It contributed to balancing social and environmental needs and paved the way to recognise the economic and cultural potential of the wetlands. Since the implementation of activities is still ongoing, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment was used Figure 7: Area archeologica di tharros, San Giovanni di Sinis, Cabras, Italy (\u00a9 L\u00e9onard Cotte, Unsplash) 18 to identify entry points to strengthen the NbS intervention. This analysis was carried out by the UNEP Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the UN Environment Programme and recommendations published in a report.[18] Table 4: Characteristics and benefits of the Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status Implementation of the NbS intervention is ongoing. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped identify the key societal challenges that needed addressing. These management plans also provided insights into human activities in the region, such as aquaculture and fishing. General information on drivers and responses of the identified societal challenges was gathered; however, there was no data specific to the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. An area for improvement identified as part of the self- assessment relates to strengthening the links to human wellbeing outcomes. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The aim of the intervention was to overcome fragmentation between the various wetland ecosystems in the Gulf of Oristano. The collaboration established among 11 municipalities through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract helped advance coordination, including across sectors. Further, interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems fed into the design of the intervention and considered various activities, including fishing, flood risk management, agriculture and tourism among others. Vulnerability and risk maps were developed. However, it was recommended that additional data be gathered to understand risks across the catchment and better define the adaptation and resilience actions to climate change, including related to connectivity between wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped understand the current state of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity in the region. Regular monitoring is 19 ecosystem integrity ensured through an integrated information system, the Oristano Wetland Observatory. In addition, the implementation of a Wetland Index is planned. Options to enhance integrity of the wetland ecosystems were implemented. These included the restoration of ecological connections, creation of buffer zones and preservation of native habitats. Key biodiversity outcomes: \uf0b7 Strengthened conservation of coastal and marine habitats; \uf0b7 Reinforced resilience to climate change impacts; \uf0b7 Reduced water consumption, abstraction, pollution and contamination. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable This criterion turned out to be the weakest for this NbS intervention. No specific cost-effectiveness study was conducted. Cost-benefit analyses and consideration of alternatives were conducted only for a limited number of the wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano. The long-term resourcing of the NbS was partially secured through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract. Additional resourcing is expected through the new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 as well as through the new funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan that is currently being developed. Moreover, the institution of a new protected area (regional park) will be an instrument to attract new funds and ensure the ongoing management of wetlands. A full economic analysis was suggested as a priority action going forward to secure the continuity and sustainability of the NbS intervention.

It provides the foundation for NbS actions in the Gulf of Oristano. In addition, national and global targets were key reference points for the design of the NbS intervention and Ramsar information sheets were updated for the six Ramsar sites. A new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 is under preparation by the regional government. Steps will be taken to integrate the results of the NbS intervention into the strategy to promote its long-term continuity. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Defining priority and corrective actions to strengthen the intervention. An analysis of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 indicators that have been insufficiently or only partially addressed helped to make recommendations for improvement and to identify concrete corrective actions to strengthen the implementation of the NbS intervention.[18] This demonstrates how the self-assessment can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of NbS interventions. Strong legal basis. The adoption of the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract by the 11 municipalities provided an important legal basis and framework to advance integrated management of six wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. It provided strategies and actions that support ongoing efforts toward the establishment of a new regional park. 3.4 Sustainable aquaculture and innovative seaweed farming in Zanzibar Location: Zanzibar, Tanzania Main implementing organisation: International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Other implementing organisation: Ecosystem-based Aquaculture Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Commission on Ecosystem Management (IUCN CEM) Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 2 (solution for sustainable management of restored and managed ecosystems, including innovative land-use planning protocols) 21 Case overview: Since 1990, Zanzibar has become a primary seaweed producer in Africa. Seaweed farming activities are usually small-scale and carried out in the intertidal zones largely in marine conservation areas, near mangroves and coral reefs. Eighty-eight per cent of seaweed farmers are women, making this an important activity to elevate their economic status and role in the community.[19] Climate change, the absence of producer associations, difficulties in accessing international markets and insufficient protection of coastal ecosystems have contributed to a decline in the production of higher-valued seaweeds. While the co-management approach applied in Zanzibar aims to protect coastal ecosystems and habitats, enhance artisanal fisheries and mariculture, shortcomings in the management remain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7932f41-a6e3-4f1b-846a-3feaacc583f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7932f41-a6e3-4f1b-846a-3feaacc583f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-discussion-paper-framing-issues", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "OECMs Discussion Paper: Framing the Issues ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-discussion-paper-framing-issues", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb1bbde148cd0c3527d69e73bb28b63c937a99e9fd0d1862b9a8ee55972c0b1f"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d51026b-1672-46c9-b8bf-b607bf7cf93c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-discussion-paper-framing-issues", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "757cb4bda2ae52272f91176fe02873e2e8e6b9071bd1a94283bc3a1be2770f17"}}, "hash": "c4678056be8ad344a78c324071f77a34979ad03f5900cea5227a9b9370f36df6", "text": "New approaches to aquaculture and marine conservation have emerged only recently (in terms of concrete projects since 2014), with the case in Zanzibar serving as a first attempt to test the level of adherence of seaweed farming with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39.

It should also be noted that the self-assessment was carried out as a desk review. Further, means of verification were not always available, as data relating to certain indicators were not gathered. To conduct a more comprehensive assessment, local stakeholders should be involved as key informants. Nevertheless, the self-assessment provided insights into areas for improvement as to how interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. It also provided insights into knowledge and data gaps, which prompted critical questions and corrective actions that need to be addressed going forward. Intervention status Initial activities are completed. Future actions, research and knowledge needs are being assessed. Figure 8: Women working in seaweed farms in Pemba, Zantibar (\u00a9 R. le Gouvello) 22 Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges were identified, documented and prioritised through a theory of change exercise. This included a stakeholder workshop and engagement with local authorities to verify the information. Several studies provided insights into the positive outcomes of mariculture and seaweed farming, which included gender equality, economic revenues provided to women and the consequences on their life, including increased autonomy, empowerment and role in the communities. Although there was an understanding of the internal and external risks of the intervention, the SWOT analysis carried out for the Zanzibar case showed that a number of weaknesses and threats have not yet been addressed. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The application of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) ensured a recognition of interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems. A more holistic approach should be applied in future interventions to take into account the impact of value chains and access to markets for local livelihoods. Some synergies across sectors were identified. However, since the theory of change exercise was not completed due to time constraints, complementary interventions were not integrated fully into the design of the intervention. It was recommended to work with stakeholders to complete this exercise and achieve synergies for future interventions, especially between aquaculture, marine conservation and other relevant sectors. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. The analysis of the biodiversity benefits achieved through this intervention were largely based on a desk review of existing literature and information rather than a specific assessment, monitoring framework or thorough and collective effort with key informants and stakeholders. As was highlighted in a recent study published by IUCN, criterion 3 is the most difficult to achieve for seaweed farming and aquaculture.[19] There is a clear need to establish measures to reduce, control and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, better documentation of the ecological state of the ecosystem, ecosystem connectivity and assessment of impacts is required. In this regard, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is an important tool to call attention to these issues and helps improve interventions that would otherwise cause harm to coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable Seaweed farming is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. The intervention did not carry out a global value chain assessment or detailed 23 assessment of climate change impacts. These could have provided insights into the economic feasibility and sustainability of the intervention, especially with regards to supporting the livelihoods of local women, who predominantly engage in seaweed farming. In addition, alternative scenarios and options need to be explored going forward to identify the most suitable, sustainable and economically viable solution in the specific context. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Co-management approaches were applied in marine conservation areas. These involved the government and local communities, often with international support. They demonstrated the willingness of the Government of Zanzibar to implement blue growth strategies that are inclusive of local communities and aim to build a sustainable future. The need to further increase and improve the participation of women and aquaculture farmers in decision-making, to enhance transparency and to provide access to information, was highlighted. There are also opportunities to enhance cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. While there was a reported willingness from the Government of Zanzibar to consider relevant trade-offs, the limits of these trade-offs and associated safeguards were not clarified. Existing cost-benefit analyses have not yet considered environmental aspects that would trigger corrective action.

By completing the self-assessment under the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39, it was possible to make concrete recommendations on how to improve the balancing of trade-offs, while ensuring the sustainability of the intervention. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Government of Zanzibar put in place a blue growth strategy, which considers the challenges of seaweed farming, including related sustainability concerns. However, there is as yet no evidence of a formal mechanism to monitor and evaluate interventions on a regular basis to determine adaptive management responses. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Since the 1980s, the Government of Zanzibar encouraged multi-use marine protected zones, which were included in relevant sectoral laws and policies. A blue growth strategy and regulations support seaweed farming practices and the achievement of global targets. The means by which lessons learned are captured and communicated have been highlighted as an area for improvement. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) 24 Lessons learned: Taking corrective action. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 served as an important tool to reflect on Nature-based Solution design, implementation and monitoring challenges. It provided insights into areas that require corrective action, the collection of additional evidence and means of verification and involvement of local stakeholders. In this manner, the self- assessment results will inform future work on aquaculture and seaweed farming in Zanzibar (and elsewhere) and help improve intervention design, implementation and monitoring frameworks. Reviewing the understanding of the NbS criteria and indicators. Several rounds of discussions, guided by IUCN expert reviewers, were held on the rationale and means of verification provided per indicator. These revealed that the criteria were sometimes understood and interpreted differently by different people, impacting the assigned rating. This demonstrated the complexities associated with assessing whether an intervention can be considered a Nature-based Solution and the need for thorough and guided consideration of each indicator. Continued engagement. A new agenda of research and development work has emerged, including dialogues around NbS criteria and indicators with stakeholders in Zanzibar and local communities. This could contribute to a future roadmap for Zanzibar and a framework for regular self- evaluation. 25 4 Summary of results First, case studies offer important opportunities for exchange of experiences, reflection on different approaches applied in different contexts as well as lessons learned with regards to opportunities, challenges and needed corrective actions. The agreed documentation framework and resulting prototype database of case studies based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 and elements from the PANORAMA: solutions for a healthy planet case study database, greatly support the analysis and comparability of experiences by offering common and robust parameters for benchmarking interventions.5 Second, there is tremendous strength in inclusive governance and open, transparent and participatory approaches that draw on local and/or traditional knowledge, engage Indigenous people, local communities and traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and youth. As illustrated in the Guatemala and Zanzibar cases, women in particular can benefit from enhanced opportunities, social status and income generated through NbS, when the design accounts for their role and inherent gender gaps. Third, scale is an important success factor. Small-scale, time-bound, pilot and project-based interventions often fail to address the full complexity of societal challenges and rarely produce the biodiversity and human wellbeing outcomes expected from the NbS. Finally, an enabling institutional, legal and policy environment provides the backbone for the implementation of and investments in NbS by making nature an ally in addressing societal challenges. Supportive, clear and coherent legal and policy frameworks can further enhance and facilitate coordination across relevant sectors and actors as well as protect the rights of affected and vulnerable communities that benefit directly or indirectly from an intervention. 5 More reflections on the benefits of the prototype database see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions, reference [11] 26 References [1] Mace, G.M.

Case studies can be a useful tool to illustrate the value of NbS interventions. They demonstrate the elements that are essential for the successful design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NbS and thus enable learning from experiences in different contexts. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is particular suited to document the positive contributions of NbS. Based on its science-based and widely consulted criteria and indicators, the Standard helps verify NbS applications and promotes comparability as well as a coherent and consistent framework for benchmarking interventions.

NbS emerged from this deeper understanding as a way to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach, with the primary goal of applying conservation approaches to safeguard society (see Figure 1).[1, 2, 3] Figure 1: Nature-based Solutions to address societal challenges. The seven societal challenges indicators are climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, economic and social development, human health, food security, water security and environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. (\u00a9 IUCN) More recently, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 1 This IUCN definition was endorsed by IUCN\u2019s 1,400 members at the 2016 World Conservation Congress in Resolution 069; an expanded definition was recently adopted at UNEA-5.2 in the resolution entitled Nature-based Solutions for supporting sustainable development 2 Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognised NbS and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and contributions to people.[4] Moreover, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), held in Nairobi in the first quarter of 2022, adopted a resolution on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development.[5] An assessment of NbS requires a consistent and common framework that helps document the positive contributions of NbS to green economic development, ecosystem management, climate change and other societally desirable outcomes. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is a valuable tool to verify a range of NbS applications. [6] The eight criteria (see Figure 2) and 28 indicators of the Standard provide clear, science-based and widely consulted parameters for benchmarking NbS interventions.[6, 7] The interdependent and non-hierarchical nature of its eight criteria implies that to be in adherence an intervention has to at least partially address each criterion. As a result, inadequacy in just one criterion means that the intervention in question is not in adherence with the Standard and therefore cannot be verified as an NbS. Figure 2: The eight criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 (\u00a9 IUCN) Adherence with the Standard means that the NbS action sufficiently addresses critical environmental, social and economic dimensions (aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), legal and policy considerations, inclusive governance and participation aspects. Due to its compatibility with the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, the Standard provides the necessary focus on achieving impact at scale, preventing misuse and applying safeguards for the verification and/or subsequent improvement of interventions to be considered NbS. The process-oriented quality of the Standard also provides additional value for analysing and extracting key lessons learned from case studies. It allows reflection on and increases understanding of challenges and opportunities, differentiates between strong and weak NbS interventions, and provides room for corrective and adaptive management and learning throughout the intervention cycle. 3 The international case studies presented here provide insights into particular success factors and challenges for NbS interventions and, thus, promote and enhance uptake, implementation and financing of NbS. Further, they support an effort to build a prototype database of NbS cases using the Standard as a lens through which to understand verification and lessons learned. 4 2 Methodology The prototype database of NbS cases was conceived through an agreed documentation framework, the selection of illustrative international case studies, and the analysis and presentation of five international case studies in accordance with the documentation framework. Inclusivity and gender considerations were given particular attention and wherever possible, disaggregated data is provided. By highlighting the inclusion of different knowledge systems and participation in decision-making of those affected by NbS interventions (including Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth), the case studies demonstrate the critical importance of inclusive governance for the success of an NbS intervention. They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4367276-0db0-4993-a005-61a1679098f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4367276-0db0-4993-a005-61a1679098f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-collation-case-studies-submitted-wcpa-task-force", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "OECMs: Collation of Case Studies Submitted to the WCPA Task Force", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-collation-case-studies-submitted-wcpa-task-force", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "730dfe8ddebc0fb7906040be42fd9c7b41b4cc876bae7011cf4c85827e5829b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e78545c-fba8-4c4c-94e6-b4b0884b5318", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-collation-case-studies-submitted-wcpa-task-force", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca22d621bc9ebebf84a4c3c00d0a556e17072220f2c22d1d76d35adb1be7458d"}}, "hash": "c4570c068eb77c57b5a63c16d9d4c65c48d9acb6a7c235f334ddcb2014dc8220", "text": "They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture. Especially concerning the role of women, the case studies highlight multiple dimensions of gender and gender-responsive approaches in the design and implementation of NbS interventions to understand and overcome gender-based gaps.

To facilitate this, a combined template \u2013 the documentation framework \u2013 was developed to ensure that the required information would be collected and collated. In order to ensure this framework was complementary with the most relevant databases, a mapping of NbS resources from the EU project NetworkNature was utilised (not yet publicly available).[10] Subsequently, relevant information from the case studies related to the documentation framework was gathered. The case study documentation framework captures key information about each of the case studies. It was designed to combine inputs from the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39 and the information required by the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database to help classify each of the case studies (see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions[11]). 5 2.2 Case study selection and documentation The case study selection process focussed on identifying and agreeing on the five most relevant international case studies. It was agreed that the selected cases should provide a good representation across societal challenges, ecosystems and sectors. The initial longlist of international case studies was drawn from cases that had already undergone a full assessment with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39. In accordance with the classification discussed in Section 2 of the CCICED Special Policy Study Report on \u201cValue Assessment of Nature- based Solutions\u201d, discussions with the Special Policy Study team and the availability of sufficient qualitative and quantitative information, five case studies were selected, analysed and documented. The results can be found below and on the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database.[12] Identify priority databases \u2022 Use NetworkNature mapping to identify three priority databases (e.g. PANORAMA) Extract documentation framework \u2022 Collect the documentation required for PANORAMA, finding gender disaggregated data where possible \u2022 In addition, gather gender relevant data inspired by the questions supplied by the CCICED Toolkit on Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability Combine into standardized template \u2022 Combine these frameworks to create an overarching template for the selected case studies.

An increase in the number of coastal flooding events and overwashing occurring several times per year, exacerbated by sea level rise and climate change, established that the existing shingle bank was insufficient to protect against floods. This posed significant actual and potential risks to life and caused damage to property and infrastructure. Additionally, coastal squeeze caused losses of coastal habitat. In response, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom delivered a GBP 27 million project to realign the defences inland, providing significantly improved flood defences to allow for managed flooding. The intervention created 300 hectares of habitat (183 of which is intertidal, including mudflat, salt marsh and transitional grassland), protection of more than 300 homes, road infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant and a boom to local tourism and recreation, with 22,000 visitors each year. The main positive impacts of the Figure 5: Aerial view of the intervention area taken in September 2013 (\u00a9 Environment Agency of the United Kingdom) 8 Medmerry managed coastal realignment include improved flood risk management, creation of wildlife habitats, enhanced landscape quality and provision of recreational facilities. Table 2: Characteristics and benefits of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Strong adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status All major NbS restoration activities have been completed and monitored. The focus is now on the continuous sustainable management of the intervention area. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges At the project planning stage, local communities, government representatives and statutory organisations were involved in the development of a vision for Medmerry, highlighting a wide range of impacts, including societal and environmental. The vision exercise highlighted disaster risk reduction, especially flooding, as a major priority. Additionally, environmental assessment data of flood events (the most serious recent event before the start of the project occurred in 2008 and caused over GBP 5 million in economic damage and required evacuation due to risk of life[14]), flood risk mapping and modelling confirmed flooding as the main societal challenge. These assessments were based on global best practices. Impacts of climate change were found to be an exacerbating factor. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale During the planning phase, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out and a full risk register developed. To achieve flood reduction and environmental improvement, 200 miles of the UK coast were assessed to determine the most promising opportunities for NbS, considering landscape, impacts on people and surrounding habitats. In addition, wider impacts across the region were assessed in accordance with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, including people, businesses, infrastructure and environments. While the coastal realignment provided many new business opportunities, these were not considered in depth during the planning phase. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The expected impacts on the ecosystems in the intervention areas were captured in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). These included mitigation measures for any risks to biodiversity during construction. For 9 instance, water voles were translocated prior to the start of the works.

Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The project placed particular emphasis on stakeholder engagement and participation of local communities in all phases of the project. This included proactively providing information about the benefits of the coastal realignment, gaining widespread support for the intervention and seeking community views and inputs. A comprehensive stakeholder analysis allowed a mapping of how best to engage with the different stakeholders. The Medmerry Stakeholder Advisory Group was established, made up of key individuals of the local community, including Parish Councils, local businesses and residents most affected by the coastal realignment. The Advisory Group helped shape the 10 design of the project and met regularly to discuss any issues and concerns. Although a complaints procedure was in place, which enabled affected individuals to raise concerns through an independent ombudsman, more could have been done to ease the associated bureaucratic burden. The active and intentional involvement of the local community and subsequent support generated, contributed significantly to the success of the project. [15] Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The costs and benefits of the NbS intervention were mapped in line with UK government assessment criteria and included the surrounding areas of the intervention site (landscape level). Annual meetings with stakeholders ensured that the NbS intervention provided the expected benefits. Public access (footpaths, cycle paths and bridleway) to the newly established nature reserve was enhanced and recreational areas provided, while maintaining a balance between recreational activities and undisturbed conservation areas. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The expected benefits were documented in the planning phase and baselines established. These informed the ongoing monitoring of NbS impacts. Immediately after project completion, a five-year monitoring programme was implemented. Annual reports summarised findings and lessons learned, which were shared and discussed with local stakeholders, external consultants, academia and risk management authorities in south England. Approaches to project planning and implementation were adjusted as needed. For instance, the approach applied to engaging the local community was adapted based on early experiences and analysis of challenges and barriers. [15] Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context While lessons learned have been captured in annual reports and through the monitoring framework, these have only been shared with a limited audience. The main benefits that have been communicated relate to reduced flood risk and created habitat. The success of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment along with other NbS interventions informed the organisational national strategy and increased the focus on NbS nationally. The project was characterised by comprehensively considering climate change and biodiversity throughout the design, implementation and monitoring phases. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Participatory and collaborative approaches. Inclusive governance and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, especially the local community, ensured effective assessment of societal challenges and priorities in the given context, increased understanding and acceptability of the proposed solution and enabled effective planning, implementation and maintenance/management of the NbS intervention, with a possibility for creative problem-solving. 11 Transparency. Transparent and structured engagement and participation of the local community throughout the project and in decision-making processes \u2013 starting with the design stage \u2013 helped to address concerns, build trust and create ownership.

The negative impacts caused by increased flood risk also caused transboundary challenges between Vietnam and Cambodia. Based on documented farmer knowledge and experience, IUCN promoted and improved locally-practiced, flood-based (wetland) agriculture and livelihood models in the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap and Long An. Flood-based livelihoods were encouraged as a financially viable, low risk alternative to triple rice cropping, to enhance economic and social resilience as well as to conserve and restore the biodiversity found in Mekong Delta freshwater wetlands/floodplains. The NbS intervention considered three systems - floating rice systems, lotus farming systems and rice aquaculture systems. Due to increasing weather extremes, hybrid solutions were also explored (combination of dykes and floodplains), to enable controlled flooding and adaptive approaches to overcome risks of drought and to manage the arrival and recession of floods. While the main focus of the NbS intervention was on farmers adding an additional flood-based crop in open flood (no dyke) and flood control zones (low dyke), the utility of replacing low value irrigated crops with higher value flood-based crops in closed control zones (high dyke) was also considered. In order to achieve the full set of biodiversity and human wellbeing benefits derived from moderated floods, interventions need to be scaled up across the entirety of the Mekong Delta floodplain. To do so, a follow-up project is currently being developed under the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Initial studies of farmer initiatives and proof of concept in IUCN pilot sites were completed between 2015 and 2018. These fed into the design and implementation of similar projects in the region (e.g. those by the World Bank, IUCN and FAO). Efforts towards an IUCN-led large-scale and transformative GCF-funded project for the Mekong Delta will build on and scale up the results of the various initiatives and enhance 4 Between 2000 and 2011, the volume of flood storage has halved from 9,200 billion m\u00b3 to 4,700 billion m\u00b3 (ICEM (2015) A Guide to Resilient Decision Making in the Mekong Delta.

The economic component was not sufficiently considered in the design of the initial intervention, though marketable products were identified. While initial IUCN pilot interventions remained limited and small-scale, collaboration across similar projects and recent policy developments currently support the development of a large-scale intervention across the 1.4 million ha of the Upper Mekong Delta floodplain. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The focus of the intervention was on modified wetland ecosystems (formally zoned as agricultural land under private tenure) and thus excluded practices carried out in protected and conserved areas. In light of the extensive scientific evidence on the risks of rice intensification, it was possible to assess the status of ecosystems as well as drivers of change and biodiversity loss. Due to the rather small scale of the IUCN pilot interventions, no concrete data or monitoring frameworks to capture the positive biodiversity outcomes were implemented. Instead, outcomes were captured in general terms, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural functions of the floodplain. Detailed 14 monitoring for potential, unintended adverse consequences on nature arising from the intervention was not carried out. Key investments in biodiversity outcomes[16]: \uf0b7 Investments into 450 ha of flood-based livelihoods to enhance ecosystem functions of floodplains, which resulted in the conservation or restoration of approx. 6.7 million m\u00b3 of flood retention capacity supporting aquifer recharge, the reduction in land subsidence and the conservation or restoration of aquatic habitat/biodiversity; \uf0b7 additional benefits were observed from wild fisheries, mitigation of river erosion through the re-establishment of natural hydrology of seasonal flooding and increased land fertility, including through sediment deposition due to the seasonal flooding. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable A feasibility study for a GCF proposal revealed that several hundred thousand farmers and a number of downstream towns would benefit financially from flooding if seasonal flood-based agriculture were applied. In addition, cost- benefit analyses were carried out on the profitability of flood-based crops and the cropping system as a whole in comparison to mono-rice cropping. The NbS intervention did not consider the development of clear value chains and business models, which hampered securing long-term funding sources to maintain the NbS. Instead, the intervention relied on short-term, project-based grant funding. The planned GCF project could help overcome some of these shortcomings. Key expected economic benefits[16]: \uf0b7 flood-based livelihoods have the potential to be 1.5 to five times more profitable than intensive rice cropping; \uf0b7 floating rice systems could generate around USD 6,400 per ha per year, while triple rice cropping systems generate only USD 3,100 per ha per year; \uf0b7 where farmers add a flood-based crop in open flood or flood control zones, additional income between USD 2,293 \u2013 USD 5,744 per ha per year could be generated depending on the flood-based agriculture system applied[17]; \uf0b7 in open flood and flood control zones, no investments need to be made towards flood management, while in closed control zones (high dykes), sluice coordination by the local government is necessary; flood-based agriculture could serve as an incentive to stop conversion of low dykes to high dykes, which in turn helps preserve the floodplains in the Upper Mekong Delta. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and No grievance mechanism was put in place for the IUCN pilot NbS interventions, due to the small-scale and limited number of farmers involved. A grievance 15 empowering governance processes mechanism was put in place for the larger scale World Bank ICRSL project implementation as was required by World Bank safeguard policies. A stakeholder analysis provided insights into which stakeholders were directly and indirectly affected. Stakeholders provided inputs into the regional vision and plans for phasing out intensive triple rice crop farming. In addition, since farmers have private tenure over their land, farmer participation in decision-making and ownership of such decisions was essential. National Resolution 120 entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d and Decision 593 defined the roles and responsibilities of different actors in decision-making processes and recognised the need for policy reform rather than small-scale community- based solutions.

However, it is not yet operational. This constitutes a shortcoming for the NbS intervention. For the World Bank ICRSL project, social and environmental safeguards were put in place. However, the limits of trade-offs were not discussed in detail. In some areas a hybrid model was used, with low dykes controlling the timing of flood arrival/recession to support double-cropping and flood-based cropping (instead of the traditional third rice crop). In the case of lotus farming systems, flood-based agriculture enabled diversification of activities, including fish raising, ecotourism and recreational opportunities. In the future, value chains, especially for rice production, will need to be considered in more detail to support the new flood-based agriculture model and gain support from rice exporters. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence While National Resolution 120 provided an enabling policy environment for flood-based agriculture, examples of interventions that ran counter to the resolution remained. This weakened the impact of the NbS intervention and underlined that monitoring needed to be improved. There is no evidence as to whether there has been a government response to adapt the approach. Limited technical and institutional capacity was identified as a key factor. Lessons learned from the IUCN pilots and experiences from other similar initiatives are shared regularly at the Mekong Delta Development Partners Working Group and Annual Mekong Delta Forums. Further, the emerging interest from academia in flood-based agriculture is already producing relevant data and information. Additionally, the preparation of the planned Green Climate Fund 16 proposal considers the above challenges. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The NbS intervention built on the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which recommended high-value double rice cropping in combination with seasonal flood-based agriculture/aquaculture to manage flood risks. This influenced the promulgation of National Resolution 120, entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d; this policy was adopted in November 2017 and stipulates that nature-based adaptation models should be selected that are environmentally sound and achieve sustainable development based on \u2018actively living with the floods\u2019. The Mekong Delta Forum provided a space for knowledge exchange on lessons learned and endorsement of a common vision for the Upper Mekong Delta, including a move to more natural land and water uses. An IUCN-led Green Climate Fund proposal is under preparation to ensure continuity of efforts and to address transboundary challenges. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Legal and regulatory framework. Supportive legal and policy frameworks opened up opportunities for a change in land use and facilitated partnerships across related initiatives for the adoption of flood-based agriculture in open flood and flood control zones. A need for market incentives. The NbS intervention in Vietnam could have profited from a more holistic approach regarding the diversification of marketable products derived from flood-based agriculture to provide additional market incentives. Through consultations and analysis of lessons learned, market access and a lack of value chain development were identified as the greatest challenges for scaling up flood-based agriculture. This is influencing the design of the future Green Climate Fund project. Overcoming small-scale and time-bound interventions. A hybrid system of flood-based agriculture with some flooding control system of low dykes could help manage risks of early/heavy floods and droughts. The highest potential lies in the closed flood zones with high dykes through the opening of sluices during seasonal floods to restore the flood retention area. However, existing projects have not yet addressed this potential. This demonstrates that for NbS interventions to achieve positive impacts at scale, small-scale (often focussed on pilots), project-based and time- bound interventions are not sufficient to address complex societal challenges. Nevertheless, partnerships between related interventions in the region contributed to institutional and policy development as well as supported greater cross-sectoral coordination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6699935a-1e3f-463e-aece-f5e2056118c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "6699935a-1e3f-463e-aece-f5e2056118c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-collation-case-studies-submitted-wcpa-task-force", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "OECMs: Collation of Case Studies Submitted to the WCPA Task Force", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-collation-case-studies-submitted-wcpa-task-force", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9c08931a21ef5c36d2031823ff128113284a474350e57d1c3ac941dd8b7ca0d"}, "2": {"node_id": "8546c72b-68e2-4401-b37d-0dabd6fb0595", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-collation-case-studies-submitted-wcpa-task-force", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6749cccf04f04de91a54524812b6ca6abec6ca80b2833e5465bb6ca4912d25fd"}}, "hash": "ac148b4
