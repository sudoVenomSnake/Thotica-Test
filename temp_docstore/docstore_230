(iii) Support from Religious and Civil Society Leaders Similarly a support and leadership is also required from religious and civil soci- ety leadership in order to create an environment in which HIV and AIDS can be effectively addressed. The leaders to help shape opinions within communities and to help communities to find ways to reduce the stigma and discrimina- tion experienced by individuals and families affected by HIV and AIDS. Active participation of groups established by and for people with HIV and AIDS to be particularly encouraged; and religious and civil society groups to also have a key role to play in providing care and support within communities and their participation in this area of the response shall be valued. 1 4 Priority Focus Areas 1.4.1 The direction for Pakistan\u2019s HIV and AIDS response is set by the National HIV and AIDS Strategic Framework, with the National HIV and AIDS Strategic Framework 2007 \u2013 2012 being currently in place and is dealt with in detail in this Chapter. 1.4.2 The concentrated epidemic being faced by Pakistan would be most efficiently faced by working in a targeted manner with the most-at-risk populations and vulnerable populations, most likely to be exposed to HIV and their partners, being the following: (a) Injecting Drug Users; (b) People who engage in sexual behaviour that puts them at risk; (c) Migrant workers; 108 HIV POLICIES (d) Long distance truck drivers and associated population; (e) Jail inmates; (f) Sexual partners, spouses and children of the people in these groups; and (g) Most-at-Risk-Adolescents 1.4.3 The primary focus of the prevention effort would be on reducing HIV infection among these populations which will involve a public health approach that seeks to work in partnership with these populations and take care not to further stigmatize them. As these populations are defined by behaviours and the people within these populations are members of the community at large therefore reaching these populations would involve working with health services, NGOs and community groups to determine approaches, strategies and messages that are accessible, appropriate and accessible to these populations. 1.4.4 Treatment, care and support efforts will focus on connecting all individuals and families affected by HIV and AIDS with healthcare and social support and on focusing resources on geographical areas most affected by HIV and AIDS and there will be a particular focus on bringing services as close as possible to communities most affected to ensure a long term connection between services and these communities. 1 5 Policy Approaches 1.5.1 The Policy Approaches section of the HIV/AIDS Policy sets out the approach for future policies in relation to HIV and this approach is expected to be reflected in the national laws and policies as well. The policy approach as stated in the HIV/AIDS Policy covers the following: (i) Reducing HIV and AIDS stigma and discrimination (a) PLHIV and KAPs shall: (i) enjoy the same rights that are afforded to all citizens of Pakistan and shall be treated with dignity and respect when seeking health and welfare services and shall be encouraged to maintain contact with these services; (ii) be cared for in communities in the same manner that other people are cared for and their participation in the design, delivery and evaluation of HIV and AIDS prevention and care initiatives shall be encouraged and valued; (b) Particular attention shall be paid by health services to reducing the barriers that prevent PLHIV from coming forward to counseling and treatment and health workers shall be provided with training and support to ensure that they can provide non-judgemental care and support for PLHIV. (c) Assistance shall be provided to employers for the purpose of modifying their employment policies in order to ensure that PLHIV have continued access to employment. (d) Anti-discrimination laws shall be amended to make it illegal to discriminate against PLHIV or people perceived to be at particular risk of HIV infection. (e) Media shall be encouraged to play a constructive role in the response to HIV and AIDS through reporting that increases accesses to accurate information and decreases HIV-related stigma and discrimination. HIV POLICIES 109 (ii) Establishing a supportive legislative and policy framework Review of existing laws and policies with a view to ensuring that they do not increase HIV vulnerability and risk or work against the vision and objective of the national HIV and AIDS response. All agencies working in the response shall be encouraged to examine their policies to determine whether they are inadvertently contributing to HIV", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0690d65b-fc1e-4250-971d-595f7f7d00c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "0690d65b-fc1e-4250-971d-595f7f7d00c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1d2640fc5b93dd2793ae0db4e598e3896cf05eb06dd9767476dde035610cb9a"}}, "hash": "d1d2640fc5b93dd2793ae0db4e598e3896cf05eb06dd9767476dde035610cb9a", "text": "risk or to HIV related stigma and discrimination.

(iv) Integration of HIV and AIDS initiative and awareness into existing programmes HIV and AIDS information, prevention and care initiatives shall be integrated wherever possible into existing programmes and service. In the health sector this shall mean integration into the Sexual and Reproductive Health services, Maternal and Child Health Services, services for Sexually Transmitted Infections, Family Health and other mainstream services and programmes such as the Hepatitis Control Programme and the National TB Control Programme. In other sectors this shall mean the development of strategies to ensure access for PLHIV and KAPs to welfare, housing and socio economic support pro- grammes, drug treatment programmes, workforce development programmes and other appropriate programmes and services. The focus shall be on breaking down access barriers and on avoiding the need for a range of unnecessary and unsustainable HIV specific services and pro- grammes. (v) Encouraging a whole of government approach \u2013 across all government departments and at all levels of government All government ministries and departments shall identify strategies to contrib- ute to the national response to HIV and AIDS and shall also examine their poli- cies and programmes to ensure that they are not contributing the to increased HIV risk and vulnerability. The participation capacity of departmental and government service staff shall be enhanced through in-service training, review of policies and procedures and standard settings. 110 HIV POLICIES The priority of focus shall be the strengthened participation by the following Ministries and departments: (i) Interior; (ii) Women Development; (iii) Social Welfare and Special Education; (iv) Defence; (v) Law, Justice and Human Rights; (vi) Labour, Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis; (vii) Narcotic Control and Anti Narcotic Force; (viii) Local Bodies and Rural Development; (ix) Industries; (x) Population Welfare; (xi) Information; and (xii) Religious Affairs and Education.

(vi) Ensuring a multi-sectoral approach that includes the full participation of civil society and community groups, religious leaders and private sector The response shall recognize and support the key role of civil societies and community groups in HIV prevention and care and reaching the PLHIV and the KAPs shall require the cooperation and particular expertise and knowledge of civil society and community groups. In particular networks of PLHIVs shall be supported and strengthened as key providers of information support and care. NGOs and community groups that works with the populations most at risk for HIV infections shall also be support- ed and encouraged to participate fully in the response and the programmes that bring these civil societies and community groups into the HIV and AIDS response shall be encouraged at national, provincial and district levels. Encouragement for participation in the in HIV prevention and care shall also be provided to religious leaders and religious communities, by demonstration of leadership in the reduction of HIV related stigma and discrimination and providing programmes and services to reduce the impact of HIV and providing assistance to promote behaviours that reduce HIV transmission. Similarly participation of the private sector shall also be encouraged and three particular aspects have been highlighted as follows: HIV POLICIES 111 (i) Encouragement of the employers and employer groups for development and implementation of HIV and AIDS workplace policies that assist in reduction of HIV risks and supporting workers and families affected by HIV and AIDS; (ii) Private sector development projects will be encouraged to assess the HIV and AID impact of their projects and put in place strategies to minimize HIV and AIDS risk, vulnerability and impact; and (iii) Opportunities for public / private partnerships that enhance the national and provincial HIV and AIDS response shall also be identified and supported.

(i) Drug Supply Reduction The Drug Supply Reduction component of the Narcotics Policy comprises of a three pronged approach (a) Elimination of poppy cultivation to maintain Paki- stan\u2019s poppy free status; (b) Prevent the trafficking and production of narcotic 4 National Anti Narcotics Policy 2010 \u2013 Updated August 2011 \u2013 Ministry of Narcotics Control, Narcotics Control Division, Government of Pakistan. 114 NARCOTICS POLICIES drugs, psychotropic substances and precursor chemicals; and (c) Strengthen law enforcements agencies and streamline activities; each of which is dealt with below. (a) Elimination of poppy cultivation to maintain Pakistan\u2019s poppy free status \u2013 The Narcotics Policy provides that Pakistan\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy should be integrated with the poppy eradication strategy at the national level in order to ensure a comprehensive approach to transnational crime. The Governments of Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa province, Balochistan and FATA should strictly eliminate poppy cultivation while providing alternative means of livelihood to poppy cultivators. Federal and provincial Law Enforcement Authorities (LEAs) should work together and assist each other in the surveying, monitoring and elimination of poppy cultivation. \u2013 Additionally an awareness campaign should also be launched to dissuade farmers from cultivating poppies and encourage them to pursue / engage in licit livelihoods. (b) Prevent the trafficking and production of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and precursor chemicals \u2013 The precursor chemicals that are listed in the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 1998 are defined as \u201cControlled Substances\u201d and there imports for licit industrial and pharmaceutical use is strictly controlled by the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Narcotics Control. \u2013 However the smuggling of such Controlled Substances and their diversion for illicit uses is an ongoing challenge for LEAs. According to the Narcotics Policy, drug producers, specially of opiates have developed substitute chemical that are not included in the Controlled Substances list as a consequence of which the identification and interdiction of such precursor chemicals has become difficult.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f08e54e-d3ae-4bbd-91e3-dff933e05f24": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f08e54e-d3ae-4bbd-91e3-dff933e05f24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03d792709b2cca09ed1a438209a1dcb405d903613ad7e580e9e9ee663d243139"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c7625b4-1199-47c0-b471-f2ee4fcda70c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6bab1048618dc37e12d5b343968ae88b25d3bd8d587c7025ce3c97f7f1d607ef"}}, "hash": "1e68c1485b1cdba577f896f911fac17b89c6c45c5c7c685d80cd3b9cd1cb2d0a", "text": "\u2013 The Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) needs to be enhanced with an identification unit of precursor chemicals at each regional directorate in order to prevent smuggling and illicit diversion of the same. \u2013 Additionally the sharing of information between various concerned government departments and agencies will be streamlined in order to ensure faster and effective interdiction of controlled substances.

(ii) Drug Demand Reduction The key elements of the Narcotics Policy is to reduce demand by focusing on drug demand prevention and treatment of drug users. According to the 2006 National Assessment of Problem Drug Use in Pakistan (\u201cProblem Drug Use Survey\u201d), which although was not a comprehensive survey, the estimated prevalence of opiate use in Pakistan is at 0.7 percent of the adult population. However, according to the Narcotics Policy, there has been a substantial in- crease in Opium and Heroin production in neighboring Afghanistan since the Problem Drug Use Survey and a shift in the trafficking routes towards Pakistan; and as a consequence it is likely that the prevalence of opiate use is higher. The \u201cDrug Demand Reduction\u201d objective of the Narcotics policy also comprises of three elements. (a) Enhance demand prevention efforts through education and community mobilization campaigns and projects \u2013 A \u201cDrug Free\u201d campaign is to be launched in educational institutions and work places in each city that will aim at educating young people about drug abuse and will involve parents, teachers, students, religious leaders, health professionals, community leaders and social workers. \u2013 For the purpose of combatting drug abuse in jails the Ministry of Interior in collaboration with provincial jail departments shall develop special training and treatment programmes for drug abuse and drug related HIV prevention and rehabilitation. \u2013 The first model for drug free jail was to be launched at Adyala Jail in Rawalpindi. \u2013 A campaign for Drug Free cities will also be launched where a drug free city will be established in each province as a model for other to 116 NARCOTICS POLICIES emulate and the help of provincial governments will be sought with regard to these projects. \u2013 Lahore has been selected as the first model drug free city for which a comprehensive plan has been evolved by the Ministry of Narcotics and Control and the Government of Punjab. \u2013 In addition to the above, material creating awareness about drug abuse shall be developed for inclusion in the curriculum of primary, secondary and higher secondary schools and universities and in order to ensure drug free work place, labour unions shall be engaged in to promote the message against drug abuse. \u2013 Labour Unions shall also be engaged to facilitate rehabilitation of drug addicts and assist their induction back into their places of employment after their treatment. \u2013 In addition to the various \u201cDrug Free\u201d campaigns the Drug Demand Reduction objective also includes improvement of recreational facilities; community mobilization and launching of awareness campaigns against drugs; and engaging the leaderships of political parties and Members of Parliament to play an active role against drug proliferation and trafficking. (b) Develop effective and accessible drug treatment and rehabilitation systems \u2013 In order to reduce drug related health problems, to encourage prevention, rehabilitate drug addicts and to successfully reintegrate addicts into the community it is necessary that effective, efficient and accessible drug treatments systems are developed and for this purpose the Narcotics Policy provides that the drug treatment and rehabilitation centres must be mainstreamed into the healthcare system and should be established in each federal, provincial and district hospital in accordance with international best practices; as a matter of priority. \u2013 Provincial health departments should develop wards in both district hospitals and tehsil hospitals for treatment and detoxification of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad42e044-66b6-46c2-8e8e-f31eb609c37e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad42e044-66b6-46c2-8e8e-f31eb609c37e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e2347f493bd7c011902cd45fa56c82710c57d2c57bc24829159f6062e11762d"}}, "hash": "6e2347f493bd7c011902cd45fa56c82710c57d2c57bc24829159f6062e11762d", "text": "drug users and the Narcotics Control Department (NCD) and ANF shall also upgrade the facilities available at the Model Addict Treatment and Rehabilitation Centres in Quetta, Karachi and Islamabad and establish new ones in Lahore and Peshawar. \u2013 The treatment and rehabilitation centres functioning under the aegis of various NGOs shall be also assisted through financial support and the provision of experts with international assistance. \u2013 Drop In Centres (DIC) for Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) shall be established in all major cities of Pakistan. \u2013 Additionally rehabilitation programmes for skill development of drug addicts shall be launched through vocational training centres. \u2013 Drug treatment and rehabilitation facilities shall be extended to key jails in Pakistan beginning with Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi; as according to available estimates 40% of Pakistan\u2019s prison population indulges in drug abuse. NARCOTICS POLICIES 117 \u2013 Special treatment centres shall be established for women in five cities of the country. \u2013 Specially designed programmes shall be introduced for street children with solvent abuse problems in major cities, including outreach and residential treatment programme. \u2013 Ministry of Narcotics and Control shall establish a Technical Task Force comprised of psychiatrists, psychologists and NGOs to develop a uniform drug treatment protocol and standard service for all government, private and NGO run drug treatement centres and training of staff of NGOs and other institutions in drug treatment through national and regional courses, workshops and seminars shall be arranged. (c) Conduct a drug abuse survey to determine the prevalence of drug addiction \u2013 A nationwide survey shall be conducted in order to determine the current pattern and prevalence of drug addiction in Pakistan and in order to ensure that the drug demand reduction and treatment and rehabilitation programmes are compatible with needs of the drug addict population of the country. \u2013 Support for conducting the survey shall be sought from UNODC and other donor agencies. (iii) International Cooperation The successful implementation of the Narcotics Policy is dependent on re- gional and international cooperation. The Government Pakistan being a signa- tory to all UN Drug Control Conventions as well as the SAARC Convention on Drug Control continues its policy of cooperation on drug related intelligence sharing, border management and joint operation against drug trafficking and precursor chemical smuggling. Pakistan shall collaborate in regional and inter- national forum to counter narcotics trafficking including at forums hosted by international LEAs and UNODC by sharing information and considering joint initiatives. Internatioal cooperation is to be enhanced by placing Drug Liaison Officers in various countries under a phased programme including Vienna (Austria), Kabul (Afghanistan), Tehran (Iran), Bangkok (Thailand) and Dubai (UAE). 1 2 The Implementation Partners \u2013 Federal Government 1.2.1 As per the Narcotics Policy anti narcotics issues are the shared responsibility of a number of ministries

It further provides that the drug treatment facilities should be able to adapt to meet the emerging and diverse needs of drug dependent persons especially those with co-morbidities such as HIV, HCV and TB and accordingly the area of prevention, treatment and rehabilitation requires capacity building which includes specialized drug demand reduction staff in the ANF. 2 3 Issues to be Addressed 2.3.1 The Drug Abuse Master Plan identifies the issues that need to be addressed during the Drug Abuse Master Plan period of 2010 \u2013 14, and these include inter alia the following, under the head of \u201cCheck the Increase in Drug Demand and Achieve Reduction in the Number of Drug Addicts through Prevention and Treatment and Rehabilitation Measures\u201d: (a) Absence of consistent drug abuse prevention programmes; (b) High prevalence of HIV among injecting drug users; (c) Introduction of cocaine and synthetic drugs (ecstasy and solvent abuse etc); (d) Limited availability of comprehensive drug treatment programme, including prisons, street children and women; (e) Lack of regular data collection and dissemination on drug abuse pattern and trends; (f) Lack of co-ordination between Ministry of Narcotics Control, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Social Welfare and provincial departments; (g) Limited technical capacity to deliver demand reduction programmes in the public sector and civil society. 2 4 Institutional Framework for Narcotics Control 2.4.1 Chapter 3 of the Drug Abuse Master Plan pertains to the \u201cLegal and Institutional Framework for Narcotics Control\u201d (\u201cChapter 3\u201d) and deals with the various institutions, within the Government that deal with Narcotics Control and the legal framework which regulates Narcotics control and the amendments required in the same. 122 NARCOTICS POLICIES 2.4.2 The relevant institutions dealing with Narcotics Control, as set out in Chapter 3 are as follows: (a) Ministry of Narcotics Control (\u201cMNC\u201d), which is responsible for making and planning Pakistan\u2019s drug control policy. (i) National Narcotics Control Council \u2013 For the purpose of overseeing the implementation of the Drug Abuse Master Plan and the Narcotics control policies and programmes in the country it has been proposed that a National Narcotics Control Council (\u201cNNCC\u201d) be set up under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister of Pakistan. The secretariat of the NNCC is to be based at the MNC. (ii) Policy Review Board \u2013 The Policy Review Board (\u201cPRB\u201d) has been set up for the purpose of reviewing the implementation of the narcotics policy by various organisations and for making such recommendations to the Federal Cabinet on policy issues pertaining to Narcotics as it may deem necessary and appropriate. The PRB is required to meet once a year and has been established at the federal level. (iii) Narcotics Interdiction Committee \u2013 The Narcotics Interdiction Committee (\u201cNIC\u201d) has been established for the purpose of reviewing, monitoring and evaluating Narcotics interdiction operations of all LEAs and to make necessary plans for more effective control over drug trafficking throughout the country. NIC is required to meet every six (6) months. The Drug Abuse Master Plan has proposed that the NIC be renamed the \u201cNarcotics Interdiction and Drug Assets Seizure Committee\u201d to emphasize the Government\u2019s resolve in tackling the problems created by drug-generated assets. (b) Pursuant to the Control of Narcotics Substances Act, 1997, the ANF has the main responsibility for combatting drug trafficking in Pakistan and for interdicting the production, smuggling, trafficking and abuse of narcotics and illicit psychotropic substances. (c) The Frontier Corps (\u201cFC\u201d), a paramilitary organization deployed along Pakistan\u2019s border with Afghanistan in the Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa province and Balochistan and along Pakistan\u2019s border with Iran in the province of Balochistan, are primarily responsible for guarding the border areas, however they also undertake counter drug-trafficking operations. ANF has delegated anti-narcotic powers to the FC. According to the Drug Abuse Master Plan their investigative capacity requires to be enhanced.

(i) Airport Security Force (\u201cASF\u201d) has a presence at all the airports in the country and while its primary responsibility is control of weapons and ammunition smuggling onto aircrafts, however it is responsible for security of airports and also assists in detection of narcotics trafficking through its baggage screening mechanisms at different airports. 2 5 Proposed Amendments in the Legal Framework 2.5.1 The main law pertaining to narcotics in Pakistan is the Control of Narcotics Substances Act, 1997 (\u201cCNSA\u201d), which covers all aspects of drug abuse, drug trafficking. 2.5.2 The Drug Abuse Master Plan has highlighted certain amendments to the CNSA, as follows: (a) Provisions should be added to include Amphetamine Type Stimulants (ATS), synthetic drugs, semi synthetic drugs and their destructive effects; (b) Currently the CNSA does not provide any time limits for the finalization of inquiries and investigations by the Investigating Officers (IO) in the asset cases nor are the courts bound to complete the trials of the asset cases within a specified period of time, consequently conviction often takes a long period of time. Amendments have therefore been proposed in the CNSA to the extent of asset matters having some embargo on the IO and the Special Courts. Additionally provisions have also been suggested in connection with limiting the period of inquires and investigation by the IO, trial courts and filing of appeals before the Appellate Courts; (c) Drug cases that involve juveniles are not properly prosecuted as public prosecutors do not have proper experience of narcotics cases and accordingly amendments have been proposed for empowering ANF Special Courts to try juvenile drug cases. 2 6 Drug Demand Reduction 2.6.1 Chapter 6 of the Drug Abuse Master Plan deals with Drug Demand Reduction and while addressing the HIV risk to the IDU provides that a comprehensive strategy for drug abuse prevention, treatment and rehabilitation in Pakistan should address all the main areas of intervention: (a) policy measures to address the control of both licit and illicit substances developing an environment that is conducive to prevention and treatment efforts; (b) prevention of drug abuse; 124 NARCOTICS POLICIES (c) reduction of the social and health consequences; (d) treatment of drug dependence and criminal justice system measures. 2.6.2 The \u201cPriority Areas to be Addressed\u201d as identified in the Drug Demand Reduction section of the Drug Abuse Master Plan, include (a) School and Community Based Prevention Programmes; and (b) Improved Delivery of Treatment Services. 2 7 Improved Delivery of Treatment Services 2.7.1 Under the head of improved delivery of treatment services, the Drug Abuse Master Plan has identified the requirement for: (a) developing standards and protocols of essential services that should be provided through drug treatment facilities; (b) certification of drug treatment facilities for the quality of services provided based on the developed standards and protocols; (c) instituting training programmes for developing and upgrading the skills of key staff and service providers in the drug treatment facilities; (d) putting in place a system ongoing monitoring of the delivery, quality and coverage of drug treatment services as well as the evaluation of the various interventions. 2.7.2 Improved delivery of treatment services has also identified the requirement for \u201caddressing the diverse and evolving needs for treatment and care\u201d and has recognized that opioid users are mostly poly drug users with many of them being injecting users, resulting in co-morbidities such as Hepatitis C, Tuberculosis and HIV and accordingly the treatment and services should be developed that take these challenging and changing demands for care of the drug dependent person into account, along with the provisions of conventional interventions as a continuum of care.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "caa017d8-c014-438b-bf56-6a15a90f1e62": {"__data__": {"id_": "caa017d8-c014-438b-bf56-6a15a90f1e62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bdd1ea5dfa96a8354c79f25d3eb92b54a4c1fc9903de95a3d22b696c3aeed9e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd4ca5ba-0a1b-471b-a60b-384382d5e67a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15eee6e078fd4d3b1b0d8b3b7992a2136d453a0a270ae46c1de75c36bc8ae964"}}, "hash": "aab40783edee7b4cc2851591471ab598e3c1f9b9fbe605d1c426d967eae143e8", "text": "Some of the issues that need to be considered are: (a) Managing withdrawal on a poly user or a person who has HCV, HIV or TB;

The study has also revealed that there are around 420,000 injecting drug users (\u201cIDUs\u201d) in Pakistan that represent 0.4% of the population of Pakistan; which is a number higher than previously reported, with the highest number of IDUs in the province of Punjab, being 250 thousand followed by Sindh with 95 thousand. 1.1.2 As per an estimate by Nai Zindagi Trust, 40% of the street based IDUs in Pakistan fall within the category of PLHIV, with 50% of them already married with three children per household. 1.1.3 The field research with regard to PLHIV comprised of group interviews and discussions with a specific group of PLHIV in Karachi; discussions with a NGO representative working with PLHIV in Rawalpindi; members of the SACP and PACP and the findings are detailed in this Chapter. As the PLHIV and IDUs formed part of the same group therefore both are discussed in this Chapter. 2 GROUP INTERVIEW WITH PLHIV 2 1 Composition 2.1.1 Interviews and group discussions were conducted with a group of PLHIV in Karachi5. Out of the group of nine (9) PLHIV: (a) Two (2) PLHIV, which includes one (1) IDU contracted HIV from FSWs; (b) One (1) PLHIV (HSW) contracted HIV from a male client; (c) One (1) PLHIV (MSW) contracted HIV from sex work; (d) One (1) PLHIV (returning immigrant) contracted HIV from a MSW; and (e) The remaining four (4) PLHIV (recovering IDUs) contracted HIV through syringe re-use. 2 2 Education 2.2.1 All members of the group had differing levels of literacy but no member of the group was literacy challenged. 5 Interviews conducted with PLHIV in Karachi at Parwaz Male Health Society, Karachi May 2013. PLHIV / IDUs 131 2 3 Health Sector 2.3.1 All members of the group were satisfied with the services being provided by the SACP and had no specific complaints about the doctors, health service providers at the SACP or any of the services being provided there. 2.3.2 The only complaint, and a recurring one was by the PLHIV with opportunistic infections such as HCV, who reported facing extreme difficulty in receiving treatment which they attributed to administrative processes. There was also a general sense of distrust about the cost of medication and the availability of medicines. 2 4 Employment 2.4.1 All members of the group were currently un-employed and reported that they faced discrimination upon disclosure of their HIV positive status. 2.4.2 Additionally all members of the group were concerned about the fact that they were unable to find employment due to their health status and were of the view that steps should be taken to ensure that there is no discrimination in employment due to health status. 2 5 Marital Status 2.5.1 Five (5) members of the group were married, yet two (2) were seperated from their wives. Out of the remaining three (3) one of the wives was HIV positive while the other two (2), while duly screened were HIV negative, as confirmed by the group members. Two (2) members of the group had children but the children were HIV negative, as confirmed by the group members.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdafb80b-b79d-43a4-877f-60e3c3ef574e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdafb80b-b79d-43a4-877f-60e3c3ef574e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d6978a7ac3c2804cd5c3907c7b365fdb647b5ae345a8217c5200391f6e2e3dc"}, "2": {"node_id": "16b5e40e-e32d-4c9f-b25c-44684ebef1fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "614e54c308ef65fd39dc6537c3d389986b423b26c1137222cded445fd3e5eb81"}}, "hash": "7b2662b37db9081cbd55052d216d6a22893c8be290c2291b870841ed1404e489", "text": "2 6 Stigmatization and Discrimination 2.6.1 Each member of the group confirmed facing discrimination and stigmatization in every sphere of life, starting from family members for some to health care providers for all, in situations when they were being dealt with in departments of public hospitals other than the HIV department. The members of the group reported that the level of discrimination in the private hospitals was comparatively less. 2.6.2 Discrimination towards PLHIV in the health sector has been widely reported, directly by PLHIV and indirectly by KAPs, in all three cities, with the consequent outcome of the PLHIV terminating the ongoing treatment. 2.6.3 The members of the current group reported that they did not face any discrimination at the SACP. 2 7 Field Findings 2.7.1 The majority of the group was aware of the source", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9491237-bc35-46c3-bc9a-2e833562f149": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9491237-bc35-46c3-bc9a-2e833562f149", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95e68ca2e2255724f3fa5ab10b79383ff9e64bcaa9be000d53db9ecf1184bcb2"}, "3": {"node_id": "c5429d95-6e19-464f-923f-290539e750a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a14e64273ed3c36905e3c769e8e43842788b62c71bce6223ce8c2d6eb7d8becd"}}, "hash": "599bb2fffc48c602abb57340ceb4167b54470618c55fac6cb95200ca1e35fc36", "text": "of the HIV transmission. The group as a whole was mainly concerned about the following: 132 PLHIV / IDUs (a) The ongoing treatment for HIV at the public health facilities, with which the majority did not report any complaints; (b) The inability of the group and other PLHIV to be gainfully employed and the discrimination faced by the PLHIV when seeking employment; (c) The hardships faced by PLHIV when accessing health facilities in relation to the allied infections and medical situations; where as per the report of each member of the group, they not only face discrimination but also have to face hardships and great inconvenience. 3 NGO IN RAWALPINDI 3 1 Perspective with regard to PLHIV in Pakistan 3.1.1 The general perspective with regard to PLHIV in Pakistan, as ascertained from our discussion with a NGO working for the rights of PLHIV in Rawalpindi6 is that there exists a lack of awareness among the general population with regard to HIV, which lack of awareness ranges from among the law enforcement agencies to the common man. 3.1.2 The discrimination faced by PLHIV is also common across the board and has been reported from all sectors of the PLHIV community and was also confirmed by the said NGO; which also included employment related discrimination and discrimination in the health sector, which was perceived as the initial stage of social discrimination and stigmatization, in most cases. 3.1.3 The lack of awareness among the law enforcement agencies is being addressed by the NGO by arranging special awareness programmes. 4 AIDS CONTROL PROGRAMME 4 1 Sindh AIDS Control Programme 4.1.1 The personnel of the Sindh AIDS Control Programme (\u201cSACP\u201d) were most receptive and informative and provided the information required7. 4.1.2 SACP did not corroborate the delays in receiving treatment for HCV reported by PLHIV, although they did agree that the lack of one window operation for HIV and its allied opportunistic infections such as HCV, HBV and TB did create delays and problems for PLHIV in accessing treatment and also resulted in certain amount of discrimination and stigmatization, due to lack of awareness and training among the health care providers in other departments. 4.1.3 A problem that is faced by the PLHIV in other departments is the lack of identification documentation; since majority of the PLHIV are IDUs and therefore may not have 6 Association for People Living with HIV in Islamabad. (Interview with Mr. Asghar Satti in Islamabad on May 17, 2013) 7 Interviews were conducted at the SACP with the Principal Programme Manager, Enhanced HIV Control Programme, Government of Sindh , Health Department, Karachi and Dr. Abro, the medical official in charge of the SACP\u2019s HIV treatment centre at the Civil Hospital at Karachi. PLHIV / IDUs 133 identification documentation they face hurdles in registration in other departments for treatment of health care facilities. It was suggested that a one-window system would be helpful and would reduce the problems of the PLHIV greatly since the PLHIV are registered with the HIV unit and therefore that should constitute sufficient registration for all other departments. 4.1.4 There were a number of children reporting co-morbidities of Thalassemia and HIV infections. 4.1.5 The SACP is funded by the Government of Sindh. 4 2 Punjab AIDS Control Programme 4.2.1 In comparison to SACP, the Punjab AIDS Control Programme (PACP) was more organized and advanced; with regard to the service delivery and surveillance8. 4.2.2 The PACP is handling service delivery directly in nine (9) cities of Punjab, namely (a) Lahore; (b) Faisalabad; (c) Sargodha; (d) D. G. Khan; (e) Okara; (f) Sheikhupura; (g) Mandi Bahaudin; (h) Sialkot; and (i) Gujrat. 4.2.3 PACP has established a first of its kind 5 days training programme in Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission that has been successfully implemented in 6 districts in Punjab. 4.2.4 As reported by PACP, Punjab has a very effective Blood Transfusion Authority which has a direct impact on HIV transmission. 4.2.5 PACP has suggested that NGOs should be encouraged to undertake sensitization and awareness programmes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5429d95-6e19-464f-923f-290539e750a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5429d95-6e19-464f-923f-290539e750a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95e68ca2e2255724f3fa5ab10b79383ff9e64bcaa9be000d53db9ecf1184bcb2"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9491237-bc35-46c3-bc9a-2e833562f149", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "599bb2fffc48c602abb57340ceb4167b54470618c55fac6cb95200ca1e35fc36"}}, "hash": "a14e64273ed3c36905e3c769e8e43842788b62c71bce6223ce8c2d6eb7d8becd", "text": "4.2.6 In case of harassment faced by members of the PLHIV and / or the KAP community at the hands of the law enforcement agencies, the PACP confirmed providing support; by communicating with the law enforcement agencies. 4.2.7 The PACP is also funded by the Provincial Government. 5 NGO WORKING WITH IDUS IN ISLAMABAD 5 1 NGO Introduction 5.1.1 The interview was conducted with a NGO working with IDUs in Islamabad and providing drug harm reduction, drug demand reduction and socio economic rehabilitation services9.

Chapter 16 FEMALE SEX WORKERS 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1.1 The field research with regard to FSWs was conducted in Karachi and Lahore and comprised of group interviews in Karachi and Lahore and interviews with a NGO working with FSWs in Lahore; and the finding are detailed in this chapter. 2 KARACHI PERSPECTIVE 2 1 Group Composition 2.1.1 The interviews were conducted with two distinct groups of FSWs in Karachi; of which the first group was a mixed one as detailed below (\u201cGroup 1\u201d) and the second one was Kothi Khana (KK) based (\u201cGroup 2\u201d). 2.1.2 Group 1 comprised of 5 women, out of which 3 were street based; one was no longer employed and 1 had only particular clients and was a dancer10. 10 The interview was conducted on May 15, 2013 at the residence of one of the FSW in the Gulistan-e-Jauhar area of Karachi, and all other FSWs arrived at the said residence for the interview. FEMALE SEX WORKERS 135 2.1.3 In order to meet Group 2 we visited a KK11, peopled by 3 \u201caunties\u201d and eleven (11) girls of varying ages; however we only spoke with 1 aunty; 2 FSWs who by their own admission were aged 15 and one 1 FSW who by her admission was aged 21; while the remaining girls and women at the KK were uncommunicative and hostile. 2 2 Age 2.2.1 The FSWs forming Group 1 were aged 25 \u2013 35. 2.2.2 The girls forming part of Group 2 visually appeared to be under age; however when we inquired the age; two of the girls said that they were 15 and one said that she was 21; while in our estimation the girls who said that they were 15 did not appear to be older than between 12 to14 years; and the girl who said she was 21 did not appear to be older than 18 years. All other girls in the KK also appeared to be not older than 16 years with the only exception being the girl who said that she was 21 years old. 2 3 Marital Status 2.3.1 All the FSWs in Group 1 reported that their marital status was \u201cmarried\u201d and reported having gotten married between the ages of 15 to 16 years. However, out of the 5 FSW forming Group 1, Three (3) FSWs confirmed that they were separated from their husbands; while 2 were living with their husbands, with the husbands being unaware of the source of their income. 2.3.2 Two of the FSWs that we spoke to in Group 2 were married, with the husband of one of them being present in the KK and procuring clients. The term \u201chusband\u201d appeared to be a euphemism for \u201chandler\u201d. 2 4 Children / Dependants 2.4.1 All the FSWs in Group 1 had between 2 to 3 children and all their children were studying in schools and were not aware of their mother\u2019s employment status.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd1af28e-a12e-4832-8b0c-6df61aab07ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd1af28e-a12e-4832-8b0c-6df61aab07ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8734990792ba4d9c9a3c294a4d0983acd9d6df6a0aea990a031c5be9cbfc0692"}, "2": {"node_id": "e3a0d61b-b59f-492b-89b0-f9aa1a978dd8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed80143131c6239766cacc9b79d90b429289d23beca44292cecfd0420cacb4ce"}}, "hash": "220d4e88c4bcc5760f5e7d2cd9a32171ea9bd4e95a5432ef03d29e1ebe662189", "text": "2.4.2 The 21 year old FSW in Group 2 had 2 children. 2 5 Health Issues 2.5.1 Group 1 reported large scale health issues among the FSWs due to lack of awareness and availability of health services among FSWs.

Cameras or tape recorders were not permitted at any stage of the interviews. Majority of the girls were operating under pseudonyms and there was a general sense of suspicion and fear. We also met birth mothers of three of the girls who were operating there that night and the \u201chusband\u201d of one of the girls. A raid by the police was expected at any minute and half an hour after we left there was indeed a raid by the police in which all girls were arrested only to be released after payment of the requisite fee (as later told to us by the FSW who had arranged for the visit to the KK). 136 FEMALE SEX WORKERS 2.5.2 Another reason listed by Group 1 FSWs for proper health care was that due to a large number of FSWs being of a young age in Karachi, they also failed to seek medical and health care facilities and were dependant on the aunties. This is was mostly applicable in case of KKs. In such case it was the older FSWs that were able to seek medical help while the younger ones went by untreated. 2 6 Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights 2.6.1 Both Group 1 and Group 2 had knowledge about HIV; however as reported by Group 1, protection usage was at 50% among FSWs in Karachi; being dependant on the choice of their clients. 2.6.2 In case of the married women in Group 1, they reported that had been unable to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights within their married life as well; and in each case the husbands had insisted that all such choices are the man\u2019s domain. 2.6.3 Upon our visit to the KK, we were informed, without enquiring that protection was mandatorily used, while none of the FSWs at the KK had knowledge of or were aware of HIV; including the aunty.12 2 7 Law Enforcement and Rights Violation 2.7.1 Group 1 reported severe violation of rights by the law enforcement agencies; which ranged from rape to framing of false charges, if arrested, while in no situation were any arrests were made on the grounds of prostitution or solicitation. In each case that was narrated, FSWs were only able to seek release from the law enforcement agencies by payment in cash and kind. 2.7.2 Security was an issue for Group 1 since they were at risk not only from the law enforcement agencies but also from their clients, as they reported serious cases of rights violations which ranged from assault, battery, rape to murder; and in each such situation they were unable to report the same or seek help due to their profession. 2.7.3 Security was comparatively less of an issue for Group 2 since the KK was under the protection of the \u201caunty\u201d who was operating the same and had undertaken certain security measures. However, at times, certain KKs were also raided in which case all persons present at the KK were arrested. 12 When we had arrived at the KK, the \u201caunty\u201d was extremely hostile towards us and had instructed us to finish our \u201cbusiness\u201d quickly, as a consequences the girls were also hesitant in talking to us. We were moved to one of the rooms where the girls came to talk to us. A uniform modus operandi was adopted for each interview conducted by us for this report, which involved introducing ourselves by name, our profession i.e. we are lawyers and the purpose and intent of the interviews and research.

This was further explained as \u201cKhunutha\u201d a congenital impairment, in which an infant cannot be identified at birth as either male or female; for the reason that the infant has both female and male sexual organs or has no sexual organs at all17. 4.2.2 The \u201cKhuntha\u201d is not be confused with the \u201cMukhannath\u201d; \u201ca term used for a man who chooses to behave and dress like a woman (an effeminate man) but is clearly identifiable as sexually male\u201d18. However the term \u201cMukhannath\u201d has also been used as a common synonym for homosexuals19 and it is perhaps this reference to homosexuality in the colloquial slang of Arabic speakers that has resulted, from the Pakistan perspective, in Mukhannath being used as a term of general reference with regard to members of the TG Community as well as certain MSWs who form part of the TG Community. 15 \u201cAncient Sindh\u2019s Famous Cities and Personalities\u201d by Mirza Qaleech Baig (in Sindhi) as quoted in \u201cTeesri Jins\u201d Translation: \u201cThird Gender \u2013 A Study on the economics of the Khawaja Saras of Sindh\u201d : Akhtar Baloch.

The term \u201cKhasi\u201d (plural \u201ckhisyan\u201d) meaning castrated man, eunuch20 appears to have been used with reference to eunuchs; however after the advent of the Mamelukes it has been interchangeably used with the term \u201cTawashi\u201d which was originally the title applied to the head eunuch who was responsible for the Mameluke Sultan\u2019s wife and for the other euncuhs in the palace as well as for their training. 4 3 The Pakistan Perspective 4.3.1 The only available study in respect of the physiological examination of Hijras is the \u201cReport on the Genital Examination of Hijras\u201d21 based on the data collected during the National Study of Reproductive Tract and Sexually Transmitted Disease in 2004 by the National AIDS Control Programme (\u201cStudy on Hijras-2004\u201d). 4.3.2 The Study on Hijras-2004 was undertaken in view of the fact that despite several studies about the socio-sexual behaviour of Hijras, any material in relation to the genital examination of Hijras is not available.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46a1a45f-8267-49be-b39c-821a90577730": {"__data__": {"id_": "46a1a45f-8267-49be-b39c-821a90577730", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6d3f3ec5a262227e9006e0b6fa17c83e7bc2de5ed5d2fc131905e5b03dd30a3"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc5a6fcd-06c4-4cb1-8491-042911f4786e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c3c9c142952c11a316c780af5267c8cc780a367a7b30acd30fd090e90f791d0"}}, "hash": "5960c73e16e200691ec100458e05c22132b00e74c0b6380c84350a4d8595075f", "text": "As part of the Study on Hijras-2004, four hundred (400) Hijras from the cities of Karachi and Lahore were examined and a random sampling of the \u201cGurus\u201d of Hijras in each city formed part of the Study on Hijras-2004 along with all Hijras under such selected Gurus;

THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY 145 5 3 Employment 5.3.1 With regard to employment the members of the TG community in Rawalpindi and in Lahore were interested in alternate modes of employment and showed interest in vocational training. Additionally some members deemed it their right to receive vocational training so that they have the necessary skill set to leave their current professions (whether begging or sex work) and considered a failing on the part of the government to not have established the requisite vocational centres. None of the TG members had government jobs, and were only aware of two (2) members of their community who had been given employment by the provincial government. 5 4 Sex Work 5.4.1 The lines between MSW community and TG community appear to be quite fluid and MSWs who did not outwardly appear to be members of the TG community declared themselves to be \u201cKhawaja Saras\u201d during the course of the study; and as a consequence there was no clear defining characteristic as to who is or is not a Khawaja Sara. The members in question mentioned their Khawaja Sara status, in reference to their sex work. 5 5 Citizenship 5.5.1 Despite the Supreme Court judgment only one member of the TG community that formed part of the Study had received the TG National Identity Card; and for the others, some were not inclined to apply for the same as they already had a National Identity Card in which their gender was listed as male; and the others were not pursuing it due to the difficulty in applying for the same. 5 6 Discrimination and Stigma 5.6.1 There were clear and distinct references to discrimination and stigma faced from (a) the law enforcement agencies; (b) health service providers; and (c) the public at large. These are listed hereinbelow, in brief, divided on the basis of the cities: (i) Rawalpindi The TG Community is facing harassment from the law enforcement agen- cies primarily due to their activities as HSW and in such capacity they are threatened with consequences under Section 107 and 109 of the Criminal Procedure Code being \u201cSecurity for keeping Peace in other cases\u201d and \u201cSecurity for good behaviour from vagrants and suspected persons\u201d. The members of the law enforcement agencies also seek sexual favours from the HSW. Additionally an instance was reported where the law enforcement agencies failed to register a complaint where a TG community member was violently assaulted and suf- fered injuries; the matter was settled by the law enforcement agencies upon receipt of financial compensation from the person who committed the assault, yet the TG community member received just a token amount. As reported, the non-HSW are also being discriminated upon by the public at large due to their gender and identity; however there was an instance where members of 146 THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY a religious organization were supportive of the TG community and in fact a member of the TG community had even joined the said religious organization as a male. With regard to the health sector, the group reported wide spread discrimination in the public health facilities and preferred private health facili- ties or facilities provided by NGOs. On the whole, Rawalpindi appears to be a more tolerant city. (ii) Lahore The HSW in Lahore reported harassment by members of the law enforcement agencies as well as by health facility providers, including sexual harassment. TG community members reported that even in case of sexual abuse they were not in a position to report the same as they did not expect to receive any sup- port or assistance from any section of the society and also narrated an incident where there was an instance of gang rape, yet no report was filed by the po- lice. The TG community members also reported that the health service facility providers also discriminated against the members of their community who fell within the category of PLHIV with the consequence that such community members preferred stay at home rather than face the discrimination at public hospitals. The NGO also confirmed such instances of discrimination against PLHIV; and also reported an incident where there was an incident of assault and rape of a member of TG community who consequently avoided seeking treatment at a hospital due to such discrimination. 5 7 Child Abuse 5.7.1 The TG community members both in Rawalpindi", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc49681b-e22a-44d2-b2bc-43b6a20c6831": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc49681b-e22a-44d2-b2bc-43b6a20c6831", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de57a66348ea24b1eb47bec7acb78ef5405f4754edbe503d04a1aad06f5dc679"}, "3": {"node_id": "fa7db839-0e40-4ab3-ad87-4551c44cead5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9beb6f30f8ba70414c68bda054b31f1a3f6a4b2cedac41030c95608ad235481c"}}, "hash": "ced9b7375b7fa526f55fdfcb4cde7c170e16d78fcaf9ce96bdd4786ef0845788", "text": "as well as in Lahore reported instances of child abuse between the age of 7\u201311 years. 5 8 Marital Status 5.8.1 A number of the TG Community members were married and appeared to be living dual lives, whereby they would live the lives of men when visiting their families/wives in their villages / cities and continue to live the life of a TG / HSW while living in the city of their employment. While being aware of the risks associated with HIV and the transmission of the same, the members of the current group had not communicated the risks to their wives, as their double lives had not been disclosed to their family and wives and accordingly any reference to HIV may have led to a disclosure of the same. MSM AND MSW 147 Chapter 18 MSM AND MSW 1 FIELD RESEARCH 1 1 Surveys and Interviews 1.1.1 For the purpose of this study, interviews and group discussions were conducted in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi24 with members of MSM/MSW community in each of the three cities. The average age group in each of the three cities was between the age of 18 to 24, with two individuals aged 29 and 42 each in Karachi. The largest group of MSM/MSW community members was in Karachi, which included a street based masseuse (Malishia). 1 2 Legal Awareness 1.2.1 The group as a whole was aware that being a MSM is an offence under the laws of Pakistan; as a consequence of which they failed to report any abuse that they faced in their daily lives. 1.2.2 Additionally, all groups in each of the cities reported that carrying condoms is a crime in Pakistan. 1 3 Education 1.3.1 The majority of the members of the MSM community were at least graduates. 1.3.2 The general trend, however, in the MSW community was not towards receiving education and in the groups that formed part of the discussion, except for two members that had received education upto the twelfth standard, most were not inclined towards education. The reasons for this lack of education and disinterest in education can be broadly grouped into three categories (a) financial; (b) sexual abuse in educational institution; and (c) introduction to sex trade and hence no interest in education. Each of these categories is discussed below. (a) a number of interviewees reported having faced financial difficulties at a young age due to which they had to give up their education or could not pursue education at all. Each of such MSWs community members were however interested in pursuing education; (b) 3 MSW community members reported incidents of child abuse in educational institutions between the ages of 7\u201312, which included an incident of abuse in a religious educational institution at the age of 7. The obvious result of such child abuse was (i) the MSWs as children did not pursue education further; and (ii) turned to sex work to earn their living; 24 Interviews were conducted in Rawalpindi at \u201cDareecha\u201d the Rawalpindi office of Naz Male Health Alliance with 2 MSWs; in Lahore at \u201cDostana\u201d the Lahore office of Naz Male Health Alliance on March 12, 2013 with 2 MSWs; and in Karachi at \u201cParwaz\u201d the Karachi office of Naz Male Health Alliance on April 30, 2013 with 5 MSWs. 148 MSM AND MSW (c) in case of 2 MSWs, further education was not pursued due to the fact that the MSWs in question had been introduced to sex work and had started earning better remuneration through sex work and as reported by them they did not feel a need to pursue education. 1 4 Employment 1.4.1 The MSM included in the surveys for the Study were employed in regular jobs and did not report any discrimination in such jobs. 1.4.2 The MSWs on the other hand did not have any alternate employment and were reliant on sex work as their means of earning a living. The reason for no alternate employment as reported was that the gains from sex work were vastly lucrative and paid in excess of what could have been earned from a regular job. Additionally, it was also reported by MSWs in Lahore that they faced stigmatization while trying to take up employment in regular jobs due to their mannerisms; despite the fact that the MSWs in question were not effeminate in appearance or TGs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa7db839-0e40-4ab3-ad87-4551c44cead5": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa7db839-0e40-4ab3-ad87-4551c44cead5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de57a66348ea24b1eb47bec7acb78ef5405f4754edbe503d04a1aad06f5dc679"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc49681b-e22a-44d2-b2bc-43b6a20c6831", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ced9b7375b7fa526f55fdfcb4cde7c170e16d78fcaf9ce96bdd4786ef0845788"}}, "hash": "9beb6f30f8ba70414c68bda054b31f1a3f6a4b2cedac41030c95608ad235481c", "text": "The MSWs in Rawalpindi reported that they were inclined to take up alternate employment and give up sex work but were unable to find alternate employment due to their lack of education and effeminate appearance. 1.4.3 The exception to the above,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2f3fd4b-6d4f-436b-859c-f7eb3c3edb02": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2f3fd4b-6d4f-436b-859c-f7eb3c3edb02", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62f67ea6c3af5a4130eb1678fb059285625dcb8769bd43ceaf48216606ff2558"}, "3": {"node_id": "cba5d5ce-07d7-4ec6-938f-bdeeef297a93", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "440d63e73fef5b0106bb1dc54e30d6d954fe010f2f3b193e27da657c1a763540"}}, "hash": "715dc8bd95d47e5154f97006dd2169a886a6f31d8778c2df3129f4481cf77765", "text": "were the masseuse (Malishia) and an auto-rickshaw driver who also engaged in sex-work. The masseuse provided street based sex work and formed part of a network of masseuses operating all over Karachi. Although the prime mode of employment of the masseuse are massages provided on street locations, however the term \u201cMalishia\u201d is recognized all over the country for specialized network of street based MSWs. Additionally, as reported the earnings of the masseuse are only from sex work and not from massages. As regards the auto- rickshaw driver his main earnings were from the auto rickshaw and he supplemented his earnings from sex work. It is also pertinent to note that he was not a confirmed MSM and reported instances of having engaged in sex with females in exchange for the cost of the auto-rickshaw conveyance. 1 5 Discrimination and Stigma 1.5.1 Each of the groups interviewed had complete knowledge about HIV and means of furthering the infection. They also had knowledge about screening and tests. 1.5.2 There were clear and distinct instances of discrimination and stigma in each city25, which fall under two heads (a) discrimination by members of the law enforcement agencies; and (b) discrimination in the health sector; and the same is discussed hereinbelow in detail. (i) Rawalpindi In comparison to other cities, the members of the MSW community appear to face the least amount of discrimination and stigma in Rawalpindi. There were 25 Based on interviews conducted at \u201cDareecha\u201d in Rawalpindi on March 7, 2013, \u201cDostana\u201d in Lahore on March 12, 2013 and \u201cParwaz\u201d at Karchi on April 30, 2013. MSM AND MSW 149 instances of excesses by members of the law enforcement agencies, but as in the other cities these excesses were of the nature where MSWs were required to give favours for free to personnel of the law enforcement agencies or face arrest. In the health sector no particular instances of discrimination were reported by members of the MSW community, the reason for which perhaps lies in the fact that they did not use public health services. (ii) Lahore The worst cases of discrimination and lack of sensitivity against members of the MSW community were reported in Lahore; which included a particular instance where an individual was made to parade naked in front of mem- bers of the law enforcement agencies and subsequently abused for 2 hours. There were also instances where members of the law enforcement agencies violated the privacy of the MSWs home with the intent to seek sexual favours. Additionally, the society at large also appeared to discriminate against the MSWs and they faced wide spread stigma and reported an inability to travel within the city with their family. Similarly in the public health sec- tor MSWs also faced widespread discrimination that ranged from the health practitioners not entertaining the MSWs to publicly insulting them for their practices (this was done when the MSWs had sought medical treatment with regard to STIs). As a consequence MSWs prefer private health care as opposed to public health facilities and / or drop-in-centres provding in house health facilities. Instances were also reported where PLHIV have preferred not to seek treatment due to the stigma attached to their health status, in the public health sector facilities. (iii) Karachi As with the other two cities MSWs in Karachi also reported instances of ex- cesses by members of the law enforcement agencies, which included an instance of a gang rape by members of the law enforcement agencies which went unreported. Furthermore, it was also reported that the members of the law enforcement agencies framed members of the MSW/MSM community on false charges of carrying narcotics on their persons. In one particular instance, the masseuse was arrested under Section 109 (Security for good behaviour from vagrants and suspected persons) of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 and remained in Landhi jail for nine (9) months. As regards the health sector, dis- crimination and stigma was reported only when the profession was disclosed. Additionally members of the NGO26 also confirmed that discrimination was faced if the profession of the MSW was disclosed and / or if the MSW fell within the category of PLHIV.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cba5d5ce-07d7-4ec6-938f-bdeeef297a93": {"__data__": {"id_": "cba5d5ce-07d7-4ec6-938f-bdeeef297a93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62f67ea6c3af5a4130eb1678fb059285625dcb8769bd43ceaf48216606ff2558"}, "2": {"node_id": "f2f3fd4b-6d4f-436b-859c-f7eb3c3edb02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "715dc8bd95d47e5154f97006dd2169a886a6f31d8778c2df3129f4481cf77765"}}, "hash": "440d63e73fef5b0106bb1dc54e30d6d954fe010f2f3b193e27da657c1a763540", "text": "1 6 Marital Status 1.6.1 Out of the total sample group, One (1) MSW was currently married with two (2) wives and eight children and Two (2) MSWs signified a desire to marry in the future. 26 This was confirmed by the in-house therapist of Parwaz, who was present during the interview and confirmed having accompanied the referrals to the public health facilities. 150 MSM AND MSW Similarly Two (2) MSM also signified a desire", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ade2e93-67c9-47d8-94e2-f4990201607e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ade2e93-67c9-47d8-94e2-f4990201607e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60f2d83667ef5d5965396a482e043525905bcf3ac133669e741a0b476c3199e4"}}, "hash": "60f2d83667ef5d5965396a482e043525905bcf3ac133669e741a0b476c3199e4", "text": "to marry in the future, although no MSM were currently married. 1.6.2 All MSWs and MSM were well aware about the risks of HIV transmission and confirmed regular screening and tests. 2 OBSERVATIONS 2 1 Law and Law Enforcement 2.1.1 The provisions of law that are applicable to MSM and MSWs are Section 377 of the PPC, being the section pertaining to \u201cUnnatural Offences\u201d. However it is interesting to note that not a single reported case under Section 377 is in respect of consensual sex and each of the reported cases is with regard to molestation of young children and has been filed by their guardians / parents. 2.1.2 During the course of our field research the instances of abuse by members of the law enforcement agencies was on the grounds that the MSM/MSWs were indulging in criminal activity and hence were liable to penalty; yet instead of arresting or penalizing them for such acts; the members of the law enforcement agencies took advantage of the MSWs and received sexual favors in exchange for the freedom of the MSWs. 2.1.3 It is also pertinent to note that even the MSWs who are arrested and imprisoned are not booked under the relevant provisions of the PPC i.e. Section 377 and are at the most sentenced under Section 109 of the CRPC. 2.1.4 Currently as a consequence of the presence of Section 377 of the PPC there is widespread violation of the rights of MSM and MSWs in Pakistan; since MSM and MSWs are unable to seek any relief under Section 377 of PPC upon the occurrence of any events of abuse; since the presumption of guilt would always be in favour of the MSM/MSW due to their profession; preferences and existing biases and prejudices. 2 2 Section 375 and Section 377 2.2.1 Furthermore, it is also relevant to note that the provision on rape of minors under the PPC is restricted to female children, as Section 375 only recognizes sexual intercourse with \u201ca woman\u201d with or without her consent under the age of sixteen years of age as Rape. Sexual intercourse with a boy under the age of sixteen with or without consent does not constitute Rape as per the provisions of the PPC. 2.2.2 The recognition of underage Rape is relevant since the punishment of Rape as provided in Section 376 of the PPC is \u201cdeath or imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than ten years or more than twenty-five years and shall also be liable to fine\u201d; and in case of rape committed by two or more persons in furtherance of common intention of all, \u201ceach of such persons shall be punished with death or imprisonment with death or imprisonment for life\u201d. While the maximum punishment for committing an offence under Section 377 is imprisonment for life or imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding ten years and for a term of not less than two years; and shall also be liable to fine. The difference between the term of imprisonment between the offences committed under Section 375 WOMEN 151 and Section 377 require that underage sexual abuse of boys should be included in the definition of Rape in order for the same to have the benefit of the punishments prescribed by Section 376. Chapter 19 WOMEN 1 NGO WORKING WITH RAPE VICTIMS IN KARACHI 1.1.1 Interview was conducted with a NGO in that provides legal aid and counseling to rape victims in Karachi27. 1 2 Rape \u2013 the hidden perspective 1.2.1 The NGO reported that due to stigma the cases of rape and molestation went unreported in most instances, and even in instances where such cases were brought to the attention of the said NGO the victims did not pursue the matter to the extent of filing a case; due to the stigma associated with the offence. 1 3 Delays in Rape Cases 1.3.1 The NGO reported that the delays in the proceeding of rape cases should be addressed as the same creates a hurdle in the proper administration of justice. This was illustrated by a particular instance where the case had been filed in 2006 and by the time the verdict was received in 2012, the victim girl\u2019s father had already expired and due to the circumstances the family had moved from Karachi and was no longer contactable and as such the verdict remained unreported to the victim. 1 4 Sensitization and Awareness 1.4.1 The acceptance of incest cases is dependent on the sensitization level of the particular law enforcement officer dealing with the matter, and for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2e63ffa-753e-4717-abfd-db4c31cebe50": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2e63ffa-753e-4717-abfd-db4c31cebe50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2a3321afb1d280f114ef35eb031f55513d368b77735e0790a0a8ac992c80279"}, "3": {"node_id": "26c9fd48-225b-42c2-a523-1316b667ac8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fde3d27cce2f75df3534b5b097418825bb43e4d1470e1536e54b5561bdf4339"}}, "hash": "6d5bfe250e346be6df062a617269b7fabecb6adbc59d54873661aa202e869760", "text": "most part the law enforcement agencies are unable to accept cases of incest. This was highlighted by a particular case, where a young girl was being abused by the father and when she filed the report with the law enforcement agencies of such abuse, instead of filing such report they called in the father to confirm the veracity of her statement. The father apologized for his acts and undertook to never repeat the same and to send the daughter to family outside of Karachi. The NGO has since been checking on the family but has not been able to locate either the father or the girl. 1.4.2 The NGO has reported that in each case of sexual abuse, the law enforcement agencies seek confirmation from the alleged abuser prior to registering the complaint. 27 War Against Rape, Karachi, interview conducted at their offices in Zamzama. 154 LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT Chapter 20 LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT 1 OBSERVATIONS AND COMMENTS ON SPECIFIC LAWS 1 1 Allopathic System Misuse Law 1.1.1 The Allopathic System Misuse Law allows the performance of circumcisions and incisions of boils by the practitioners of Alternative Medicine and there is no monitoring mechanism for the practitioners of Alternative Medicine. Since the performance of circumcisions and incisions of boils, both carry significant HIV risks the Allopathic System Misuse Law should contain specific provisions for training universal precautions and post exposure prophylaxis. 1 2 Allopathic Rules 1.2.1 The current rules do not contain any provisions with regard to the dissemination and / or awareness about HIV and / or the training in respect of universal precaution protocols. 1.2.2 The Allopathic Rules allow the grant of a permit to an individual who, while having studied for a period of not less than four (4) years for a licentiate or degree course of medical education in \u201cany\u201d institution and was eligible to appear in the examinations, yet has not passed or failed to appear in the final examinations; and such an individual upon the grant of a permit is authorised to prescribe anti-biotics and the dangerous drugs listed in Schedue B of the Allopathic Rules. 1.2.3 As a consequence of Rule4(a), the Allopathic Rules allow the prescription of anti- biotics and dangerous drugs, in accordance with the Allopathic Rules by individuals who have failed to successfully pass their medical examinations, for any reason whatsoever, whether as a consequence of passing the examinations or as a result of failing to appear in the examinations. 1 3 PMDC Law 1.3.1 Pursuant to the PMDC Law all medical practitioners are required to be registered and only duly registered medical practitioners are allowed to provide / be employed in health service / health facilities. In view of the PMDC Law, it is apparent that there is a system of legislation that regulates the health service industry in Pakistan. 1.3.2 Similarly the provision of health care facilities is also regulated at the provincial level as evidenced by the provincial laws detailed above. 1 4 Safe Blood Transfusion Laws 1.4.1 In addition to the Safe Blood Transfusion Laws earlier mentioned, there are also similar laws governing the transfusion of blood and blood products in the province of Punjab and in the capital territory of Islamabad, namely the Punjab Transfusion of Safe Blood Act 1999 and the Islamabad Transfusion of Safe Blood Act, 2002. LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT 155 1.4.2 The Transfusion of Safe Blood Act provides for the establishment of the Blood Transfusion Authority which is responsible for the monitoring for the safe blood transfusion practices in its relevant provincial jurisdiction, however the implementation or otherwise of the Transfusion of Safe Blood Ordinance remains dependent on the particular approach of the Blood Transfusion Authority in each province, which can also be measured by the number of cases of HIV transmission through blood transfusion reported in each province. 1 5 Disabled Person (Employment and Rehabilitation) Ordinance, 1981 1.5.1 While the DPO has been promulgated in 1981 and could have been relied upon by the PLHIV for purpose of seeking employment however no such reliance has been reported. 1.5.2 The definition of \u201cdisabled person\u201d as provided in DPO is broadly drafted and includes a person who is unable to undertake gainful employment in order to earn his livelihood on account of disease; and can be interpreted to include PLHIV.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26c9fd48-225b-42c2-a523-1316b667ac8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "26c9fd48-225b-42c2-a523-1316b667ac8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2a3321afb1d280f114ef35eb031f55513d368b77735e0790a0a8ac992c80279"}, "2": {"node_id": "f2e63ffa-753e-4717-abfd-db4c31cebe50", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d5bfe250e346be6df062a617269b7fabecb6adbc59d54873661aa202e869760"}}, "hash": "3fde3d27cce2f75df3534b5b097418825bb43e4d1470e1536e54b5561bdf4339", "text": "1.5.3 Accordingly, PLHIV can take benefit of the 1% quota provided in the DPO law to seek employment, in the provinces where there is no HIV Law.

This would ensure that at no point in time would the confidentiality be breached and the PLHIV be faced with discrimination and stigmatization. 1.5.5 Another amendment that may be incorporated in the DPO would be to include provisions with regard to discrimination. These amendments can be general and non HIV specific in nature; but would ensure protection to the PLHIV. 1 6 HIV Prevention and Treatment Bill 1.6.1 With regard to the provisions on routine testing and / or diagnostic testing, while the intent of this provision may have been that such testing is prohibited without consent, however as currently drafted Section 13(1) only provides that \u201cNo person shall be required to be HIV screened for routine testing or diagnostic testing purposes by any public or private health care facility\u201d. It would be more appropriate to insert \u201cwithout his / her consent\u201d at the end of this sub-section. 1 7 HIV Safety Bill 1.7.1 Certain ambiguities exist in the provisions of Section 3. It is not clear as to what is meant by \u201cscreening of HIV shall also be included in blood screening\u201d. Is the intent of this provision that whenever blood screening conducted at any blood laboratory than screening of HIV shall be conducted throughout the Capital Territory of Islamabad, with or without consent of the patient. Furthermore this Section 3(2) provides 156 LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT that HIV tests can be undertaken by a \u201cprimary health care giver, nurse, attendants, paramedics involved in care of patient\u201d. This sub-section also requires further review in order to ensure that only facilities that have the requisite expertise should be permitted to carry out the HIV tests. 1.7.2 The provisions of Section 3(3) appear to be discriminatory in nature and should only be restricted to the person that can prove that he / she has contracted the disease from association with a person who has AIDS / HIV and negligently associated with such other person and / or voluntarily failed to disclose such fact. Although this Section provides that a Court, Public Prosecutor or a Physician may request HIV tests and than goes on to state that the results shall be informed to such person in the strictest of confidentiality, however, given the discriminatory treatment faced by HIV patients in Pakistan and further provided that Court records are public in nature, there should be (a) an exception for such results to not form part of the public records of the Courts; and (b) all individuals asking for such records to sign a confidentiality undertaking and a penalty for breach of such confidentiality undertaking. 1.7.3 The interpretation of Section 8 could result in ambiguities and this Section needs further clarity, specially since this Section pertains to disclosure and deals with exceptions to the confidentiality provisions contained in Section 7. It is not clear as to who would determine whether \u201cpublic safety is at risk\u201d and additionally no parametres or defining modes have been provided for either \u201crisk to public safety\u201d or for \u201c control surveillance of the disease\u201d and in such case the exceptions to disclosure contained in this Section are open to interpretation. 1.7.4 Section 9 does not take into account the breach of confidence by medical practitioners or people working in hospitals and breach of confidence by members of law enforcement agencies; there should be a special provisions for those. 1.7.5 Section 10 does not detail the fine or the imprisonments. 1 8 Control of Narcotic Substances Act 1.8.1 In terms of the CNSA, any person found in possession of a narcotic drug would be subject to the punishments that are set out in Section 9 of the CNSA, which range from an imprisonment for a term of two (2) years for possession of 100 gms or less of a narcotic drug / psychotropic or controlled substance (\u201ccontraband\u201d); to death penalty or life imprisonment or imprisonment that may extend to fourteen years and a fine that may extend to PKR 1,000,000 in case of possession of contraband exceeding 1 kg. 1.8.2 Section 9 does not differentiate between a person trafficking contraband and a person in possession of the contraband for personal use.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed9c513e-a649-4dcb-befb-42717b6f42bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed9c513e-a649-4dcb-befb-42717b6f42bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0d3677dc2b117a966a7df40c9a0a91ff6a4d16ce59c22db6b6ab6a17def1441"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ab09f24-2dfa-47c3-ae4c-b8acd3ba09c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6dabaa82a9432bf639b014d3a23c91d8195b6974776d2c163b01bdad0c0257c0"}}, "hash": "89b5e361df7cd7e98bdb4296dc4364b1129bd37ecb0cfe8be73221d6a9e33076", "text": "The purpose why the distinction between trafficking and possession is relevant would be for the reason that a person who possesses contraband for personal use, could be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10cc80f6-dfe8-468c-aafb-3b75e6d25693": {"__data__": {"id_": "10cc80f6-dfe8-468c-aafb-3b75e6d25693", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d648436315cdd29a88d52c79bb5ea91b095319c6eeabeda8d6846bafbddc7b7b"}, "3": {"node_id": "73850701-b828-44b3-b29e-218a8c4e9d4c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7ed04cee857b1a5d6031885019db3b43a57a8ced52f69e95948608404696cb3"}}, "hash": "b9571ebe3e33905eebe88ca3d35dc53d43ac0c473b035da0b2f71130f9a582eb", "text": "classified as an addict and therefore the welfare of such a person should be the responsibility of the State.

In view of the same, it would appear that treatment would not be provided free of cost and in such case what avenue for rehabilitation and treatment would be available for the street based addicts who do not have the financial means for such treatment. Clarity is required in relation to this Rule. Would the Provincial Government be responsible for such treatment. 1 10 Sindh Disposable Syringes Act 1.10.1 No particular authority has been prescribed for the purpose of monitoring and checking whether disposable syringes other than \u201cauto lock, auto destruct or auto break syringes which are automatically destroyed locked or broken and cannot be used for second time\u201d are being used in Sindh. 1.10.2 Additionally the Sindh Disposable Syringes Act does not restrict the import into Sindh of disposable syringes that do not fall within the category of auto lock, auto destruct or auto break syringes which are automatically destroyed locked or broken and cannot be used for second time; as a consequence such syringes could well be imported into Sindh and could be used in the black market. 1.10.3 It would also be appropriate to seek an amendment in the Customs Schedule to ensure that any syringe that is does not fall within the category of \u201cauto lock, auto destruct or auto break syringes which are automatically destroyed locked or broken and cannot be used for second time\u201d should be included in the list of contraband items. 1 11 Vagrancy Laws 1.11.1 The Vagrancy laws of Pakistan are a prime example as to why new generation laws are required in Pakistan. 158 LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT 1.11.2 The Punjab Vagrancy Ordinance is actually the West Pakistan Vagrancy Ordinance, 1958 that is applicable to all provinces of Pakistan and has effect not only in Punjab but also in Balochistan and KPK. 1.11.3 It was subsequently amended in 2001 by Balochistan and Punjab to amend Sections 6 and 21, however these were administrative amendments. 1.11.4 The Vagrancy Law refers to medical examination of vagrants by the Manager under Section 5 for the purpose of determining their gender and ascertaining whether they are \u201clepers\u201d, suffering from a contagious disease, insane or medically deficient and the general state of health and bodily condition of the vagrant. This section does not refer to any informed consent from the alleged vagrant prior to such examination. 1.11.5 The sentence for vagrancy is imprisonment that can extend to three (3) years under the West Pakistan Vagrancy Law, which includes the Punjab Law and a period not exceeding one (1) month and for subsequent punishments not exceeding six (6) months under the Karachi Vagrancy Law. 1.11.6 Although the vagrancy laws may have been used at the time they were promulgated for the purpose of penalizing criminal / \u201cvagrant\u201d elements in the society, however in the current scenario they could well be used to the detriment of the KAPs, specially the IDUs and the street children.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73850701-b828-44b3-b29e-218a8c4e9d4c": {"__data__": {"id_": "73850701-b828-44b3-b29e-218a8c4e9d4c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d648436315cdd29a88d52c79bb5ea91b095319c6eeabeda8d6846bafbddc7b7b"}, "2": {"node_id": "10cc80f6-dfe8-468c-aafb-3b75e6d25693", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9571ebe3e33905eebe88ca3d35dc53d43ac0c473b035da0b2f71130f9a582eb"}}, "hash": "e7ed04cee857b1a5d6031885019db3b43a57a8ced52f69e95948608404696cb3", "text": "1.11.7 It may also be taken into account that penalties under Section 269 and Section 270 which pertain to spread of infectious diseases dangerous to life, carry a sentence of that may extend to six (6) months and two (2) years, respectively, yet under the West Pakistan Vagrancy Ordinance, 1958 and the Punjab Vagrancy Ordinance, 1958, a person could well be punished with imprisonment for a period not exceeding", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f31a17f-3268-470c-9ffb-6d6526fef1dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f31a17f-3268-470c-9ffb-6d6526fef1dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5db0085ace57d12020d64cf2aec3fee26fbd8042d3f9d2227ac8c1df780a7d81"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e702061-5a48-41b8-978c-0a27bac63821", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c68e118c7f1bbbadf4c5d528ee5f1a66cab58cc8f634c85e3617e2e2052ac63"}}, "hash": "1d8cd634890906643d2a6149277cb3156dcdc4e54b61ce5bd1dcd821d09cf202", "text": "three (3) years. 1 12 Child Marriage Restraint Act 1.12.1 Although there continues to be a strong movement for amendment in the CMRA for amending the definition of child as provided therein; so that whether male or female a child would be a person who is below the age of eighteen. 1.12.2 Despite the suggested amendments to the CMRA, the problem with the CMRA remains that in most cases of child marriage, the age of majority for a female is determined on the basis of the Hudood Ordinance, which defines the same to be the age of puberty; and on such basis even the marriage of a child under the age of sixteen can stand solemnized, notwithstanding the CMRA. 1.12.3 The amendments and modifications that should be suggested to the CMRA should be disengaging the CMRA from any other law for the purpose of determining the age of the contracting parties to the marriage. This can however, only be undertaken once awareness has been created among all sectors of the society with respect to the ills of child marriage; including the religious scholars and the community at large. 1.12.4 Additionally, child marriages are not reported as the same are considered as acceptable practice in the communities with a high incidence of child marriage. LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT 159 Accordingly either there should be a surveillance mechanism that monitors and reports on the occurrence of child marriages at district level or there should be wide level awareness campaigns that would ensure that such communities would report all incidents of child marriage. 1.12.5 The punishments prescribed by the CMRA are simple imprisonment and a fine of PKR 1,000, irrespective of the offence committed i.e.; whether the offence is under Section 4, namely, child marriage by a male adult above 18 years of age; or under Section 5, being the solemnization of a child; or under Section 6 allowing a child marriage by the parents of guardians. Notwithstanding that Pakistan law recognizes neither statutory rape nor marital rape, however given the severity of the offences dealt with under Section 4, 5 and 6 it would have been appropriate that, firstly the sentences would differ in severity; and secondly, that all three punishments / penalties would have been updated in accordance with the changing times. 1 13 Suppression of Prostitution Ordinance 1.13.1 The Suppression of Prostitution Ordinance is a legislation that appears to have been drafted for penalizing and discouraging prostitution in the 1960\u2019s but thereafter has remained unused and forgotten. 1.13.2 This is the only law that contains such detailed provisions for penalizing actions that may result in exploitation of women, however over time this law has neither been updated nor has it been relied upon. A review and modification of this law in order to update the same will greatly benefit the FSWs. 1.13.3 Certain provisions contained in the Suppression of Prostitution Ordinance are specially worth nothing, are the penalties prescribed for the following: (a) anyone above the age of 18 who lives off the earnings of another\u2019s prostitution whether with or without such person\u2019s consent; (b) anyone who is proved to have coerced or influenced the movements of a prostitute in a manner that show that he has aided or abetted or compelled or exploited her for prostitution with any other person or keeps or manages or assists in the management of a brothel; (c) causing, encouraging or abetting the seduction or prostitution of a girl under 16 years; (d) procuring, enticing or leading away a woman or a girl, or attempting to do the same for the purpose of prostitution; (e) bringing or attempting to bring into the province a girl for the purpose of prostitution. (f) The PPC in Sections 371A and 371B prescribes the punishment for selling and buying a woman for the purpose of prostitution; and the punishment as prescribed by the PPC, being imprisonment that may extend to twenty- five (25) years is more severe than the one prescribed by the Suppression of Prostitution Ordinance. (g) Similarly the PPC also prescribes a more severe punishment for procurement of a minor girl under Section 366A, being imprisonment for a term that may extend to tent (10) years.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e702061-5a48-41b8-978c-0a27bac63821": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e702061-5a48-41b8-978c-0a27bac63821", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5db0085ace57d12020d64cf2aec3fee26fbd8042d3f9d2227ac8c1df780a7d81"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f31a17f-3268-470c-9ffb-6d6526fef1dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d8cd634890906643d2a6149277cb3156dcdc4e54b61ce5bd1dcd821d09cf202"}}, "hash": "4c68e118c7f1bbbadf4c5d528ee5f1a66cab58cc8f634c85e3617e2e2052ac63", "text": "160 LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of the PPC, it would be more beneficial as a whole, if the punishments in the Suppression of Prostitution Ordinance are rationalized and matched to the ones prescribed in the PPC and the Suppression of Prostitution Ordinance is accordingly revisited, reviewed, revised and duly implemented in all provinces. 1 14 Human Trafficking Ordinance 1.14.1 The Human Trafficking Ordinance does", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ed83258-0e48-4fb8-b8eb-75622625b7fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ed83258-0e48-4fb8-b8eb-75622625b7fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "abbd6e8daccd947a3d97777059d9adfe70f465327b07df3756c4fc502564b0ec"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a0064fc-8834-4916-87c6-3b45a8bc637a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f5e25246c9b951ab52d3ab489aa3969eec4433f93158ad92783109d8fe1da69"}}, "hash": "7596555ead514a1462d79c41c1f51836142615f138a9c561616b57912b54a234", "text": "not deal with human trafficking within the boundaries of Pakistan and only pertains to human trafficking \u201cout of or into Pakistan\u201d.

This would mean that a marriage of a minor has been solemnized by the parents of such minor in contravention of the provisions of the Restraint of Child LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT 161 Marriage Act, and the Court is allowing the placement of such minor in the custody of her husband, despite the fact that such marriage was in contravention of the provisions of law. 1.16.2 Section 21 not only refers to the marriage of two minors but also to children of minors. 1.16.3 The law of Guardian and Wards also needs to reviewed and updated, as the pecuniary punishments prescribed hereunder do not reflect the current financial values;

This is a confusing and convoluted opening statement for the guiding principles, in fact it is bordering on a factually incorrect statement, for while gender relationships might determine the \u201ctransmission\u201d (and not \u201cacquisition\u201d) of HIV, but it is more sexual relationship based. This opening statements sets the tone for the entire HIV/AIDS Policy. While as a statement of existing facts this would not have been a cause of concern, however the connection of all future programmes and services (as stated further in the first guiding principle) that will devise and implement strategies 162 LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT that address gender norms and relations should be a cause for concern; since it completely ignores that the future programmes and services should be devised and implemented on the basis of the key modes of transmission as evidenced and recorded in the monitoring, evaluation and surveillance conducted by the national and provincial programmes. 2.2.2 While addressing the prevention and care needs of women and girls is appreciated however, the national surveillance reports provide that HIV prevalence among FSWs being the only female category included in the Key Affected Population, is at the lowest, out of all the \u201cpopulations most at risk\u201d. Additionally, as no data of the female population comprised in the bridging population is available therefore for the purpose of discussing the prevention and care needs of the female KAPs only the FSWs are taken into account. 2.2.3 The prevention and care needs of the highest risk group being the IDUs have not received a special mention in the HIV/AIDS Policy and specially the HIV/AIDS Policy does not take into account or mention the likelihood of intersectional IDU / FSW interaction that may result in a higher prevalence rate among the FSWs. 2 3 3rd Guiding Principle 2.3.1 If a PLHIV is a citizen of Pakistan than such a PLHIV does indeed should have the same rights as all other citizens of Pakistan and by law cannot be discriminated against, on the basis of health status, gender, socio-economic status or HIV risk factor. In the event discrimination does indeed exist, than firstly the HIV/AIDS Policy needs to provide measures for the identification of each sector in which such discrimination exists and thereafter provide stringent measures for the elimination of such discrimination, whether by legislation, policy or programmes. 2 4 6th Guiding Principle 2.4.1 The statement that approaches to HIV and AIDS shall be consistent with Pakistan\u2019s religious and cultural values is paradoxical in nature and would have resulted in disputes at the time of interpretation; when approaches to HIV and AIDS could have been viewed as opposed to Pakistan\u2019s religious and cultural values. 2 5 National HIV/AIDS Commission 2.5.1 As the HIV/AIDS Policy dates back to the pre-18th Amendment period therefore the reference to the National AIDS Commission is relevant. However, in view of the 18th Amendment there should be HIV/AIDS Commission on the Provincial level in each of the four (4) provinces and a National HIV/AIDS Commission at the national level. 2.5.2 The National HIV/AIDS Commission should comprise of representatives from each of the Provincial Commissions and stake holders at the national level. 2.5.3 The HIV/AIDS Policy does not set out the role of the AIDS Commission and considering that the HIV/AIDS Policy is the national policy in relation to HIV and is establishing the Commission therefore it should have clearly set out what the role of LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT 163 the Commission was, in order to avoid further conflict and discrepancies. Additionally, it merely sets out that the Comission will be headed by the Chairman of the Senate without devising the role of the head of the Commission either. 2 6 Priority Focus Areas 2.6.1 While the HIV/AIDS Policy states that there should be no discrimination against PLHIV and KAPs, yet it discriminates against them itself, by failing to correctly identify the most at risk populations and the vulnerable populations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae38ab8d-3dca-451a-af65-88628c1e43b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae38ab8d-3dca-451a-af65-88628c1e43b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "057f702f89eacf543a1f75ca82eecfe9b9d034b83574825f3fe2d54ed6f5a403"}, "2": {"node_id": "6f426ba3-8f7a-4fe2-b09b-3b5a91108422", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64b10e906e543e3c0c7f65c087130567870b4097a128333ba2b5adcbb9808dc2"}}, "hash": "bb4eccf03f39ea99aa7e559222116c9ee8e87639ec3e9a449e7b579d157db1d5", "text": "2.6.2 The National AIDS Control Programme has conducted several surveillance rounds in Pakistan which include mapping exercises of the most-at-risk populations, and the results of such exercises have clearly identified the most at risk populations as the (a) Injecting Drug Users;

(b) the inconvenience of (i) traveling from far flung areas of the province to the main cities where the testing and counseling facilities are available, which includes not only a cost element but also a time and inconvenience factor; and (ii) distant parts of the city to various locations within the city where the testing and the other facilities are located. However, none of the above have been addressed in the HIV/AIDS Policy and no measures have been suggested to resolve the above referred issues. 2 8 Establishing a Supportive Legislative and Policy Framework 2.8.1 As mentioned above, the majority of the PLHIV and the KAPs comprise of individuals that are engaged in activities that are considered to be in violation of various laws of Pakistan.

LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT 165 3 NARCOTICS POLICIES 3 1 CNSA 3.1.1 Pursuant to the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, the possession of contraband constitutes an offence and accordingly addicts are liable to be sentenced in accordance with the terms of the CNSA, unless the Narcotics Policy makes special qualifications for the rehabilitation of the addicts; which would then required to be reflected appropriately in the legislative framework. 3 2 Prisons and Contraband 3.2.1 The practical and realistic picture is that upon being sentenced and imprisoned all addicts continue to receive contrabands in the prisons in Pakistan. The Narcotics Policies do not adequately address this issue nor do they provide effective measures for overhauling the supply chain mechanism. 3.2.2 The practice in most provinces appears to be for all IDUs that are sentenced to be transferred to one prison facility, and as a consequence such facility becomes the main source for not only contraband but also of HIV infections. This is not only evidenced by the large number of HIV infections that are reported in particular prison facilities in each province, but has also been confirmed by the PLHIV that were interviewed during the course of the research. A news item confirming \u201cEight Adiala Jail inmates test HIV positive\u201d28 appearing in today\u2019s paper also bears witness to this situation. 3.2.3 The above should be adequately covered in the Narcotics policies as the same is an inherent HIV risk and a necessary prevention and control measure. 3.2.4 In addition to the Narcotics Policies there should be an IDU policy that pertains specifically to the IDUs and the policies that are to be undertaken with regard to the protection and welfare of the IDUs and the IDUs should not be categorized as part of the Narcotics policy; primarily due to the fact that by framing of a separate and distinct policy for the users of contraband / IDUs the State would be acknowledging its responsibilities towards the addicts and IDUs; and the addicts and IDUs would / should be invested with rights as a consequence of the drafting of such a policy. 4 BROAD OVERVIEW OF THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK 4 1 Health Laws 4.1.1 While laws in the health sector have been updated and new laws have been promulgated / enacted however the effectiveness of such laws remains dependent on the particular agency / authority responsible for their implementation; and accordingly the effectiveness of such laws differs from province to province. 28 The Express Tribune- May 30, 2013. 166 LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT 4 2 Relevant Laws 4.2.1 The promulgation of the Sindh HIV Law is the only law pertinent to HIV in Pakistan and to the issues of PLHIV. While the Disabled Person (Employment and Rehabilitation) Ordinance, 1981 is available in other provinces for the purpose of seeking employment benefits and training, yet it remains to be seen whether reliance on such law would prove beneficial for the PLHIV, given the sensitivity of the confidentiality requirements and the stigmatization and the discrimination element. 4.2.2 The Suppression of Prostitution Ordinance, a law promulgated for the purpose of suppressing prostitution, contains several provisions that can be utilized for the purpose of better safeguarding the rights of FSW and if re-enacted with due rationalization then it may be relied upon for better protecting the rights of a larger group of KAPs. 4 3 Welfare 4.3.1 Pakistan is a welfare state and the legislative framework for such a welfare state is available; as evidenced by laws such as the Minimum Wages for Unskilled Workers Ordinance, 1969, Workers Children (Education) Ordinance, 1929, Maternity Benefits Ordinance, 1958.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS \u2013 KAPs 169 appears to be truer for Pakistan than one would expect, however from the Pakistan perspective prostitution appears to be a combined result of a glaring social and economic disparity and the prevalent yet latent and unacknowledged promiscuity in the society. 3.1.2 While in the course of study and research on FSWs in Pakistan, they have been divided into the following broad categories on the basis of their mode of operating, into, (a) Street based; (b) Home based; (c) KK based and (d) Brothel based; however for the purpose of better understanding the difficulties being faced by them, it would be pertinent to divide them laterally into (a) Need Based; (b) Familial Choice/Force; (c) Choice By Birth; and (d) By Choice. (a) Need Based: being those FSWs, that were pursuing lives other than as FSWs however due to a great economic crisis or need they had to turn towards sex- work. They are generally married and with children and although they do not have any other specific skill set but are keen to develop any other skill in order to earn a living. The Need Based category cuts across both the Street Based and the Home Based category. (b) The Familial Choice/Force category is one where the FSWs are forced and / or coerced into sex work by their families, which could be the parents (either or both), brothers or uncles and includes the sale of the women/ girls to the handlers who then marry them for the purpose of giving a sense of respectability in the event of apprehension by the law enforcement agencies. (c) In certain situations where the girls are born into a community of FSWs they consider sex work to be their inherited profession of their mothers and in such situations due to the lack of opportunities they continue in the same profession.

Chapter 22 SECTORAL PARTNERS 1 NGOS 1 1 FSWs and NGOs 1.1.1 During the course of our research we faced considerable difficulty in identifying NGOs working with FSWs in Karachi; and upon establishing contact with the FSWs, this was also confirmed by FSWs. The FSWs of Group 1 reported that despite the fact that they have established a CBO yet they have not been received any guidance and / or any assistance from any governmental and / or developmental quarter; and there is no other NGO / CBO that is working with FSWs in Karachi; except for one NGO that is engaged with FSWs in a particular area of Karachi. 1.1.2 Group 1 FSWs were of the view that a FSW CBO would be best able to understand the on ground issues and problems of FSWs and access the FSWs for service delivery purposes; however they felt handicapped in accessing the donor agencies and the developmental institutions due to their lack of literacy and computer skills. 1.1.3 A similar situation was reported by the NGO the Walled City in Lahore, which as per their say so, was also unable to access donor agencies and developmental institutions due to their lack of literacy skills and inability to prepare reports and compile statistical data. 1.1.4 While the NGO in Lahore working outside of the Walled City is reported to have accessed over 9500 FSWs, however the homebased FSWs that formed part of our research were unaware of such NGO and had expressed a need for a DIC for FSWs. 1 2 Knowledge Base 1.2.1 All NGOs that formed part of the research were providing information with regard to health, STIs and HIV and there did not appear to be any organization that was working in Karachi, Lahore or Islamabad that worked towards creating legal SECTORAL PARTNERS 171 awareness with regard to an individuals rights in society or the corresponding obligations. 1.2.2 This is illustrated by two particular instances: firstly, with regard to the awareness of rights; in all three cities the outreach workers of the NGOs working with MSM/ MSWs reported being harassed by the law enforcement agencies for possession of condoms in bulk; despite the fact that there is no law which describes / defines the same as an offence and every individual has the right to have on his person any such thing which is not forbidden by the law of the land and / or deemed to be a contraband. Secondly with regard to the obligations, while discussing CSA, a MSW narrated that one of his clients was renting his apartment for the purpose of introducing young boys into the sex trade; but the MSW in question did not feel any obligation the boys, despite the fact that they were minors. These two incidents underline the fact that there is a requirement for creating an awareness of rights and obligations. 1.2.3 The international conventions that the Pakistan is a State Party to would have little significance unless its citizens understand the import of the provisions of such conventions and start reflecting the same in their lives. 1 3 KAP Research Models 1.3.1 Due to the number of researches that are conducted by the numerous agencies, authorities and the media that require KAP participation, not just on HIV but also on the lifestyle, shortcomings and difficulties in lives of the KAPs, that these interviews and research seem to be a means of livelihood and there are specific rates for each KAP community that is being interviewed. 1.3.2 It may be worthwhile for the KAPs to consider establishing an association, either at a provincial level that would regulate such interviews and would also be the lobbying point for their rights and for legislative and policy amendments. 2 BLOOD BANKS 2 1 Deficiencies 2.1.1 As part of the field research, interviews were also conducted with the head of an eminent blood bank in Karachi;

One such instance which was recently reported in the press, involved an individual who claimed to be an AIDS patient and abducted, raped and killed young women, as an alleged cure for AIDS, and allegedly prescribed to him by a local medicine man. This was the only reported incident of its kind, that involved murder of innocent women for the sake of curing HIV and therefore formed part of our research for this study. 3.1.2 The facts of the case, as detailed by the Capital City Police, Islamabad (\u201cIslamabad Police\u201d)32 were that in February 2013, a man was arrested in the Bhara Kahu area of Islamabad, for raping and murdering an 11 year old girl, with the help of his female accomplice. During the investigation the accused claimed that he had AIDS and was abducting and raping women and young girls with the help of his accomplice to cure his ailment. The couple also confessed to the rape and murder of a 9 year old and the unsolved murder of a 22 year old daughter of a police officer in Bhara Kahu in November 2012. Additionally the accused also confessed to the murder and rape of a girl in Lala Musa. The accomplice in the current case was released on a bail before arrest order from the court33. 3 2 Meeting with the Islamabad Police 3.2.1 In order to further investigate the above-referred matter, we had a meeting with the Assistant Inspector General of Capital City Police, Islamabad and it was confirmed by the Islamabad Police that the accused was not HIV positive and / or suffering from AIDS and had mentioned HIV in order to mislead the police, although no reference to screening of the accused was made with regard to the basis of such confirmation. The accused had also committed similar offence with two (2) women in Lahore but in both those instances there had been no reference to HIV; and the reference to HIV had only been made in relation to the offences committed in Islamabad. 3.2.2 Certain suggestions were made by Islamabad Police with regard to the current HIV situation in Pakistan, being, (a) regular HIV screenings should be conducted at all military cadet academies and police academies; and (b) at the time of issuance of heavy vehicle licenses to truckers and long route bus drivers and at the time of renewal of the heavy vehicle licenses to truckers and long route bus drivers; there should be an opportunity for HIV screening with informed consent and HIV awareness programmes should be arranged accessible by such license holders. 32 We met with the Assistant Inspector General of Capital City Police, Islamabad on May 17, 2013 in Islamabad. 33 \u201cVirgin Cure: Three women killed to \u2018cure\u2019 AIDS\u201d : The Express Tribune, published February 28, 2013 176 SHORT TERM RECOMMENDATIONS Chapter 23 SHORT TERM RECOMMENDATIONS 1 LEGISLATION 1 1 Law Review Committees 1.1.1 Law Review Committees should be formed in each province, directly responsible to the Minister for Law in each province; with private sector membership, including a member of the judiciary either retired or current, funded by a developmental agency. 2 SENSITIzATION CAMPAIGNS 2 1 Law Enforcement 2.1.1 In view of the fact that all KAPs have reported wide spread discrimination and harassment by the law enforcement agencies, it appears that it is imperative that sensitization campaigns be organized at a mass scale for the law enforcement agencies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c25dd228-4ba6-4032-91ef-c5c4a1e1b7b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "c25dd228-4ba6-4032-91ef-c5c4a1e1b7b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a38bd1dd41bea507def1e69e7271ea8cdb7598949a7e0f3b63e1ee89e37f2aba"}, "2": {"node_id": "019db070-857c-4109-969b-171f2bbae307", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a0c262062a742cea50cac7ddf37c1b5b73d5cd3b466d616291ee393ed3ecce7"}}, "hash": "abe2ca6a20907ef8e34827f8b247bc0fa9a3738e7aa9e40123727f189a06946b", "text": "2.1.2 However given the deep rooted taboo and stigmatization attached to both the professions (law enforcement as well as the sex workers) the sensitization campaigns will need to be well organized and thought out. 3 MEDIA CAMPAIGNS 3 1 HIV Awareness 3.1.1 Awareness of HIV among the community at large is at a low scale.

First and foremost, we would like to thank the community members who willingly gave their time to share their personal details with us. They did this without payment and with a great amount of trust. A community-based project such as this could never have happened without such strong support and enthusiasm for the project from men who have sex with men, gays, bisexuals and transgender people in and around Suva, Nadi and Lautoka. We especially thank the community contributors who were involved in the initial development of the project: Jone Volau, Maurice Kingdon, Nicholas Mitchell, Noa Targuci (Jnr) and Sakiusa Taleaua. We\u2019d like to extend our gratitude to Jane Keith-Reid, director of the AIDS Task Force of Fiji, whose vision, unwavering support, mentoring and belief in us made this community-owned and -driven research project possible. To Ferdinand Strobel and Garry Wiseman of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Edmund Settle of the UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre in Bangkok, we thank you for providing the initial funds, funding the consultant\u2019s visits to Fiji, and generally supporting the project. We would like to thank Stephen Scott, formerly the International Projects officer at ACON (the AIDS Council of New South Wales, Australia), who assisted this project at its hour of need and enabled the partnership to form between ACON and the AIDS Task Force of Fiji. To ACON more generally, we are grateful for this partnership and the support provided. To Dr. Josaia Samuela, Ministry of Health, Suva, Fiji, we are grateful for your support. Our special thanks to Marlene Dutta, our external Financial Consultant, for providing administrative support for the project. Finally, to the members of the HIV Epidemiology and Prevention Program at the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity in Society (formerly the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research) at the University of New South Wales, many thanks for your words of advice and encouragement. cOntentS GlOSSARy OF TERMS AND ACRONyMS 6 ExECuTIVE SuMMARy 7 1.

It aims to inform the public health response to HIV and sexual health among MSM and Tg in Fiji and assist in the development of community-based activities. The research was community-based and the survey data were collected by MSM and Tg community research assistants. desIgn of the study A total of 212 MSM and Tg participated in an interviewer-administered questionnaire (response rate: 89.6%) and 25 MSM and Tg participated in qualitative focus group discussions. The questionnaire was based on similar studies conducted internationally and the focus group discussions further explored relevant topics. The project did not merely consult with members of the researched population. Rather, MSM and Tg community members of various ethnic backgrounds were involved in every stage of the research process, including initiation of the study, planning and study design, data collection, data entry, data analysis, and reporting. This project represents an effective and fruitful example of international networking between MSM/gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (gLBT) organisations. The project involved staff members and volunteers from the AIDS Task Force of Fiji\u2019s Amithi Project based in Suva, Fiji and the AIDS Council of New South Wales (ACON) based in Sydney, Australia. the respondents The", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c31de09-9f1e-4f72-840f-56e11de6103b": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c31de09-9f1e-4f72-840f-56e11de6103b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Secret Lives, Other Voices...: A community-based study exploring male-to-male sex, gender identity and HIV transmission risk in Fiji", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87b357bcf8283a62a0edcfdc4201b132be92560583952365bb98559a7410bfd7"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc3f7e01-dbf4-4931-95a0-bd980a99b78a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "41c76de448ed63bdd60706c54ee1ee31be589fb963bc087a8bd891d1addb44ca"}}, "hash": "d6bdb1207275ff92134a0e189938c91bb1f859cc023fcb0733c8872880638847", "text": "sample consisted of a diverse group of 212 MSM and Tg. Respondents ranged in age from 18 to 51 years and the median age was 25.5. Approximately half lived in the greater Suva Area and the other half in the western locations of Lautoka and Nadi. Fijians made up 38.6% of the sample, Indo-Fijians made up 50.0%, and people of \u201cother\u201d ethnicities made up the remainder. One-third of the respondents had completed high school, and over half (56.0%) went on to some form of further study. 8.1% of the respondents reported having had no formal education at all. Over half of the respondents were Christian, nearly one- third was Hindu, and 13.2% were Muslim. The majority of the respondents were working (70.5%) and nearly one in five were studying. just fewer than 10% were not working or studying. The majority of respondents had never been married (79.1%), while 16.5% had ever been married to a woman. sexual and gender IdentIty and gender expressIon gender and sexual identity terms are used in complex and inconsistent ways by MSM and Tg in Fiji. Although the terms used are often the same as in other countries, the meanings can be quite different. The respondents were asked to self-identify their sexuality and gender. These were put together to create four categories: 32.4% of the respondents were straight-identified men, 14.8% were bisexuals, 19.5% were gays, and 33.3% were transgenders. Respondents expressed their masculinity and femininity to varying degrees. In terms of dress and gender expression, straight men were exclusively masculine, bisexuals were more masculine than feminine, gays were both masculine and feminine, and Tgs were more feminine than masculine. The majority of Tgs dressed with a mixture of how men and women usually dress. A significant finding was that \u201cglobalised\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d sexual/gender identities exist in Fiji simultaneously. Some MSM and Tg identify with more international understandings of terms like \u201cgay\u201d, while others have more \u201clocal\u201d understandings that are in line with traditional ways of understanding sexuality and gender. These groups often have difficulties in understanding and relating to each other. This finding has implications for policy and health promotion practice. An important difference between \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cglobalised\u201d identities was in terms of attitudes towards relationships. Those with \u201clocal\u201d identities were more likely to focus less on long-term relationships, and their relationships were more likely to correspond to traditional notions of gender with the straight-identifying partner acting as the \u201cman\u201d and the gay/Tg partner as the \u201cwoman\u201d. This potentially indicated specific vulnerabilities relating to MSM and Tg expressing their gender in more typically feminine ways. The differences in gender/sexual identities also meant that the idea of some kind of unified MSM/Tg or gLBT community may be problematic. However, there was general agreement that many MSM and Tg do not want a \u201csegregated\u201d gay community to emerge in Fiji, but would prefer to remain integrated with the broader mainstream community. sexual attractIon Overall, 62.7% of the respondents were attracted to men, 46.7% to gays, 25.0% to transgenders and 42.0% to women. Straight men were most attracted to women, followed by gays and Tgs, but were generally not attracted to other straight men. Bisexuals showed the most diversity in their attractions. Virtually all gays and Tgs were attracted to straight men, a smaller percentage was attracted to other gays, and none were attracted to women. It appears that straight men do not view as bisexuals, gays and transgenders as \u201cmen\u201d, allowing them to engage in sexual behaviour with other biological males without challenging their 8 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... heterosexual gender identity. yet it must be remembered that these sexuality/gender categories are fluid and flexible. sexual partners Overall, 48.1% of respondents had ever had sex with women and 51.9% had not.

The data indicated that across the whole sample, anal sex was extremely common; 98.1% of the respondents had engaged in anal sex in the previous six months. Straight males mostly took the insertive role only in anal sex (91.2%), transgenders generally took the receptive role only (80%). The gay respondents were either receptive only or versatile, while bisexuals were more likely to be versatile (61.3%) or insertive only (22.6%). It appears that group sex may be common among MSM and Tg in Fiji. condoM use This research presents something of a mixed picture of condom use among MSM and Tg in Fiji. On one hand, the rates of condom use are perhaps not as low as expected, but there is certainly room for improvement. For those who had had anal sex with any MSM or Tg partners, 21.6% always used condoms and 57.7% sometimes used condoms. When having sex with straight male partners, 14.8% of the respondents always used condoms, while one-third always used condoms with gay or transgender partners. This highlights the potential vulnerabilities of those having sex with straight-identifying men. In urban areas, condoms are not difficult to access. The results showed that despite the high levels of knowledge regarding HIV in Fiji, many people are simply not motivated to use condoms. The patterns of drug and alcohol use the last time the respondents had sex with a condom versus the last time they had sex without a condom were essentially the same, indicating that drug and alcohol use likely does not cause risky sexual behaviour. sex work It was clear that sex in exchange for money, gifts or favours was common in this sample of MSM and Tg, with two-thirds of the respondents either paying or receiving money, gifts or favours in exchange for sex. Receiving gifts or favours for sex was the most commonly experienced. A key finding was that the term \u201cin exchange for sex\u201d is complex. For example, due to the labeling of the straight male as a \u201cboyfriend\u201d, the gay or Tg person might be unlikely to report that the financial support given to the straight partner is \u201cin exchange for sex\u201d. It was common for gays and Tgs to use alcohol to encourage straight men to have sex with them. This happened in two ways: (a) the gay/Tg person buying the straight male a lot of drinks at the bar (and the straight male often expecting to be bought drinks), and (b) the gay/Tg giving the straight male alcohol after having sex. Overall, the results demonstrated that the boundaries between \u201cordinary sex\u201d and \u201ctransactional sex\u201d are blurred. There are certain social expectations operating in Fiji whereby money and gifts are exchanged in the context of casual or regular relationships, but that this is not seen as \u201csex work\u201d. Alongside this, there also exists a more well-defined profession of sex work, where the transactional nature of the sex is explicit. hIv transMIssIon knowledge Respondents had high levels of knowledge about HIV transmission; 65.7% of respondents correctly answered all of the questions. gays and bisexuals got more answers correct than straight men and transgenders. Indo-Fijians got more answers correct than Fijians and those of \u201cother\u201d ethnicities. Respondents were uncertain about the risk of oral sex, with 24.0% answering that HIV transmission through receptive oral sex is possible, 40.2% saying it is not possible, and 35.8% answering that they were not sure. knowledge did not necessarily lead to safe sexual behaviour, and more research is needed to clarify these results. hIv testIng and sexually transMIssIble InfectIons There is certainly room for improving the rates of HIV testing among MSM and Tg in Fiji.

Stigma and discrimination based on sexuality or gender was common: 66.2% of respondents reported being talked about by others, 57.2% experienced verbal abuse and 30.3% had been physically hurt in the past six months. gays and transgenders experienced more abuse and more frequently than bisexuals and especially straight men. Overall, 26.8% of respondents reported having been forced to have sex against their will. Again, this was more often experienced by gays and transgenders: 50% of all those who had been forced to have sex were transgenders and 31% were gays. The results indicated a strong need for psychological and support services for MSM and Tg. socIal networks and coMMunIty MSM and Tg in urban Fiji are socially integrated with the broader community, as well has having networks of specifically gay and Tg friends. Straight men tended to be less connected to gay/Tg networks. There was a sense that \u201ccommunity\u201d is lacking among MSM and Tgs in Fiji. However, there are fluid social networks that can be built on for the delivery of community development programs. Participants reported many kinds of divisions among groups of MSM and Tgs in Fiji. However, the participants reported a desire to see a stronger sense of MSM and Tg community in Fiji. prograMs and servIces MSM- and Tg-specific services are limited in Fiji. The majority of respondents (approximately 67-70%) had never been approached by HIV outreach workers, or been given condoms or lubricant by outreach workers. Less than half (43.0%) could name one or more organisations working with MSM, gays or transgenders in Fiji. More gays and Tgs were able to answer this question than straight men or bisexuals. The results indicated that there is a need for more services. conclusIon and recoMMendatIons Although not necessarily representative of all MSM and Tg in Fiji, the data gathered in this research are extremely valuable in helping to understand the risk behaviour and other factors among MSM and Tg, and in enabling the development of recommendations for future HIV prevention and health promotion actions. As a community-based study, this research was very much focused on generating information to help answer the question: \u201cWhere to from here?\u201d. The recommendations include:1 1. hIV prevention and health Interventions should be culturally appropriate and targeted to different groups of MSM/Tg, and greater funding should be secured to increase the number and reach of services. 2. Clinical sexual health services Access to MSM- and Tg-friendly and competent voluntary confidential counselling and testing (VCCT) and STI services should be scaled up and health care workers should be trained on the specific health and social support needs of MSM/ Tg. 3. Strategic information Further research is needed on MSM and Tg in Fiji, involving respectful partnerships between community organisations and research institutions. 4. Stigma and discrimination It is clear that homophobia, transphobia and gender violence need to be addressed at a societal level and that mental health and support services are needed for MSM and Tg. 5. Social networks and community The study highlighted the lack of a sense of MSM and Tg community in Fiji. It is clear that strong social networks of MSM/ Tgs exist, at least among feminine gays and Tgs, but an overarching sense of community does not. It is recommended that MSM and Tg in Fiji should be supported to develop skills in community organising and to implement community activities aimed at building the MSM/Tg communities in different locations around Fiji. 1 For the full list of recommendations, please refer to page 94. 10 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... 1. intrOductiOn background Fiji is classified as a low HIV prevalence country, with an overall population HIV prevalence of 0.05%, or 333 confirmed cases up until the end of 2009 (Republic of Fiji Islands, 2010).

The five UNgASS indicators relevant to MSM and Tg were not reported in 2008 and 2010 (Republic of Fiji Islands, 2010; amfAR, 2008). There has also been very little published in the academic literature about MSM and Tg in Fiji. Indeed, a review of published materials about MSM and Tg in Asia and the Pacific in 2009-10 revealed no academic articles specifically about HIV and MSM/Tg in Fiji (UNAIDS & APCOM, 2010). It appears that the only study relating to HIV and risk behaviour among MSM and Tg in Fiji was conducted by the AIDS Task Force of Fiji (ATFF) in 1998, with the results being released in 2001 (AIDS Task Force of Fiji, 2001). ATFF is a community-based HIV organisation established in 1993. Over the years, it has conducted HIV prevention education, established a drop-in health centre in Suva, distributed condoms and lubricant, conducted sexual health testing, and provided training and support to community organisations in other Pacific countries. ATFF has had a specific project for MSM and Tg called the Amithi Project since 2006. ATFF\u2019s 1998 study involved a sample of 346 MSM and Tg in Fiji (with a further 64 questionnaires completed in Samoa and Vanuatu). It was funded by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and support was provided by the University of the South Pacific and the Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society at La Trobe University. Some of the results from ATFF\u2019s 1998 study of MSM and Tg were: \u2022\ufffd Approximately one-third of the sample had been to a sexual health clinic and slightly less than 30% had had a blood test for HIV. \u2022\ufffd Of the 49% who had insertive anal sex, 62% reported using condoms; of the 69% who engaged in receptive anal sex, 70% reported using condoms. Of the 85% who had sex with women, 57% reported using condoms. \u2022\ufffd 25% reported always practicing \u2018safe sex practices\u2019 and this decreased to 15% when intoxicated. 11% stated they never practiced safe sex, which increased to 31% when intoxicated. However, 13% of the respondents said they always used condoms, even after drinking alcohol. \u2022\ufffd Of the 88% that reported having casual sex, 12% reported always using a condom, 52% said \u2018sometimes\u2019, and 9% said \u2018never\u2019. \u2022\ufffd The respondents with 21 or more partners in the previous six months said their partners used condoms consistently. Respondents with less partners reported less consistent condom use (60% of those with 16-20 partners; and 62% of those with 11-15 partners). \u2022\ufffd Respondents met their sexual partners at clubs (36%), through friends (32%), on the street (31%), at home (25%), in cars (16%), in parks or hotels (15% each), the beach (9%), the cinema (7%), in toilets (7%), on the bus (5%) and in hostels (4%). \u2022\ufffd 20% of the respondents said they had sex with gay men, 17% with bisexual men, and 71% with \u2018straight\u2019 men. It was possible that some of these distinctions were confusing. The qualitative results indicated that the term \u2018straight men\u2019 was used for men who identified and acted in line with traditionally male gender roles. \u2022\ufffd There was a lack of understanding about the relative risks of sexual behaviours. For example, 31% did not know or did not believe that condoms could prevent HIV transmission. \u2022\ufffd A great deal of stigma and internalised homophobia was reported by respondents. given the lack of quality research data on MSM and Tg people in Fiji, ATFF decided to conduct a second community-based research study on these populations.

Community involvement implies that community members have ownership over the research project, participate and make decisions at every stage of the research process, and are seen as active co-researchers rather than passive \u2018research respondents\u2019 (Minkler, 2005). Thus, the first activity for the project was to recruit a group of gay- and Tg-identified people as the core group of research assistants and key contacts. This group of 9 people was trained in research methods and ethics, was central to the questionnaire design and approval process, and was trained in administering the questionnaire. The core group was responsible for contacting and recruiting other MSM/Tg from various identity groups into the research project. They administered the questionnaire, were involved in the data entry and analysis, and will report the results back to the broader community of MSM/Tg. No key decision in this project was taken without the input and consent of these community members. The core group was recruited to the project through ATFF\u2019s networks and contacts. Training the MSM &TG community research assistants In December 2009, the core group of MSM and Tg community members attended a six-hour training course on communication skills over three days. An ATFF staff member delivered the training. The participants in the training received FjD $10 for travel for each session of participation. In March 2010, the core group of MSM and Tg community members attended a 22-hour training course on research skills over 7 days. The ACON staff member designed the training course in collaboration with ATFF staff members, and delivered the training. The participants in the training received FjD $10 for travel for each session of participation. The key demographic variables of the trained group are summarised in the following table. Table 2.1: Demographic variables of the research training group Variable Details Gender and Sexual Identity 5 identified as gay or gay male and 4 as Tg.

Developing the questionnaire Although the initial plan was for the study to be primarily qualitative, it was decided that due to the complete lack of current or recent data on the sexual behaviours of MSM and Tg in Fiji, a quantitative behavioural survey would be of greater use. The results from such a survey could be used as baseline data for later behavioural surveillance surveys. With this in mind, a focus group was conducted with the core group of community research assistants during their training. The focus group was aimed at exploring some of the language used by and about MSM and Tg in Fiji, the sexual and social behaviours of these groups, and some of the issues facing them. Information from the focus group was incorporated into the development of the quantitative questionnaire. The questionnaire itself was based on similar research studies with MSM and Tg in various countries, such as Australia (Lee E et al., 2010), Sri Lanka (Rawstone & Worth, 2007), and Timor-Leste (Lee j, Rawstone & Worth, 2010). Additional questions were developed, based on the information needs of ATFF and the ATFF\u2019s 1998 study on MSM and Tg in Fiji and other Pacific Islands (ATFF, 2001). given that there had been no detailed research on MSM and Tg in Fiji since ATFF\u2019s 1998 study, a broad-based questionnaire was desirable.

Ethics approval The project received approval from the Fiji National Research Ethics Review Committee of the Fiji Ministry of Health. The ethics approval number for this project is 037/2010, dated 8 September 2010. utilising community-based partnerships In the international HIV sector, and regionally in Asia and the Pacific, much emphasis has been placed on building \u201cnetworks\u201d of MSM/Tg organisations. Often, it can seem that the energy and resources placed in such \u201cnetworking\u201d bears few results. However, in the case of this project, the personal contacts and connections between staff members of ATFF and Australia\u2019s largest HIV and gLBT community-based organisation, ACON (the AIDS Council of NSW), led to a strong and fruitful partnership. given the small budget for this project and the desire to focus on a community-based effort, it was not possible to pay for the technical support services of an international consultant \u2013 as usually happens with research projects run by community-based organisations in Asia and the Pacific. Instead, ATFF approached ACON\u2019s International Project for assistance. With the support of a small amount of extra funding from the UNDP for flights and accommodation, ACON was able to send a staff member with social research and community education experience to Fiji for nine days (i.e. the first author of this report). In this visit, the study was designed and the research assistants trained. The ACON staff member then provided further assistance remotely with the ethics application and procedural issues. Neither ACON nor the ACON staff member were paid by ATFF or the UNDP for this work, representing a true partnership between two like-minded community organisations committed to seeing a strong community-based HIV prevention response in MSM and Tg communities. In November 2010, the first author moved on from ACON, but remained involved in the project as an independent volunteer. Support for and opposition to the project It should be noted that this project encountered considerable opposition from various angles. Some people working within certain large multilateral agencies, as well as local and international universities, argued that ATFF did not have the capacity to conduct such a project and that it was inappropriate for such a small community organisation to attempt it. Indeed, efforts were made to prevent this project from going ahead. Well after this ATFF project was initiated, it was announced that a different MSM/Tg research study was to be implemented by university researchers working with a different MSM organisation. We believe that these two studies will complement each other and that the addition of more valuable data about MSM and Tg in Fiji is a positive outcome. 13 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... Despite the opposition to this study, ATFF also received strong support. As mentioned, the UNDP in Fiji and ACON\u2019s International Project based in Sydney, Australia were committed to the project throughout its entirety. Most importantly, this project was extremely well supported by MSM and Tg community members. Community members were centrally involved in every step of the process. Although we did not pay any community members to fill out the questionnaire, there was an overwhelmingly positive response and a strong willingness to participate, even from males who identified as heterosexual \u2013 a group that often does not see itself as part of the \u201cgay\u201d or \u201ctransgender\u201d communities.

There are very few gay-, bisexual-, Tg- or MSM-specific organisations in Fiji. The MSM and Tg communities in Fiji tend to operate as informal social networks. The project began with the involvement of a core group of MSM and Tg community members from diverse backgrounds, who were trained to become the research assistants conducting the interviews for the research. In the initial stages of the project, the community research assistants developed confidential lists of people that they knew who were MSM (gay, heterosexual or bisexual) or Tg. When recruitment started, the community research assistants were able to use these lists to make their initial contacts. At the end of each interview, the respondents were asked by the community research assistants whether they knew anyone that might be interested in being interviewed. The research assistants gave the respondent the ATFF contact details. In this way, the sample was able to extend further into new social networks. Along with these \u201csnowball\u201d approaches, information about the project was spread via word-of-mouth, social networking websites such as Facebook, and email through ATFF and other organisations\u2019 networks of MSM/Tg community members. Community members were able to contact ATFF and request to participate. A problem with \u201cconvenience\u201d sampling is that the overall sample can become dominated by people with similar characteristics as the initial contacts. Attempts were made to mitigate this problem by: \u2022\ufffd Starting with a diverse core group of community research assistants and key contacts; \u2022\ufffd Utilising the social/professional contacts of other community members who were not trained as community research assistants; \u2022\ufffd Checking the sample characteristics regularly during recruitment to see if certain ethnic, gender or sexuality groups were dominating the sample, and if so, making efforts to engage members of the less represented groups. Overall, 215 respondents were interviewed. However, 3 questionnaires with large amounts of missing data were excluded, leaving a final sample size of 212 respondents. Approximately 25 further people were approached by the research assistants to participate, but refused. This resulted in a response rate of approximately 89.6%. There appeared to be two main reasons for refusal: 1. A simple lack of time and/or availability, and 2. Not wanting to participate because the study was not of interest to them. The first reason was given by people from various groups, whereas the second appeared to be given mostly by straight men who perhaps did not want to be identified as MSM. We do not believe that many straight non-MSM were approached. That is, we do not believe that the research assistants approached men who never actually had sex with other men or Tgs. The people who were approached in this study were generally known to the research assistants through their social or sexual networks and were thus known to be MSM with a high degree of accuracy. The refusals seemed to be more about some straight men not wanting to admit or talk openly about their sexual behaviour with other men \u2013 an unsurprising thing considering the general homophobic attitudes in Fiji (see Chapter 15). What was more surprising (at least to the Australian first author if not the local research team) was the large number of straight men who were willing to participate. given that a scientific estimation of the size of the MSM and Tg population in Fiji has never been conducted, it was not possible to determine what proportion of the total MSM and Tg population was surveyed. Although this is a relatively small sample size, 14 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... it is not dissimilar to other international baseline behavioural surveillance surveys (BSS) of MSM, such as in Sri Lanka, where the BSS using convenience sampling had a sample size of 302 (Rawstone & Worth, 2007) and in Timor-Leste, where the BSS using respondent-driven sampling had a sample size of 254 (Lee, Rawstone & Worth, 2010). elIgIbIlIty for partIcIpatIon In the study The selection criteria for the study were: \u2022\ufffd The respondent must be a permanent resident of Fiji. \u2022\ufffd The respondent must be biologically male.

Of the nine research assistants that were trained in March 2010, four went on to conduct interviews. The large dropout rate was due to the long gap in time between the training and the data collection fieldwork, although some of these participants still remained involved with ATFF in other capacities. The time gap occurred because it took five months to gain ethical approval for the project. This was not because of any ethical problems or concerns with the project, but because the ethics committee was experiencing some transition and was not able to table the project until September 2010. The four research assistants were joined by four new MSM community members to conduct the data collection fieldwork. These new members of the research team were provided with training from ATFF staff. The final team of research assistants thus consisted of one ATFF staff member and seven MSM/Tg community members. All eight research assistants conducted interviews in the greater Suva Area, and four conducted interviews in Nadi and Lautoka. Each research assistant received FjD $10 for every completed questionnaire. The research assistants reported that each interview took approximately 45 minutes. The shortest interview was approximately 30 minutes and the longest took approximately two hours. The demographic details for the group of eight research assistants were: Table 2.3: Demographic variables of the research assistants Variable Details Gender and Sexual Identity 4 identified as gay or gay male, 2 as gay/Tg and 2 as Tg.

It is important to note that respondents were not paid for their participation in this study, as is common in many other studies in developing countries, including Fiji. This decision was made primarily because we wanted to foster a sense of community participation, altruism, and shared benefit among MSM, gays, bisexuals and transgenders, rather than a sense of individualism and personal benefit. In developing countries, the opinion that people will not participate in research for free is often espoused. ATFF and the research assistants felt that at least in their social networks, in their community, this was not the case. Indeed, we found that over two hundred MSM and Tg were more than willing to participate for no personal gain whatsoever. This means that we can be assured that \u201creal\u201d MSM and Tg participated and that the sample was not corrupted by non-MSM/Tgs who may have simply wanted payment. In the course of the fieldwork, the research assistants were told that this has happened in other research studies on marginalised groups in Fiji. analysIs and valIdatIon of the data The data were entered into computers using the SurveyMonkey online survey tool, and once entered were subsequently exported into Microsoft Excel format. Two ATFF staff members entered the data. The first author of this report performed the initial data analysis in january 2011 and wrote the first draft of the report. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel and the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, Version 19) software. The draft results were shared with ATFF. In early February 2011, the UNDP provided a small amount of funding for flights and accommodation so that the first author could return to Fiji for seven days.

There was a palpable sense that more needed to be done to bring the MSM/Tg community together in Fiji, and there was also a great sense of anticipation and passion to create an accepting, egalitarian, respectful and inclusive MSM/Tg community in Fiji. 16 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... 3. the reSpOndentS key fIndIngs \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdsample\ufffdwas\ufffdfairly\ufffdyoung,\ufffdwith\ufffda\ufffdmean\ufffdage\ufffdof\ufffd26.9\ufffdyears\ufffdand\ufffda\ufffdmedian\ufffdage\ufffdof\ufffd25.5\ufffdyears.\ufffd\ufffdRespondents\ufffdranged\ufffdin\ufffdage\ufffd from 18 to 51 years. \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdsample\ufffdwas\ufffdfairly\ufffdevenly\ufffddivided\ufffdbetween\ufffdthe\ufffdGreater\ufffdSuva\ufffdArea\ufffdand\ufffdthe\ufffdwestern\ufffdlocations\ufffdof\ufffdLautoka\ufffdand\ufffdNadi. \u2022\ufffd Fijians\ufffdmade\ufffdup\ufffd38.6%\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdsample,\ufffdIndo-Fijians\ufffdmade\ufffdup\ufffd50.0%,\ufffdand\ufffdpeople\ufffdof\ufffd\u201cother\u201d\ufffdethnicities\ufffdmade\ufffdup\ufffdthe\ufffdremainder. \u2022\ufffd One-third\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdrespondents\ufffdhad\ufffdcompleted\ufffdhigh\ufffdschool,\ufffdand\ufffdover\ufffdhalf\ufffd(56.0%)\ufffdwent\ufffdon\ufffdto\ufffdsome\ufffdform\ufffdof\ufffdfurther\ufffdstudy.\ufffd 8.1% of the respondents reported having had no formal education at all. \u2022\ufffd Over\ufffdhalf\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdrespondents\ufffdwere\ufffdChristian,\ufffdnearly\ufffdone-third\ufffdwas\ufffdHindu,\ufffdand\ufffd13.2%\ufffdwere\ufffdMuslim. \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdmajority\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdrespondents\ufffdwere\ufffdworking\ufffd(70.5%)\ufffdand\ufffdnearly\ufffdone\ufffdin\ufffdfive\ufffdwere\ufffdstudying.\ufffd\ufffdJust\ufffdfewer\ufffdthan\ufffd10%\ufffdwere\ufffdnot\ufffd working or studying.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1fd1d044-cd13-43eb-84cf-01613ddc747e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1fd1d044-cd13-43eb-84cf-01613ddc747e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Secret Lives, Other Voices...: A community-based study exploring male-to-male sex, gender identity and HIV transmission risk in Fiji", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bdbf3c01778d4e5876c73d711d7981c3e1d9c23f905a0ff163faf2528cca9013"}, "2": {"node_id": "90dc1972-c91f-4162-b434-57ad0ac68196", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28ea9c4dfdb77d0c5fefb035048797c9e63217867449f05c43e89f37a8c76087"}}, "hash": "56e468c81538fac6fb55af237f901e8064402af161ba150642d047ff8f85ab37", "text": "\u2022\ufffd The\ufffdmajority\ufffdof\ufffdrespondents\ufffdhad\ufffdnever\ufffdbeen\ufffdmarried\ufffd(79.1%),\ufffdwhile\ufffd16.5%\ufffdhad\ufffdever\ufffdbeen\ufffdmarried\ufffdto\ufffda\ufffdwoman.\ufffd\ufffd age The mean age was 26.9 years, the median age was 25.5, and respondents ranged from 18 to 51 years of age.

It was weighted towards the younger end of the age spectrum, which is not unusual for studies of MSM in developing countries. just under half of the respondents lived in the greater Suva Area and just over half lived in Nadi or Lautoka. Despite ATFF not having an official presence in the western side of Viti Levu, the research assistants reported that it was not difficult to engage people in the study. There was a real willingness to be involved, and they reported that community members had a desire to see more community activities occurring in Nadi and Lautoka. In terms of ethnicity, the ethnic mix in our sample did not correspond exactly to the ethnic mix of Fiji as a whole. Our sample had a larger proportion of Fiji-Indians. Fiji-Indians make up approximately 38% of the total population of Fiji (United Nations Statistics Division, 2010), whereas they comprised half of our sample. People with \u201cother\u201d ethnicities make up approximately 5.7% of the population of Fiji (Fiji Islands Bureau of Statistics, 2008), whereas they made up 11.4% of our sample. The sample was quite diverse in terms of education and religion, although it was dominated largely by people with full-time jobs over other levels or types of occupation. It was also dominated by respondents that had never been married to a woman. It is likely in reality, there are many married men in Fiji who engage in sex with men or transgenders. However, this information is very difficult to ascertain objectively, due to the stigma involved with admitting same-sex activity. As a community-based study aiming to provide direction to the ATFF\u2019s work, the focus was always intended to be openly-identified and community-attached MSM and Tg rather than \u201chidden\u201d MSM. 20 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... 4.

That is, for gender: male, female, and transgender; and for sexuality: straight/heterosexual, gay, and bisexual. They reported that in Fiji, there is a local term for biological men who act, dress or feel like women \u2013 vakasalewalewa \u2013 which is similar to the fa\u2019afafine of Samoa or the fakaleiti of Tonga. The research assistants thought that in modern terms, vakasalewalewa could be put into the same category as transgender. It was noted that although many Western terms are used in Fiji to describe sexuality and gender, they may not be used in the same way as in other countries. The research assistants reported that the concepts of sexuality and gender can be somewhat blurred. Despite this, the questionnaire was designed to attempt to separate the two concepts from each other. This meant that some participants might have felt confused about how to respond, but we also ensured that there were open-ended \u201cother\u201d categories so that respondents could state their own identities in their own terms. The research assistants agreed that there was no perfect way to describe sexuality and gender in Fiji, and that separating the two concepts from each other might help to understand it better. sexual IdentIty In this study, the concept of sexuality is seen as multi-dimensional and can be thought of as including (Laumann, 1994): \u2022\ufffd The label a person uses to define themselves (identity) \u2022\ufffd Who a person is attracted to (desire, orientation or attraction) \u2022\ufffd Who a person engages in sexual activity with (behaviour). In terms of sexual identity, respondents were asked to say if they were: a) gay or homosexual, b) bisexual, c) straight or heterosexual, or d) some other sexual identity that they were asked to specify. The respondents answered in the following way. Table 4.1: Sexual identity Number percentage Gay or homosexual 75 35.7 bisexual 31 14.8 Straight or heterosexual 69 32.9 Other 35 16.7 Total 210 100.0 Data were missing for 2 respondents The vast majority (31 out of 35) of the respondents who selected \u201cother\u201d specified their sexual identity as either transgender or female. Interestingly, one male participant stated about his sexual identity: \u201cin the sense that I do the fucking\u201d. This response picks up on a common phenomenon in many cultures where a (usually heterosexual) male identity is unproblematic as long as one engages in insertive rather than receptive sex (Altman, 1996). 21 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... gender IdentIty gender identity refers to the label that a person uses to describe their gender. It is not the same as biological sex. Some people, for example, may be biologically male (i.e. they have xy chromosomes) but call themselves \u201ctransgender\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d. In this study, respondents were asked to say if they were: a) male, b) female, c) transgender or Tg or vakasalewalewa, or d) some other gender identity that they were asked to specify. 60.7% reported being male, while 31.8% reported being either female or transgender. Most of those who chose the \u201cother\u201d category stated a sexuality label as their gender. For example, seven respondents said \u201cgay\u201d, three said \u201cbisexual\u201d and one said \u201chomosexual\u201d. One respondent rejected all gender labels by stating, \u201cnot female, not male, not transgender\u201d, and another said, \u201c50-50\u201d.

Sexuality/Gender Grouping and Ethnicity We examined the four sexuality/gender groupings by ethnicity. The Fijian group was made up mostly of straight men and transgenders. There were more bisexuals and gays in the Fiji-Indian group, and the least number of transgenders. Half of the group made up of people with \u201cother\u201d ethnicities was transgender, with the smallest number of gays and bisexuals. Figure 4.2: Sexuality/gender grouping of respondents in the different ethnic groups This can also be visualised the other way around (see Figure 4.3), showing that Fiji-Indians made up the majority of all groupings except Tgs, which had more Fijians and \u201cothers\u201d. The bisexual grouping was predominantly made up of Fiji-Indians. Figure 4.3: Ethnicity of the respondents by sexuality/gender grouping 23 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... dIscussIon and valIdatIon If nothing else, this study clearly demonstrated that sexual and gender identities in Fiji are blurry and complicated, and that the words used to define these identities are (a) not used in the same way as they are often used in other countries, and (b) not used consistently within Fiji. The blurriness of sexual and gender identities was confirmed and discussed at length at the validation meetings with community members. This section of the report outlines some of important insights gained through the implementation of the research and the validation process. One concept or two? As has been found in other Asia-Pacific countries (for example, see jackson & Sullivan, 2000; Altman, 1996), the concepts of sexuality and gender are often not seen as separate in Fiji. For example, to be called a \u201cman\u201d automatically implies a heterosexual orientation. This means that for many people in Fiji, the concept of a \u201cgay man\u201d is impossible, because if one is \u201cgay\u201d then one cannot be \u201cmale\u201d. Rather than being used as an adjective, the word \u201cgay\u201d is used here as a noun. In the case of transgenders, the category of \u201ctransgender\u201d is sometimes seen as encompassing both sexuality and gender together. That is, some transgender people may not see themselves as having a sexual identity label such as \u201cgay\u201d, \u201cbisexual\u201d or \u201cheterosexual\u201d. For the most part, it seems that the \u201ctransgender\u201d label, at least for male-to-female transgenders, implies attraction to straight men; however, many Tgs appear not to use the sexual identity label \u201cheterosexual\u201d, perhaps because they are not biologically female. However, a number of people in our study identified themselves as both \u201cgay\u201d and as \u201ctransgender\u201d. For this group in particular, but also for those respondents who identified as \u201ctransgender/female\u201d or just as \u201ctransgender\u201d, the label could mean all sorts of different things. For example, it could mean: \u2022\ufffd A person born as a male but identifying as a female, who wears female clothing, expresses their gender in feminine ways, and who is on female hormones. \u2022\ufffd A person born as a male but identifying as a female or as a transgender, who wears female clothing, expresses their gender in feminine ways, but who has no interest in taking hormones. \u2022\ufffd A person who identifies as transgender, identifies also as gay, who wears a mixture of male and female clothing, is fairly feminine in day-to-day life, but who generally looks and seems like a \u201cboy\u201d. \u2022\ufffd A person who identifies as transgender and gay, who dresses like a boy and expresses their gender in masculine ways. These are just four different examples to illustrate the multiple ways that gender identity, sexual identity, clothing, and gender expression can be combined. The same label of \u201ctransgender\u201d can be used by all of these people, but the way individuals enact their sexuality and gender may be very different.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68422b6b-b579-4c2a-81b8-25e0867a1ac9": {"__data__": {"id_": "68422b6b-b579-4c2a-81b8-25e0867a1ac9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Secret Lives, Other Voices...: A community-based study exploring male-to-male sex, gender identity and HIV transmission risk in Fiji", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66b8bd41b10a3429cd3e161d9620b2887faca38cad5356b16d96760ec93f4cfb"}, "2": {"node_id": "6294a9ea-3d30-4a4c-8b4b-00c96c988484", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8be96d91b42aea9e318acfe1c95e8899c68cae5c173c68f93fc6eea8c3a039f9"}}, "hash": "10f68e429c870fd79486abe386aa8432ff7cee25f27ef4b02c7fab698288e1fa", "text": "One of the most important things to keep in mind when reading this report is that in Fiji, the label \u201ctransgender\u201d or \u201cTg\u201d does not always mean what it might mean in other countries.

In many ways, it seems very similar to the fa\u2019afafine of Samoa or the fakaleiti of Tonga. But in the validation discussion, the participants felt that Fiji was different from the Polynesian countries and from India, as there was no established or normalised \u201cthird gender\u201d. There was some sense that perhaps Fiji once had a traditional third gender, but the participants could not explain what happened to it, and why it disappeared from traditional Fijian culture but not Polynesian cultures. The Indo-Fijian participants had knowledge of the traditional hijra in Indian culture, but said that this concept was not established among the Indo-Fijians in Fiji. Global or local? It has been reported that in a number of countries across Asia and the Pacific, a transition has occurred or is occurring whereby new \u201cglobalised\u201d sexual and gender identities are emerging alongside the local or traditional sexual/gender identities (Altman, 1996). Researchers have found that the globalised identities do not simply replace the local identities, but that they tend to co-exist, often uncomfortably. Some MSM/Tgs continue to identify in the more traditional ways, while others take on more globalised gay identities. The groups often have difficulties understanding each other, and there can be undercurrents of conflict or simply a lack of connection. This can mean that the idea of some kind of unified MSM/Tg or \u201cgLBT\u201d community is very problematic. This research found that this process is most certainly occurring in Fiji. It is unclear how long it has been happening, as so little has been documented about sexual and gender minorities in Fiji. The fact that this transformation is occurring was mentioned by numerous participants in the validation process. However, it must be noted that, for the most part, in this study we appear to have tapped into a sample made up of more people with local/traditional sexual identities rather than global ones. From the validation discussions, we were able to summarise the key differences between the \u201clocal/traditional gays, Tgs and vakasalewalewa\u201d, as opposed to the \u201cglobal gays\u201d. The summary is presented in Table 4.4. Please note that the statements 24 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... are generalisations, and that most MSM and Tg people in Fiji would not fit perfectly into either category. However, it is still instructive to consider the broad differences. Table 4.4: Characteristics of global and local/traditional sexual and gender identities Characteristic local/traditional gay, transgender, vakasalewalewa Global gay Gender identity \u2022\ufffd generally don\u2019t identify as male. gender and sexual identity seen as one combined concept. \u2022\ufffd Often identify as male. gender identity seen as separate from sexual identity. Thus, \u201cgay male\u201d rather than \u201cgay\u201d is common.

Try to distance themselves from the typical feminine and flamboyant stereotypes of the \u201clocal gays\u201d. What is the meaning of bisexual? The research assistants reported that there were two potential interpretations of the term \u201cbisexual\u201d among MSM and Tg in Fiji: 1. To mean someone who is attracted to and has sex with both men and women; and 2. To mean a biological male (identifying as male, female or Tg) that takes both the insertive and receptive roles in anal sex; that is, someone that is \u201cversatile\u201d. This stark difference in interpretation of this word was somewhat worrying when it came to making sense of the data. However, 25 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... this was explored in validation discussions with both the research assistants and community members. Although there were no bisexual-identified people in the validation discussions, it was confirmed by the majority of research assistants and community members that most of the 41 respondents in the survey who identified as \u201cbisexual\u201d most likely meant that they were attracted to both men and women. The bisexual grouping was not discussed in the original focus group with the MSM and Tg research assistants prior to the development of the questionnaire. That is, bisexuals were not talked about as a common \u201ctype\u201d of MSM in Fiji. This meant that there were no questions in the questionnaire asking about the respondents\u2019 sexual activity with bisexuals. \u201cBisexual\u201d was, however, included as an option in the list of sexual identities because we wanted to ensure the list was inclusive. When the data was examined by the sexuality/gender grouping of the respondents, it became clear that we needed to consider the bisexuals as a separate grouping. In some respects, the bisexuals seem more like the straight men, but in other respects, they seem more like gays. The group appears to have its own characteristics that set it apart from the other three groups. These characteristics will be explored throughout the report. What does it mean to be \u201cstraight\u201d in Fiji? There was an overwhelming view in all the discussions with community members and research assistants, both before and after the research was implemented, that it is extremely common in Fiji for purportedly \u201cheterosexual\u201d men to have sex with other biological males. This study, given the relatively small number of straight male participants, is not able to comment on how widespread male-male sexual behaviour is across the whole of Fiji. However, questions about the prevalence of male-male sexuality activity and what it meant to have a \u201cstraight\u201d male identity in Fiji were explored through the validation process. There was a sense from the community members that there are generally no obvious differences between straight men who like to have sex with other biological men versus those that never would. At many times during validation, there were claims that all men in Fiji are likely to have had at least one same-sex experience, and that essentially, all men were potentially open to same-sex encounters.

The majority of Tgs dressed with a mixture of how men and women usually dress. Like the concept of sexuality, \u201cgender\u201d is also multidimensional. We have already discussed gender identity \u2013 that is, how a person labels their gender. Another important aspect of gender is how a person expresses their gender in their day-to-day lives. To gain a richer understanding of gender expression in the sample, the respondents were asked two further questions. The first was about how they expressed their gender through their clothing in their day-to-day life. Table 5.1: Gender expression through dress Number percentage Dress how men usually dress 123 61.2 Dress how women usually dress 18 9.0 Dress with a mixture of how men and women usually dress 60 29.9 Total 201 100.0 Data were missing for 11 respondents The results become more meaningful when examined by sexuality/gender grouping. All of the straight men and all but 3 of the bisexual men stated that they dress how men usually dress. By comparison, 55.0% of the gays dressed how men usually dress, while 45.0% dress with a mixture of how men and women usually dress. The transgender group showed the most diversity: only 6.6% dressed like men, 63.9% dressed like women, and 55.2% dressed with a mixture of how men and women usually dress. One straight man, one gay, and nine transgender respondents did not answer this question. Figure 5.1: Gender expression through dress The second question was about how they expressed their gender generally. It asked, \u201cIn your day-to-day life, how often are you: a) Masculine (like a boy), and b) Feminine (like a girl)?\u201d The question was structured as two separate continuums, rather than a single continuum with masculine on one side and feminine on the other. The reason for this is that if we understand gender expression to be something that people do rather than something that people are (kentlyn, 2006), two implications arise: 27 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... 1. The question is one of how often a person acts and feels \u201clike a man\u201d or \u201clike a woman\u201d, rather than how much a person is \u201clike a man\u201d or \u201clike a woman\u201d, and 2. It is possible for people to act and feel both masculine and feminine at different times. The results showed that 66.8% of the respondents were masculine quite or very often, while only 9.1% were never masculine. By contrast, 43.7% were feminine quite or very often, while a much larger 44.7% were never feminine.

Figure 6.3: Attraction to people from one, two, three or four groups, by sexuality/gender grouping Secret Lives, Other Voices 46 dIscussIon and valIdatIon Some important insights arose from these data. First, when exploring the attractions of straight males, we see that they were very rarely attracted to other straight males. This supports the notion that straight men do not view bisexuals, gays and transgenders as \u201cmen\u201d, allowing them to engage in sexual behaviour with other biological males without challenging their heterosexual gender identity. It appears that straight males do not differentiate between gays and Tgs. In the validation discussions, it was proposed that straight men probably think about the sexuality of others in terms of \u201cstraight male\u201d versus \u201cnot straight male\u201d, and that they probably do not have an understanding of the ways in which gays might be different from Tgs. The validation meetings were generally attended by people with \u201clocal\u201d gay and Tg identities. They essentially all said that they were attracted to straight men and not really to other gays. They had heard of this emerging pattern of gays liking other gays, but didn\u2019t seem particularly interested in it. It may be that sexual attraction to other gays is a marker separating those with \u201cglobal\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d gay identities.

The third component of sexuality is who people have sex with (Laumann, 1994). This chapter explores the types of partners that the respondents had. sex wIth woMen Respondents were asked if they had ever had sex with women: 48.1% (n = 102) of respondents had ever had sex with women and 51.9% (n = 110) had not. When asked about the previous six months, 44.3% (n = 94) respondents said they had had sex with women, while 55.7% (n = 118) had not. When broken down by sexuality/gender grouping, the results were as expected. The vast majority of straight men and bisexuals had previously had sex with women, one in five gays had ever done so, and only 5.7% transgenders had. In the previous six months, 92.6% of straight men and 77.4% of bisexuals had had sex with women, whereas only 7.3% of gays and 4.3% of transgenders had.

The participants discussed two common desires among gays and Tgs, but that these two desires were often at odds with each other. The first was the impulse to \u201cget the next guy\u201d. They discussed how they were constantly focused on the quest to find a new (usually straight male) sexual partner. The second impulse contradicted the first, and was the desire to find something longer-lasting and intimate with a male partner. However, even in these comments, there was a sense of fatalism about the perceived reality that (a) they would never achieve that fantasy with a straight male, and (b) even if they found a longer-term lover, the success of the partnership would be undermined by the desire to constantly find new sexual partners. There was some discussion of looking for intimacy in short-term relationships with straight men, but also the sense of disappointment over and over again when they realised that this was usually not what the straight male partner was looking for.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6aa6bdae-555d-48fc-941f-55f7210e64f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "6aa6bdae-555d-48fc-941f-55f7210e64f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Secret Lives, Other Voices...: A community-based study exploring male-to-male sex, gender identity and HIV transmission risk in Fiji", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a22a92c85fc8670a83c43cef8886924129d5c553115d3931086576549dee5cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "3191ce5d-33c3-429e-b178-252e39ab56c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a37e2b3e302c092bc33f239aa85ce780d38258ee7e8ff8f626fd490d53719f33"}}, "hash": "9bd51f3a88c0637a1c2cfbe45b982d2f49dd58e3b05b3d4922d4f0bdb8237d93", "text": "Although the numbers were too small to make any generalisations, it did appear that the focus in the first day of validation, which involved more gays rather than Tgs, was on the first impulse to constantly find new sexual partners.

Casual partners are seen as people with whom there is no ongoing connection or commitment. Of course, the boundary between these categories is not clear-cut, and different respondents might interpret them differently. However, these have become fairly standard categories used internationally in research with MSM. The choice of whether to assign partners as \u201cstraight male\u201d, \u201cgay\u201d or \u201ctransgender\u201d was also left up to the respondents. The research assistants found that they had to explain the concept of transgender, and that some respondents did not understand the difference between gay and transgender. The key point is to be aware that the respondents answered the questions based on partners they assigned into each category \u2013 which would not necessarily be the same as how the partner would assign themselves. Please note that for the questions regarding condom use, respondents were not actually asked if they had \u201cused a condom properly\u201d. They were asked if they had used a condom, if they had not used a condom, if they used a condom but it broke or if they used a condom for part of the time only. All the responses other than \u201cused a condom\u201d were put together into the \u201cdid not use a condom properly\u201d category, indicating that at least some unprotected sex occurred. regular straIght Male partners 48.6% (n = 103) of the respondents currently had a regular straight male partner at the time of the survey, and 50.0% (n = 106) of the sample had had any kind of sex with any regular straight male partner/s in the previous six months.

There will be more detailed discussion on these findings in later chapters. For now, we will make just a couple of observations. One of the most striking patterns emerging from these data is the difference in sexual behaviours when having sex with a straight male partner on the one hand, versus when having sex with a gay or Tg partner on the other. As will be explored in Chapter 9, straight men were generally the insertive partners in anal sex, while gays and Tgs were usually the receptive partners. The same pattern was true for oral sex also. Straight men were more commonly masturbated by their sexual partners, but it was less common for gays to be masturbated by their partners, and much less common for Tgs. While it was not picked up in the quantitative questionnaire, there was some discussion at the validation meetings about a common pattern where the focus of the sexual activity between straight men and gays/Tgs is very much on the pleasure of the Continued 52 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... straight male. It is common for the gay/Tg partner not to orgasm in sexual encounters with straight men. Some participants commented that they had met straight men who were also interested in intimacy and in pleasuring the gay/Tg partner, but this seemed to be the exception rather than the rule. 53 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... 9. SexuAL ActivitieS: AnAL Sex key fIndIngs \u2022\ufffd 98.1% of the respondents had engaged in anal sex in the previous six months. \u2022\ufffd Straight males mostly took the insertive role only in anal sex (91.2%), transgenders generally took the receptive role only (80%). The gay respondents were either receptive only or versatile, while bisexuals were more likely to be versatile (61.3%) or insertive only (22.6%). For most MSM and Tg people, anal sex presents the highest risk activity for HIV transmission. For this reason, we have included this special chapter on anal sex specifically. Anal sex between two biological males is different from anal or vaginal sex between a man and woman because both partners can both penetrate (i.e. be the insertive partner or \u201ctop\u201d) or be penetrated (i.e. be the receptive partner or \u201cbottom\u201d). While some MSM exclusively adopt either the insertive or receptive position with all their sexual partners, many MSM engage in both insertive and receptive anal sex (i.e. to be \u201cversatile\u201d). prevalence of anal sex The data indicated that across the whole sample, anal sex was extremely common. 98.1% (n = 208) of the respondents had engaged in anal sex in the previous six months, meaning that only four respondents did not have anal sex with any partners in the previous six months. anal sex posItIon by sexualIty/gender groupIng The results suggested that the role taken in anal sex is very much linked to the sexuality/gender identity adopted by the respondent. See Table 9.1 for the results. The straight male respondents overwhelmingly reported that they took the insertive role only in anal sex (91.2%). By contrast, the vast majority (80%) of transgender respondents took the receptive role only. A very interesting pattern emerged between the gay and bisexual respondents. The gay respondents all fell into the receptive only and versatile categories, whereas the bisexuals were more likely to be versatile (61.3%) or insertive only (22.6%).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da3b4bf7-1193-4bcd-a783-11596d2e4236": {"__data__": {"id_": "da3b4bf7-1193-4bcd-a783-11596d2e4236", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Secret Lives, Other Voices...: A community-based study exploring male-to-male sex, gender identity and HIV transmission risk in Fiji", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05661460de507cb9827fc6f24646c143caf24044baca67aa29b9c62855e39cb1"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6845274-24c8-4594-8154-cb752fa440be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0e005281b3a9a7c046403894a41497ff9f29f5575235eb5b8531d0ae88d8021"}}, "hash": "71b6bd516d4a20b11c6c5ba9398be7ababccddeb6b908f580ea1cceed5674a11", "text": "Table 9.1: Anal sex position by sexuality/gender grouping Number (percentage) No anal sex Insertive only Receptive only both insertive and receptive Total Straight men 1 62 0 5 67 (1.5) (91.2) (0.0) (7.4) (100.0) bisexuals 0 7 5 19 31 (0.0) (22.6) (16.1) (61.3) (100.0) Gays 1 0 20 20 41 (2.4) (0.0) (48.8) (48.8) (100.0) Transgenders 2 1 56 11 70 (2.9) (1.4) (80.0) (15.7) (100.0) Data were missing for 1 straight male respondent.

SexuAL ActivitieS: grOup Sex key fIndIngs \u2022\ufffd 25.5% of respondents reported they had never \u201cengaged in sex with more than one person\u201d in the last six months, 48.5% reported occasionally, and 26.0% said they did this often. \u2022\ufffd Bisexuals engaged in sex with more than one person the most frequently and straight men the least frequently. \u2022\ufffd The wording of the question may not have indicated group sex to some respondents. However, qualitative discussions supported the finding that group sex is common among MSM and Tg in Fiji. In the literature on HIV and MSM, group sex has emerged as a key predictor of unprotected anal sex and HIV transmission. Most of this literature comes from Western countries. It is unclear how prevalent group sex between MSM and Tg is in the Pacific, or how much it may be associated with HIV risk. In the focus group discussion during the development of the questionnaire, the MSM and Tg research assistants reported that group sex is common in Fiji. To explore this assertion, respondents were asked how often they had engaged in sex with more than one person in the last six months. The results demonstrated that group sex is a fairly common experience among this sample of MSM and Tg, with only one-quarter having not engaged in any group sex in the previous six months.

However, given that only three validation participants had ever actually had group sex, it is difficult to know how common these events might be.

Since there were no \u201cglobal\u201d gay men at the validation discussions, it was not clear whether these kinds of sex parties have emerged in Fiji. 58 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... 11. cOndOm uSe key fIndIngs \u2022\ufffd Those who had had vaginal sex with female partners in the previous six months were fairly evenly split between always, sometimes and never using condoms for vaginal sex. \u2022\ufffd For those who had had anal sex with any MSM or Tg partners, 21.6% always used condoms and 57.7% sometimes used condoms. \u2022\ufffd There was not much difference in condom use between casual and regular partners. \u2022\ufffd When having sex with straight male partners, 14.8% of the respondents always used condoms, while one-third always used condoms with gay or transgender partners. \u2022\ufffd 37.0% of respondents used a condom correctly the last time they had anal sex with any kind of partner. \u2022\ufffd The last time they had sex with straight male partners, 28.6% used condoms correctly.

Among MSM and Tg, the key risk factor for HIV transmission is unprotected anal intercourse, thus, the questionnaire contained a large number of questions relating to condom use. condoM use by partner type We were interested to know if patterns of condom use were different depending on whom the respondent was having sex with. This was clearly the case (see Table 11.1). Those who had had vaginal sex with female partners in the previous six months were fairly evenly split between always, sometimes and never using condoms. However, for those who had had anal sex with any MSM or Tg partners, fewer always used condoms (21.6%), and a larger group sometimes used condoms.

The key concern was around how drug and alcohol use may be associated with decreased condom use, given that the ATFF study in 1998 (ATFF, 2001) found that consistent condom use was lower when alcohol was involved. In the current study, respondents were asked about drug and alcohol use the last time they had anal sex within the past 6 months with a male, gay or Tg partner with a condom, and the last time they had anal sex within the past 6 months with a male, gay or Tg partner without a condom. These questions were based on surveys of gay men in Sydney, Australia (Prestage, 2005). For the last time using a condom, 102 respondents were excluded because they did not have anal sex at that encounter or because they only had unprotected sex in the previous six months. For the last time not using a condom, 102 respondents were also excluded because they did not have anal sex at that encounter or because they only had protected sex in the previous six months. This left 110 respondents in each question. These respondents rated if they had used alcohol or other drugs at their last encounter either with or without condoms. They were able to choose multiple items because it is possible to use more than one substance at a time, and indeed, this was common. Of the 88 respondents who reported using any substance the last time they used a condom for anal sex, 40 of them (45.5%) reported using more than one substance. Similarly, of the 81 respondents who reported using any substance the last time they did not use a condom for anal sex, 40 of them (49.4%) reported using more than one substance. 63 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS...

This is an important point, as it can be tempting to make claims that substance use causes riskier sexual behaviour. These data clearly demonstrate this not to be the case. Instead, what they demonstrate is that the use of alcohol in particular, but also the use of kava and marijuana, is common when MSM and Tg in Fiji engage in sex. condoM use and hIv knowledge We were interested to find out if higher levels of knowledge about HIV transmission were associated with higher levels of condom use. An HIV knowledge scale was created from the six knowledge items based on the UNgASS indicator. The sample was broken into: (1) those who had always used condoms for anal sex in the previous six months, and (2) those who had engaged in some unprotected anal sex. The group that had always used condoms for anal sex had a higher mean score on HIV knowledge (mean score = 5.8) than the group that had engaged in some unprotected anal sex (mean score = 5.2). This difference was statistically significantly different (p = .000), however, it is important to keep in mind that a mean score of 5.2 out of a possible 6 is still very high. obtaInIng condoMs Respondents were asked where they had bought or obtained condoms in the previous six months.

Data were missing for 15 respondents. dIscussIon and valIdatIon This research presents something of a mixed picture of condom use among MSM and Tg in Fiji. On one hand, the rates of condom use are perhaps not as low as expected, but there is certainly room for improvement. Condom use was discussed at the validation focus groups. The participants mentioned that condoms are seen primarily as contraceptive devices in Fiji. For many straight men, one of the perceived benefits of having sex with another biological male is that pregnancy is impossible and therefore condoms do not have to be used. It was also proposed that due to most HIV cases in Fiji being between heterosexual men and women, male-male sex may be viewed as less risky, thereby decreasing the motivation to use condoms. Thus, the validation participants were not surprised that our results indicated that condom use is lower when having sex with straight men. Transgenders were the least likely to always use condoms, which may be because transgenders almost exclusively have sex with straight men, and one of the most common reasons for not using condoms was that the respondents\u2019 partners did not want to use one. The validation discussions very much supported the notion that there are high levels of HIV knowledge in Fiji, especially among gays and transgenders, but that many people are simply not motivated to use condoms despite their high knowledge. The participants also confirmed that in their experience, using alcohol when having sex is extremely common in Fiji. This aligned with the finding that the most common place to find sexual partners was in clubs and bars. The validation participants mentioned that they were most likely to be picked up at clubs and bars by straight men very late in the night (i.e. early the next morning) and once the straight men and they themselves were already quite drunk. They were surprised to see the results showing that alcohol and drug use was the same the last time the respondents used and did not use a condom for anal sex. After some discussion, they proposed that many people either have a personal policy to use condoms or they don\u2019t; the presence of alcohol and other drugs probably did not affect this personal policy a great deal. The validation participants agreed that obtaining condoms is not difficult in Fiji. Again, the question was more about the motivation of people to spend money on condoms when they could be spending it on other things. Some participants talked about accessing free condoms from HIV organisations, but others argued that seeking out free condoms could be a hassle, especially given that there are limited places to obtain them. 65 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... 12.

Figure 12.1: Frequency of sex work in the last six months Secret Lives, Other Voices 96 dIscussIon and valIdatIon It was clear that sex in exchange for money, gifts or favours was common in this sample of MSM and Tg. The research assistants believed that, if anything, the rates of sex work were probably under-reported, especially sex in exchange for gifts and favours. The research assistants reported that in these questions, some respondents said that they had not or would not give gifts and favours, but that in some cases they may not have been telling the truth. One of the issues here is that the term \u201cin exchange for sex\u201d is complex. The way it is phrased implies that the situation is quite obviously transactional in nature, which leaves out much behaviour that is less obvious. It may have implied to some respondents that the payment of money, gifts or favours was negotiated as part of the sex act, leaving out the times where there was money or gifts being exchanged, but in a way that was less directly related to the sex act. This was especially in the case of when gays or Tgs have a straight male \u201cboyfriend\u201d whom they essentially support financially. Due to the labeling of the straight male as a \u201cboyfriend\u201d, the gay or Tg person might be unlikely to report that the financial support given to the straight partner is \u201cin exchange for sex\u201d. It was often simply viewed as one of the things that gays and Tgs must do if they want to maintain relationships with straight men. The validation participants confirmed this. They reported that the exchange of money and gifts is extremely common in Fiji. For example, they reported that when having sex with straight men, it is very common for the man to ask for some money or something else such as a phone recharge card. These situations were not so much a case of the straight men saying, \u201cIn payment for me having sex with you, I want you to give me $10 (or a taxi fare, or a recharge card, etc)\u201d, but more a case of the straight men trying their luck to see what they could get out of it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4486e85d-bfe3-4818-9c8f-09e9b81aaf0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4486e85d-bfe3-4818-9c8f-09e9b81aaf0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Secret Lives, Other Voices...: A community-based study exploring male-to-male sex, gender identity and HIV transmission risk in Fiji", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e53e489aed000dd52b528d7c11d7629f822d253a6a751b32c2b5056de8eecf4a"}, "2": {"node_id": "6de4a47e-3779-4e57-9951-683970071f9f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "273f195fefc0df6c3bc6c803893402f17496ca63f72fa1fb209211bb81092572"}}, "hash": "d13d9f5ae88c3ae4c0b176761dc7be2c2330217827da38474d93b57262507772", "text": "In this way, the exchange of money or gifts often happened after the sex had already occurred, further complicating the idea of \u201cin exchange for sex\u201d.

The discussions also included the way that money and gifts for sex circulate around the different partners. Straight men will often use the money or gifts they get from gays/Tgs to give things to their girlfriends. So, there can commonly be situations where, for example: a gay/Tg person gets paid money for sex with clients (straight men), then uses that money to support a straight male \u201cboyfriend\u201d or to pay straight casual partners with money or gifts; the straight male might then use that money to support his girlfriend or buy gifts for her, or perhaps even to purchase the services of male, Tg or female sex workers. Most common was the pattern where a straight male may have a gay/Tg partner as well as a female partner, and uses the money received from the gay/Tg partner to pay for gifts for his girlfriend. Overall, the results and discussions demonstrated that, as in many non-Western countries, the boundaries between \u201cordinary sex\u201d and \u201ctransactional sex\u201d are blurred. There are certain social expectations operating in Fiji whereby money and gifts are exchanged in the context of casual or regular relationships, but that this is not seen as \u201csex work\u201d. Alongside this, there also exists a more well-defined profession of sex work, where the transactional nature of the sex is explicit. 67 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... 13. hiv trAnSmiSSiOn knOwLedge key fIndIngs \u2022\ufffd Respondents had high levels of knowledge about HIV transmission. 65.7% of respondents correctly answered all six questions. \u2022\ufffd gays and bisexuals got more answers correct than straight men and transgenders. \u2022\ufffd Indo-Fijians got more answers correct than Fijians and those of \u201cother\u201d ethnicities. \u2022\ufffd Respondents were uncertain about the risk of oral sex, with 24.0% answering that HIV transmission through receptive oral sex is possible, 40.2% saying it is not possible, and 35.8% answering that they were not sure. ungass hIv knowledge IndIcator The respondents were asked about their knowledge of HIV transmission and risk.

The question was included not to \u201ctest\u201d the knowledge of the MSM and Tg respondents, but rather to simply explore what they thought about the risk of oral sex.

Figure 14.2: previous STI diagnosis by ethnicity Secret Lives, Other Voices 105 Percentage Percentage It should be noted that higher rates of diagnosis could be an artifact of higher testing rates rather than STIs actually being higher in certain groups. Unfortunately, we did not ask about rates of STI testing. Therefore, we cannot determine whether STI rates were actually higher amongst bisexuals, Fiji-Indians and those with \u201cother\u201d ethnicities, or whether these groups simply got tested more or were more willing to admit having had an STI. 73 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... dIscussIon and valIdatIon There is certainly room for improving the rates of HIV testing among MSM and Tg in Fiji. However, it is important to recognise that people have valid reasons for not testing more often. In the validation meetings, a range of significant barriers to HIV testing were mentioned, such as: lack of trust in clinics, confidentiality issues, privacy issues, and feeling judged by unfriendly clinic staff. They also mentioned practical factors such as the time it takes to get tested, difficulties with the opening hours of clinics, and having to go for a second appointment to get the results. Participants felt that testing rates for HIV and STIs would increase among gays and Tgs if there was a MSM-friendly clinic. In terms of STIs, the STI rates reported in this study are likely to be under-reported. The validation participants felt that many people who filled out surveys may not have understood what we meant by having ever been diagnosed with an STI. They also said that people would feel ashamed to admit this. One of main reasons for our suspicion that STI rates were under-reported is that data from the Fiji Ministry of Health show that Fijians are diagnosed with STIs at much higher rates than Indo-Fijians and people with \u201cother\u201d ethnicities. For example, in 2007, there were over 1000 gonorrhoea diagnoses in Fijians, and only just over 200 in Indo-Fijians.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49a99eef-9db7-4460-8c94-761080f26dfd": {"__data__": {"id_": "49a99eef-9db7-4460-8c94-761080f26dfd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Secret Lives, Other Voices...: A community-based study exploring male-to-male sex, gender identity and HIV transmission risk in Fiji", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e27a161a1274ba96d039b8d38df390b363fe0b8a3d5fa4942fcc7ef9f9b5bdd"}, "2": {"node_id": "16338ddc-6504-4f3d-ab5c-9a0dab9c5ac2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21170047762ce401eaa37833c6a40d4f594770067a379125a54253f504c0ce38"}}, "hash": "2b8ca939cc3ad62b14e33584490aa144bb2ad2a10a94bac91df0598e7ed204ac", "text": "Most of these diagnoses were in men.

Figure 15.8: Abuse Scale and Safety Scale by sexuality/gender grouping forced sex A previous study in Fiji found that 21% of MSM and Tg respondents had experienced sexual abuse such as forced sex or rape (Buchanan-Aruwafu, 2007), however the sample size was very small (48 interviews and focus groups with 26 participants). Without going into too much detail about this topic, respondents in this study were asked if they had ever been forced to have sex against their will. 26.8% (52 respondents) stated they had, and 73.2% (142 respondents) stated they had not. This question was not answered by 18 respondents. When examined according to sexuality/gender category, the results showed that 41.0% of gays and 40.0% of transgenders had been forced to have sex against their will. By contrast, fewer bisexuals and straight men had experienced this (15.4% and 9.5% respectively). 79 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... Figure 15.9: Experiences of forced sex by sexuality/gender grouping Secret Lives, Other Voices 114 Of the 52 respondents who had been forced to have sex against their will, 26 of these (50.0%) were transgender and 16 (30.8%) were gay. Figure 15.10: Sexuality/gender grouping of those respondents who had ever been forced to have sex against their will Secret Lives, Other Voices 114 dIscussIon and valIdatIon It was confirmed in the validation meetings that Fiji is not a safe place to express a minority gender or sexual identity. Validation participants were not surprised to see that those who were most open about their sexualities and genders were also the ones most targeted for abuse. There was something of a sense of irritation at MSM who try to \u201cpass\u201d as heterosexual so as not to experience abuse. Many gays and Tgs felt that they did not have this option, and that even if they did, they would not want to pretend to be anything other than what they are. While it may seem somewhat contradictory that the groups which experienced the least amount of abuse also felt the least safe and comfortable, it is not a surprising pattern. This could be an artifact of how the questions were asked. The questions were \u201cHow safe do you feel expressing your gender and sexuality?\u201d and \u201cHow often do you experience abuse based on your gender or sexuality?\u201d. If we had asked generally about how safe respondents felt, perhaps the bisexuals and straight men, given that they experienced much less abuse, would have said that they felt safe. That is, bisexuals and particularly straight men could feel very safe in their day-to-day lives, but when it comes to the question of sexuality, and admitting to others that they have sex with men/Tg, they might feel very unsafe. It makes sense on one level that the people who have dissonant identities and behaviours felt the least \u201csafe\u201d and \u201ccomfortable\u201d. They are having sex with men, but they are not willing to take on a gay identity, which might cause them to feel stressed and unsafe. The gays and transgenders might have said they feel very safe expressing their gender and sexuality in Fiji because they are taking something of a defiant attitude towards the world. The view that many gays and Tgs are tough and defiant was expressed in the validation meetings. The validation meeting with the research assistants also resulted in some important comments.

However, this was explored qualitatively in the validation process. Among the gays and Tgs at the validation meetings, there was quite a lot of consensus regarding some key issues. First, there was a view that there is not so much a sense of a gLBT community in Fiji as there are large, interconnected social networks. These networks are typically made up of \u201clocal gays\u201d and Tgs. The participants also mentioned that there are somewhat separate social networks of gay men with more \u201cglobalised\u201d gay identities (although they did not use this term). Second, there was a sense that something is missing from the \u201cgLBT community\u201d in Fiji, and that there are a range of divisions within the population of gays, Tgs and other MSM. Participants spoke about there being divisive hierarchies and a growing problem of elitism in some sections of the population. There were concerns that gay and Tg individuals were being tokenistically placed in leadership roles and do not have the capacity or desire to represent the needs of other gays, Tgs and MSM. Again, although they did not use the language of \u201cglobal\u201d versus \u201clocal\u201d, the differences between feminine gays and Tgs versus masculine-acting gay men was discussed at length. The feminine gays and Tgs felt that the gay men did not want to associate with them because of the fear of being \u201couted\u201d in the broader community. generally, it is an understandable concern regarding disclosure issues to the wider community. Another issue within the social networks of feminine gays and Tgs was the intense competition for the attention and affections of straight men, which could cause serious conflicts. Finally, another issue was mentioned at all three validation meetings, relating to tokenistic involvement. gays and Tgs had been \u201cused and abused\u201d by others, including some MSM when organising events. It was reported that the event organisers make money from events featuring gays and Tgs, but that they are made out to be a laughing stock. There was a strong feeling of resentment toward this, and that gays and Tgs should stop supporting such events that undermine the cause of decreasing stigma and discrimination. Third, despite these problems, there was palpable desire to see stronger communities emerge, along with more gay and Tg community activities. Most participants did not think that the gLBT community in Fiji should develop into some kind of separate community from the general, heterosexual population. But there was clearly a desire for gay/Tg safe spaces, services, and social activities.

Although our questionnaire did not ask these questions in exactly the same way as the UNgASS indicator, we were able to determine the answer to the two parts of the indicator, albeit for the last six months (rather than the last twelve).

However, this does not automatically mean they will be used. Only around one in five respondents were occasionally approached and the majority was never approached by HIV outreach workers in the previous six months, indicating that there is room for improvement. In terms of the services named by the respondents, it is important to keep in mind that even if an organisation was on the list, it did not mean that the organisation necessarily worked with MSM/Tgs \u2013 rather it simply meant that respondents believed this about the organisation. Some of the organisations mentioned were not known to ATFF staff members. For example, although 19 respondents mentioned \u201cHuman Rights\u201d, we were unable to ascertain what exact organisation was meant by this. 89 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... 18. LimitAtiOnS There is no such thing as a perfect research study. Like all studies, this one contained some limitations, although these did not overshadow the usefulness of the data. As with all studies using snowball and convenience sampling methods, the sample in this study was not truly representative of the entire MSM and Tg population in Fiji. This simply means that while helping to provide important insights, the data are not generalisable to all MSM and Tg in Fiji. First, the respondents primarily came from urban areas of Fiji. The experiences of MSM and Tg in rural areas are likely to be somewhat different. However, given that any HIV prevention interventions or MSM/ Tg community-building efforts will always have their foundations in the urban areas, this focus was appropriate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43c0624e-cd72-4fe8-8436-e9ff966d9651": {"__data__": {"id_": "43c0624e-cd72-4fe8-8436-e9ff966d9651", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Secret Lives, Other Voices...: A community-based study exploring male-to-male sex, gender identity and HIV transmission risk in Fiji", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87459b60490b71eac080328cddd8ac1006617d4dd7a614974ba6cc84f88e4b5e"}, "2": {"node_id": "6eeedb6f-01f5-429e-8321-ad01554f452c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/secret-lives-other-voices-community-based-study-exploring-male-male-sex-gender-identity-and-hiv-transmission-risk-fiji", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6149fdccdfaa0c0260ad09d20ff0e3c9dde47c80c268131ef3292abda551dbcf"}}, "hash": "19c1427dc274f8ac06d7ca73aea67a07cbdacd3645be58f39183f9ef6c993de7", "text": "Second, as mentioned in Chapter 3, the ethnic mix in our sample did not correspond to the ethnic mix of Fiji as a whole, as our sample had a larger proportion of Fiji-Indians.

Indeed, we believe the ethnic diversity in this sample is one of the key strengths of this study.

Third, the proportions of the different sexuality/gender groupings may not correspond directly to the \u201ctrue\u201d situation in Fiji. For example, we had quite a large group of transgenders in our sample. However, given that no scientific size estimations of the MSM and Tg populations have been conducted in Fiji, we cannot know the \u201ctrue\u201d proportions of straight MSM, gays, bisexuals and transgenders. In any case, throughout this report, we have broken down the findings by sexuality/gender grouping as much as possible so as to mitigate this potential problem. The sample size in this study was fairly small due to limited available resources. However, as mentioned previously, it was not substantially smaller than many behavioural surveillance surveys of most-at-risk populations in a number of countries (for example, Colby, 2003; Lee, Rawstone & Worth, 2010). As with all studies on sensitive topics, especially such as stigmatised sexual behaviours, we cannot know for sure that respondents answered truthfully or \u201ccorrectly\u201d on every question, or that they interpreted every question the way it was intended. yet, we found that there was a high level of consistency across the data, which speaks to its validity. Many of the findings came out according to expectation. For example, patterns of condom use were fairly consistent, even though the questions were asked differently at different points; it was consistently found that condom use with straight male partners was lower than with other partners. The research assistants reported that in some cases, they suspected that some respondents under-reported the number of sexual partners and over-reported their rates of condom use. However, these are limitations of any self-report questionnaire into sexual behaviour. Although anonymous self-administered surveys may have increased the truthfulness of responses, when designing the study we had to weigh this against other factors such as the likelihood of respondents completing the questionnaire and their capacity to understand the questions. In the end, it was decided that an interviewer-administered questionnaire would be more desirable, so that the interviewer could explain the questions and clarify the responses. As mentioned in Chapter 16, we acknowledge that the questions on STIs could have been substantially improved if we had asked about rates of STI testing and diagnosis, and specific symptoms of STIs such as sores, itchiness, lumps, and discharge. There were some slight discrepancies in the data, for example, where a respondent might say that they had no MSM/Tg sexual partners in the previous six months at one point but then report on their anal sex practices in the last six months at another point. Overall, these discrepancies were small. There was also a fair amount of missing data, particularly toward the end of the questionnaire. This was not surprising given the length of the questionnaire and the fact that it contained very sensitive and personal information regarding anal sex, alcohol and drug use, and sexual health testing. However, again, overall, even in the worst cases of missing data, approximately 90% of respondents still answered the questions. This leads onto another point, which is not so much a limitation of our research as a cultural observation. Conducting research in Fiji is impacted by the authoritarian values of the overarching culture. For example, in schools, children are generally told what to think; in churches (which play a central role in Fijian culture), ministers are seen as authorities on how to live. Even in HIV peer education, it has been noted by ATFF staff that some peer educators can start to take on something of an authoritarian role and tell their peers what they should be doing rather than educating them in a more peer-based, neutral, and health promotion-based sense. This aspect of the culture has impacts on research. Throughout the data collection interviews and in the validation meetings, there was often a sense of respondents and participants wanting to provide the research assistants or research consultant with the \u201cright\u201d answer.

In the last fifteen years, ATFF has seen individuals change their outlook from \u201clocal\u201d or feminine to more \u201cglobal\u201d over a period of time, suggesting a fluid situation where individuals continue to seek appropriate identities. There are a number of implications from these observations. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods come from Western cultures, where categorisation and labeling feel natural and are inherent to the culture. Western cultures are also more individualistic (Mao, van de Ven & McCormick, 2004). There is a strong focus on the authenticity of the individualised self, a long tradition of claiming identities for oneself and establishing self-devised boundaries around those identities. In Fiji, as in many non-Western cultures, identity categories certainly exist, and they operate with real meanings in the culture. However, the focus on categorisation and the claiming of abiding individual identities is far less emphasised. Things are far more fluid. In Western countries, when a person moves from one sexual or gender identity to another it is usually perceived as a process of change \u2013 change that can be experienced as quite difficult and sometimes painful. In Fiji, it may be more likely that the person never really had a particularly fixed sexual or gender identity in the first place. 91 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... 19. cOncLuSiOn And recOmmendAtiOnS This report has outlined the findings of the first research study to be conducted on MSM and transgenders in Fiji since ATFF conducted its last study in 1998. Although not necessarily representative of all MSM and Tg in Fiji, the data gathered in this research are extremely valuable in helping us to understand the risk behaviour and other factors among MSM and Tg, and in enabling us to develop recommendations for future HIV prevention and health promotion actions. As a community-based study, this research was very much focused on generating information to help answer the question: \u201cWhere to from here?\u201d. The following pages outline some of the most significant overarching findings of our research, along with key recommendations for the future. hIv preventIon and health proMotIon wIth MsM and transgenders In fIjI There is wide diversity among MSM and Tg in Fiji. Different types of MSM/Tg in Fiji have different experiences and belong to different social networks. Our research, both through the quantitative survey and the qualitative focus group discussions and interviews, determined that there are four broad groupings: \u2022\ufffd Feminine gays and transgenders (often with \u201clocal\u201d sexual and gender identities) \u2022\ufffd Masculine-identified, \u201cglobalised\u201d gay men \u2022\ufffd Bisexuals \u2022\ufffd Straight-identified men People from all four groups participated in our research, although there were less \u201cglobalised\u201d gay men than the other groups. In terms of HIV prevention and other health promotion activities, it seems clear that the four groups will need to be targeted in different ways. For example, the results showed that active social networks already exist among feminine gays and Tgs, whereas straight men who have sex with men are less linked to each other socially. We also found that there are divisions between feminine gays and Tgs versus \u201cglobalised\u201d gay men, and that it may be unrealistic to expect one unified community to emerge, or for one community organisation to meet the needs of both of these groups. Further, it is clear that the feminine gays and Tgs experience the most discrimination. However, they also perhaps have the most strengths: they are willing to openly contravene socially accepted gender and sexual roles, and they are willing to stand up for themselves. This is in contrast to the other types of MSM, especially straight men. It would also be unrealistic to expect a \u201ccommunity\u201d of straight MSM to ever form in Fiji. The very idea of community is built upon shared identity.

Greater funding be secured to allow hIV prevention and health promotion activities and resources to be implemented by various organisations. When prioritising HIV prevention interventions, there should be an emphasis on interventions that are likely to have the greatest impact and can be implemented at sufficient scale to have this impact. Interventions should be tailored to the nature of the epidemic in specific settings, including prioritisation of subgroups of MSM most at risk, as well as the capacity of the health, CBO and other services in those settings. Furthermore, we suggest that: \u2022\ufffd For the feminine gays and Tgs, the response should be based on a community development model. Such a model would examine the broader social determinants of health, not just HIV prevention and condom use. This approach could focus on human rights, decreasing stigma and discrimination, providing space for social support, building self-esteem, and increasing psychological and community empowerment. It should be an egalitarian and grassroots response rather than an elitist or authoritarian one. Our research demonstrated that active informal social networks of feminine gays and Tgs already exist in Fiji, and crisscross the entire country, or at least the island of Viti Levu. These existing networks can be utilised to develop and implement innovative HIV prevention and health promotion programs. \u2022\ufffd \u201cglobalised\u201d gay men would also benefit from a community development model. However, for the most part, \u201cglobalised\u201d gay men are likely to need specific responses tailored to their own identities and interests. 92 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... \u2022\ufffd Straight-identified MSM will probably not benefit from a community development-based response, as active social networks of straight MSM are not evident. Straight-identified MSM are always the hardest group to reach in any country. As mentioned, possibly the most efficient way of increasing condom use among these men is through the education and community mobilisation of their gay and Tg sexual partners. given that most straight men do not have sex with each other but rather with gays and Tgs, empowering the gays and Tgs to insist on condom use would therefore increase condom use among straight MSM also. Other methods to reach straight-identified MSM would most likely include training healthcare workers in cultural sensitivity to MSM and Tg issues and increase their awareness of the specific health and social support needs of MSM/Tg, with technical assistance from MSM community-based organisations (WHO, UNDP, UNAIDS, Department of Health Hong kong, China and APCOM, 2010). \u2022\ufffd Since we still do not know a great deal about bisexual MSM in Fiji, it remains unclear how best to work with them on HIV prevention and other health promotion activities. However, they will still tend to benefit from user-friendly clinics, and the sensitisation of healthcare workers as well as their gay and Tg sex partners. At this stage, we recommend that more research is needed to understand the group of MSM who identify as bisexual as well as their male and female partners. clInIcal sexual health servIces Our research highlighted that many MSM and Tg in Fiji have not been tested for HIV. The results did not uncover high rates of STIs, however, we believe that rates of STIs were most likely under-reported. A key gap in Fiji\u2019s clinical sexual health services is a designated clinic for MSM and Tg. It has been demonstrated in many countries around the world that HIV and STI testing rates can be substantially increased if MSM have a safe place to get tested. Thus, it is recommended that: 5. Access to MSM- and TG-friendly and competent voluntary confidential counselling and testing (VCCT) and STI services be scaled up. 6. health care workers be sensitised to the specific health and social support needs through programmes delivered in collaboration with MSM/TG CbOs.

Like any piece of research at a single point in time, this study has possibly posed more questions than answers, or at the very least, it has illuminated many areas requiring further research. We welcome more projects to increase understandings of MSM and transgenders in Fiji, especially those that are community-based and aimed squarely at implementing actions to improve the health and wellbeing of MSM and Tgs. It is recommended that: 7. Further research be conducted with MSM and transgenders in Fiji, on different topics, in different areas, and with different groups. 8. Agencies and research institutions develop respectful partnerships with MSM and TG community organisations that are mutually beneficial to all parties and which improve local research capacity, ensure that research is appropriate and relevant, and ensure that research leads to the implementation of actions. 9.

We found high rates of recent experiences of abuse due to sexuality and gender. The results showed that feminine- identified gays and Tgs experienced the most abuse, but that these individuals perhaps had the most social resources to draw upon. The bisexuals and straight men, while experiencing less abuse, felt less safe and comfortable expressing their sexualities and genders. Our research also uncovered a great need in those who had experienced abuse to talk about their experiences and to gain support from others. Currently, no such services exist for MSM and Tg in Fiji, despite the extremely high levels of homophobia. Thus, two interlinked recommendations are made that: 93 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS... 10. homophobia and transphobia be addressed at a societal level. 11. Gender violence relating to MSM, TG and other gender-variant males must be addressed. 12. Mental health and support services specifically for MSM and TGs, or appropriate for MSM and TGs, be established. coMMunIty-buIldIng This study highlighted the lack of a sense of MSM and Tg community in Fiji. It is clear that strong social networks of MSM/Tgs exist, at least among feminine gays and Tgs, but that an overarching sense of community does not. The focus group discussions uncovered a great desire for community activities to develop. It is important to note that many of the most successful HIV prevention programs in the world arose out of or alongside community-building activities. Strong communities are able to advocate for their rights, empower themselves, support community members in healthy behaviours, and solve problems. The following recommendation is made for two reasons: (a) to assist in HIV prevention programs and (b) to build resilient MSM and Tg communities as a goal in its own right. 13. MSM and transgenders in Fiji should be supported to develop skills in community organising and to implement community activities aimed at building the MSM/TG communities in different locations around Fiji. 94 Secret LiveS, Other vOiceS...

People living with HIV and their households, including those who suffered AIDS-deaths, are acutely burdened by Illnesses, loss of jobs and income, rising medical expenses, depletion of savings and other resources, discrimination, social exclusion and psychological stress related morbidity. The impact is also felt on the status of women as well as education of children. Based on its mandate1 to lead the human development dimensions of the epidemic, including its social and economic implications, UNDP Regional HIV and Development Programme has taken steps to study the impact of the epidemic2 at the household level in select countries of the Asia Pacific region and to recommend impact mitigation steps. It developed a methodology based on a large-scale study in India3 and helped UNDP COs in China, Cambodia and Indo- nesia launch studies on the impact. Vietnam launched a similar study incorporating relevant elements from the methodology. They are under various stages of implementation. To share the learning from the studies as well as the progress and challenges; and to discuss how best to incorporate critical emerging issues including spousal transmission, the impact of volatile food and fuel prices and the current financial crisis in the studies; and appropriately revise the methodology and questionnaire, the Regional HIV Programme organized a two- day technical consultation in Colombo from 3-4 March 2009. The consultation was attended by research teams and UNDP staff from Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam, and leading experts on the socio-economic analysis of HIV, and the members of the Regional HIV Programme. This report presents the summary of the technical presentations and discussions at the consultation as well as the outputs such as the survey questionnaire. The report has been prepared with a view to guide research and analytical efforts for studying the various dimen- sions of the socio-economic impact of HIV on people living with HIV and their households. To enhance the utility of the report, the presentations have been featured as technical papers and the discussions thereof have been summarized with considerable attention to operational details.

According to the Report, although the macro- level impact of HIV in Asia and the Pacific appears negligible, millions of people will endure the impact of the epidemic because of the large populations in the region. The Report also stresses the need for data to understand the epidemic better and respond effectively. A recent editorial in the AIDS Journal and accompanying papers also highlighted the utility of household impact studies and the need for a strategic approach. 3 Socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS in India; UNDP, NCAER & NACO, 2006 1 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific DAy 1 D ay 14 comprised learning from the socio-economic impact studies in India and China followed by updates on the methodology and process from the research teams from five countries: India, China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia. The sessions also discussed emerging issues such as HIV and food security in Asia, impact of financial crisis on the households of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) and intimate partner transmission. OVERVIEW OF STUDy METHODOLOGIES & LEARNING: INDIA & CHINA EMERGING ISSUES AND THEIR SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT 4 Please see annexure (1) for more details Introduction and setting the context I n his opening remarks, Mr. Omar Noman, Chief of Policies and Programmes, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, looked at the broad macro-economic situation in Asia. Making a comparison between the current global financial crisis and the Asian crisis in the late 1990s, he said there is hope in this region because unlike in the past, the financial sector hasn\u2019t collapsed. China and other countries in the region have built up huge foreign exchange reserves that can act as buffers. Delving the possible linkage between the present economic crisis and HIV, Mr. Noman talked about the major fiscal expansion which every country in this region is going through to stimulate the economy. As quite a bit of these stimulus packages are typically targeted towards social protection, in the form of public works programme or employment guarantee schemes, he felt that countries could look for stimulus packages that could protect the interest of people living with HIV. In his view, this bad time could provide very good opportunity not only to make a case for HIV, but also expand it, since at least to some extent the response to HIV/AIDS is related to government spending. Mr. Noman expressed his concern over the shortage of data and how policy responses are hampered by the non-availability and delay of data. In this context, he appreciated the socio economic impact studies that are being undertaken in the region as \u201csome- thing invaluable\u201d. He called it a great opportunity to change the policy in a substantial manner, if one could get that kind of household data for policy - formulation and match that to what may be considered to be key protection packages as fiscal stimulus. Setting the context of the consultation, Ms. Caitlin Wiesen, HIV/AIDS Regional Prac- tice Leader and Programme Coordinator, Asia and Pacific, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, emphasized the need to understand the socio-economic impact of HIV at the household and individual levels. In her opinion, assessing the impact of HIV/AIDS is extremely important and critical for the policies and programmes in the region. She explained how the data available can be used to address and shape the issues that often protect the interests of people living with HIV/AIDS. Though Asia is considered to be a low prevalence region, the studies in countries such as India and China indicate clearly what is happening to households with people living with HIV. Ms. Wiesen highlighted the dynamics of the epidemic in a typical Asian country as an important issue. The 75 million men in Asia who are estimated to be visiting sex workers are the key drivers in determining the phase of the epidemic. These men who visit 10 million sex workers can in turn infect 50 million women who are in marriage or long term partnership with them. This is overlapped by men who have sex with 3 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific men and injecting drug users. In this context, Ms. Wiesen emphasized the need to look at the questions on spousal transmission and issues such as disclosure of HIV status that could be included in the socio-economic impact studies. There is also a need for serious enquiries concerning discordant couples and intimate partner violence in the context of spousal transmission. Ms. Wiesen also spoke about the impact of external shocks such as food price infla- tion", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56d4e467-ff98-40c8-8695-673825df8e99": {"__data__": {"id_": "56d4e467-ff98-40c8-8695-673825df8e99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific - Report on Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a0f107c1c7ef7bcec18786f6fc68a611a650af76418ba86f4d83618f80aa69f"}}, "hash": "7a0f107c1c7ef7bcec18786f6fc68a611a650af76418ba86f4d83618f80aa69f", "text": "and volatility. Studies have shown that HIV households lose income due to loss of employment and their medical expenses increase significantly resulting in a decline in food consumption. This is particularly important and a cause for concern since there is a need to enhance the quantity and quality of food as lack of nutrition can lead to more rapid progression of HIV. A five country analysis undertaken by the HIV Team using existing data shows how food price increase can affect the HIV households and how food support programmes can mitigate the impact. For example, in Cambodia the HIV households who received intervention from the food support programme showed an increase in terms of quantity and quality of food intake, reduction in medical expenditure, and a positive impact on children\u2019s education. Those who have more disposable income do not compromise on quality or quantity of food. These findings are extremely important for the policy makers, she added. The Commission on AIDS in Asia has recommended that impact mitigation should be included in AIDS programmes and one of the areas that was recommended was the need to ensure livelihood options for the HIV-widows and the affected families, and to secure inheritance and property rights for women. These two recommendations are essentially based on the studies in India which shows that 80 % of women whose husbands have died were pushed out of their marital homes. Shelter and security are absolutely critical for women living with HIV. The Commission on AIDS in Asia has included this as the overall recommendation for the region and spousal transmission as a new area to concentrate on. Updating on the progress of the socio-economic impact studies, Ms. Wiesen said that the study in India was completed three years ago and it might be the right time for a follow up with a rapid survey to collect data from some of the households to measure the changes in the impact over time. China has completed the data collec- tion and analyses and is finalizing the report. In Cambodia, the questionnaire is in the final stage and emerging critical issues need to be added, without overloading it. The study in Indonesia is just getting underway and Vietnam is ready with the first draft of the report. 4 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion Socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS on households in India A study in six high prevalence states: learning and experience Dr. Basantha K.Pradhan National Council for Applied Economic Research, New Delhi, India T he study on the socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS in India was initi- ated during 2004-05 and the report published in May 2006. At that time, no large scale household survey had been done anywhere in the world on HIV and AIDS. In any survey, data is a major problem and this is more so in respect of HIV house- holds. The economic and social impact was looked at three levels: macro, household and individual levels. The data collected from households included information from household as well as individual levels (gender impact, stigma and discrimination etc). There was an attempt to assess the macro economic impact by using a mathematical model, but due to shortage of data, it encountered many problems. The objective of the study was to analyse the nature and type of socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS on households and individuals in terms of: impact on household income and expenditure; D changes in pattern of household consumption, savings and borrowings D impact on education of children D effect on health status of PLHIV D stigma and discrimination experienced by PLHIV (an attempt was also made D to quantify this, but the results were not fully satisfactory) Gender impact of HIV and AIDS. D 5 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific The Process The study was conducted in six high prevalence states and in each state, the districts with high prevalence were chosen. The methodology adopted was to survey HIV households as well as similar non-HIV/general households as a control group using multi-level, stratified sampling. Although listing of HIV households was available with some agencies, they could not be accessed due to ethical and confidentiality issues and therefore random sampling could not be done. In view of such constraints, VCTC counselors working in state health organizations were chosen to conduct the survey and they were trained appropriately. A team comprising a male and a female counselor was deployed in each of the selected districts. They were told to look for HIV positive individuals in clinical stages 2, 3 and 4 so that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "074b6e77-bcf6-468b-bd3b-e3e32339a467": {"__data__": {"id_": "074b6e77-bcf6-468b-bd3b-e3e32339a467", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific - Report on Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16f45f60f3a60cf727fe4d6e75de8b0993a1b2c1cb006ee3c37a616f63f13e8d"}}, "hash": "16f45f60f3a60cf727fe4d6e75de8b0993a1b2c1cb006ee3c37a616f63f13e8d", "text": "the impact on the parameters to be studied was measureable. The counselors were also asked specifically to look for households in higher income groups so that the samples would be representative. However, it was not possible to get them since they don\u2019t visit government hospitals and instead seek treatment from the private sector. Hence, the sample was mainly from the lower middle and poor economic sections. The total sample consisted of 2068 HIV (rural+urban) households, and nearly three times this size, i.e. 6224 samples, were from non-HIV households serving as the control group. For every HIV household surveyed in a village/block, three non-HIV households belonging to similar localities and similar socio-economic background such as income, occupation and education were interviewed. However, the concept of obtaining similarly educated sample was not possible as numbers became too small due to sub-categorization. A list of the non-HIV households was made, with income and occupation, and if there were more than three non-HIV households with similar characteristics available for one HIV household, then, the non-HIV households were selected randomly. For the quantitative survey, two sets of questionnaires were devised, one for the HIV households, and the other for the non-HIV households. They were generally similar, except for a few questions. The HIV household questionnaire had an additional sec- tion with questions aimed at the HIV affected, and the non-HIV household question- naire had a section on knowledge and awareness about HIV/AIDS. Apart from this, Focus Group Discussions were held in different states and a number of case studies conducted to capture interesting cases on stigma and discrimination and gender issues. Results from these were used to complement the findings of the survey. The average household income was nearly same/marginally different, for the HIV and non-HIV households, and because of this, comparisons between the two could 6 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion be made by using different income groups. The HIV households were worse off in terms of basic amenities and ownership of assets and consumer durables. Most of the sample PLHIV was in 20-40 years age group, and the level of education was low, with nearly a fourth of the sample being illiterate. Wage labourers dominated the sample among both men and women. In terms of the findings of the study, it may be noted that no statistical analysis was undertaken. The analysis was drawn from the tables. Impact on household income The impact on the household income was through loss of job of the PLHIV and absence from work. In the present situation of the global economic meltdown, the main impact of the household will be through loss of employment. Hence, in the model questionnaire, differentiation should be made between job loss due to global meltdown and that due to HIV. In the study, the results revealed that some households did not suffer any loss of income, and one possible reason could be that the PLHIV was at an early stage of the infection, which might not have hampered the earning capacity. However, for those households which experienced a loss of income, the loss was very high and it was particularly so in respect of agricultural labourers. Also, contrary to what is found in literature, loss of income of caregivers was not very significant. This could be due to the need for supplementary income dominating the care-giving role. Also, with a person being infected with HIV, the requirement for resources increases, and this forces other members, including caregivers, to earn. Impact on employment The most severe impact of HIV on the households comes from the loss of employment caused by HIV infection. The percentage of unemployed among the PLHIV increased nearly three times: from 3.6% (before learning about their HIV status) to 9.8% (pres- ent). Work force participation rate of children and the elderly in HIV households was seen to be higher than those for non-HIV households. The requirement of resources goes up in the HIV households and hence more children and elderly are forced to work. The elderly in the HIV households are under considerable stress to look after the needs of the households. A look at gender and workforce participation rates indicates that the burden is more on women and girl children. 7 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific Impact on the pattern of consumption The consumption pattern of certain critical components indicates the differences between HIV and non-HIV households. Medical expenses of HIV households are very high, as expected, and are almost four times that of non-HIV households. The overall food-related expenditure of HIV households is higher than that of non-HIV households,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee330356-a955-461e-90c2-c5c1424aca1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee330356-a955-461e-90c2-c5c1424aca1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific - Report on Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3c196c0e93045886ec2dd177634430f0fee3b4ab7aa0f0acb43e3e5c388976b"}}, "hash": "f3c196c0e93045886ec2dd177634430f0fee3b4ab7aa0f0acb43e3e5c388976b", "text": "possibly because an HIV positive person is expected to consume nutritious food to stay healthy. In order to meet this higher expenditure, the HIV households are seen to be cutting down expenditure on other items. However, closer examination reveals that in labour households, food-related expenditure is less than that in non-HIV households, indicating their inability to spend on nutritious food. Impact on household savings The HIV households had more savings in cash, indicating the need for immediate liquidity for emergencies. They hardly had any savings in jewellery and other assets. Impact on borrowings The percentage of HIV households which borrowed during the one year period before the survey was higher for HIV households at all levels of income. However, it is possible that some households might not have borrowed that year, but have done so in the previous years. In fact, the important parameter is the quantity of borrowing since a family member was tested positive. Obtaining correct information in this regard could be difficult because of recall problems. Impact on education of children The impact on education was assessed by comparing children of HIV with non-HIV households in terms of ever and current enrolment percentages, dropout rate and number of years of schooling, reasons for dropout, type of school attended, school attendance and reasons for absenteeism. In the literature on HIV/AIDS, education is a dominant subject, and reasons for dropout are generally discussed. With that in view, questions on all the above were included. Looking at both ever-enrolled and currently-enrolled, the results indicate that the non-HIV households are better off. Further, it was seen that in HIV households, more girls go to government schools than private schools because education is free in the former. 5 SNA - System of National Accounts. SNA activities are economic activities; extended SNA are para economic and non-SNA are social and cultural activities. SNA is a system of classifying activities for national accounting purposes 8 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion Stigma and discrimination An attempt was made to quantify stigma and discrimination experienced by the PLHIV. Surprisingly, the survey results did not indicate a high degree of discrimination at work place, school and community. This does not mean that there was no discrimination. The reason however turned out to be that most of the PLHIV had not revealed their status in these places because of the fear of stigma. In fact, even in the households, sometimes the HIV status was not disclosed even to spouses for quite sometime. Al- though a high percentage of PLHIV reported family support, in case of women it was mostly the natal family and not the in-laws. The survey revealed that women faced more discrimination - not only are a higher percentage of women asked to leave their houses compared to men, women also reported discrimination in the form of neglect, isolation, verbal teasing and deprivation of basic amenities. Gender impact In order to get the gender impact, data on the time- use- pattern was collected, in which all the members of the households were asked how they spent their time (24hours) in a day. The activities were classified into three main divisions -SNA5, which is paid work; extended SNA which involves housework, but unpaid e.g. cooking, taking care of the children); and non-SNA where the time is spent on oneself (e.g. bathing, leisure etc). The results were tabulated for two categories of family members - 15 to 59 years and above 59 years, and comparisons were made between HIV and non-HIV, male and female and elderly and others. The results revealed that men spent more time on SNA activities in both HIV and non-HIV households. Women from HIV households spent more time on productive activities. Older women of HIV households spent more time on extended SNA activities compared to their counterparts, indicating that they shoulder the additional burden of tending to the sick. Also, women from HIV households are left with lesser time for themselves. It was found that 70% of the caregivers were women and among them 21% were HIV positive themselves. 32% of female care givers were currently employed. In other words, this group of 32% women bore the burden of care and paid work, in addition to household chores. Status of HIV positive widows The impact on widows was found to be extremely severe. As compared to other HIV households, HIV widow households were worse off in terms of living conditions, as- sets, income and expenditure. The HIV widow households spent less on food, faced 9 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific the double burden of stigma", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef9633fc-0e74-4c76-b326-6f8ada373abb": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef9633fc-0e74-4c76-b326-6f8ada373abb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific - Report on Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e398331bfe0b2b891f98f6945db624d3f5b423a5077931b924cbb0dcfee22b2"}}, "hash": "5e398331bfe0b2b891f98f6945db624d3f5b423a5077931b924cbb0dcfee22b2", "text": "and discrimination even in the family, and in a large number of cases, denied share in their husband\u2019s property and were living with their natal families after the death of their husbands. Discussion The key points raised during the discussion following the presentation were social protection of PLHIV for loss of income, loss of employment and methodological issues such as the challenges in the correct assessment of income. The loss of efficiency, absenteeism and loss of jobs are generally the means of loss of income. At the time of the survey, there were not many government programmers. But of late, the PLHIV in the high prevalence states are getting free ART in the government hospitals. Additionally, many NGOs in the high prevalence states provide supplementary nutritious food to some of the affected. Currently, employment guarantee schemes are being run by the government, but given the health conditions of the positive persons, it is difficult to know what kind of benefits they are likely to get out of this scheme. However, during the survey, it was found that some of the PLHIV were getting employment in the state AIDS control societies and NGOS, and widows were gainfully employed as counselors. As regards the data on household income, it is difficult to get the estimates of income correctly. Even if the income is well estimated, it generally falls short of the real income. It is possible that respondents may not understand the meaning of \u201cincome\u201d correctly. Some may not disclose all the sources of income. Hence, an indirect method of finding the income is the best, and would have the least error. Hence, information was sought individually on all sources that could constitute the total income. Now, with the emerg- ing three new issues to be incorporated into the questionnaire, many questions have to be added. But adding these questions should not make the questionnaire too lengthy. It should be balanced without losing sight of the fact that getting correct information on income is very important. In the Indian study, no statistical analysis was done, and the analysis was based only on the conclusions drawn from tables. However, they may be included in the ongoing studies. There could be significance tests - which would help in knowing whether a particular result is statistically significant or not. To study some relationships, say, the co-relationship coefficients which can be used to make comparisons, for example, whether health and education are more strongly related in HIV households than non-HIV households can be made. Regression analysis, i.e., multiple regression analysis, is very important. It can quantify the degree of dependence of a certain parameter - say how the average education level may depend on various factors like income etc. Statistical analysis of the results has already been undertaken in the China study, and should be done for all the countries. 10 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in China A five province study: learning and experience Prof. Yuan Jianhua Beijing Institute of Information Control, Beijing, China I n China, 223,501 persons were reportedly living with HIV/AIDS until the end of 2007, most of them in rural areas. Even though the overall prevalence of HIV and AIDS is low in China, the prevalence rate is fairly high among special population groups and in certain areas. Studies indicate that the socio-economic impact of HIV at individual and household levels can be very severe at some places. However, there is not enough data and evidence which quantify the impact of and response to HIV and AIDS on households and individuals. A household survey to assess the socio-economic impact was conducted during February - April 2008 with the support of UNDP in five high HIV prevalence provinces in China, namely Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hubei and Shanxi. This included survey of HIV households (target group) and non-HIV households (control group). Please see companion CD-ROM for the questionnaire. The Process The tools of the survey included structured questionnaire for data collection, fo- cus group discussions, case study etc. The questionnaire was based on the India questionnaire with inputs from Dr. Pradhan. The sample households were selected by using multi-stage sampling method and, at each stage, selection was based on systematic sampling. The sampling framework is the list of PLHIV who can be contacted in the locality. The non-HIV positive persons whose age were almost the same as HIV persons (less than five years old) were selected as the control group in the neighborhood of the PLHIV interviewed or in the community where HIV posi- tive persons lived.

The survey was conducted in collaboration with local departments, such as CDC and Women Union and some of the PLHIV participated as investigators. The SPSS statistical 11 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific package was used for analyzing the data. The statistical analysis methods included: descriptive statistics, table analysis, mean comparison, correlation and regression analysis. The research team conducted panel discussions for the technical report a number of times, so as to find more information and quantify the correctness of the conclusions. Dr. Pradhan provided technical support and a number of multiple analyses were carried out and these included in the detailed report. Information was shared with officials from the UN agencies and government sectors. Based on the analysis of data and technical report, a detailed report and a summary report have been finalized. The research team conducted five consultative meetings with experts from the government departments, CDC, international agencies, NGOs and universities and the participants proposed some recommendations to the report, which were very valuable and helpful. Key findings HIV/AIDS could change the household structure. 41.1 percent of the HIV D households surveyed are in joint-family (married children living with parents/ grandparents), while in the case of non-HIV households this percentage is lower at around 33.4%. Distribution of households by level of income shows that while nearly half of D the HIV households belong to the low income category (household annual income less than 10,000 Yuan) and 19.26 % live under the relative poverty line (household annual income less than 4193 Yuan), in the case of non-HIV house- holds only one third belongs to the low income category and 11.46% of the households live under the relative poverty line. An analysis of the consumption pattern reveals that the expenditure of HIV D households is mostly focused on the basic needs of daily life. Compared to non-HIV households, the HIV household spends 17.4 percent of the total con- sumption on medical expenditure, about 10 percent higher than the percent- age of non-HIV households (7.9%), and the expenditure on education and durables is much lower The survey attempted to find out the mechanisms adopted by the HIV house- D holds to cope with the financial difficulties. Most of the HIV households have no insurance or pension. When facing financial crisis, the first choice for both HIV and non-HIV households is to borrow from friends and relatives (60.7% and 66.7%), the second choice is to use up the savings (25.5% and 32.7%). The proportion of households resorting to liquidation of assets, spouse going out to work to earn additional income and receiving support from the NGOs are higher in the case of HIV households. 12 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion The impact of HIV/AIDS on education of children mostly happened in the D households belonging to low income category and those live below the rela- tive poverty line. Compared to respondents from non-HIV households, the PLHIV spent less D time in productive work; the time spent by male PLHIV on productive work is 42 percent less than that of non-HIV positive male, while in the case of female PLHIV it was 28% less, indicating that female PLHIV could not reduce their working time as much as men could. As far as the total time spent on produc- tive work and household work is concerned, the women in non-HIV house- holds spend 0.7 hours more than men, while female PLHIV work 2.2 hours more than male PLHIV, indicating that HIV/AIDS increases the work pressure for females, while men could get more time for relaxation. Regression analysis was also done to find the impact of various factors on D the quality of life of the PLHIV. Ten independent variables such as per capita income, CD4 count, education, discrimination and marital status were used for the analysis.

As a result, some children lose out on education. At the same time, the support that the HIV-households receive plays an important role in reducing the impact of HIV/AIDS on individual and households. HIV/AIDS could destroy the marriage of PLHIV, change the household struc- D ture, and weaken the family system. There is still considerable stigma and discrimination against PLHIV. PLHIV, who D disclosed their status, and their family members, have suffered discrimination in the community, health facilities and schools. 13 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific The impact of HIV/AIDS on the education of children can be very severe. The D enrollment ratio and the average schooling years decreased, especially for the households with low incomes. HIV/AIDS makes the gender inequality more serious. D Recommendations Try to integrate HIV into income generation, anti-poverty and development D activities so that the HIV households are able to cope with the situation by themselves. Strengthen the medical support and innovate the support pattern, integrate D the medical support for PLHIV into conventional medical insurance system, such as new type rural cooperative health system and social insurance. Incorporate social support for PLHIV into conventional government social D support programme. Advise the civil department to expand the scope of low- est life guarantee for PLHIV. Combine various recourses to provide day-to-day support to the families of D PLHIV, especially the families with single parent and old people. This would help in reducing the stress and improving the quality of life of the family. In the high prevalence areas, combine anti-discrimination education with D IEC activities. The aim of such education should not only be to promote the knowledge of HIV/AIDS, but also to change the attitude and behavior of people towards PLHIV by conducting specific activities. Strengthen the interventions on education of children, especially for girls. D Establish a targeted education support system. Adjust the contents of \u201cFour Free and One Care\u201d policy, provide education support and free skill training for older children. Pay more attention to female PLHIV. Take up targeted measures to reduce D their vulnerability. 14 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion Discussion The discussion mainly focused on methodological and data collection challenges such as maintenance of confidentiality, incentives for the respondents in view of the long questionnaire and time taken for interviews and difference between rural and urban HIV households. In response, Prof. Yuan said that the local CDC has the list of names and the field work was done in cooperation with them. One or two days before the interview, the local CDC fixed up appointments with them. Before the interview, they were informed that this was only for research and not open to public. In the questionnaire, the name of the person was not written, but only the names of the contact people were mentioned. In the Union province, since there is no discrimination, the field team directly went to their houses. This study was mostly conducted in villages, except in two places, which were like a township. He also said the respondents were given nominal amounts of money. It was suggested that sector-wise impact may be measured in the future studies particularly in view of the impact of the economic crisis on people living with HIV. It was also stated that in both India and China, family members were not allowed to be present during the interview of the PLHIV. Their presence may actually affect the interview process and disclosure of complete/correct information. In both the countries, the control group was selected from similar socio-economic backgrounds. In Cambodia and Vietnam, closest (proximity) household method was used for se- lecting the control group. In this context, some literature review can be done to see how technically/comparatively valid they are. The participants suggested additional analysis of secondary information, e.g. review of existing government policies and support and whether the numbers match with the government support. 15 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific Socio-economic impact of HIV in Indonesia A seven province study: update on the methodology and the process Mr. Teguh Pramono Central Bureau of Statistics, Jakarta, Indonesia I ndonesia consists of 33 provinces, spread out from Aceh in the north-west and Papua in the far- east.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6de8bff1-0b83-47d2-bf65-5b32e9de56bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "6de8bff1-0b83-47d2-bf65-5b32e9de56bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific - Report on Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1876fab31c95f57761f3b5dd595d4b0c396a2c59151296f3edb6722c6b1836e2"}, "2": {"node_id": "f153799d-2ac4-4c94-b54e-22a4a4698ca5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b13f45be2af36b6f6f5621d50c08dc20b24c61d528561753c81f0d176573915d"}}, "hash": "18105d928f1822c533a3dffbf6ff48dcf1645100f6562d657026cbe79e855e6e", "text": "The population of the country is now around 231 million, with density of 123 people per sq km.

The purpose of the study is to create a detailed report on the nature and extent of socio-economic impact of HIV on individuals and households and recommendations for impact mitigation. The study will focus on household structure, income, expendi- ture, employment, health, education, access to services, interpersonal relationships, stigma and discrimination, the impact of rising food-prices, psychological impact, quality of life and social environment. Special emphasis will be on the impact on women. The recommendations would include a strong case for impact mitigation. This would provide a pool of resources and database for further research and analysis on related issues. The study will compare the expected outcomes with that of other countries where similar studies have been undertaken. The study would help policy makers, influential leaders and society in deepening their understanding of the socio-economic impact of HIV on households and design appropriate policies and programmes to mitigate it. The questionnaire has been adapted from China\u2019s questionnaire with some modifications - eliminated some questions on the mode of transmission keeping in mind the ethnicity of the people and issues of confidentiality and added some new questions on the labour force. The questionnaire is divided into two parts based on the experience in pre-testing in west Java: SDGK09-K7 which is meant for the head of the household, in case he/she does not know that one of his/her household member is infected. It was felt that it was 7 Please refer companion CD ROM for questionnaire 17 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific not only difficult but also risky to ask about the PLHIV when the other members are not aware about his/her HIV status. This questionnaire will also be used to interview control-households. SDGK09-M8 is meant for the person living with HIV. It was difficult to find the control households. Unlike China, in Indonesia, there was no listing of PLHIV and the control households were selected by comparing household position or the condition of the houses such as the wall, the roof and the number of members in the household with that of HIV households. For the survey, a sample of seven provinces has been selected primarily driven by the estimated number of IDUs, prisoners, and people living with HIV, based on the data that there are 193,000 people living with HIV. The household sample consists of 1,000 households nationwide and proportionally selected from seven provinces. The province selected are intended to represent four high prevalence and two low prevalence provinces -Jakarta, Papua, East Java, West Java, Bali, East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara. East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara are considered as low prevalence provinces. The list of populations/mapping of positive households will be provided by JOTHI (Jar- ingan Orang Terinfeksi HIV Indonesia, PLHIV network in Indonesia). Base on the list the sample households will be selected through systematic sampling. The sampling will seek to ensure all modes of transmission are covered. The enumeration will be conducted by a team consisting of two persons, one, and a staff from the National Statistical Office (NSO) and another from JOTHI. Each team will interview 25 households. The field work will take almost one month if one household is interviewed every day. The staff from the NSO will be responsible for the interview of PLHIV and their household and also interviewing the control households. JOTHI will be responsible, especially, for the access to the PLHIV since they are very sensi- tive to those who are not from their community. Some JOTHI researchers are also participating in coordinating the field enumeration, and observing the quality of data. The quality of data will be supervised by a field supervisor and editor in the office and a validation program will be executed. Discussion To questions on mode of transmission, it was stated that the discussions with UNDP Indonesia and National Commission and also with JOTHI led to the decision not to ask direct questions on mode of transmission for ethical and accuracy reasons. 8 Please refer companion CD ROM for questionnaire 18 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion However, direct questions will be asked on this issue. Regarding the selection of control household, the concern was whether the comparison should be with the socio economic condition of the household before HIV-infection or at present. In terms of comparing with the current condition of the HIV households, there is some information- loss because from the time of getting infected to the present, the household has become poorer.

When asked for the list of names of HIV positive persons, JOTHI in Bali found it dif- ficult to give the names and their contact details and the register has the names with only cell numbers and these numbers can be changed anytime. In the absence of addresses, the households cannot be approached directly. The NGO could not give any detail since they are meant to be confidential. The study team has given the NGO a format to provide the names and address and is hopeful to get the information before starting the field work. The study team is 100 percent dependent on JOTHI to meet the households. Responding to questions on quality of data collection, Mr. Promono said enumeration will be done by professionals from the Central Bureau of Statistics. It will be made sure that in each province, people selected to conduct the survey are graduates and have experience in socio-economic field and they will be trained before they start the field work. This is being done through JOTHI. They can also go with the team and inform them about the survey and the likely benefits. Regarding the selection of the control households, one of the issues is to match the non-HIV household results with the national level sample survey results. If they are comparable, it can be presumed that the selection of non-HIV household is unbi- ased. In Cambodia, the same questions from the national surveys are used to make sure that the results of the non-HIV households can be compared with the results for the general population. Mr. Promono said many of the positive respondents refuse to be interviewed at home and they may have to be interviewed outside their homes. This may create some problem since it is important to know the socio-economic condition of the HIV households in order to select the comparable non-HIV households. The participants were unanimous in the utility of the pilot tests, particularly on issues of sensitivity. 19 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific Socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS on households in Vietnam: The impact on poverty Tommaso Tabet UNDP, Hanoi, Vietnam T he first study on the impact of HIV in Vietnam was conducted in 2004 and the results were published in 2005. The findings of the study were used for policy and programme decisions of the government. The government was interested to conduct an update of the earlier study, and hence the present project was started in 2008-2009. It comes under the UNDP funded HIV leadership program involving the Party and national assembly. The project began in October in 2008 and was due to be completed by late march 2009, but has been slightly delayed. Both the government and the HIV community in Vietnam have high expectations from the study that the data and information can provide crucial evidence for policy formulation. There have been many changes in the HIV framework in Vietnam in the last three years and it is therefore time to assess the impact. The study is both qualitative and quantitative and is consistent with older studies. It also has a great potential for regional analysis. In the context of Vietnam, its legal framework which provides good HIV laws, the party directive 54, and also the national strategy on HIV go hand in hand. The Three Ones is a pretty new development in Vietnam. Also, importantly, HIV prevalence estimations are more reliable reliable now. All the partners have agreed on the methodology and the results of the study. However, MDG 6 will probably not be achieved by 2010-2015. The Vietnam household questionnaire can be found within the companion CD-ROM. Objectives of the study To assess, analyze and update the nature and magnitude of socio-economic D impacts of HIV and AIDS on households To draw possible scenarios of HIV/AIDS impacts on poverty and draw projec- D tions on what could happen in 5-10 years 21 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific To develop up-to-date survey and analytical methodologies to demonstrate D the feasibility of the study To feed to the national M&E system and outline the most relevant policy and D advocacy recommendations. The methodology is very similar to other studies, especially those in India and China. Six provinces or cities with high HIV prevalence were selected as the sites. The study-design consists of comparing 453 pairs of HIV affected and non-affected households, and then qualitative in depth interviews for confirmation.

Non-HIV households were selected based on the proximity to the HIV households with similar characteristics such as type/quality of accommodation, number of family members etc. A structured questionnaire for HIV and non-HIV Households containing (a) demo- graphic information; (b) economic status: housing and living conditions, income and expenditures; main changes in the last year; (c) health status, health service utilization, direct & indirect costs, nutrition etc; (d) family environment: community participation, impact on women, children, caregivers; (e) stigma and discrimination, including family members; (f) status of receiving support/services from outside family (knowledge, access, use, etc.) was used. In addition, guides for In-depth In- terviews and Focus Group Discussions were also prepared. The approach was not to ask questions directly. Key findings The economic impacts indicated are loss of income, increased expenditure and decrease in assets of HIV households. The impact on expenditure of HIV households includes reduction in absolute expenditure on food and education, and an increase in absolute expenditure on medicine and health care. The income losses have been calculated as income lost due to lost working days by caregivers and the sick per- sons. On the social front, PLHIV changed their work because they think that they were not strong enough for their work. Though stigma and discrimination is found to be decreasing, it still exists. It also includes self stigma. Results indicate increased burden on women (care-givers), especially in-house, compared to men. Another finding is that free ARV program and participation in self-help groups may help to minimize the impact of HIV and AIDS on households and individuals. The ARV program was started only about a year or two ago in Vietnam. But there have 22 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion been huge improvements in providing free ARV drugs. The government now fully supports people living with HIV. It has supported the establishment of an umbrella organization of their networks. The framework is very good and the feedback from PLHIV is that they find a considerable support from these groups. Limitations The sample has a loss of representation of the extremes, i.e. respondents in early or last stage of HIV infection, as well as those in the poorest and richest quintiles, because they are very difficult to access. It has also been very difficult to select the non-HIV households which are in the same income quintiles as that of HIV house- holds/or live in similar conditions. There is the question of reliability of income/expenditure estimates. The information provided in the quantitative questionnaires, as also during some of the qualitative discussions indicate that people misquote their income so that they are in the lower income quintile and hence can access free ARV. Consultations are being held on the manner of comparison of the income and expenditure with VHLSS9 income/expen- diture classifications. This is quite important, especially for the projection in the last part of the study. Since the framework of the present study and the methodologies used in 2005 have changed, it is not possible to use the 2005 study either as the baseline or as a comparative tool. Projecting the Impact Projecting the impact of HIV/AIDS on national poverty involves estimation of unit cost of HIV care and treatment services. Some information will be provided by the government, like cost of ARV. The number of households that may fall into poverty as a result of HIV/AIDS will be modelled by projecting HIV incidence in each quin- tile using the national representative data of VHLSS (2008). High and low epidemic growth projections are available and will be utilized. The incidence for each quintile will be combined with household impact data to determine the incidence of pov- erty.

It is important to come to an agreement on the type of results that are useful. What type of statistical techniques should be agreed upon in terms of presentations? The type of policy conclusions or changes needs to be highlighted. It will be very useful for all the different studies to understand as to how to frame the results better. Regarding the unreliability of estimating income and expenditure, if information on the household assets and household characteristics are available, an index on asset basis in terms of economic status with quintiles of different asset levels can be developed. Therefore, if that information is available, some analysis can be made by ranking the assets and then looking at the socio-economic status. Reservations were raised on the accuracy of projections based on a small sample. Additionally, though the selection of the control population is based on systematic sampling, the HIV population is not representative as they were randomly selected. That is another drawback for projection. In other countries, the sample size is larger. The methodology should be studied and seen whether it is possible to apply it in other places, keeping in mind the limitations. Despite the serious limitations, there is nothing wrong in attempting poverty related projections as it can influence policy makers. 24 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion Socio-economic impact of HIV on households in Cambodia A national study: the methodology and process James Cercone President, Sanigest International I n Cambodia, the study is in progress and hence this meeting is particularly useful for confirming and advancing some of the concerns regarding the questionnaire. The presentation gives an overview of the study designs, some of the key issues regarding mapping and data as well as the key issues and challenges being faced along the way. The objective is to carry out a socio-economic impact survey looking at HIV versus non-HIV households in terms of specific outcomes such as: Deepened understanding of the socio-economic impact 1. of HIV on households. Estimation of the overall economic impact on Cambodia. 2. Identifying appropriate policies and programmes to address 3. the socio-economic impact of HIV. To make recommendations to create an enabling social environment 4. for people living with HIV in Cambodia. The main concern of the study is a deep integration between the results of the study and the translations of the results into policy changes. The study has been under- taken with the support of UNDP and UNAIDS through a consulting company called Sanigest International and a local partner, Center for Advanced Study (Cambodia). The team is working in consultation with different stakeholders (Civil Society, donors, Government of Cambodia, and Development Finance Institutions). The overall design is similar to the other studies. The economic impact of HIV that the study is seeking to measure is at both micro and macro levels. HIV affects the individuals, households, the demography, mortality, morbidity the labour market, the private sector, the government and ultimately the economy. This structure or 25 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific framework has been used to try and develop the questionnaire, and to ensure that all the key elements are captured. So far, none of the studies have discussed about the impact on businesses risks. The impact on household can be grouped into three categories - economic, social and health. It can be then broken down to create what essentially are the modules for income and employment issues, social support programmes, consumption and savings, health status, education, knowledge and awareness, gender, and household coping mechanisms. This study has two addi- tional areas of intervention-economic shock and food security. How these are to be included into the overall framework is yet to be worked out. The main research questions are: How does HIV affect the human capital accumulation in a household, includ- 1. ing education, nutrition and health outcomes? Some questions on nutrition (body mass index and growth) are being asked so that the differences in some of these key measures between HIV and non-HIV households can be seen. What is the direct impact of HIV on poverty, social structure, migration and 2. inequality including specific issues of gender and access to financial services? What is the impact of HIV on labour supply and wages due to morbidity, 3. death and discrimination? How the level and pattern of consumption compare for HIV households and 4. non-HIV households?

There will be a number of questions on stigma. The questionnaire will be fairly detailed and include questions on consumption, education, assets, financial burden, coping mechanisms, government and non-governmental support, migration, participation and awareness in general, and the issues related to HIV positive women. The study has three components - the survey design and set up, data analysis and policy outcomes. The final stage is the dissemination plan and outreach through media. The study started in October and by November the draft questionnaire was ready and some of the initial stakeholder consultations have been completed. In Decem- ber, the questionnaire was submitted for ethical clearance, but was turned down 26 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion for technical reasons. The research team is hopeful of getting ethical clearance in the next few weeks and commence the survey immediately. Attempt has been made to design the study consistent with the studies in India as well as China. Attempt has also been made to be consistent with the Cambodian socio-economic survey. Regarding the questionnaire, both English and Khmer translations are being used to capture the nuances. The Cambodian household questionnaire can be found in the companion CD-ROM The Process The sample is to be selected randomly from the registry at the ART/OI sites, which have information on HIV households. Home-based teams and interviewers will be used to carry out the survey. Twenty out of 24 provinces are being covered, and hence unlike the other surveys which are taking a targeted approach of selecting the low and high prevalence areas, this study will go in for a national representation. A number of power estimates have been done to try and improve the precision in terms of the size of the sample. If the home based teams were to apply the survey instrument, supervision will be very important. Across the board, the various studies have a sample size ranging from 1000 to 3000. For example, if the difference in the hospitalization rates between the HIV and non-HIV households are to be assessed, what should be the sample size? For the hospitalization rates, which are a fairly infrequent, (e.g. only 5 percent people need hospitalization) by increasing the sample size from 1000 to 2000, there will be a huge gain. However, an increase in the sample size from 2000 to 2500, the gain is small, and from 2500 to 3000, it is very small. On the other hand, in the case of the household savings rate, there is no improvement in the results by considering above 250 households. Hence it is very important to model specifically based on the parameters one is looking for and try to determine the optimum sample size rather than setting an overall sample size which is generally done. The initial sample size was 2000 HIV households and 2000 control households. After running a number of power estimates with greater precision, and using the results from China and India, the calibrated model ended up with a much bigger sample of HIV households rather than the control households because more precision was required with regard to HIV households. Secondly, because of the consistency with the Cambodia socio-economic survey (CSES), it is felt that the CSES can be used as well to counter the small sample size of the control households. A number of other 27 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific questions, for example on the education and income levels, can be compared with the CSES and it should be possible to make the comparison between the HIV house- holds and the non-HIV households. The study is also assuming the response rate to be 90 percent. It is also important to know about the replacement rates. I will have five data sources: the primary data collected from the ART/OI site registries, \u201crandom walk\u201d mapping to select the control groups for which information will be taken from administrative data from registered lists, the national CSES10 to validate the results for non-HIV households, focus groups to understand better some of the key results for specific groups and finally, direct interviews for higher income groups. In India and China, the high income group was under-represented. The process of ethical review has not been very transparent and is very time consum- ing. The quality of the registry of the PLHIV is not really known. Though the study team has been assured of it, they are not sure whether they can randomize the selection of the households.

The study is trying to cover 20 of the 24 provinces, which obviously increases logistical complexity and the cost especially given the short time frame. Rains could slow down the implementation significantly and increase the cost. Discussion The key questions raised during the discussion included if the study should use the traditional way of measuring stigma on a 5-point scale or change it to make it methodologically consistent with other studies and how does one handle the recall bias. In the study in India, selection of HIV households was not based on random sampling and hence the question of response-rate did not arise. But in the Chinese study, there was the response-rate and replacement-rates. Regarding the selection of the control group, in the Indian case, once the villages were identified, a listing of the households was done to collect information on house- hold characteristics such as occupation and income. If the number of households so 10 Combodia Socio-Economic Survey 28 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion obtained was more than three for every positive household, the stochastic manner was followed. If the quality of registry of HIV household was not satisfactory, other lists either with the government or some other group was looked at. Regarding the power of test sampling, the Chinese study used the formula where sampling error and confidence interval were given. Therefore, the power of testing was implicit. Increasing the sample size beyond a level doesn\u2019t result in any scientific gain but rising costs. The Chinese method takes that into account. On the issue of high income sample, the study in Cambodia is not proposing to achieve a representative sample to include them in any significant way, but to in- terview 5-6 high income persons who can be identified through personal contacts and use it to make anecdotal references to see potential differences between HIV in high income households Vs HIV in middle or low income households. In terms of the power estimates, a linear programming was done to find out the optimum sample size to get a minimum confidence level and use the evidence from the previous studies. 29 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific HIV and food security in Asia - preliminary findings from the existing studies and implications for future studies Kazuyuki Uji UNDP Regional Centre In Colombo, Sri Lanka T his is an unexplored area and the socio-economic impact studies that are be- ing undertaken now can certainly provide a great opportunity to deepen the understanding of the subject. The presentation is to explore possible questions or possible analysis that could be considered for these studies. Based on a preliminary review of existing data from within Asia, the presentation would try to look in to the issue of HIV and food security. In the last few years in the Asia-pacific region, there has been a sharp increase in the price of food and fuel. The extent of price increase has been particularly sharp and some people call the phenomenon the \u2018Silent Tsunami\u2019 denoting massive possible impacts of hunger across the region. There is a sudden steep increase in the food prices. Given these circumstances of rising food prices, people have started to think about the issue of hunger or food insecurity in the context of HIV. The primary review of existing literature indicates that the linkages of HIV and food insecurity have been firmly established in Africa. In Africa, food insecurity is acting both as a potential cause as well as consequence of vulnerability to HIV. However, in Asia these linkages have not been extensively explored, despite the fact that for example in Cambodia, the overall food programme categorizes the HIV-affected households as food-insecure. In addition, food insecurity could cause massive clinical impact on the HIV positive people and the affected households. For example, the malnutrition triggered by the food insecurity increases the risk of OIs as well as fastens the rate of disease progression to AIDS, increases the risks of vertical transmission, and renders children with HIV, who are prone to severe malnutrition, at high risk. It is known to obstruct the absorption of HIV medicines, which is particularly concerning because ARV is a lifeline of the positive people to stay healthy and keep working to support children and family.

Given 31 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific these extraordinary circumstances of rising food prices and the compelling evidence from Africa and potential far-reaching impacts of food insecurity in the context of HIV, there is a need for some information from within Asia. In this regard, a preliminary study was commissioned to the Mahidol University, Thailand to examine the existing data from within Asia to find out possible linkages or information on this subject. Two types of studies were conducted. First was the collection of household studies which had HIV-affected as well as non-HIV affected households including the HIV household studies from India and China and a house- hold study in Thailand, which was conducted in 1998. Other studies used were the Cambodian household study of 2003 and 2004, published last year in the AIDS Journal; the Vietnam HIV poverty study (commissioned by UNDP Vietnam);Cambodia Food Support Programme evaluation report commissioned by USAID; and the Tamil Nadu study on the socio-economic impact of ART. This is the only cohort study and the rest are cross-sectional. Of course, there are so many limitations because of the reliance on existing data. A major limitation was that none of the studies was actually designed to specifically target the food insecurity issues. Despite these major limitations, there are interesting findings which may have use- ful implications for the socio-economic impact studies. Though the data cannot be compared across the board, the data on the per capita monthly food expenditure in India, Thailand and China show that sometimes there are specific variations in terms of food expenditure. For example, in India the HIV affected households had actually spent more as compared with non-HIV affected households and the report speculates that HIV affected households would spend more on nutritional food to stay healthy. On the other hand, in Thailand, it is the opposite where the HIV affected households spent less as compared to the control or non-HIV affected households. From the food security perspective, in the context of rising food prices, one could argue that HIV af- fected households in India could be more vulnerable because the rising food prices may force these households to cut down the food consumption needed to stay healthy. On the other hand, one could also argue that the HIV affected households in Thailand spending less could be considered more vulnerable, because of the rising medical expenses for the HIV affected households compared to non-HIV households may have pushed down the priority on food which has been strained by the rising prices. The basis of the data alone no conclusive statement can be made. One way of ad- dressing this issue is to examine whether the food expenditure patterns or levels have changed after diagnosis or disclosure, and if yes, when. This is subject to recall bias, but may be interesting to explore. Another interesting finding came from the Cambodian household study (2003). The data shows that the percentage of households that pur- 32 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion chased less food to pay for their healthcare is higher for the HIV affected households, suggesting that the HIV affected households are more vulnerable. The same study also demonstrates that children and adolescents in HIV affected households recorded some food security issues such as experiencing more hunger, and consuming fewer meals a day. This shows how food reduction is used as a coping mechanism and how it could impact the weaker or younger family members. To address this issue, the pos- sible question and analysis that could be considered is that how many meals they have a day. This could be directed at children, adolescents or female members if they are included in the study. One could also go into the quality of the meals. The Cambodia Food Support Evaluation Report shows some potential benefits of food support to HIV affected households. The study shows much lower medical expenditure for the HIV affected households in the intervention which received food support as compared with the control group which did not receive any such food support. The data from the same study showing lower medical expenses for the intervention group also shows that the percentage of people living with HIV and reporting at least one infection in the past two weeks is lower for the intervention group and this definitely reduces the need for hospital visits, doctor\u2019s fees or medicines.

Therefore, in any case, these findings could indicate that the food support programme for HIV affected households could be affected at least for the positive members of the family or in many cases, the adults. However, in the Cambodian households study a very different picture about the at- tractiveness of the food support for the HIV affected households emerges: there are more security risks for children and adolescents in the HIV affected households. In Cambodia, more than 80% of these households are receiving food assistance and these food security risks occur despite the fact that overwhelming majority of HIV affected households were actually receiving food assistance. These findings compel us to look at the quality of the food assistance programmes. For example, it raises questions like what food support did they receive? Did they consume all the support received? Did they receive any training/information on diet and nutrition along with the food sup- port? One could also look into the potential impact of the food support, the change in the food consumption or expenditure patterns as a result of food support. The Tamil Nadu cohort study on the socio-economic impact of the ART on the adult PLHIV in the Tamil Nadu Family Care Continuum Programme appears to show that ART initiation is somehow connected with the increasing food consumption. However, since the details of the study are not available, no statistical significance could be assessed. 33 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific Increased food consumption levels seem to be more of an indirect consequence of initiation of ART which made the people healthy, and stay on their jobs for a steady income. The possible interplay between the ART and food security may be an area worth exploring because more and more people in Asia are starting on ART. Suggestions for further analysis/possible additional questions for the survey It may be interesting to run a regression to see which variables may be associ- D ated with food security risks and food support. To capture changes in the household food consumption after detecting the D HIV status, including intra-household differences, following questions can be tried.

Palanivel UNDP Regional Centre In Colombo, Sri Lanka U nfortunately, no serious work linking the financial crisis with HIV/AIDS has been done so far. The impact of the financial crisis would vary from country to country, depending on the country\u2019s economic integration with the rest of the world. For example, compared to countries which are isolated, countries such as Singapore, China, Malaysia and India which have done very well on the globaliza- tion process are likely to suffer more. Therefore the extent of economic impact will determine who is going to be vulnerable or who is going to be non-vulnerable. The second factor is that the impact will depend upon the kind of depth and length of recession in the developed countries, their policy responses, and the economic characteristics of the countries. The third factor is how the Asian countries will respond. The impact of the financial crisis is going to spill over to Asia, primarily through the following channels: the first one is the financial contagion and spillover effects of the current stock market.

Roughly about a fourth of the Asia\u2019s GDP is based on exports to the Western countries. Asian countries also have a relatively higher financial integration with western countries in terms of not only the FDI but also the portfolio investment. The western portfolio investment in Asia has been on the rise for the last 10-15 years. In the less developed countries such as Nepal, Bangladesh and even the middle income countries such as Sri Lanka and Philippines, Remittances are an important source for household consumption as well as for macroeconomic stability. Tourism is also an important source for certain countries such as Maldives. Countries such as Bhutan may face problems regarding ODAs. It looks likely that Asia will be significantly affected. 35 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific The economic implications in terms of GDP are very significant. The global growth rate decelerated from 5.2% in 2007 to 3.4% in 2008, and in 2009 it is going to be only 0.5%, which is about 4-5% decline since 2007. Asia may also witness a similar decline, i.e. half of what has been achieved in 2007. Asia was able to achieve about 9-10% growth in 2007 and 9% in 2008. In 2007, China was able to grow at 12-13% while India recorded a growth rate of 9%. But in 2009, Asia will be lucky if it is able to achieve 5% growth. The growth is expected to remain at or above the rates observed during the Asian financial crisis. Impact on the labour market is felt not only in Asia but also at the global level. Unemployment is increasing dramatically in the last 2 years. The number of unem- ployed people in Asia has risen from 79 million in 2007 to 84 million in 2008 and is expected to go up to 94 million in 2009. Even though unemployment is increasing, Asian countries are still able to offer good number of employment opportunities compared to other developing countries. For example, in 2008, more than half of world\u2019s new employment was created in Asia. Unfortunately most of this employment was not remunerated properly. 47% of the employed (over 250 million) in South Asia are classified as working poor, compared to the global average of 20%. On the poverty side, Asia still has about 900 million poor people, even though dur- ing the last 15-20 years Asia has experienced a dramatic decline not only in terms of reducing poverty incidence but also by lifting millions of people out of poverty. But during this financial crisis, the fuel and food prices put together, the two exter- nal shocks are expected to push roughly 100 million people below poverty line i.e. roughly about 60-70 million people minimum on the financial side, another 50-60 million due to food and fuel prices. With about 100 million additional people below the poverty line, the total could go up from 900 million to a billion. In all the developing regions, during last 2-3 years the number of people affected by hunger is increasing dramatically from roughly about 800 to about 963 million people, which is an increase of about 150 million people. Most of this increase is taking place in Asia and so the financial crisis could create further problems on this front. In terms of policy response and in order to mitigate the impact, many countries, both developed and developing, across the world have taken strong fiscal and monetary stimulus policy packages. This fiscal stimulus alone now roughly constitutes about 1.5% of the GDP - East Asia still has a large fiscal space to boost the economy, but unfortunately many South Asian countries have relatively higher fiscal deficit. The monetary policy has also changed dramatically. Even in 2008, it was becoming more 36 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion complex because until September, many countries tried to use the monetary policies to control inflation such as the food and fuel inflation. But in the last four months they went to other extreme: they went on expanding monetary policies to support the economic growth under the global economic outlook. In terms of policy challenges, many countries will have lower export growth, lower economic growth and higher unemployment rate. Similar is the case with the pov- erty rates. The key issue is the possible duration of the global recession. If it exceeds six months, the region will face serious problems.

For e.g. during the 1990s, Japan experienced a similar economic slowdown and the Japanese government imposed various fiscal measures, but the economy did not respond. Therefore, until the structural issues in banking and finance sectors are addressed, the fiscal stimulus packages are not likely to work. In terms of household level impact, in informal sectors such as con- struction, tourism, textile and garments, people will be affected more badly com- pared to the people working in the agriculture sector. Restoring growth is vital and there is a need to initiate strong social programmes which could help children stay in school and ensure that the health and other basic needs of the general popula- tion are addressed. In this regard, UNDP should promote/encourage countries to institute conditional social development programmes similar to India\u2019s employment guarantee programme. Discussion People in rural areas can get affected indirectly by the loss of jobs in urban areas. In urban areas, a large number of people working in sectors such as tourism, construc- tion, textile and garments are migrants from rural areas and when they lose jobs they will go back to the villages. In India, for e.g. hundreds of people working in gem and jewellery industry in Gujarat, are moving back to rural areas. It is a very good opportunity for using the stimulus packages of the government for social sector since private sector is not stepping in because of the high risk and profit reduc- tion. However there are doubts about the absorption capacity of the social sector. Government support to HIV/AIDS may probably decline more allocation may go to addressing the financial crisis. The HIV/AIDS household is likely to be affected mainly through three primary in- struments/channels: employment, support of national/international NGOs PLHIV, treatment programmes etc, and government support. There is a need to examine the fiscal stimulus package announced by various countries and see the nature of 37 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific social safety net provided to the HIV households. In this regard, the findings from the China study about the different types of support to the HIV households and their impact are very interesting. From Cambodia, there is evidence on the wide rang- ing impact of food support. What would be the impact on agricultural production? Studies in Uganda have shown that HIV households tend to shift from multi-crops to single crops resulting in serious drop in household incomes. 38 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion Spousal Transmission of HIV An example focused on intimate partner violence and HIV infection: findings from a national sample of Indian husband-wife Dyads (Presented via tele-conference) Michele R.

Silverman, PhD16 Harvard School of Public Health, Boston Introduction Relation between IPV and HIV I t is estimated that one in three women worldwide face violence at the hands of a partner. The abused women demonstrate high levels of HIV probably because of limited ability to refuse sex and negotiate condom use. Further, behavioral interventions are successful with non-abused women and are found ineffective for abused women. Young people in the age group of 15-24 years constitute almost half of new STI infections each year. Perhaps the most telling evidence is that suggesting that elements of STI/HIV protection are outside the domain of control of women in abusive relationships. Some evidence from qualitative work with women and prior work among men suggest that IPV relates to coercive sexual risk. Abusive men report more risky sexual behavior and demonstrate higher prevalence of self-reported STI. Men\u2019s abusive and sexual risk behaviors may elevate their own STI/HIV risk and facilitate transmission to female partners. The available data have prompted increasing recognition of pathways by which male violence against female partners may both be a marker for and directly facilitate (i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7024b95-75c0-4f30-aca7-e1579e959e7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7024b95-75c0-4f30-aca7-e1579e959e7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific - Report on Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a2bdfe8c7d237c65ad7b8151b4443c682d714da50e32f7ad4276cf71aca64cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "7629126d-bf0f-412a-816a-0837cc59938f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3aca8e3258bca5d29c2d66c450b705ee188af494baf7fa7628b3923625d7c7e6"}}, "hash": "6829dde0a1e792693290fffba89670c17a12ff2f81a90064904999e0f832c53b", "text": "11 Harvard School of Public Health, (Boston, MA, USA) 12 Harvard School of Public Health, (Boston, MA, USA) 13 Boston University of Public Health (Boston, MA, USA) 14 Population Council (New Delhi, India) 15 National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Indian Council for Medical Research (Mumbai, India) 16 Harvard School of Public Health, (Boston, MA, USA) 39 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific be a mechanism for) sexual transmission of HIV to women in India and elsewhere.

However, unprotected forced sex or unprotected coercive sex perpetrated by abusive men within marriage may constitute a direct mechanism, possibly facilitating HIV trans- mission to wives. In India, heterosexual sex is considered to be the dominant route for transmission of HIV. Married women were once considered low-risk because of the limited sexual risk behavior among women. Despite reduction in prevalence of HIV infection among the general population of India, women account for a rising percentage of all cases with husbands' risk behavior described as the major source. Women comprise 40% of the reported 2.5 million cases of HIV in India. Intimate partner violence (IPV) has been described as being associated with heterosexual transmission of HIV to women in India and elsewhere. The above study was undertaken with the objective of assessing the relationship between experiencing IPV and the occurrence of HIV infection in a nationally representative sample of married Indian women tested for HIV. In this first national population-based study of the relationship of husbands' violence against wives to the latter\u2019s HIV status (as indicated via diagnostic testing), married Indian women who experienced both physical and sexual IPV demonstrated HIV infec- tion prevalence approximately four times greater than that of non abused women. Importantly, women's HIV infection was not related to their own sexual risk behaviors (condom use and multiple partnering). These findings support descriptions of the Indian HIV epidemic among married women as driven primarily by the behavior of men and highlight the potential role of men's abusive behaviors in posing HIV risk to their female partners. As abusive men have been found to demonstrate both higher levels of sexual risk behavior and, as an inherent aspect of their abuse, higher levels of control over sex and sexual protection, women experiencing IPV face \"double jeopardy\" regarding risk for HIV infection from male partners (i.e. they are likely to hold little control over sexual protection with a high-risk male partner). Thus, IPV may represent both a risk marker and risk factor for increased HIV prevalence among women. Current findings of Indian women's elevated HIV infection based on their reports of physical and sexual violence from their husbands demonstrate the need for further research to confirm the specific potential mechanisms and to disentangle the roles of abusive men's risky behavior outside the relationship and sexual violence within the relationship in posing HIV risk to their female partners. 40 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion Aims of the study Are abusive men more likely to be infected? 1. D Assess the linkage between IPV perpetration with men\u2019s HIV infection Does IPV modify women\u2019s HIV risk, based on exposure to husband HIV? 2. Assess women\u2019s risk of HIV infection based on exposure to husband\u2019s HIV D Assess role of IPV in modifying women\u2019s risk D The present study attempts to advance the current state of knowledge by assessing the prevalence of HIV infection among married Indian women and evaluating the relationship of women's experiences of physical and sexual violence from husbands to their HIV infection. Data The present study is based on data from the National Family Health Survey -3 (NFHS-3), a national survey conducted in all 29 states of India from November 2005 to August 2006 by the International Institute for Population Sciences and Macro International. A nationally representative household-based sample was created via a stratified, multistage cluster sampling strategy. The analytic sample was limited to currently married female participants for whom both outcome (HIV test results) and exposure data (IPV) were available, and the final sample consisted of 20429 couples. The predictor variable considered was the physical or sexual IPV and was based on 9-item assessment via women\u2019s self report. The outcome variable considered was HIV and was assessed on biological sample collection and lab testing for HIV-1. In addition, demographic covariants considered were age, education, wealth index and religion while sexual risk was assessed by condom non-use, multiple past-year sex partners and male circumcision. Step -1 of Analysis In order to analyse IPV as a risk marker for high risk male partner, men\u2019s risk of HIV acquisition outside the marital relationship based on their perpetration of IPV was assessed. To allow for greatest clarity and empirical strength in assessing the extent to which men\u2019s IPV perpetration relates to acquisition of HIV infection outside the cur- rent marital relationship, as hypothesized, this analysis was restricted to men whose female marital partners were not infected with HIV, i.e., those men who could not have acquired HIV via their female partners (n=20,362). For this 67 men whose wives were HIV+ (n=20362) were removed to minimize", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "238290ba-852e-410a-be53-bf0297e6be8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "238290ba-852e-410a-be53-bf0297e6be8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific - Report on Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/socio-economic-impact-hiv-household-levels-asia-and-pacific-report-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92aeec2b8741afc21106260133a225891c82e223c5372d9513eb4b838a0aa81c"}}, "hash": "92aeec2b8741afc21106260133a225891c82e223c5372d9513eb4b838a0aa81c", "text": "the likelihood that they were infected by their wives. Men\u2019s HIV prevalence based on IPV perpetration was found to be 1.90 times that of non-IPV giving greater strength to the suggestion that abusive men\u2019s sexual risk behavior outside that relationship is leading them to acquire HIV. 41 Socio-economic impact of HIV at the household levels in Asia and the Pacific Step - 2 of Analysis In order to analyse IPV as a risk factor for HIV transmission, women\u2019s risk of HIV infection based on exposure to husband\u2019s HIV was assessed. This was stratified by presence of IPV and also formally tested for interactive effect of exposure to both husband\u2019s HIV and IPV. Associations of husband\u2019s HIV with women\u2019s HIV, stratified by IPV shows nearly 7 fold greater risk of acquiring HIV.

D This could be achieved by Sexual risk reduction targeting IPV perpetrators and behavioral interventions D to prevent IPV may reduce secondary HIV transmission Because of relatively strong gender-based constraints on women's sexual behavior in South Asia, Indian women have little opportunity and great costs associated with sexual risk-taking; thus, their HIV infection is likely to be driven to a greater extent by husbands' behavior (that is, extramarital sexual risk and marital sexual violence). Further, IPV may pose a relatively greater HIV threat to Indian married women based on a lack of communication regarding sex being a culturally prescribed marital norm, posing additional barriers to both discussion of sexual risk and women's resistance to sexual violence. Thus, consideration of cultural and geographic contexts in such investigations is likely to be critical to advancing understanding of how men's IPV, men's sexual risk, and women's sexual risk interact in relating to HIV infection across populations. Current evidence of elevated HIV prevalence among abused women holds critical implications for practice. Clinicians should incorporate inquiries to women regarding 42 RepoRT on TeChniCal ConsulTaTion experiences of partner violence, particularly those working in settings focused on care for STIs, as such infection may be considered a marker for elevated risk of both IPV and HIV. As important as identifying abused women, however, is education regard- ing the nature of their risk and assistance to reduce this risk; thus, greater support for community-based programs supporting women surviving IPV is also required. Further, clinical programs addressing STI/HIV among men should include a focus on IPV as a potential transmission risk for their female partners. However, what will likely be critical to the ability of such programs to reduce men's risk of transmission is the modification of gender norms that have been described as supporting both sexual risk and IPV.

In the second half of the day, there were discussions on developing a common outline/framework for final country reports and other steps including outreach and advocacy. MODEL QUESTIONNAIRE: BRAINSTORMING AND ANALySES NEXT STEPS DAy 2 I. Brainstorming on the Questionnaire T he participants of the Consultation were divided into three groups and each group discussed the questions that could be included in the survey to capture the impact of three emerging issues on the HIV households: the financial crisis and social safety nets, food security and intimate partner transmission. The groups also paid attention to additional issues such as remittances and migration. The groups agreed to following changes/additions to the questionnaire.

It is equally well known that the media, as the prime shaper of \u2018the world outside and the pictures in our heads,\u20191 can be one of the most powerful tools for fighting stigma and discrimination, and creating an enabling environment. Over the course of the HIV epidemic\u2019s 30-year history, notable strides have been made globally to reduce stigma and discrimination towards people living with HIV (PLHIV) and key affected populations (KAPs) such as female sex workers (FSW), men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender (TG) people and people who use drugs (PWUD). These efforts have included the development of supportive legislation and policies, advocacy and community mobilization through networks and collectives, and media campaigns featuring celebrities and societal leaders. In addition, strategic and sustained efforts with the news media have not only facilitated increased and improved coverage, but have also served to advocate for changes in policies and programmes, and of equal importance, to fighting stigma and discrimination relating to key affected populations. However, in Sri Lanka, the news media continue to play a less effective and arguably damaging role in their coverage on HIV and KAPs due to a number of complex factors. For example, the national prevalence of HIV is low at 0.1%, so related programming and community mobilization is limited; HIV therefore may not be considered a topic of great importance to the media industry, and may not align with their political and business interests. Some political and media observers of Sri Lanka believe that the decades-long civil war has had long- term impacts on the state of media and practice of journalism including on issues of ethics, autonomy and regulation. Many also believe that the fundamental quality of journalism in Sri Lanka is poor, with most journalists having little knowledge of the basic codes of ethics underpinning the profession. This becomes especially problematic in the case of HIV, with media coverage of the issue routinely violating the rights of PLHIV and key affected populations in respect to confidentiality and anonymity. The criminalization and overall stigmatization of sex work, homosexuality and drug use in the country further fuel incorrect and damaging coverage if members of the media see themselves as a moral \u2018watchdog\u2019 reporting in the \u2018public interest\u2019. An example of this problem occurred in 2011 with the Rivira newspaper\u2019s sustained targeting of Companions on a Journey (CoJ), an NGO working with MSM in Colombo, thus forcing the temporary closure of some NGOs, and further driving KAPs underground. The episode led the government, UN agencies, NGOs, journalists and media analysts to examine the role of the news media in reporting on KAPs, and to initiate measures to strengthen the role of the media in stemming the epidemic and protecting the rights of key affected populations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2bcd5b63-03e9-4548-97f1-72f769028f2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bcd5b63-03e9-4548-97f1-72f769028f2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Stigma, Discrimination and Key Affected Populations: Strengthening the Role of Media Advocacy in Sri Lanka through a Critical Analysis of News Media Coverage", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9aa8f04933103c638980f13dbd59e1fbadac0adfb362aa56ac092aef7ec2fb00"}, "2": {"node_id": "90803c48-f127-4e88-aa97-a52a5099a9b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b18f3bcb0d19e5044592ef9292708ae2ba2b31a462dc134e649d20aa88f40234"}}, "hash": "b967456102383092fe10382de0c9732efdcd7487725e6ac563ebf754b7c7e44a", "text": "This study, therefore, is a first step towards enabling Sri Lanka to play its role in achieving the global UNAIDS-propelled strategic vision of zero discrimination, zero infections and zero deaths caused by HIV through an examination of the role of media in relationship to the stigmatization of key affected populations and people living with HIV in Sri Lanka.

Provide recommendations for strengthening the role of media advocacy in creating an enabling environment for HIV prevention, treatment and care. The study uses a multipronged design including: a desk review of HIV policies and programmes, and legislative and media frameworks; a content analysis of print media coverage on HIV and KAPs across 17 newspapers in English, Sinhala and Tamil between January 2010 and June 2012; and finally, semi-structured interviews (SSIs) with a range of cross-cutting stakeholders including the HIV sector (government, local NGOs, UN agencies), the media industry (journalists, media houses), media regulatory bodies and journalism institutions. The study draws from theoretical frameworks such as the agenda-setting function of the news media and sociological analysis of \u2018Grand Narratives\u2019 in studying media representations of key affected populations. \u2018Framing\u2019 analysis is applied to the study of media coverage in the form of positioning of articles, formats, choice of headlines, words, phrases and visual imagery. The study is especially timely, given that efforts are currently underway in Sri Lanka to develop and finalize the second National Strategic Plan (NSP) on HIV for 2012\u20132016. key Findings from content Analysis volume Of a total of 2440 articles, the maximum coverage was on people who use drugs (78%), followed by FSWs (14%) and PLHIV (5%), with MSM and TG accounting for the least coverage (1.7% and 0.9% respectively). What is especially of concern is the low coverage of MSM and TG populations, given that MSM currently account for almost half the HIV prevalence in the country. This is juxtaposed with the high coverage of people who use drugs, even though IDUs, who form a very small subset of this larger group, account for only 0.2% of the HIV transmission in the country. Format A bulk of the coverage (92.9%) was in the form of daily news reports, which were an undifferentiated mass of coverage on raids and arrests. Features, which can provide more nuanced and human interest coverage, accounted for only 6%; analytical columns/editorials which can play a critical role in facilitating informed debate and advocacy constituted only 0.5% of the coverage. Placement Overwhelmingly, the coverage was found mostly in the Crime section (90%), with Society (12%) and Health (1.8%) trailing way behind. The low coverage in other sections, such as the Business/Finance pages (0.2%), indicates that HIV has not been effectively \u2018mainstreamed\u2019 in the media, i.e. that the media understands and reports on the ways that HIV affects society beyond being considered only a health issue. content Most of the stories (87%) fell into the \u2018law enforcement\u2019 category, followed by \u2018Health/HIV program and services\u2019 trailing way behind (5%) along with \u2018socio-cultural issues and personal stories\u2019 (4.8%). Stigma and discrimination (1.6%) and sexuality (0.9%) were the least covered categories. coverage of kAPs PWUDs accounted for the maximum coverage among KAPs (78%), despite the low contribution of this group to the transmission dynamics in the country. This was followed by FSWs (14.1%) and PLHIV (5%). In sharp contrast, coverage was lowest for MSM (1.7%) and TG (0.5%), even though MSM account for 12.3% of the HIV transmission. The disproportionate focus on people who use drugs suggests that the 7 impetus for the coverage is not HIV, but other factors such as the criminal status of their activities or an interest, possibly sensationalistic, in the lives and activities of this KAP. representation of kAPs Almost half the coverage (46.3%) presented MSM and TG as \u2018immoral\u2019, while female sex workers were primarily positioned both as \u2018criminals\u2019 and \u2018victims\u2019 (44.1% and 32.5% respectively). Coverage of people who use drugs, who account for the maximum coverage, was overwhelmingly that of criminals (96%).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "279a07ba-0e48-4445-a4ee-e25c3ecf86c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "279a07ba-0e48-4445-a4ee-e25c3ecf86c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Stigma, Discrimination and Key Affected Populations: Strengthening the Role of Media Advocacy in Sri Lanka through a Critical Analysis of News Media Coverage", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68108ee5b6307006581f51dd5a2543e4012a94aa867455822bc2b406e5179859"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb9553d5-b054-4e26-bc69-9af269334fac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47e8f0fc55066380183bf196b68b934d3d0b1b093ae76570dfdc04f1cf4fe1c9"}}, "hash": "8662186c3ef2bb179fabb706cbcf6062f22b814450424c9b9287312d84f66858", "text": "While data on PLHIV fell mostly in the \u2018positive\u2019 category (36%), closer examination indicates that much of it was event-centric coverage such as World AIDS Day (WAD) rather than a positive depiction of PLHIV as confronting and overcoming everyday challenges. About 27% of the coverage on PLHIV positioned them as \u2018victims\u2019 doomed to die tragic deaths, with little agency to alter their destinies.

Of the remaining 12 stories quoting key affected populations, nine quotes were from FSW, two from MSM, and one from a transgender person. key trends and Patterns Overall, the volume of media coverage on HIV and KAPs is low in Sri Lanka \u2014 a direct result of the low HIV prevalence in Sri Lanka and its correlation with limited programming and community mobilization. In addition, as is the case with news media in most parts of the world, health coverage is given low priority compared to politics and business. However, while a relatively low volume of coverage is understandable in a low-prevalence country, what is of concern is the quality of coverage, and the clear violation of basic reporting ethics and standards. Identified in this study are \u2018Grand Narratives\u2019, stories that are told that tie together historical meaning, experience and knowledge in a way that legitimizes society and a particular set of cultural beliefs. In the context of this report, elements of the grand narratives that we identified, and that the news media retells, perpetuates and promotes are: homosexuality and transsexuality are dangerous; they threaten the long-standing Buddhist culture of Sri Lanka; and they represent a \u2018pariah\u2019 western culture that is perverted. Homosexuality is a mask for paedophilia, involves older Caucasian men \u2018preying\u2019 on young innocent boys and is an illness that can be treated with bizarre cures. Similarly, female sex workers and people who use drugs are located in stories where AIDS is the punishment for sin. While there are voices that differ to and dissent from these Grand Narratives \u2014 editorials advocating for the repealing of \u2018Victorian legislation\u2019 relating to sex work, features on adoptions by same-sex couples, or first-person testimonials from gay rights activists \u2014 they are insignificant in numbers and strength. Notions of morality and the way that society views sex and sexuality will affect reporting on this area in the news media. It can be surmised that sex and sexuality in Sri Lanka are viewed negatively, leading to an absence of coverage, and that when written about, are done so in a way that is sensational and does not accurately reflect the broader society. Thus, an informed and open discourse on sex and sexuality (which received a mere 0.9% of the coverage) is absent in newspapers, even in health columns. It is replaced instead by salacious tabloid-style reporting that includes themes such as the licentious lifestyles of the wealthy and promiscuous, gay \u2018sex parties,\u2019 full-page prurient \u2018expos\u00e9s\u2019 on students leading double lives as sex workers, and cigarette-smoking Caucasian \u2018prostitutes\u2019 in archetypal skimpy red dresses that represent the threat of western depravity. The criminal status of homosexuality, sex work and drug use contributes to the stigmatization of these groups.

Set in a world of vice, violence and crime, these stories portray dire destinies awaiting those who are at odds with prevailing norms and social order. Headlines highlight arrests and raids, while images show uniformed police who restore law and order.
