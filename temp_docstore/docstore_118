Project Summary Feasibility: Brown howler monkeys form social groups with varying size. Although groups present hierarchies with one central male, the mating activities of other resident males are tolerated. They have flexible folivorous-frugivorous feeding behavior. Such habits allow the species to persist in small and degraded forest fragments, thus they are considered as potential candidates for early-stage reintroductions in a refaunation program. REFAUNA is a refaunation program (i.e. trophic rewilding, Svenning et al., 2015; Fernandez et al., 2017) that has started with the reintroduction of the Red-rumped agouti in 2010, followed by the Brown howler monkey in 2015. Both reintroductions were conducted at Tijuca National Park (TNP), with the main goal to restore ecological processes lost due to defaunation. TNP vegetation is composed of typical Atlantic rain forest species along with some exotic species. The habitat is considered suitable for howler monkeys, and presumed causes of extinction (deforestation and hunting) are no longer present. TNP is the most visited protected area in Brazil, with more than 2.6 million visitors in 2018. On the one hand, reintroductions in this urban protected area provide an interesting opportunity for engaging a wide public on conservation biology. On the other hand, this large number of visitors could be challenging when reintroducing social and charismatic species. Implementation: Six individuals were released in TNP from 2015 to mid-2019. The first group consisted on four individuals (sex ratio 1:1), being two captive- born and two wild-born obtained from seizure. Prior to translocation, all individuals were held at Centro de Primatologia do Rio de Janeiro (CPRJ) for health exams, dietary re-education and establishment of group cohesion. We only observed one Transporting howlers to release pen \u00a9 Lu\u00edsa Genes 170 agonistic behavior during quarantine, from the central male to a juvenile (not included in the group). We translocated the four individuals to a 4 x 2 x 2 m soft release pen at TNP, where they stayed for three weeks prior to release. Every individual was monitored to check for possible wounds or abnormal behavior. After release, supplementary feeding was offered through a fruit box first placed on top of the pen, and then hanged 10 m high at the canopy. We continued supplementing the animals for two months after release. Two months after the first release, the captive-bred male had to be retrieved back to CPRJ due to interaction with visitors and abnormal behavior. The other male started presenting the same behavior and we decided testing another approach: releasing it in a site with lower touristic visitation. One year after the first release, the captive-bred female also showed interaction issues with visitors. In this occasion we were able to bring another male from CPRJ to TNP, the fifth individual. They stayed together in the pen further away from most visited areas for two weeks in late 2016 and were then released. The sixth individual was a juvenile that stayed for five months in the release pen, due to wounds caused by the radio transmitter and due bond trial with another female. The female was removed before releasing due to illness. After its released, this animal also presented abnormal behavior and, therefore, was also removed from TNP. Post-release monitoring: We followed translocated individuals intensively for the first two weeks after release. Although intensive, monitoring avoided interactions with howlers. Most radio transmitters failed one month after release.

Kangaroo rats are ecosystem engineers and maintain grassland communities through their burrowing and seed caching behavior. SKR occur in open, flat areas with native grass or sparse coastal sage scrub, but much of the habitat within their historic range has been destroyed due to agriculture, housing, and industrial development. Development in southern California is occurring at a rapid pace, and mitigation translocations of SKR and other kangaroo rat species are frequently required, although rarely successful. Improving translocation methods is critical for the persistence of this species. SKR are listed as endangered under the United States Endangered Species Act, threatened under the California Endangered Species Act, and Vulnerable by the IUCN. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Experimentally manipulate releases to determine whether familiarity with neighbors improves translocation success. \uf0b7\uf020 Modify habitat at release-site prior to translocation to increase suitability for SKR. \uf0b7\uf020 Establish a self- sustaining breeding population of SKR. \uf0b7\uf020 Improve translocation methodology for SKR and other heteromyids. \uf0b7\uf020 Mitigate for development at source sites and increase the number of populations on protected land.

Project Summary Feasibility: Previous kangaroo rat translocations failed to establish viable populations with long-term persistence. High mortality, low site fidelity, and lack of post-release monitoring contributed to a history of unsuccessful translocations. In 1992, 599 SKR were translocated with no animals surviving at the site 11 months following release (O\u2019Farrell, 1994), and a 2002 translocation resulted in 40% survival four months post-release with no surviving animals after one year (Spencer, 2003). Past translocations did not consider the social relationships within SKR populations. Although SKR are solitary and territorial, the dear enemy effect suggests that they may spend less time and energy defending their multi- purpose breeding territories from familiar neighbors compared to unfamiliar individuals (Temeles, 1994). Translocating animals with familiar conspecifics could increase the likelihood of translocation success by reducing aggressive interactions, increasing site fidelity and survival, and ultimately by improving reproductive output (Shier & Swaisgood, 2012). One mechanism by which social familiarity can improve translocation success is by helping to anchor released individuals. Reducing post-release survival has been identified as one of the 50 most important questions in all of conservation behavior (Greggor et al., 2016). Implementation: A total of 99 SKR were translocated; 54 in September 2008 and 49 in July 2009. Prior to translocation, we determined territory locations and neighbor relationships by trapping the source sites and tagging individuals with unique color combinations of reflective ear tags. An animal was assigned to a territory if it was trapped at the same burrow \u22653 times and was observed entering or chasing another animal away from the burrow (Shier & Swaisgood, 2012). After neighbor associations were mapped, SKR were trapped for removal from the source sites, fitted with VHF radio transmitter backpacks, and transferred to the release site. A protocol for soft release was created, which included acclimation cages for each individual. Acclimation cages consisted of an underground wire nest box (15.2 x 15.2 x 7.6 cm) set 30.5 - 38.1 cm underground, two corrugated plastic tubes (5 cm diameter) that connected the nest box to the surface, and an above ground wire retention cage (30 x 61 x 30 cm) filled with approximately 5 cm of dirt from the site. During the acclimation period, one tube was plugged and the other tube opened into the above-ground cage, allowing SKR access to explore and forage above-ground while preventing them from escaping. In response to 175 Harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex rugosus) invading cages a ring of plastic landscape divider was installed around each acclimation cage with insect adhesive (e.g. Tanglefoot) along the seam to prevent ants from getting into the acclimation cage. We held SKR in acclimation cages for one week and fed them a mix of seeds and lettuce daily. At the end of the acclimation period, the top cages were removed and animals were able to move freely on the site. We placed a battery-powered electric-tape fence around the site to deter coyotes and other mammalian predators. Each year, half of the SKR were translocated with members of their neighbor group and half were translocated with unfamiliar individuals. Groups were matched for age and sex ratios, and released on the same night to ensure release timing did not confound the results (Shier & Swaisgood, 2012). Because non-native grasses restrict movement of SKR, in 2008, we reduced non-native grass cover on the 3.24 ha release site using a string trimmer. In 2009, an adjacent 4.45 ha release site was burned to reduce ground cover prior to SKR translocation. Both release sites were located on the Southwestern Riverside County Multispecies Reserve in southern California. Post-release monitoring: For two days following both releases in 2008 and 2009 behavioral observations were conducted on a random subset of kangaroo rats. These observations revealed that SKR translocated with familiar neighbors initiated fewer fights and spent more time vigilant and foraging than SKR translocated with unfamiliar individuals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69f884ba-6c14-465b-909b-c1d792d138a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "69f884ba-6c14-465b-909b-c1d792d138a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd2db2e79e6c68f340ace50a622e2a380b651d2560d8b89f1448b80c60c6ff5d"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2fec42a-d4ce-4404-899b-c44aeb03e22e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f864726189cf76acc41701a88ab7a6e4d110b816e61177bcccb232a00defd24e"}}, "hash": "e055c4edaab20596b7be91a5817bd7fc3b6a143412ccc67c02e3633b7df1eb6f", "text": "We used radio telemetry to track the burrow location of each animal every day for two months post-release, and once a week during the third month.

In both 2008 and 2009, we found higher rates of survival for SKR that were translocated with familiar neighbors compared to those translocated with unfamiliar individuals. Annual trapping revealed that more offspring were born to females translocated with familiar neighbors. We counted active burrows to compare SKR activity between plots where different habitat restoration techniques were used. There were more burrows, indicating greater SKR activity, Release site habitat with native grasses \u00a9 Debra Shier 176 in areas where non- native grasses were burned, followed by areas that were mowed, and the fewest burrows in untreated areas. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Gathering social data on the source population was time and labor intensive; however similar results could be accomplished through extensively trapping within small target areas and moving all neighbors simultaneously. \uf0b7\uf020 Collecting a sufficient number of individuals to translocate in paired experimental and treatment groups required translocations to be conducted in two different years and from three source sites. \uf0b7\uf020 Following the 2008 release, only 3 of 20 (15%) female kangaroo rats translocated with unfamiliar individuals survived to six months post-release. \uf0b7\uf020 Intensive, annual management was necessary to reduce non-native grass cover on both release sites prior to and following translocations. \uf0b7\uf020 Harvester ants invaded acclimation cages in 2008 and high levels of predation by Barn owls and meso-carnivores followed the 2009 release. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Increasing social familiarity among members of a release cohort can be important to dampen dispersal, facilitate settlement and promote exhibition of important behaviors associated with fitness, and enhance survival and reproduction in SKR, and should be tested more broadly with other species. \uf0b7\uf020 In cases where restoration of a release site is required prior to release, the method of site preparation has the potential to influence establishment and post-release success and requires more research. \uf0b7\uf020 Implementation of soft-release protocols, including the use of acclimation cages and food supplementation, likely contributed to high post-release survival, but have not been directly compared to hard release. \uf0b7\uf020 To manage non-targets at the release site, plastic landscape dividers are an effective means of excluding ground-dwelling ants from acclimation cages, but electric-tape fencing is not effective at reducing predation pressure as fencing posts provided perches for raptors and fencing did not deter mammalian predators. Transferring SKR to acclimation cage 177 Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 A self-sustaining population continued to persist nine years following release, with 148 individual SKR (19.25 SKR/ha) trapped on the original release sites in 2017, with many (n = 85) in reproductive condition. \uf0b7\uf020 Social structure is important even in a solitary species and behavioral observations and fitness measures both show SKR translocated with familiar neighbors were more likely to settle at the release site and had higher survival and reproduction than SKR translocated with unfamiliar kangaroo rats. \uf0b7\uf020 The translocation methods with acclimation cages, ant deterrence, and intact neighbor groups improved techniques for SKR soft release. \uf0b7\uf020 Release site selection based on suitable soils, slope, aspect, and conservation status of the property, with vegetation management prior to and post release to maintain open ground and reduce non-native grass cover, facilitated long-term success. \uf0b7\uf020 Collaboration with land managers and federal, state and local agencies was critical for the success of the program.

It is one of the five most threatened felid species of the world and it has been categorized as Critically Endangered in Bolivia (Villalba et al., 2009). It is also listed in CITES Appendix I. There is no record of any Andean cat in captivity. In March 2016, a sub-adult Andean cat was captured by local people in the town of Patacamaya (about 100 km from La Paz city) and delivered by the Bolivian Forestry and Environmental Police (POFOMA) to the Vesty Pakos Municipal Zoo (La Paz). There was no certainty of the specimen\u2019s origin and exact date of capture, therefore, it was decided to keep it in captivity until an appropriate solution could be decided. Behavioral studies showed that the individual should be released. We carried out pathogens analyses that came back negative (Napolitano et al., 2019) Released Andean cat \u00a9 Juan Reppucci - AGA 179 and identified two potential sites with optimal habitat to release the individual in Sajama National Park.

Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 The Andean cat is safely released following international guidelines, local regulations and specially generated local protocols. \uf0b7\uf020 Behavioral studies allow adjustments in the management of the captive Andean cat, to safeguard its welfare and help in maintain natural behavior. \uf0b7\uf020 Results of health studies to avoid any possibility that the animal could be harmful to wild populations. \uf0b7\uf020 The individual is successfully monitored until its establishment in the release area or proximities. \uf0b7\uf020 Elaboration of video and press release to increase general public knowledge regarding Andean cat existence and its conservation threats.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d32ae507-a224-4fa4-af04-a56e095cb4ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "d32ae507-a224-4fa4-af04-a56e095cb4ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81bbe5db97e85868a937957fe4b6db2e72fb5b6d129af2e47f72c10b4bf87aae"}, "2": {"node_id": "264d8133-8074-4dd5-9aed-330b8144c4df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40f8172bab1b690bfc735b1d8207ed1f7cadc25fb828f7918a8f5624896cf9c3"}}, "hash": "7c630a6561d55987b9b6428e6d2d4b2149a3429a67221b36d0a13db9996e3a00", "text": "Project Summary Feasibility: An inter-institutional ad hoc committee was established to define actions concerning the rescued Andean cat; it included representatives of the Bolivian environmental authorities (national, departmental and municipal levels), POFOMA, the Vesty Pakos Municipal Zoo, Andean Cat Alliance (known by its Spanish acronym, AGA), Wildlife Conservation Society - Bolivia and the Institute of Ecology of the San Andres Major University. The release site was selected considering the location where the individual was found, the existence of previous records of the species and the predisposition of Protected Area\u00b4s authorities and local communities to receive the Andean cat and collaborate once the individual has been released. During four days in July 2016, five potential areas were evaluated in Sajama National Park (SNP), to identify the most appropriate site for releasing the Andean cat, considering habitat features (rocky areas, highland 180 wetlands, vegetation cover), prey availability, human activity and accessibility. Technical representatives of the Committee participated with the collaboration of SNP park rangers. Implementation: To proceed with the release of the Andean cat the Committee followed IUCN guidelines and Bolivian regulations. The Andean cat remained quarantined for 165 days in a special enclosure, adapted by the Zoo staff.

In all assessments physical condition, hematological and blood chemical parameters were normal compared to that of domestic cats and wild felids of the genus Leopardus (data for the Andean cat did not exist) (Beltr\u00e1n-Saavedra et al., In review). The Andean cat\u2019s blood was checked through PCR and serological tests for 17 pathogens relevant to felids, to prevent the introduction of those into the release area. All tests were negative (Napolitano et al., 2019). A GPS-VHF collar (ATS\u2122), provided by an Argentine team of AGA was fitted on the Andean cat to be able to monitor its behavior after release. The collar was programed to obtain one point every five hours daily, and one point every hour every seven days. According to this schedule the battery should last up to eight months. Three days before the release event, some elements used by the Andean cat in the Zoo\u00b4s enclosure, like stones, branches, sand and straw, were scattered around the chosen site, in order to reduce post-release stress. At 06:00 hours on 27th August 2016 the Andean cat was sedated at the Zoo and placed in a kennel for transport. During the trip to the SNP, physiological parameters were monitored and after complete recovery the cat was transported on foot to the exact location to be released. The Andean cat was released at 15:35 hours and monitored until 17:00 hours, during this time it showed normal behavior and movements. Post-release monitoring: For 20 days after the release, the cat was monitored daily and intensively estimating general location trough the VHF signal making sure to not disturb it. No exact locations were pursued because this information was already being stored in the GPS collar and we prioritize to obtain information on presence and movements of the animal in the area. The Andean cat was detected almost daily over the first 12 days; in four non-consecutive occasions the signal came from the release area, and in other four from adjacent valleys, within a range of about 3 - 4 km (NE, NW and SW). No signal was obtained from either those areas or further away (up to 17 km) for the following seven days until 14th September. On 15th September, around 15:00 hours for the last time and for few minutes the signal was obtained, coming from the upper part of the valleys located over 3 km from the release site. Several searches were carried out between October and December simultaneously with two or three teams, covering suitable areas for Andean cat within the whole Sajama National Park. The release site was close to the Chilean border and a Chilean AGA team carried 181 out a search in the Chilean side, between 27th November and 2nd December, but no positive results were obtained. Finally, on 28th April 2017 an aerial search was carried out covering about 350 km\u00b2, but no signal was obtained either. It is relevant to highlight that the collar was also fitted with a mortality signal, that should trigger in case the animal was not moving for a long period of time. Throughout all these searches the mortality signal was not detected; therefore, it is more likely that either the cat dispersed far away from the release site, or that the collar failed. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 There are no records of any Andean cats in captivity, therefore the Zoo team adapted and adjusted all procedures. This was also an unprecedented release experience in Bolivia. \uf0b7\uf020 The pathogen analyses of blood samples were made as a facility with AGA\u00b4s trained experts in Chile, so CITES permits were needed to move the samples between countries. The complications for obtaining those permits delayed the release date. \uf0b7\uf020 To obtain an appropriate tracking collar was also highly difficult and affected the release date. \uf0b7\uf020 The lack of a permanent vehicle for field monitoring hampered the search of the Andean cat in regular intervals. \uf0b7\uf020 Although local people from the protected area was informed and consulted about this operation, the fact of introducing a carnivore (even a small one like the Andean cat) made some concern; so, during the monitoring process, meetings with some communities was carried out to explain the project. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 It is fundamental to ensure that natural behavior of small wild cats temporally kept in captivity is preserved, as well as their health and welfare.

It is also essential to reinforce local laboratories to be prepared for genetic, parasitological and of pathogen analyses. \uf0b7\uf020 There is a need to raise awareness and to generate a closer participation of people who live near release sites, so that they are part of these conservation processes. Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 The maintenance of the Andean cat in quarantine was successful and an important achievement in the conservation history of the Andean cat. It was the first Andean cat maintained officially in captivity and the first being released after captivity. \uf0b7\uf020 The conformation of an interinstitutional team, the knowledge, responsibility and willingness of the members was fundamental during all the process. \uf0b7\uf020 The transportation and release process were successful, the Andean cat was sedated and adequately manipulated for this purpose. \uf0b7\uf020 After the release, the Andean cat was daily monitored during 20 days, of which it was detected for nine non-consecutive days. \uf0b7\uf020 The signal was lost after 20 days which precluded us from knowing the final outcome of the released individual. The loss of the signal could be due to a failure of the radio-collar as happened to other researchers studying the species in the high Andes (Reppucci, pers. comm., Villalba, unpublished), or it is also likely that the cat moved much further. A study made in the area of the release in 2018, which involved 36 camera traps and six months of permanent sampling did not detected the presence of this individual (from 18 photos with Andean cats evaluated; Huaranca, et al., In prep.).

Shier Institute for Conservation Research, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Rd., Escondido, CA, 92027, USA dshier@sandiegozoo.org Introduction The Los Angeles pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris brevinasus; LAPM) is a nocturnal, granivorous, heteromyid rodent endemic to open Riversidean alluvial fan sage scrub habitat (Williams et al., 1993). The LAPM is one of eight sub- species of the little pocket mouse (P. longimembris) (Hall, 1981), and is listed as a Californian species of special concern as a result of serious population decline and range retraction from agricultural and urban development (Brylski, 1998). Additional threats to LAPM habitat include habitat fragmentation and invasive plants, especially annual grasses that eliminate bare ground (Western Riverside County BMP, 2011). As a conservation measure, we translocated LAPM from a water recharge project area in the San Jacinto river, California, USA. Our release site was approximately 8 km up-stream in a protected reserve. The translocation aided LAPM by reducing mortalities associated with the project. LAPM is not currently listed federally as an endangered species, however they are closely related to the critically endangered Pacific pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris pacificus; PPM) (Williams et al., 1993). Little pocket mice are smaller than other heteromyid rodents and a secondary goal of this translocation was to gain experience with the equipment and methodologies needed for relocation of heteromyids of this size. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Modify habitat at the release-site prior to translocation to increase suitability for LAPM. \uf0b7\uf020 Develop an efficient and reliable translocation strategy for LAPM and other small heteromyids. \uf0b7\uf020 Establish a self- sustaining breeding population of LAPM. \uf0b7\uf020 Mitigate for development at source sites and increase the number of populations on protected land. Los Angeles pocket mouse 185 Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Capture and translocate at least 50 individuals to maximize probability of release success. \uf0b7\uf020 Settlement and survival of LAPM at the release site. \uf0b7\uf020 Evidence of successful reproduction of the translocated LAPM, measured by offspring at the site or reproductive males and females during post release monitoring. \uf0b7\uf020 Establish a population of LAPM that persists for at least five years following release. Project Summary Feasibility: LAPM are endemic to open Riversidean alluvial fan sage scrub habitat in areas with suitable sandy soil (Williams et al., 1993). This restricted range in southern California has a dense human population and LAPM are in direct conflict with the rapidly growing Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino urban centers. In addition to direct loss of habitat, LAPM habitat is compromised by fragmentation and a variety of human impacts such as, artificial light pollution, illegal off-road vehicles, garbage dumping, human encampments and House cats. Our translocation project was a conservation mitigation measure for a water recharge project in occupied habitat within the dry riverbed of the San Jacinto river, California, USA. Our group has developed an effective translocation protocol for Stephens\u2019 kangaroo rat with a post-release monitoring program (Shier & Swaisgood, 2012). We modified this protocol to fit the smaller heteromyid rodent, LAPM (8 -11 g versus approximately 67 g). A release site was chosen by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service approximately 8 km up-stream from the source site in a conservation area managed by the Western Riverside County Regional Conservation Authority.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3a5da75-aa77-4c03-973e-dea91765cbf2": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3a5da75-aa77-4c03-973e-dea91765cbf2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ec566fe8c43fafacb206276bfb52cd83a5e12c327976d41d65d68ce06c92326"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb4f52b1-4087-468a-b529-723008cfba72", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a933ce1854b972e54fd169fbbcaea7cf9f28d12f9516bfefbf7f304a05c9bc8"}}, "hash": "cba9692f2cffa4ab4a7f23e706b21a6031fd8ff13db4904464401ec1d8a3b4a9", "text": "This release site is within the same drainage with similar vegetation and predation pressure beyond the distance that LAPM could travel to return to the source site.

Implementation: In May 2012, we trapped 122 LAPM (52 adult females and 70 adult males) from the source site over 21 consecutive nights (10,710 trap nights) immediately prior to the start of construction. Unfortunately, this time of year is not ideal for a translocation as it was in the middle of the breeding season, however we were tied to the construction schedule.

We supplemented the diet of pregnant and lactating females with whole powdered milk. In preparation for the translocation, we had invasive grasses mowed and small 186 Sycamore trees (Platanus racemosa) within 100 m of the release site removed as they could be used as perches by avian predators. To deter meso -predators, we applied Mountain lion urine (Mt.LionPee, Original Predator Pee) along the perimeter of the site once weekly for four weeks prior to the release. At the release site each LAPM was placed in an individual acclimation cage. Acclimation cages consisted of an underground nest chamber (15.2 x 15.2 x 7.6 cm) set 60 cm underground, two black plastic corrugated tubes (2.54 cm diameter) which connected the nest chamber to the surface, and an above-ground wire retention cage (20 x 20 x 20 cm). The acclimation cages were spaced 5 m apart in neighbor group clusters of 32 per group following Shier and Swaisgood (2012). We installed plastic landscape dividers around acclimation cages to prevent invasion by Harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex spp). The placement of individuals in acclimation cages was based on neighbor relationships from geographical locations of trapped individuals from the source site. In addition, family groups of mothers and newly weaned offspring were placed in adjacent acclimation cages. We fed mice a seed mix and lettuce daily while in acclimation. After one week in the acclimation cages, the above-ground portion of the acclimation-cages was removed. On 10th July 2012 we released 144 marked LAPM (52 adult females, 69 adult males, 12 juvenile females, 11 juvenile males) into the wild from their acclimation cages. We continued to supplement the mice three times a week with the seed mix until rains produced sufficient food resources (three months). Post-release monitoring: We re-trapped the site for five consecutive nights at one and three months following release. During these two trapping bouts we captured 31% of the translocated LAPM. To assess long-term success, we continued to trap for five consecutive nights each year for five years post-release. At one year post-release we trapped 24 LAPM. 62% (N = 15) of captured LAPM were founders and N = 9 were unmarked LAPM. Two years post-release there were 31 LAPM and one was a founder. At five years post release in 2017 the population was strong with 67 LAPM trapped. We observed signs of reproduction during all years of post-release monitoring. LAPM have short life histories and it is thought that the unmarked LAPM at the site are the result of successful reproduction. However, because we have not conducted genetic analysis there is a possibility that LAPM were recruited from the surrounding area. Release site habitat 187 Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Initial trapping took place under a super moon and during the breeding season; this may have decreased the number of LAPM we were able to remove from the source site. \uf0b7\uf020 The release site was in a protected natural area with restricted human access; however, people trespassed, rode off-road vehicles, dumped trash, and vandalized and stole equipment. \uf0b7\uf020 Seven LAPM died in acclimation cages. They were found dead above ground after digging out all the soil from the top cage. They may have died from exposure or stress from trying to escape. \uf0b7\uf020 In the absence of radio-telemetry, we were unable to distinguish between dispersal from the release site and mortality. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 When the release site is near residential neighborhoods the safety of the neighborhood should be taken into consideration. This particular neighborhood had high levels of vandalism and confrontations. People were not opposed to our conservation efforts, but our staff were vulnerable because we were in the field at night. We implemented a new protocol to include security into projects that are located in areas with moderate to high levels of crime and/or drug use. \uf0b7\uf020 We were able to scale down the equipment for the smaller sized heteromyid.

Highly Successful Successful Partially Successful Failure 189 Conservation translocation of banded and Shark Bay rufous hare-wallaby to Dirk Hartog Island, Western Australia Saul Cowen & Colleen Sims Biodiversity and Conservation Science, Western Australian Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, 37 Wildlife Place, Woodvale, Western Australia, Australia saul.cowen@dbca.wa.gov.au; colleen.sims@dbca.wa.gov.au Introduction The Banded hare-wallaby (Lagostrophus fasciatus fasciatus) and Shark Bay rufous hare-wallaby (Lagorchestes hirsutus bernieri) are two small macropodid marsupials, listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN and under Australian Commonwealth and Western Australian state legislation. Although similar in appearance and behavior, these species are not closely related, with banded hare-wallabies the sole-living representative of the subfamily Lagostrophinae. Both taxa disappeared from the Australian mainland after European occupation, at least partially as a result of predation by non-native Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and Feral cats (Felis catus) (Woinarski et al., 2012), and the only remaining natural populations were found on Bernier and Dorre Islands in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Subsequently, Banded hare-wallabies have been successfully translocated to Faure Island (also in Shark Bay) and Australian Wildlife Conservancy\u2019s Mt. Gibson Sanctuary, but the Shark Bay subspecies of Rufous hare-wallaby has never been translocated. Dirk Hartog Island is a large island (63,300 ha) in Shark Bay and while there are anecdotal reports that both taxa previously occurred there, no physical evidence (historical or subfossil specimens) were ever obtained. The successful eradication of Sheep (Ovis aries), Goats (Capra hircus) and Feral cats from Dirk Hartog Island by 2017 represented an opportunity to establish new populations of both taxa.

Project Summary Feasibility: Dirk Hartog Island is geographically proximal to the only natural populations of both these taxa, with just 30 km separating the island from Dorre Island. Bernier and Dorre Islands have ostensibly similar vegetation to Dirk Hartog Island and all three islands fall within the same Interim Biogeographic Regionalization for Australia (IBRA) bioregion (Yalgoo). Since the destocking of sheep and goats commenced in 2005, vegetation has begun to recover with 38% of the island showing significant recovery (van Dongen et al., 2019). The subsequent removal of cats further increased the likelihood that the island could support hare-wallabies. While no specimens or subfossil remains have ever been obtained of either taxon from Dirk Hartog Island (Baynes, 1990), there is strong anecdotal evidence that both did once occur on the island (Shortridge, 1909). Although formerly a pastoral property, Dirk Hartog Island became a National Park in 2009 and is managed by the Western Australian Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA). However, the former pastoral lessees retain a small freehold property on the island and operate a vehicle barge which Hare-wallabies arriving by helicopter \u00a9 DBCA 191 permits public access to the island.

Implementation: A trial translocation of 12 individuals of each taxon took place on 29th and 30th August 2017, in a 2:1 female to male sex ratio. The focus of the trial was to better understand the challenges that a translocation of these taxa would entail, before commencing a full-scale release. Animals were transferred by charter vessel (approximately five hours journey) and Rufous hare-wallabies were treated with a sedative (diazepam) to assist with maintaining animals in a calm state. Both species received selenium and vitamin E, which are thought to play a role in minimizing the risk of capture myopathy. All 24 individuals were fitted with radio-telemetry collars and were monitored daily by ground radio-tracking for 12 weeks post-release. After this period, collared individuals were recaptured for assessments of condition and collar-fit. Monitoring was reduced to once every 4 - 6 weeks by fixed-wing aircraft to assess ongoing survival and animals were recaptured in May 2018 for collar removal and health-checks. After the success of the 2017 trial, a full-scale translocation was commenced in September 2018 with 90 Banded hare-wallabies and 50 Rufous hare-wallabies released, this time in even sex ratios. Again, 12 individuals of each taxon were fitted with collars and monitored in the same fashion. However, the translocation of animals from Bernier and Dorre Islands employed the use of a helicopter, reducing journey time to approximately 30 minutes, while also minimizing other negative sensory stimuli. Post-release monitoring: During the trial translocation, Rufous hare-wallabies underwent significant weight-loss in the first 12 hours after capture, with an average of 13% reduction (up to 18%). It was assumed this related to stress- related urination and hypersalivation. By comparison, Banded hare-wallabies did not show significant weight loss. This was followed by the first mortality four days post-release, with a male Rufous hare-wallaby found dead. A subsequent necropsy indicated capture myopathy as the cause of death. However, no further mortalities were recorded until collars were removed in May 2018. Recaptures of collared hare-wallabies found most were in average or above-average condition and six Banded hare- wallabies and 10 Rufous hare-wallabies were recorded as having pouch young. Rufous hare-wallabies slowly regained weight but only three exceeded Hare-wallaby release habitat \u00a9 DBCA 192 their original capture weight (although some animals would have lost weight after weaning joeys). During the full-scale translocation, initial weight-loss in Rufous hare-wallabies was minimal (average 3% in first 12 hours) and this was largely attributed to the shorter time and reduced stressors in transit by helicopter. No mortalities of collared hare-wallabies were recorded in the full-scale translocation in 2018, but a road-kill rufous hare-wallaby was discovered by rangers in May 2019. Signage has been erected to encourage visitors to the island to slow down outside of daylight hours but the risk of vehicle collisions with hare-wallabies and other wildlife may need to be better articulated to the public. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Management of translocation stress, particularly in Rufous hare-wallabies, was a major consideration. This species is vulnerable to mortality through capture or stress myopathy (Cole et al., 1993), which is initiated by exertional stress. \uf0b7\uf020 Capture of hare-wallabies on Bernier and Dorre Islands involved hand- netting at night using a spotlight to locate animals. This, and the need to access the islands by sea at night was a major challenge, especially when hampered by inclement weather. \uf0b7\uf020 Intensive post-release monitoring was made more challenging by large over-night movements, particularly by Rufous hare-wallabies. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Whether originally native to Dirk Hartog Island or not, both Banded hare- wallabies and Rufous hare-wallabies adapted quickly to their new environment and thrived.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5efb1c60-2580-49fb-93d5-88e8d86ac177": {"__data__": {"id_": "5efb1c60-2580-49fb-93d5-88e8d86ac177", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e887771ce0083f02d12589325792f85945265d98fc553bf672cf68d8ad04c39"}, "2": {"node_id": "404ed048-da12-484a-9310-c9d923f314b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d02e1057b18635eec35057106b4c6e8e2c1808f7a3c5f5c068f4a2048814888"}}, "hash": "659c235b026bdc0f1eadb2323407bf9f5d3a2fd96ac9e91ac8f4a0d507d7356d", "text": "\uf0b7\uf020 Reducing time in transit and employing a transport medium with less negative sensory stimuli (noise, motion, scent) helps minimize stress, particularly for vulnerable species like Rufous hare-wallabies. \uf0b7\uf020 Hare-wallabies can be fitted with telemetry-collars without causing mortality from entanglement, assuming due care is used to achieve optimal collar-fit. \uf0b7\uf020 Both Banded hare-wallabies and Rufous hare-wallabies undertake large movements during the initial post-release period but often return to their initial release location. \uf0b7\uf020 Vehicles represent a potential source of mortality for hare-wallabies on Dirk Hartog Island, which is something that will need to be managed. 193 Success of project * - ranking for both Banded hare-wallaby and Shark Bay rufous hare-wallaby Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 Successful removal of sheep, goats and cats from Dirk Hartog Island. \uf0b7\uf020 Highly suitable habitat at release sites. \uf0b7\uf020 Trial translocation undertaken initially to help inform and improve strategies for full-scale translocation. \uf0b7\uf020 Expertise of field-team with collaring and handling of hare-wallabies and administering drugs. \uf0b7\uf020 Large translocation numbers", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11c34e57-dc92-41fb-aa30-0635cd693f0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "11c34e57-dc92-41fb-aa30-0635cd693f0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "beca8a76ed2bcdae9d47b0f0426fe8c39c40732ea4cd5cc88ee697644f6f8797"}, "3": {"node_id": "2d7b968b-9a6e-4770-bd15-105300b6774f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c91c4ece2890bb5b74b76b8abb59b928444de7f3e30979b83fc916123df2739"}}, "hash": "39ad6e686d9542d82cc42feb241340d5383520391ef104ee744f4d1715a8e664", "text": "in a rapid, intense translocation session.

Last seen on the mainland in 1967, its extinction has been attributed to predation by introduced predators, habitat loss and disease. It is now restricted to Tasmania and listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List and the EPBC Act 1999. It is a nocturnal predator and scavenger with a diet of invertebrates, birds, small mammals, reptiles, fruit, and carrion. The species is sexually dimorphic with a mean adult body mass of 1,250 g for males and 850 g for females. Males have larger home ranges (mean 44 ha) than females (mean 35 ha). Females can carry a single litter of up to six young per year. Annual mortality in the wild is high, with 20 - 58% of juveniles surviving to their first breeding season with a life expectancy of three to four years (Godsell, 1983). The reintroduction site is Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary (MFWS), a 485 ha area containing critically endangered Box-gum grassy woodland situated Eastern quoll \u00a9 Adam McGrath & Woodlands and Wetlands Trust 195 in north-east Canberra, Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Australia.

A translocation proposal was prepared including the success criteria outlined above as well as a risk assessment (Manning, 2015). The predator-proof fence surrounding MFWS removed the threat posed by introduced Red foxes and cats, which are a major barrier to mainland reintroductions. Based on these, the reintroduction was approved by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE), Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, ACT Territory and Municipal Services and the ANU 196 Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee. Implementation: The reintroduction was undertaken as a series of three trials over three consecutive years (Trial 1 in 2016, Trial 2 in 2017, and Trial 3 in 2018). An additional translocation was conducted in 2019 to maximize the genetic diversity of the founding population (not reported here). We used the Translocation Tactics Classification System (TTCS, Batson et al., 2015) as a framework to adapt our tactics between trials to achieve our strategies of maximizing survival and minimizing post-release dispersal. We also adopted an adaptive management approach, using monitoring to facilitate rapid learning and to implement interventions to improve reintroduction success (Wilson et al., 2020). In Trial 1, we translocated fourteen Eastern quolls (6 females & 8 males) to MFWS in austral autumn. No females were carrying pouch young because the mating period was yet to occur. Founders were selected from both captive (6) and wild (8) populations. Captive founders were sourced from Mt. Rothwell, and wild founders from free-ranging populations across 14 geographic regions in Tasmania which were separated by at least 15 km or a significant geographical barrier to eastern quoll dispersal (informed by a study of the genetics of these wild populations in Tasmania (Cardoso, 2014)). We took no more than two animals from each region to minimize impacts on the source population and maximize genetic diversity. Releases were carried out as soon as possible (i.e. animals were transported to the ACT, underwent health assessments, and released on the same day) and at night to minimize stress and to provide maximum time to explore MFWS and find a den before first light. No supplementary food was provided. Despite significant modifications to our predator-proof fence prior to the first release, within days of the Trial 1 release, seven founders escaped over the MFWS fence. Of these, two were found deceased (assumed to be preyed upon by the red fox), three died from injuries whilst under observation in a care facility, and two were retrieved alive and released back into MFWS. Of the remaining seven founders, two were found deceased within MFWS, one was transferred to Mt. Rothwell due to its poor condition, and four (3 females & 1 male) survived without issue. In Trial 1, 43.8% of founders survived the establishment period, 37.5% maintained body condition, and 62.5% of females produced young. Mulligans Flat release site \u00a9 Mark Jekabsons 197 In Trial 2, we translocated thirteen female-only founders, preferring those that were carrying pouch young that were fused to the teat (>60 days of age, ~25mm crown rump length, Bryant, 1988). Releases in Trials 2 (and also in Trial 3) were conducted from one of four central locations (separated by 50 m). This tactic aimed to maximize the distance over which a founder would travel before encountering the fence, while also allowing them to encounter food resources, den sites, conspecifics, or other features of interest before the fence. In Trial 2, 92.3% of founders survived the establishment period, 92.3% maintained body condition, and 84.6% produced young. In Trial 3, we translocated 8 female-only founders, also preferring those carrying fused pouch young. No significant differences in survival or dispersal were found between captive and wild founders in Trials 1 and 2, so only the more genetically- diverse wild founders were selected in Trial 3. No significant weight loss was observed, so no supplementary feeding was provided. In Trial 3, 87.5% of founders survived the establishment period, 100% maintained body condition, and 87.5% produced young.

As an adaptive management intervention, supplementary food was deposited into their dens, in declining amounts as weights stabilized. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Males were poor founders: In Trial 1 many founders, especially males, escaped over the MFWS fence within the first few nights of release. \uf0b7\uf020 Releases should occur in winter: We hypothesized that the greater number of male escapes was exacerbated by the timing of release. Eastern quolls experience elevated breeding hormones in autumn, and this stimulates mobility and aggression in males, aiding them to acquire den sites and food (Godsell, 1983). We suspect that females may have also struggled to settle because they were being pursued by males and were likely to have elevated hormones. We adapted our tactics in Trials 2 and 3 by conducting 198 releases in winter, after the mating period. This had the added benefit of reducing stress and collar fit issues associated with breeding hormones. \uf0b7\uf020 Females should be translocated with pouch young: Conducting releases in winter allowed us to translocate females with fused pouch young. This tactic meant we could translocate new male and female juveniles sired by either captive or wild males, and avoided the elevated male mortality and dispersal observed in Trial 1. We hypothesized that females with pouch young would invest in finding and maintaining a natal den, thereby reducing dispersal and potential escape from MFWS. \uf0b7\uf020 Dispersal affects the survival: Founders that moved between dens on consecutive nights were more likely to escape and less likely to survive, and this den movement was lower for females and when den sharing with another founder. \uf0b7\uf020 Stress needs to be managed: Founders in Trial 1 were released from bags by researchers, which may have increased stress. We adapted our tactics in Trials 2 and 3 and placed founders in situ in a den box (wooden box with a sliding door) with the door closed for one to two hours (delayed release). After last light, the door was opened from behind the den box and the founder could leave of its own accord. We hypothesized this would minimize stress and provide maximum time for founders to explore MFWS and find a den before first light. Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 We released healthy eastern quolls into a fenced predator-free environment. \uf0b7\uf020 We closely monitored the population post-release and adjusted our reintroduction tactics to reduce factors driving dispersal over the fence and mortality. Once we identified a way to establish founders inside MFWS we were able to reduce our effort and focus on translocating more genetically- diverse founders. \uf0b7\uf020 We used the TTCS as a framework to improve our ability to identify, select Highly Successful Successful Partially Successful Failure Research team \u00a9 Swimming Wombat Photographics & Woodlands and Wetlands Trust 199 and design tactics to achieve our strategies of maximizing survival and minimizing post-release dispersal. \uf0b7\uf020 We used trials in an adaptive management framework to make informed choices that improved reintroduction success. This approach is particularly important for threatened species reintroductions, where rapid decisions are often required despite the absence of complete knowledge. \uf0b7\uf020 The passion, dedication, innovative thinking and collaborative effort of the partners and volunteers which made the planning, operations and research conducted in this project possible.

It is listed as Least Concern by IUCN Red List. However the subspecies P. bengalensis rabori occurring on the Philippine islands is listed as Vulnerable, and the subspecies P. bengalensis iriomotensis occurring on Iriomote Island in Japan is considered Critically Endangered. Although the leopard cats adapt to diverse habitats, a combination of factors including human encroachment, habitat loss and fragmentation, and commercial exploitation have threatened leopard cats in many of their historic ranges. Road kills, the competition and spread of disease caused by invasive carnivores (e.g. dogs and cats), as well as killed in retribution for poultry damage, were all considered the threats to leopard cats across most of its Asian range. The populations of Bangladesh, India and Thailand are included in CITES Appendix I, while all other populations are included in Appendix II. In Taiwan, it is listed as Endangered in the Wildlife Conservation Act since 2009 (Council of Agriculture, 2009). This research was conducted in Miaoli County (24\u00b017\u2019N-24\u00b044\u2019N, 120\u00b043\u2019E-121\u00b015\u2019E) where is one of three counties (Miaoli, Taichung and Nantou) that where still have viable population of Leopard cats in northwestern Taiwan. Seven orphans were rescued and were later released at or near the site where they were found from 2012 to 2015, and the soft-release techniques were used. Past and recent human settlement and activities have contributed to a high level disturbance in this research area. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 To assist the individuals returning to the wild, adapting and surviving in the natural environment. \uf0b7\uf020 To return the genes to the native populations for reducing losses caused by human Leopard cat \u00a9 Mei-Ting Chen 201 interference. \uf0b7\uf020 To investigate whether and how the individuals could survive and breed successfully. \uf0b7\uf020 To establish soft-release techniques for rescued orphan Leopard cats. \uf0b7\uf020 To develop the reintroduction protocol of the leopard cat for future reintroduction in the historic distribution areas. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Leopard cat survives in the wild. \uf0b7\uf020 Settlement and establishment of the Leopard cats territory. \uf0b7\uf020 Breeding success of the species in the wild. Project Summary Feasibility: When the orphaned Leopard cat was rescued, the individual was sent to the rescue center for health examination and therapy and the experts meeting evaluated the feasibility of the training-release project for the orphan Leopard cat. Diverse issues had been evaluated for understanding the tradeoff among the benefits, costs and risks and these include: 1) the conditions of habitat, such as local density of Leopard cat, food resource and competitors; 2) conservation status of population, which is Endangered in Taiwan; 3) conditions of the individuals which include the source, physical and mental conditions, risk assessment of contagious disease; 4) success assessment of release according to the technique of training and release, the interaction between individual and trainer, and the attitudes of locals towards leopard cats; 5) feasibility of monitoring, including radio-tracking and monitoring the body condition of the released individual by visiting it irregularly; and 6) the budget. The expense was the minor concern, because it had been evaluated that population size of Leopard cat in Taiwan could be 468 - 669 at present, and the government was committed to restoration the population.

Moreover, the species is classified as Critically Endangered in the Red list of vertebrates of the Czech Republic (CR) and belongs to the highest category of specially protected species in Czech legislation. Its conservation is hence of high priority and a national Action Plan for the European Ground Squirrel (EGS) has been implemented since 2008. Both reintroductions and supplementations discussed here have been performed as part of this Action Plan. Reintroductions are currently restricted to the protected landscape area \u010cesk\u00e9 st\u0159edoho\u0159\u00ed, as the first experimental area that offers suitable habitat and good potential to create a metapopulation. This metapopulation should possibly include stable existing populations Hr\u00e1dek and Ran\u00e1. Supplementations are at the present focused on small populations with abundance of up to 15 individuals, but with good potential regarding habitat quality and size and also management. In the future it is intended to use supplementations even for larger populations to prevent them from inbreeding. There are no geographical limitations for the supplementations within the CR, all populations are considered to be from the same genetic lineage. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 To create a functional metapopulation of EGS in western part of the protected landscape area \u010cesk\u00e9 European ground squirrel \u00a9 J. Matou\u0161ov\u00e1 206 st\u0159edoho\u0159\u00ed with a minimum abundance of 2,500 individuals (reintroduction goal). \uf0b7\uf020 To ensure the long-term existence of maximum EGS populations in the CR (supplementation goal). Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Confirmed successful breeding of released individuals (for both reintroductions and supplementations). \uf0b7\uf020 Long-term persistence of new populations, ideally also with increasing abundance and expansion to surrounding suitable habitats (for reintroductions). \uf0b7\uf020 Doubling the abundance of a particular population at that time within five years of last release, independent existence of the population for at least 10 years after last release (for supplementations). Project Summary Feasibility: The EGS is a socially living species that requires open habitats with permanently low vegetation cover. In the CR, these conditions are usually met at grassy airfields, natural or cultural grasslands - steppes, meadows, pastures, camps or sports fields, vineyards, gardens and orchards. All of these habitat types require at least some kind of human management, typically mowing or pasture, in order to constitute a suitable environment for EGS. Ensuring regular management at most EGS localities is an essential part of the Action Plan.

Financial aspects regarding future management of the newly created localities is of course of great importance. Planning supplementations is carried out in a similar way.

Final decision then takes into account size of each locality, its history and prospects regarding management, property rights and positive or negative view of respective landowners, overlaps with protected areas, etc. Of course, a necessary condition for reintroductions and supplementations is a sufficient and reliable source of individuals of suitable genetic origin. Due to the conservation status of EGS in the CR and limited options to provide spare animals from existing natural populations, this has been solved by establishing four breeding facilities (most of them started with animals brought from Slovakia) and by cooperation with zoos that keep EGS of acceptable genetic origin. During 2017 all of these sources were able to provide around 100 individuals every year for the purposes of reintroductions and supplementations. Implementation: Carrying out EGS reintroductions and supplementations is highly demanding on coordination and cooperation. There is, for biological reasons, a relatively short time period (early spring or late summer), during which any releases of the species should be performed (we have so far always released in late summer). Therefore, all required administrative matters need to be taken care of in advance. This includes for example official agreements of relevant conservation offices or permissions from respective landowners. At the same time, up to date information about current state at selected localities, situation in breeding facilities or offers from zoos needs to be continuously collected. Consequently, a plan for given season can be prepared (where to carry out a reintroduction/supplementation, how many individuals to release at each locality, from which sources to bring animals in each case, etc.) and dates of releases can be set. The season plan has to be effectively communicated with all involved Release enclosures for squirrels \u00a9 J. Matou\u0161ov\u00e1 208 parties, so that everything is then prepared in time (needed equipment, trapping of EGS in breeding facilities, transports, veterinary checks, etc.). Very important is of course also keeping records of all released individuals. Sex, weight and age (juvenile or adult) are taken, as well as fecal and DNA samples, and the animals are individually marked with microchips. Known experience with releases of EGS suggests that it is essential to force the animals to remain at the release site as long as possible and prevent them from panic escape reaction. This is usually ensured by releasing them individually into pre-drilled holes that are then temporarily closed by a heavy bottle or wooden stick and an extra protection for the first few days is provided by simple enclosures. Food and shelter in form of pallets with hay are also provided at the beginning to help the animals settle at the locality. In case of supplementations the new animals are usually released directly into existing burrow entrances of the local individuals, with the entrances again temporarily closed. Post-release monitoring: After release, each locality is visited at least two to three times in the course of the next week, when the enclosures and bottles are removed. More frequent visits follow until first hibernation, during this time occurrence of new burrow entrances is observed. Afterwards, the localities are regularly checked as part of monitoring within the Action Plan. That includes one obligatory visit per year (but typically three) and provides results in form of population estimates and maps of inhabited area. Additionally, active burrow entrances are localized by GPS to get a more detailed picture of the inhabited area and at least one trapping session is usually performed to check the health and demography of the population.

The largest range areas for the savannah populations are the Tsavo ecosystem and its environs, and the Laikipia - Samburu ecosystem and contiguous areas to the north. The forest-dwelling populations occur mainly in the Aberdares and Mt. Kenya, coastal forests and Mt. Elgon. Between 1973 and 1990, elephant numbers in Kenya catastrophically dropped from some 167,000 to a minimum of around 20,000 (Douglas-Hamilton, 1989). From 1990, after the formation of a more effective management authority, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and the end of legal international ivory trade (through elevation of African elephants to Appendix I of CITES), the national elephant population gradually increased to about 35,000 in 2010 (KWS).

Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Rescued elephant calves rehabilitated at Reteti and later successfully released to the wild. \uf0b7\uf020 Minimizing contact between elephant\u2019s claves and humans at release site to avoid habituation. \uf0b7\uf020 Minimizing risk to people and elephant. \uf0b7\uf020 Promote interactions of the released orphaned elephants with wild elephant population at Sera. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Released elephant calves to adapt to the new environment and with <5% mortality rate. \uf0b7\uf020 Released calves interact with wild elephants at the release site. \uf0b7\uf020 Released calves to maintain a good body condition score (3 - 3.5 out of 5) during and after release. \uf0b7\uf020 Zero conflict with humans\u2019 post release. Project Summary Feasibility: Approval was sought from the Kenya Wildlife Service to initiate the project. Weaning, training and handling: This begun nine months before the actual move. The calves were isolated from the group and kept in a separate stable. Bottle feeding was initially eight times a day every 24 hours and was dropped sequentially and by the time of translocation only two bottles feeding in a 24 hour period was done. The milk formula concentration dropped from 260 g to 130 g per feeding by the time of translocation as the calves browsed more on natural vegetation.

Information was gathered on any elephant disease at Sera and there was no record on elephant disease outbreak at Sera for the last seven years. Body condition scoring and general health was assessed and ascertained to be good before the move. Assessment of Sera as a suitable release site: Habitat assessment at release site confirmed enough forage, good security, minimal predator pressure (only three Post-release monitoring of elephants 212 Spotted hyenas at release area) and hence low risk of predation. Water analysis was performed and levels were within acceptable limit as per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and in comparison with livestock guidelines (There is NO available elephant specific water requirement guidelines) except for high nitrate levels in one of the water sources within Sera. Surface water distribution is adequate Socio-economics impact: Several meetings and public gatherings were held to sensitize the two communities about the move. The communities endorsed the move and jointly drafted a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Sera and Namunyak (Reteti) for the management of translocated elephant calves. Implementation: Capture and loading: Two months prior to the move, a transport container was mounted on a loading ramp and crate training began. The three elephants were fed in the transport container to get accustomed to it. During the movement day the exercise went without hitches save for some delays due to the excitement created by observers. The animals looked calm and so decision was made not to use any tranquilizers during transport. The transport container was filled with browse cuttings and animals were checked every 30 minutes during transport. Release of the elephants at Sera holding boma: The three calves were released onto a temporary holding boma at Sera Community wildlife conservancy. The boma had the basic requirements to provide shade, water and browse. There was also a mud bath for elephants to wallow and cool themselves off. Post-release monitoring at Sera: At the time of release, the elephants continued with their normal routine of two bottles a day (06:00 and 18:00 hours). They fed on natural vegetation while being taken out of the boma to familiarize themselves with watering points. By day three, the elephants did not return to the boma and the keepers observed them from a distance. Interestingly they did not have the need for bottles and continued feeding on natural vegetation. At some point they met with wild elephants and followed them from a distance while maintaining their group. No aggression was observed between the newly released elephants and the wild elephant families/ individuals. Post release monitoring will continue and will include regular body condition assessments. Warges, Sosian, Lingwezi & Keeper 213 Major difficulties faced: \uf0b7\uf020 Seasonal changes: Dry season can be extraordinarily dry leading to little available forage. Rainy seasons lead to accessibility challenges due to vehicles getting stuck during transport. \uf0b7\uf020 Uncertainty: This being the first rewilding project there were lots of delays as no one was sure what would happen \uf0b7\uf020 Lack of elephant specific drinking water guidelines. Major lessons learned: \uf0b7\uf020 The need to consult and involve communities as well as other stakeholders during planning and implementation phase. \uf0b7\uf020 Preparation for movement need to start early ideally nine months before the movement. This will give time to the group to become cohesive and learn from each other while at the same time have enough time to forage on natural browse more than being bottle fed. \uf0b7\uf020 The timing of the movement should be at the tail end of dry season or early wet season for the elephants to browse on more lush vegetation as soon as its sprouts. This will ensure that they are not nutritionally stressed and are able to improve or maintain good body condition. Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 Multi-stakeholder consultations during planning and implementation phase. \uf0b7\uf020 Habitat and water analysis survey prior to the move. \uf0b7\uf020 Experience and commitment from Reteti staff and by all persons involved.

A small population of captive individuals survived at a few European zoos, totaling 54 individuals in 1924 (Olech, 2008). Long-term collaborative breeding has resulted in the species recovering to more than 7,000 individuals today, and it is currently listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. Modelling of the habitat required for sustaining large bison populations identified the Carpathian mountain range, which spans 260,000 km\u00b2 across seven countries of Eastern Europe, as one of the only remaining places where European bison could potentially survive independently, and particularly the area from south-east Poland through Ukraine and into northern Romania (Kuemmerle et al., 2011). The Carpathians supports populations of brown bears, wolves, lynx and wildcats but the largest herbivores (bison, aurochs and wild horses) were all driven to extinction around 200 to 400 years ago. European bison have been reintroduced to the northern Carpathians since the 1960s, with six separate populations established in Poland, Slovakia and Ukraine. The Vanatori Neamt Nature Park (VNNP), located in northern Romania towards the border with Ukraine, was therefore the ideal site for the first reintroduction of European bison in the country (Kuemmerle et al., 2010). Goals \uf0b7\uf020 To establish a viable, free-ranging population of European bison in the Vanatori Neamt Nature Park. \uf0b7\uf020 To provide a model project that demonstrates the advantages of large mammal conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. \uf0b7\uf020 To provide long-term economic benefits to the Released European bison in VNNP \u00a9 Felicia Aron 215 local, national and regional economy. \uf0b7\uf020 To provide a flagship species that serves the role of promoting public awareness and educational campaigns for the promotion of the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development, locally, nationally and internationally. \uf0b7\uf020 To promote regional integration in the Carpathian Mountains chain. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Successful translocation of European bison from several source populations. \uf0b7\uf020 High post-release survival and successful reproduction of released European bison. \uf0b7\uf020 Appropriate range expansion and habitat use by the reintroduced European bison population. \uf0b7\uf020 No poaching of released European bison. \uf0b7\uf020 Replication of project model to other sites. Project Summary Feasibility: The Vanatori Neamt Nature Park (47\u00b003'10'' to 47\u00b018'20'' North, 26\u00b0 4\u201920\u2019\u2019 to 26\u00b022'32'' East) is located in the Neamt County of Northeast Romania. It is part of the Eastern Carpathians and Moldavian Sub-Carpathians, at elevations of 365 to 1,231 m. The park covers an area of 30,818 ha, including 26,322 ha (85%) of natural mixed forests, 2,300 ha of pastureland, 900 ha of hayfields and 700 ha of urban areas (Catanoiu, 2007). Over half of the forest stands are aged over 100 years, peaking at 180 - 200 years. Average annual rainfall is 652 mm, and temperatures range from -3.7\u00b0C in January to +19.5\u00b0C in July. The park is a Natura 2000 site for species and habitats of community interest. Vanatori translates as \u201chunters\u201d, and the area has been known as a hunting reserve since 1475, when hunting was the preserve of the Moldovian prince and his court (Catanoiu, 2007). The VNNP had the highest probability of effective law enforcement of 24 Romanian protected areas assessed by Ioj\u0103 et al. (2010). The Crac\u0103u valley was identified as the first release site within the VNNP. It is an isolated forested valley of around 5,000 ha, with deciduous and mixed forests (altitude between 800 - 1,000 m), with low human impact.

All European bison were of the Lowland-Caucasian line and were subject to health-testing prior to transfer to the pre-release sites. Supplementary feeding was provided close to the pre-release enclosure during particularly cold spells. Post-release monitoring: Six of the first 10 European bison released were fitted with VHF radio-collars prior to release. This allowed monitoring of factors including habitat preferences, refuges, group dynamics, and health status. Battery life for these transmitters was about two years. The VNNP team used this information to help advise on habitat suitability for subsequent European bison reintroduction projects in the \u021aarcu, Poiana Rusc\u0103i and F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 areas of the Southern Carpathians in Romania.

Despite some problems these collars allowed more efficient monitoring than had been possible with the radio-collars. The group of six females remained together post-release, generally feeding in the hay meadows during the summer months and moving into the forest areas in the winter months. They were joined by a male during the first winter post-release, and again during the second and third winters post-release. Five of the six females gave birth to a single calf each in the summer of 2017, three years post-release. The sixth female gave birth the following year, and three further births were reported in 2019. By the end of 2019, 25 of the 30 released European bison in the VNNP were still alive, 22 births had been reported, and the total population was 47 (Table 1). Of the five post-release deaths, four were males and one was a female, one occurred less than one year post-release, another two years post-release, and three at five or six years post-release. Survival to one year post-release is 96.2%, overall annual survival is 96.0%, and female annual reproduction is 30.3%. With the help of the GPS collars, it was calculated in 2017 that the reintroduced European bison population was ranging across an area of 60,000 ha, incorporating a diverse range of habitats. Much of this ranging was by the males, the two female herds remained in ranges of approximately 10,000 ha each. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Inappropriate legal status and management of European bison at a national level: There is no national coordinated official policy regarding reintroductions and the reintroduced European bison populations, leading to incoherency in the relevant national legislation.

It is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN and as a Species of Concern by the state of Montana. Once numbering in the millions, bison were nearly extirpated in the 1800s due to widespread and intensive hunting (Gates et al., 2010). Conservation efforts have brought the species back from near extinction, with an estimated 11,248 - 13,123 mature individuals according to the IUCN Redlist. However, there are concerns over long-term genetic diversity due to small herd size and cattle gene introgression (Gates et al., 2010). The Montana Glaciated Plains has been identified as a global priority for conserving grassland biodiversity due to the relative intactness of native habitats and diversity of flora and fauna (APR, 2018). This region comprises of sagebrush steppe and mixed grass prairie with intermittent streams that flow into the Missouri River. Here, the nonprofit American Prairie Reserve (APR) is attempting to establish a 1,416,399 ha reserve for large-scale conservation. APR has reintroduced bison since 2005 and to date have 866 bison and 169,818 ha.

Project Summary Feasibility: The Montana Glaciated Plains has been identified as a global priority for grassland conservation due to the relative intactness of native habitats and existing biodiversity (APR, 2018). This region comprises of sagebrush steppe and mixed grass prairie with intermittent streams flowing into the Missouri River. Bison evolved in this landscape as the primary grazer and historically had a large impact on the ecosystem via grazing and other interactions (Gates et al., 2010). APR aims to restore bison in order to restore grassland biodiversity on the landscape scale. However, cattle have been grazed here since at least 1915 (McMillan et al., 2018) and currently exist on private and public lands. Therefore, the public is concerned that a transition from cattle to bison will negatively impact the region\u2019s ranching culture and industry. Other concerns include damage to personal property, public safety issues, disease transmission to other livestock, and impacts to vegetation and wildlife. Implementation: In 2005, APR reintroduced 16 bison from Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota (USA) onto their private lands. Subsequent reintroductions from 2006 - 2014 include a total of 42 bison from Wind Cave National Park, 10 from Broken Kettle Grasslands Preserve in Iowa (USA), and 238 from Elk Island National Park in Alberta (Canada). These three source herds represent two genetic ancestries, contain no cattle genes, and have been free of brucellosis and tuberculosis for at least 30 years. To further increase genetic diversity, APR and the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, which has bison of Yellowstone National Park lineage, have agreed to swap 12 bull bison. All reintroductions are conducted through soft release with the bison being corralled for one month and disease tested before release onto the land. Bison cow fertility has been 80 - 90% and population growth has been ~20% annually, similar to the rates found during 222 the early years of bison restoration on the National Bison Range in Montana and in Yellowstone National Park (APR, 2018). In total, APR owns 42,323 ha of private land and holds state and federal leases on 127,494 ha of public land, totaling 169,818 ha of the 1,416,399 ha goal. Bison currently occupy 15,129 ha. Leased land is managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM, a federal agency) and the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC), which have approved year-round bison grazing on two allotments totaling 7,284 ha. Four additional allotments, totaling 13,106 ha, are currently rotationally grazed by cattle and are proposed to transition to bison grazing, pending approval. Recently acquired private and public lands do not yet have reintroduced bison. APR has also restored native vegetation on 1,692 ha of previously cultivated lands. Post-release monitoring: APR conducts biannual counts of the bison population, which is 866 as of fall 2019. Herd movement is also monitored using GPS radio-tracking collars. APR annually screens for disease by immobilizing or capturing a sample of the herd and drawing blood for testing. All animals that are sampled receive an ear-tag and RFID tag. Disease management follows the policies and regulations of the Montana Department of Livestock and the U.S. Department of Agriculture because bison in Montana are currently classified as livestock and are required to be managed as such. Additionally, APR follows the IUCN guidelines for managing bison health. APR bison have not tested positive for brucellosis or tuberculosis. APR minimizes manipulation of the population to allow it to develop a natural sex ratio and age structure. Hunting and translocating bison to other conservation herds have been used to reduce herd sizes that have increased to the carrying capacity of the lands.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9a1ab2e-d68b-431a-81fb-9ebffaae2bd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9a1ab2e-d68b-431a-81fb-9ebffaae2bd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6fbf0967a679e42a37610ef28be0f491c78adb60cc9a56a3e4f4ae2f823f6994"}, "2": {"node_id": "fbf74b7c-dc6f-48fc-91ab-a9d25f42ce34", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc958ad6ead50edbe49f41364ef0268f4ccec784e956e47aab127cf98c1f686c"}}, "hash": "a06bc844114b2dc581110a0d0ee6583fae0d6f611ff3a9dc335128d0795d40df", "text": "Mortality from competition among bulls, from native predators, and from other natural causes is permitted.

Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 It will take many years, possibly decades, to reach the ambitious goal of 10,000 bison and 1,416,399 ha due to local and legislative opposition to bison restoration in Montana. \uf0b7\uf020 Funding must remain secured for long-term management (property acquisition and fencing), scientific research, and monitoring. \uf0b7\uf020 Large-scale restoration of this species requires partnerships with indigenous tribes and local, regional, national, and international conservation groups, researchers, donors, and supporters. \uf0b7\uf020 To generate public and political support, the team needs communications specialists, marketing staff, and philanthropy managers who can harness the iconic status of the species and its story of restoration.

(2018) has shown that it has some ecologically beneficial effects on plant communities. \uf0b7\uf020 The reserve has grown to 169.818 ha since 2005, but the reserve lands are currently patchily distributed. \uf0b7\uf020 APR\u2019s bison management has contributed over US$ 1.9 million annual expenditures in the region, and APR continues to partner with willing landowners, tribes, researchers, and visitors for a diversity of financial and cultural benefits (APR, 2018). \uf0b7\uf020 It is difficult to change the local community\u2019s and legislature\u2019s views of bison restoration. This is due to the local and statewide livelihood in livestock since the past century, agriculture as one of the largest industries in the state, and public perceptions of bison restoration regarding disease, private property impacts, reductions in cattle ranch numbers, and associated economic declines in rural communities.

Its total population size is believed to be under 10,000 mature individuals, and it suffers from persecution across most of its range, despite being primarily a scavenger with little evidence of predation on livestock (Mills, 2013; Wiesel, 2015).

Four of the reported living captive Brown hyaenas are in South Africa, four in Europe, three in North America and one in Asia.

Project Summary Feasibility: The male Brown hyaena was born on 19th June 2009 at Port Lympne Reserve in Kent, UK, the only male in a litter of three thought to be the first captive births of this species in the UK and the first in Europe for a over decade. The two females were subsequently transferred to other European zoos to join two lone males, but there was no other female in captivity in Europe to be paired with the young male. Therefore an alternative solution outside of Europe was looked for, primarily motivated by welfare rather than conservation concerns. In 2012, discussions commenced with the SanWild Wildlife Sanctuary in Limpopo province in the north of South Africa, located approximately 40 km west of Kruger National Park, who were willing to try to rehabilitate and release the hyaena into their private fenced reserve. The SanWild Wildlife Sanctuary is just over 2,600 ha in size. It comprises a mixture of habitats and varied terrain, including flat grassland, thick bush, rocky hills, and some water holes. The reserve was founded by the late Louise Joubert primarily for the rehabilitation of rescued wildlife. A small number of rescued Brown hyaenas had been released to the reserve prior to this release, as had various other species. A pack of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) was held in one large enclosure, with sub-groups allowed out into the main reserve four at a time to be able to hunt; these hunting parties would always return to the rest of the pack in the enclosure due to their tight social bonds. All necessary infrastructure and staffing for the proposed rehabilitation and release of the male hyaena were therefore in place at SanWild. The long-term commitment of the Joubert family to the site meant that post-release support and monitoring would be undertaken, which was one of the pre-requisites for implementing the project from The Aspinall Foundation\u2019s perspective. Post- release support and monitoring have been important components of other translocation projects implemented or supported by The Aspinall Foundation (e.g. Catanoiu et al., 2021; King et al., 2012). Implementation: Once all necessary permitting and health-testing was completed, the male Brown hyaena was sedated and crated at Port Lympne on 12th August 2013, arriving the following day at Johannesburg airport in South Africa. Following a short delay at customs it was a simple 5.5 hour drive to SanWild. It was already dark when the transport crate was unloaded into the pre- release enclosure. The crate was opened the same evening. The team returned early the next morning and found the hyaena sitting calmly in the bushes in the 227 center of the enclosure. There was no evidence of any digging along the fence-line or any other sign of attempts to escape from the enclosure. Over the following weeks the hyaena settled well into the pre-release enclosure, including showing good survival instincts such as storing excess food in an old aardvark burrow.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6aaab4c4-eaca-4c07-b3a7-ccb8d657e170": {"__data__": {"id_": "6aaab4c4-eaca-4c07-b3a7-ccb8d657e170", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee3c1a09a8276f4f79e3c778561c282e95b07bd19975efee2b35f5d8dd1ee4c3"}, "2": {"node_id": "7ae2c934-7eae-4f4d-a86b-eb25d7718487", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcbce1effbd3a3125feadccd8296bbcc718fc39a616da0cc6eb4314181b1e510"}}, "hash": "f7ca3e8fc8f221953c52b58039a364b88a0fa4705555d86c8333c2ffd07a5e37", "text": "He also made contact with some other hyaenas through the enclosure fence.

Project Summary Feasibility: From December 2007 to April 2009 a field survey was conducted of 22 potential gibbon sites outside of National Parks in West and Central Java, comprising 106 forest blocks (Wedana et al., 2010). New Javan gibbon populations were discovered in the protected forest reserve of Mt. Tambakruyung, Ciwidey, and in the western part of Mt. Tilu Nature Reserve, southern West Java. Fifteen groups of Javan gibbons were found at Mt. Tilu, comprising 43 individuals, occupying around 2,000 ha (20 km\u00b2) in the southern and western parts of the reserve. Gibbons were absent from all other areas of Mt. Tilu, which contains 8,000 ha (80 km\u00b2) of mountain forest habitat. Based on these extensive survey results, the Mt. Tilu Nature Reserve was identified as a suitable site for Javan gibbon conservation through Post-release monitoring team \u00a9 The Aspinall Foundation / KLHK 231 population reinforcement by releasing captive-held gibbons. Mt. Tilu (7.156\u00b0S 107.530E; 1,030 to 2,140 m elevation) has a mountainous topography with an average rainfall of 2,534 mm/year. Ninety tree species have been identified (30 families), 50 of which form part of the diet of Javan gibbons. Release site management is undertaken as part of the Mt. Tilu NR collaboration conservation management with BBKSDA, a 650 ha privately-owned tea plantation (PT. Chakra) located inside the Nature Reserve, and representatives of local community groups. The education and awareness strategy focusses on local villages, involving all levels such as elementary and high school environmental programs, plantation workers, and local people/village leaders. Implementation: Pre-release is undertaken at the Javan Primate Rehabilitation Centre (JPRC), 15 km from Mt. Tilu. This involves disease screening, behavioral training, and diet modification to reflect food availability at the release site. All gibbons underwent extensive pre-release testing and preparation that followed a detailed disease risk analysis. Several captive gibbons tested positive for the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). We organized a field survey to test for the existence and prevalence of HBV in wild Javan gibbon populations, and in collaboration with Public Health England this resulted in the identification in wild and captive populations of a HBV strain specific to Javan gibbons (jgHBV). The virus does not appear to cause disease in gibbons, and therefore the research demonstrated that captive gibbons shown to have the specific Javan gibbon strain of HBV can be considered for release. Transport to the release site is in individual crates, by vehicle to Mt. Tilu then carried to the specific release sites. The gibbons spend a few days or weeks in simple net cages at the release site prior to final release. As recommended by Campbell et al. (2015), gibbons are released in bonded pairs if we have successful pairings during the rehabilitation period. However, a few gibbons are not easy to pair. In such cases we release them alone in an area where we have identified a single existing wild gibbon present.

Local students from various local Universities also help to conduct post-release research, such as collecting data on diet. Of the first 33 Javan gibbons released, to the end of 2018, one is still monitored over five years post-release, another was monitored for over three years post- release, and 11 more for over one year post-release. Only three are confirmed dead (one male during the soft-release process), one infant female at five months post-release, and one male killed by a Javan leopard at eight months post- release). Survival to one year post-release is therefore between 39% and 91%. The large range of uncertainty is to due to the difficulties of monitoring many of the released gibbons for more than a few months post-release. Survival to two months post-release is between 65% and 98%. Four births have been reported within the program so far (Table 1). Two of the births, in 2016 and 2019, were to a wild female who paired with a male released in 2014. The pair and the two infants were still regularly observed to the end of 2019.

Summary of Javan gibbons released in and around the Mt.

Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 The pre-release socialization stage must be as natural as possible, considering the natural behavior of the species, including in the selection of foods and of enrichment. The pre-release phase is very important in determining the ability of individual gibbons to survive in the wild. \uf0b7\uf020 Gibbons are very sensitive and selective species, especially pairs, so the rehabilitation process requires a long time. \uf0b7\uf020 Health testing is critical for good selection of individuals for release. \uf0b7\uf020 In the absence of effective tracking devices post-release monitoring must be conducted intensively on a daily basis for the initial 1 - 2 months after release. Just one or two days without monitoring makes it very difficult to locate the gibbon again. \uf0b7\uf020 The success of a rehabilitation and release program lies in the management of post-release monitoring.

The use of land for economic activities has resulted in disturbance to forest security in the form of encroachment, illegal logging, forest and land fire, and illegal trade in plants and wildlife (MoEF, The State of Indonesia\u2019s Forests 2018), including the live capture of wild primates for the illegal wildlife trade. This case study refers to reinforcement projects for the two species in the isolated forests of Mt. Tilu Nature Reserve near Bandung in West Java, with captive-born and rescued wild-born langurs sourced for release from the Javan Primate Rehabilitation Centre located at the foot of Mt. Patuha in the protected forest area of Mt. Tikukur. The project is managed within the Javan Primates Conservation Programme (JPCP), run by the Directorate General for Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystem, Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK), in partnership with The Aspinall Foundation (TAF) Indonesia Program. Javan grizzled langur \u00a9 Tony King / TAF / KLHK 236 Goals \uf0b7\uf020 To return confiscated and captive-born Javan primates to their natural habitat. \uf0b7\uf020 To increase the viability of isolated populations of Javan grizzled langur and western Javan ebony langur in and around the Mt. Tilu Nature Reserve, West Java, Indonesia. \uf0b7\uf020 To raise public awareness, especially amongst the younger generation, about the importance of wildlife and habitat conservation. \uf0b7\uf020 To provide opportunities for national students to participate in field-based conservation of primates. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 High post-release survival of released primates. \uf0b7\uf020 Reproduction by released primates. \uf0b7\uf020 Increased viability of the Javan grizzled langur and western Javan ebony langur populations in the Mt. Tilu Nature Reserve. \uf0b7\uf020 Increased public awareness not to keep or trade Javan primates. Project Summary Feasibility: Mt. Tilu Nature Reserve (7.156\u00b0S 107.530E; 1,030 - 2,140 m elevation) was selected as a suitable site for the reinforcement of primate populations, primarily for Javan gibbons (Wedana et al., 2021) but also for Javan grizzled langurs and Javan ebony langurs, following extensive surveys from 2007 to 2009 of 22 sites outside of National Parks in West and Central Java (Wedana et al., 2010). During 14 transects at Mt. Tilu, Javan grizzled langurs were recorded 25 times, in groups of one to 10 individuals, and Javan ebony langurs 12 times (Wedana et al. 2010). Mt. Tilu is isolated from other forests by deforested lowlands. The cause of declines of langur populations in and around Mt. Tilu probably include hunting and habitat destruction and fragmentation.

Implementation: Pre-release is undertaken at the Javan Primate Rehabilitation Centre (JPRC), 15 km from Mt. Tilu. This involves disease screening, behavioral training, and diet modification to reflect food availability at the release site. All langurs undergo extensive pre-release testing and preparation that follows a detailed disease risk analysis. The langurs spend a few days or weeks in simple net cages at the release site prior to final release. Thirteen Javan grizzled langurs have been released between 2015 and 2019 (Table 1), including seven males and six females. Eight of these were transferred from the captive population in Europe, and five were rescued by KSDAE from the illegal wildlife trade in Indonesia. Ten were released on Mt. Tilu, the other three in the nearby sites of Patengan Nature Reserve (one pair in 2016), and Mt. Tikukur Protected Forest (one solitary male in 2019). Thirteen western Javan ebony langurs have been released between 2016 and 2019 (Table 2), including two males and 11 females, as three groups of four released in Mt Tilu (2016 to 2018), and then a single female released in the nearby Kanaan Protected Forest (in 2019). All were individuals rescued by KSDAE from the illegal wildlife trade in Indonesia. Post-release monitoring: Released langurs are monitored post-release whenever possible, by The Aspinall Foundation in collaboration with West Java BKSDA forest rangers, local trackers and university students. Four of the 13 Javan grizzled langurs released are known to have died within the first-year post- release, one due to predation by a Javan leopard seven months post-release, one due to consumption of a poisonous plant four months post-release, and the other two within two weeks post-release for reasons thought to be related to digestive issues. Four others have been monitored for over three years post-release (three of them for over four years), the other five survived well for a few months post- release but could not be monitored any longer due to difficulties in locating them. Survival to one year post-release is therefore between 31% and 69%, and thought to be at the higher end of this range. Survival to one-year post-release for rescued individuals is between 60% and 80%, for zoo-born individuals it is no higher than 63%. Of the four that have been successfully monitored, three are females that have all joined wild groups and each has given birth post-release, 238 Table 1. Summary of Javan grizzled langurs released in and around the Mt. Tilu Nature Reserve till the end of 2019 and one is a male that also joined a wild group, one month-post release. One of the females to give birth was captive-born in the UK. There have been no reported deaths amongst the 13 western Javan ebony langurs released, but only four have been successfully monitored for over one year post-release. Survival to one year post-release is therefore 100% for the langurs that have been successfully monitored, but sample size is low. The four females successfully monitored joined wild langurs soon after release and two have subsequently given birth to surviving offspring. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 The gut of the Javan grizzled langur is very complex, both anatomically and physiologically. They are predisposed to dysbiosis which can be rapidly fatal, causing lower post-release survival rates than in other Javan primates. \uf0b7\uf020 Limitations of tracking equipment for post-release monitoring. \uf0b7\uf020 Identifying additional forest locations for releases.

Project Summary Feasibility: The release sites were selected following population and habitat surveys at numerous sites across East Java in 2010 and 2011 (Wedana & Kurniawan, 2011; see Wedana et al., 2013). Following these surveys, the choice of the first release site was the Coban Talun Protected Forest, located within the Raden Soerjo Forest Park. Another survey was undertaken in March 2012 to conduct detailed studies of biodiversity, threat potentials and vegetation, including wild food abundance (Kurniawan, 2012). Coban Talun PF comprises approximately 250 ha of forest from Mount Pusungrawung to the eastern slope of Mt. Biru and is a form of highland rainforest ecosystem with evergreen trees. Elevation ranges from 1,300 - 2,200 m a.s.l.. Coban Talun is managed by a state- owned forestry enterprise Perum Perhutani. According to information from local residents, the number of langurs previously in the 1980s and 1990s could reach hundreds of individuals. The number has decreased dramatically as a result of uncontrolled poaching, and only six groups were found in 2010 - 2012 with an average of 15 individuals per group. The carrying capacity of Coban Talun was estimated at approximately 15 groups. The second release site selected was the Kondang Merak Protected Forest, a lowland rainforest located by the coast south of Malang covering ~1,500 ha but with only 28 langurs in four groups inventoried in 2011 (Wedana & Kurniawan, 2011). All coastal rainforests in this region are severely damaged and Kondang Merak lowland forest \u00a9 Tony King / TAF / KLHK 243 Table 1. Summary of Javan ebony langurs released at Coban Talun and Kondang Merak between 2012 - 2019 fragmented, and langur populations are isolated and highly threatened (Wedana & Kurniawan, 2011). The Kondang Merak PF is also managed by the state-owned forestry enterprise Perum Perhutani. Implementation: The pre-release phase is undertaken at the Javan Langur Rehabilitation Centre (JLRC) in East Java, located only 4 km from Coban Talun, and approximately 50 km from Kondang Merak. The average rehabilitation period for the langurs prior to release is 10 months, including three months of quarantine. All necessary pre-release procedures, such as final veterinary exams and behavioral observations, are undertaken during the pre-release phase. All langurs undergo extensive pre-release testing and preparation that follows a detailed disease risk analysis. Transport to the release site is in individual cages, either carried as a backpack for the 1 - 2 hour journey to Coban Talun, or driven to Kondang Merak and then carried to the release site. Simple cages are constructed at the release sites to allow a soft-release process. The first releases used wooden cages built high in the trees (Wedana et al., 2013), more recent releases have used net cages constructed from ground level to the mid-storey. During this habituation phase the langurs are introduced to natural leaves which will become their food in the forest. After about five days the langurs are released. A total of 128 East Javan ebony langurs have been rehabilitated at the JLRC from 2011 to 2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a29d4a86-97e5-485b-8029-77130dda3578": {"__data__": {"id_": "a29d4a86-97e5-485b-8029-77130dda3578", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04495bd8bd73dbd5342596f76b391d37c8d2f5bf66f1de0623619ae52081e22c"}, "2": {"node_id": "d88262d9-3a1e-4a7e-8329-7ab39b342cce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e08f254f1a0e3bc7d9dd12d24a8692af3b6736f7f9bf638d0c96565c049ebb7a"}}, "hash": "6ec2f6266ecaacaf2eb12c7df9661442bf989b6d4752e551c4e524b3fb26f7f6", "text": "Of these a total of 93 langurs have been released, 32 at Coban Talun and 61 at Kondang Merak (Table 1).

Twenty- six langurs have been monitored for over two years, including eight for over five years and another for over seven years. Many of the released groups associated with wild langurs. Some wild individuals joined released groups, and some released individuals joined wild groups. Home-range sizes for the released groups are estimated at between 6 - 21 ha, depending on the condition of the vegetation cover and the availability of natural foods. At least 121 species of plants have been observed to be consumed by released langurs in Kondang Merak, and at least 35 species at Coban Talun. Vegetation consumed includes trees, vines, epiphytes and shrubs. Of the first 70 langurs released, to the end of 2017, only four are confirmed dead, 40 were monitored for at least one year post-release, and 12 could not be monitored after only a short time post-release, giving a first-year survival rate between 69% and 93% (excluding the 12 langurs that were not monitored), and considered to be at the higher end of this range as all disappearances were due to difficulties of maintaining monitoring and recognizing individual langurs rather than any evidence of possible mortality. A total of 30 births have been reported to 28 released female langurs to the end of 2019 (60% of females released to the end of 2017), with one female having three reported births, including five births to female langurs captive-born in the UK.

The species is classified as Vulnerable in Argentina, where specialists speculate that habitat loss and transformation, and increasing levels of poaching and hunting caused a 30% population decline within the last 15 years. Indeed, Collared peccaries were partially eradicated from at least three and driven to extinction in two provinces (Camino et al., 2019). Located in northeastern Argentina, Corrientes is one of the provinces where Collared peccaries disappeared around the mid-20th century. Corrientes is home to the Iber\u00e1 wetland, a 13,000 km2 complex of federal (i.e., Iber\u00e1 National Park) and provincial reserves that protects an interconnected system of marshes, large ponds and streams associated with subtropical grasslands and remnants of native forests. Collaborative efforts implemented by governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations led to a steady recovery of wildlife and natural habitats in the Iber\u00e1 wetland; thus, creating the conditions to revert extinction processes. Indeed, since 2015, Foundation Rewilding Argentina has been reintroducing collared peccaries in Iber\u00e1 National Park (28.65491 S, 57.43166 W). Here, we summarize results obtained during the first five years of work. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 To restore Collared peccaries to the Iber\u00e1 wetland. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Number of groups formed. \uf0b7\uf020 Percentage of groups that are no longer supplemented with food. \uf0b7\uf020 Percentage of groups that reproduced. \uf0b7\uf020 Percentage of Collared peccary with young \u00a9 Rafa Abuin 247 reproductive events that resulted in piglets surviving \u22656 months. \uf0b7\uf020 Number of self-sustainable populations established. Project Summary As a result of improved conservation and legal status and habitat restoration the Iber\u00e1 wetlands became suitable for the reintroduction of Collared peccaries. Threats like hunting and poaching were minimized and, in some locations, even halted by law enforcement and patrolling. Furthermore, Collared peccaries were successfully reintroduced in Texas, USA (Litondo, 1993), lending support to reintroductions as tool to restore this species. Provincial and federal wildlife agencies were reluctant to allow translocations of wild peccaries (see major Difficulties Faced). Thus, we resorted to zoos and wildlife shelters to obtain the needed individuals (see Reasons for Success). We obtained permits to transport and release peccaries from provincial and federal Wildlife Agencies, according to existing regulations. Overall, the public supported the reintroduction of this species, but governmental officers were concerned regarding large and small agricultural producers, who could see peccaries as having similar impacts than Feral pigs (Sus scrofa domestica), being the latter invasive and harmful to agriculture and animal husbandry. To overcome this misconception, we held several meetings with these officers and explain them the differences between peccaries and Feral pigs. As a result, we could reintroduce a few groups and once officers realized that peccaries would not impact agricultural activities, we obtained a full approval for the translocation project. We obtained 205 collared peccaries from eight zoos and wildlife shelters. We transported peccaries from their home institutions to our quarantine facilities using 70(l) \u00d7 40(w) \u00d7 50(h) cm crates made of iron and wood.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98c79b18-5c40-4e95-b5b2-48f5fabb8647": {"__data__": {"id_": "98c79b18-5c40-4e95-b5b2-48f5fabb8647", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8731626f101746582230b3efb8a9a08893ae38e37037687bf268f4688fd8b36d"}, "2": {"node_id": "afb56462-0c45-4632-9026-ea6db67f5622", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f164bcdf3f4c32bbd3bdaeeee2d3ceef20c553d82129d934c01c7df8aa84ab05"}}, "hash": "ab38874b9782ac408b621308800362fbbcaa2b8785e65bbe20c1b8af5597bb36", "text": "Peccaries were placed individually in each crate to avoid fights.

Before release, we treated animals for internal and external parasites using 300 \u00b5g/Kg (Dectomax\u00ae, Zoetis AR Laboratory), ricobendazole 7.5 mg/Kg (Axilur\u00ae, MSD Animal Health), praziquantel 248 5.5 mg/Kg (Cestodan\u00ae, K\u00f6ning Laboratory), and friponil 1% pour on formulation 1mL/10 Kg (Ectoline\u00ae, Boehringer Ingelheim). Peccaries fit for release were moved to pre-release pens, where we fed them daily with a mix of non-native and natural foods. Time spent in pre-release pens varied from 7 - 30 days. If small groups were consolidated at arrival, animals would spend a short period in pre-release pens. Conversely, if small groups had yet to be formed, animals would spend more time in pre-release pens. In some cases, we collared all individuals that we freed, but as the number of entanglement events increased, we began collaring only a few (see major Difficulties Faced). We implemented an intensive post-release monitoring scheme based on radio-telemetry because peccaries struggled identifying native sources of food; thus, periodic food supplementation was need. Food supplementation lasted ~30 days to a year, but time decreased as we gained experience regarding the native foods that peccaries preferred. Food supplementation was terminated when we observed that animals would not lose weight despite a steady reduction in the amount of food we provided. However, if after some time animals lost weight, food supplementation was reinstated. Interestingly, we observed that individuals that were thriving after release would teach recently freed animals how to find food resources in the wild. Thus, we began establishing mobile pre-release pens with na\u00efve individuals in the territories of stablished ones. Established solitary males taught na\u00efve females, and groups of females taught na\u00efve males. Out of 167 individuals released in four different locations, 32% died from collar and agonistic-related injuries, starvation, drowning and unknown causes. At least 21 groups became established, 16 (76%) of which are completely independent (i.e., food supplementation was terminated) and 19 (90%) are formed at least by one female and one male. Of the later, at least 11 (58%) reproduced \u22651 times. Out of 19 recorded reproductive events (i.e., piglets were observed), 11 (58%) resulted in at least one piglet surviving \u22656 months. Currently, two self-sustaining populations thrive in two locations, whereas two populations, still under management, are being established in other two locations. More releases are planned for 2020. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Federal and provincial wildlife agencies would not issue permits to translocate wild individuals. They perceived translocations as a hazard to source populations rather than a conservation tool. As a result, we were limited to reintroduce captive animals provided by zoos and wildlife shelters. \uf0b7\uf020 Misconceptions about the potential for peccaries to harm agricultural activities. \uf0b7\uf020 Captive animals required lengthy quarantines, and intensive veterinary care and management before and after release extending project times, costs and increasing risks. \uf0b7\uf020 Although critical for post-release monitoring, collaring was problematic. 249 Individuals tended to lose weight after release, which translated in decreasing levels of fat around the neck. Thus, collars became loose increasing the frequency of entanglements, where animals would get entrapped with a front leg through their collars (i.e., between the collar and the neck). This often resulted in severe injuries and even deaths. \uf0b7\uf020 Often, we lacked information about group membership of the animals that we incorporated in to the project. Thus, large groups were kept in the same pen and then released. Large group size increased the frequency of intraspecific strife, which resulted in injuries, deaths, and triggered undesirable early dispersal. Early dispersal of uncollared individuals hindered food supplementation during the critical first weeks after reintroduction. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Favor large (e.g., 40 \u00d7 40 m) over small (e.g., 20 \u00d7 20 m) pens during quarantine when social relationships between individuals are unknown.

Box 45553, Abu Dhabi, UAE mkabshawi@ead.gov.ae; ssakkir@ead.gov.ae Introduction White saxaul (Haloxylon persicum Bunge) is a perennial, small tree found in the deserts of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Jongbloed, 2003). It grows in shallow depressions along the slopes of dunes and is tolerant to extremes in temperature, light and water availability (Al-Khalifah, 2007). They occupy a geographically distinct and well-delineated area in the south of Abu Dhabi City, where they form a characteristic species-poor plant assemblage on low dunes (Al Dhaheri et al., 2017). The shrub, belongs to the family Amaranthaceae, grows up to 4.5 m high. The wood is heavy and coarse and the bark is spongy and water- soaked. The leaves are so small that it appears leafless, giving it a dull grey appearance. H. persicum woodland in Abu Dhabi is described as \u2018dew forest' because of the way in which the leaves trap the condensation of fog moisture.

Project Summary Feasibility: H. persicum has a restricted distribution in Abu Dhabi and is of outstanding conservation value because this is the only natural occurrence in the UAE and in eastern Arabia in general (Al Dhaheri et al., 2017). The species has been in severe decline and the existing stands are at threat due to loss of their natural habitat and overgrazing. No natural regeneration of the species was recorded in the wild due to environmental extremes and lack of rainfall. The natural habitat for H. persicum in Abu Dhabi is locally known as Al Ghadha Protected Area (N 23.921305\u00b0, E 54.266781\u00b0), with a total area of 1,088 km2, which represents the eastern distribution limit of the species in the Arabian Peninsula, which is officially Habitat overview of White saxaul plants \u00a9 EAD 253 protected under UAE Federal Laws. A detailed distribution map of the species was created and provided us with an estimate of the population size. In order to supplement the native population, we decided to have a new patch of the species in the same habitat with in the protected area. Implementation: For supplementation of natural population (in situ conservation) actions, seeds were collected from the existing wild population. Seeds were collected from their natural habitat from the end of December to the beginning of January during the years 2016 - 2017. Seeds were sown in potting bags soon after collection, without any treatment, in a substrate that consists of soil and peat, and sown at a depth of 3 mm and moisturized. After about two weeks, 23% of the seeds germinated and the seedlings remained in the potting bags for up to one year, until they attained a height of about 50 cm. The seedlings, were then transplanted to the nine planting sites which each have a distance of 3 km between patches and each patch contained ~300 plants/patch. The patches were irrigated for the first five months and then irrigation was stopped for the next seven months and the success rate without watering was found to be 70%. After seven months the patches were irrigated once every two weeks. All planting locations were recorded with a GPS, and mapped in order to be easily identified for long-term monitoring. Post-planting monitoring: After transplantation, the monitoring was carried out on a monthly basis and individual plants were counted and assessed for their growth and survival and monitored for flowering and fruiting. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 The seeds are highly viable for about two weeks after which the viability drastically reduces. Aerial view of White sexual strip planting \u00a9 EAD 254 \uf0b7\uf020 There is a low rate of germination. \uf0b7\uf020 The seeds are sensitive to soil depth for germination. \uf0b7\uf020 As post-plantation monitoring is on-going the plants are still in a vegetative state as flowering and fruiting has not been recorded. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 The viability of seeds is found to be low. \uf0b7\uf020 Seeds germinated only at a burial depth of about 3 mm. \uf0b7\uf020 Propagation by seeds has been found successful. \uf0b7\uf020 Protection against grazing from Camels (Camelus dromedarius) and off- road driving. Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 Seedlings were grown to a mature size before transplantation. \uf0b7\uf020 Seedlings were transplanted in the same habitat. \uf0b7\uf020 Protection of the transplanted area from livestock grazing and off-road driving. \uf0b7\uf020 Regular irrigation pattern.

Rob.) is a decumbent to sprawling subshrub ~30 cm high. It is a member of the Dilleniaceae, a family of mainly shrubs, with 11 genera. It occurs in dry sclerophyll forests, with light clay shale sandstone transition soils, in the highly urbanized Sydney Basin Bioregion (OEH, 2018). Hibbertia spanantha was formerly described in 2015 (Toelken & Robinson, 2015) and is restricted to four disjunct populations, which cumulatively contain around 100 stems. The number of genetically distinct individuals is unknown as this species may produce ramets (clones). Under the IUCN Red List categories; restricted geographic distribution, very low numbers of mature individuals and projected or continuing decline, Hibbertia spanantha has been listed as Critically Endangered under both Australian Commonwealth (EPBC Act, 1999) and New South Wales state (BC Act 2016) legislation. An experimental augmentation translocation commenced in 2017 to buffer one population, of eight plants (some probably clonal), from stochastic threats and anthropogenic impacts of nearby urban development. This translocation successfully established 19 additional individuals (of an original 25). Learnings will be applied to large-scale translocations, when the genetic health of parent populations can be confirmed. Hibbertia spanantha flower \u00a9 C.

Project Summary Feasibility: Hibbertia spanantha is known from only four populations, the largest containing ~89 stems (some suspected ramets) and the smallest restricted to one plant. Each population is highly fragmented, with an area of occupancy (AOO) no greater than 100 m2. It\u2019s restricted range, small population size, low area of occupancy and low observed reproduction, compounded by threats from urbanization in the Sydney Basin, have resulted in it being a recommended population augmentation candidate. Undertaking these translocations required collaboration and support from one private ecological consultancy, three local government authorities and licensing from the State Government authorities. Due to budgetary constraints, in-kind contributions from local government staff and community volunteers were essential when planning the propagation, planting and subsequent maintenance and Chantelle Doyle counting flowers \u00a9 Simon Dunne 257 monitoring of translocated plants. Implementation: The production of viable seeds in Hibbertia spanantha is sporadic. Therefore, plants were propagated from cuttings collected from the wild population. Cuttings were taken from semi-hard wood and transferred to potting medium two months later. Striking and propagation success was >90%. A total of 25 plants were grown in 125 ml forestry tubes for the experiment. Twenty of these were potted using a customized nursery, premium potting medium of organic (composted pine bark and coir peat) and inorganic matter (fine sand), identified by the nursery as maximizing growth in Australian native species. Nutrient loading was achieved using two varied applications (high [~7.5 g additional fertilizer] and low [~3.5 g additional fertilizer]). Home soil collected from parent population site was mixed at 50:50 ratio with nursery standard mix and divided between the remaining five 125 ml forestry tubes.

Each block included 1 - 2 plants from each nutrient/home soil treatment. Plants were watered in with 5 L/plant, by hand using watering cans. Follow up watering was undertaken at a rate of 4 L/plant per plant every two days for the first week, then 4 L/plant every three days for the second week. Plants were then hand watered weekly for the next month, at a rate of 3 L/plant per plant. Post-planting monitoring: Plant growth and reproduction post-planting was monitored monthly for 12 months (358 days). Growth measurements were taken Ross Rapmund monitoring plant growth \u00a9 C. Doyle 258 as orthogonal widths and converted to a growth index. Reproduction measures were time of first flowering, peak flower number (count) and time to 50% flowering production (T50). Reproduction monitoring increased to between weekly and fortnightly during peak flowering (November - January). Water stress affected most individuals during the experiment post-planting, resulting in leaf drop and spot flowering.

Doyle 259 plantings. Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 Conservation augmentation had >80% survival after 12 months (19 of 25 plants) but required intensive hand watering. \uf0b7\uf020 Plants showed evidence of reproduction, prolific flowering but fruiting was negligible. This may be due to low genetic diversity and may require subsequent plantings of plants from other populations. Pollinators are also unknown. \uf0b7\uf020 Limited number of plants in the pilot translocation meant reduce ability to analyze significant results (and inform subsequent planting).

Tall astelia populations have declined by 68% over the 25 years since it\u2019s monitoring program began in 1993. Threats to the species include plant pathogens (Phytophthora and Pythium species), browsing by introduced Sambar deer (Rusa unicolor), and wildfire.

Project Summary Feasibility: The Tall astelia rainforest habitat is characterized by an overstory of Myrtle beech (Nothofagus cunninghamii), Southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum), and Blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon) with the occasional emergent Mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans). The middle stratum is typically comprised of the Soft tree fern (Dicksonia antarctica) and Rough tree fern (Cyathea australis). Fern species including Hard water-fern (Blechnum wattsii) and King fern (Todea barbara) dominate the understory and rich array of fern species that grow as epiphytes on the trees including Kangaroo fern (Microsorum pustulatum) and Common finger-fern (Grammitis billardierei) and Filmy fern species (Hymenophyllum sp.). The sites range in elevation from 400 - 800 m a.s.l. and are characterized by sloping topography that form a gully with a watercourse flowing through them. This topography and wet vegetation mean that these sites are less likely to be impacted by fire than the surrounding upslope sclerophyll vegetation. The Otway Ranges site is located in a National Park and one site in the Central Highlands is in a Regional Park managed by Parks Victoria. The other 13 sites are located in Special Protection Zones within State Forests which are managed by the State Government Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. Implementation: We conducted a translocation trial to determine if this was a viable management option for the species. This trial involved translocating 54 individuals from one source site into three sites recipient sites: control site (within the source site); in a locally absent site (on the same creek line as the source site in an area where the species is absent); and, in an rainforest site 25 km away from the source site where the species does not occur. The trial was a success with between 83 - 88% of individuals surviving two years post translocation at each of the three trial sites. We then applied for and conducted a translocation of 200 individuals from six source sites, including the Otway Ranges site, to create five new sites and to increase the number of Tall astelia in one of initial trial sites (absent site) and re-stock a heavily browsed site post-fencing. Post-planting monitoring: We continue to visit translocation sites on an annual Pollination by Swamp wallaby captured in a camera trap picture 262 basis to monitor survival and reproduction. Of the 254 translocated plants 22% (56) have died. This includes 13 of the original 54 trial translocation plants four years post translocation and 43 plants from the 200 translocation plants two years post translocation. Nineteen of the 43 plants that have died in the translocation were in the heavily browsed site that was re-stocked. Mortality across all sites is mostly due to herbivory and disease in the translocation sites. Some sites have performed better than others and this highlights the importance of finding translocation sites that are free of disease and herbivores or are fenced. Some individuals may not have survived the translocation due to them having damaged or few roots when they were taken from the source site. Microsite selection within sites also had an effect on the survival of translocated individuals with wet and muddy areas closest to the watercourses not suitable for having higher mortality. We have just completed a genetic analysis of the species across its range to understand its gene flow dynamics and help to inform future translocations. This understanding will assist us to determine which source sites are best to use to increase genetic diversity of translocated populations. It will also provide guidance on the required proximity of translocations to encourage gene flow between populations.

It is currently ranked as Critically Endangered (CR) under World Conservation Union (IUCN, 2001) Red List criteria B1ab and 2ab (based on severely fragmented populations and continued decline in, extent of occurrence and area of occupancy). Project location is in the Eastern Goldfields region, north of the Southern Cross town-site, in Western Australia. The species is a short range (~100 km) endemic recorded from just three locations. It occurs on the mid to upper debris slopes of rocky ironstone and weathered basalt ridges. These ridges are rich in minerals and the main threats to the species are mining and exploration activities (DEC, 2016). The species is a non-lignotuberous, monoecious shrub growing up to 1.8 m in height, with evidence of flowers being insect- pollinated and seeds being ant-dispersed (DEC, 2016). Recruitment is likely to be episodic pulse-events, with soil moisture availability the principal driver of seedling emergence, in this semi- arid environment with ~300 mm annual rainfall (Elliott, 2019; Turner, 2018).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0548068a-6b4c-499b-85fa-8c48c579dc7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0548068a-6b4c-499b-85fa-8c48c579dc7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0df68132a42425a4db6200215f955bef3be726fb8ba0af7b87de20ae8f8e510"}, "2": {"node_id": "465a811b-30a7-45f6-a122-69928beb6f87", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ad7f131ad41dab42b70c99c27092e66ed2fb9ff1b4c7bf58847483bab641365"}}, "hash": "11280654f91bb1f574d99631e53c082b9e85528919550cc09b79bf81c178ad37", "text": "Ricinocarpos brevis male flower \u00a9 Carole Elliott 265 Goals \uf0b7\uf020 To improve the understanding of methods to translocate Ricinocarpos brevis. \uf0b7\uf020 Assist in establishing R. brevis populations on waste rock landforms and/or other areas disturbed by mining.

Soil profiles are incomplete, often with a base profile of mixed large, small and fine scale waste rock fractions, which provide durable substrates for achieving landform stability; and a surface cover of topsoil that is ideally applied to a depth of <10 cm, whilst maintaining favourable soil-moisture properties for plant establishment.

Note: Text in quotation (\u201c\u2026\u201d) is quoted directly from the species Interim Recovery Plan, issued by the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC, 2016). Implementation: Translocation: Recipient sites (disturbed, waste rock landform) for experimental translocations were selected based on: \uf0b7\uf020 Being close to natural populations (i.e. landscape connectivity). \uf0b7\uf020 Land tenure and risk of future mining activity. \uf0b7\uf020 Safe and ongoing accessibility to sites located within mining activities. \uf0b7\uf020 Landscape aspect (e.g. preference for southern facing aspect). \uf0b7\uf020 Rehabilitation stage of waste rock landform (i.e. capacity to install translocation). \uf0b7\uf020 Physical and chemical assessment of soils (i.e. similar to natural population). \uf0b7\uf020 Capacity to install infrastructure (e.g. irrigation). Experimental translocations were installed yearly in April - June in 2013 - 2017, and designed to compare the success of tubestock planting and direct seeding. Tubestock experiments used 24 plants per treatment and tested up to five treatments in each translocation year. Treatments investigated to determine tubestock survival included shading, fertiliser, irrigation, propagation source (seed or cuttings), plant age, water holding crystals and biodegradable pots. Direct seeding experiments, used eight replicates of 25 seed for each treatment and tested up to six treatments each year. Treatments that were investigated included aspect (north or south-facing), shade, irrigation, seed burial, seed enhancement (priming or pelleting) and water holding crystals. Each replicate (tubestock or seed) was individually fenced to protect against herbivory. Experimental translocation site \u00a9 Carole Elliott 267 Cultural/tribal: \u201cA search of the Department of Indigenous Affairs Aboriginal Heritage Sites Register has identified four sites of Aboriginal significance within the vicinity of the populations of Ricinocarpos brevis on the Windarling Range (DIA, 2010). Liaison has been included as a recovery action to ensure there will be Indigenous engagement in relation to the recovery actions posed in this plan.\u201d (DEC, 2016). Phytosanitary concerns: Translocated tubestock were propagated and grown in an accredited nursery (Kings Park and Botanic Garden Nursery) prior to planting in translocation sites, thereby posing no inherent phytosanitary risks. Post-planting monitoring: Monitoring: Intensive monitoring of tubestock and direct seeding was conducted regularly after installation: at 1 - 2 months (late autumn); 4 - 5 months (spring); 7 - 8 months (early summer); 9 - 10 months (late summer) and 12 months (early autumn) for every year of the translocation program. Monitoring involved quantification of seedling emergence, survival, growth, health, and reproduction. Results: Evaluation showed that shading, irrigation and older tubestock increased seedling emergence, survival, plant health and growth. However, the magnitude of these increases depended on seasonal rainfall, as these approaches were more effective in average or above average rainfall years. For example, overall seedling emergence (autumn to spring) for 2015 was lower (1.7%) than 2016 (4.5%), despite experimental irrigation, and was most likely affected by reduced rainfall over this period (2015 was 54% below average and 2016 was 13% below average).

Many plant species are highly threatened mainly due to the reduction and fragmentation of habitat and the spread of invasive species. Several programs and projects have been developed for the conservation and restoration of this region. However, forest restoration rarely includes endangered species, mainly due to the difficulty of obtaining seeds and seedlings from these plants. To address these constraints Chau\u00e1 Society, a local NGO, focusses on researching and disseminating best restoration practices for 46 rare and threatened tree species. This case study will focus on activities carried out between 2014 - 2019 on three species listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN: 1) Butia eriospatha - an ornamental grassland palm with edible fruits; 2) Cedrela fissilis - a tree with high economic and ecological importance; 3) Ocotea porosa - a tree readily exploited for timber and woodwork.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c449078-2588-413f-9c27-2059a04a47a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c449078-2588-413f-9c27-2059a04a47a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "039556f258e12724fe18a4ff6bafe87f5c2cc3abd6dc20cbf82c42f61a8f53c7"}, "2": {"node_id": "677541e9-ae0d-4374-8274-c27819c56ecd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d3c5487762b9f5f3c006af41802e194032758efc3662dad3d0fa6e866e60610"}}, "hash": "5afcc1f39a3fb86fbf4dbba3344eb783f9f7e50cddc6f96d5075077f27c96bb2", "text": "The three species listed Araucaria forest \u00a9 Raphael Santos 270 on Brazil\u2019s Red List: 1) Trithrinax acanthocoma (Vulnerable), 2) an ornamental Palm tree (Ocotea odorifera) (endangered) - a tree that suffered high exploitation for timber and aromatic oils, and 3) Quillaja brasiliensis (endangered) - a tree used for soap making and for wood. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 To locate and map 60 new individuals of each species (12 mother trees with a minimum distance of 50 m between trees) across five populations for seed collection and for ecological studies within an adequate genetic variability. \uf0b7\uf020 To collect seeds from all mapped individuals for ecological research and seedling production in the Chau\u00e1 Nursery. \uf0b7\uf020 Establish at least four new populations of each six tree species by reintroducing seedlings into protected areas and also monitor their survival and growth rates for at least three years.

Project Summary Feasibility: Southern Brazil\u2019s Araucaria Forest is part of the Atlantic rainforest eco-region which historically dominated the landscape, yet present coverage is estimated at less than 1% of remnant of old secondary damaged forest (Castella & Britez, 2004). Currently the landscape is an agro- mosaic with fragments of generally secondary forest less than 50 ha (Ribeiro et al., 2009; Tabarelli et al., 2010), high-yield agriculture (Fonseca et al., 2009), and alien species monoculture plantations for timber and paper.

Forest restoration interventions that include a broad range of species are a challenge, mainly due to the availability of native species seedlings in nurseries. Despite the increasing demand for restoration (by law, buffer zones of river and springs shall be preserved or restored), landowners and local institutions are not aware of the importance of diversity in restoration, due to the loss of cultural and economic ties to the forest. Public and private nurseries typically produce a small selection of threatened species. Sites left to regenerate naturally also do not hold endangered species, usually because of the lack of them in neighboring plots. Chau\u00e1 Society collaborates to promote change in this arena searching for new populations, mapping trees, producing seedlings, reintroduction and monitoring planting, and producing technical and scientific information about rare and threatened species. This case study demonstrates efforts to reintroduce and monitor individuals of six endangered species from the Araucaria Forest. Implementation: Over the past five years, we looked for and monitored the phenology of mother trees aiming to identify and collect mature fruits and seeds. We recorded 473 mother trees from B. eriospatha in seven protected areas. Seeds were collected from 24 of them, which resulted in 2,112 seedlings. From these, 221 were planted and monitored. For C. fissilis, we found 114 mother trees in 16 protected areas, and seeds were collected from 15 of them, resulting in 894 seedlings, 293 of them were planted and monitored. The species O. odorifera was represented by 58 mother trees in 14 protected areas, and seeds were collected from eight of them. 617 seedlings were produced and 431 of them were set in the field. For O. porosa, 136 mother trees were distributed in 20 protected areas, and 30 of them have produced seeds that resulted in 2,111 seedlings - 682 planted. Q. brasiliensis is extremely rare, just three mother trees in two protected areas were identified, and seeds from one tree resulted in 267 seedlings. A total of 256 saplings were under evaluation in the field. T. acanthocoma occurred in just two protected areas, and from 169 mother trees, nine produced 1,154 seedlings that resulted in 750 individuals in the field. Post-planting monitoring: Seedlings were planted in sites located along the original distribution area of the species, and the maintenance was performed by partners quarterly. All sites were monitored until three years after planting, and we Chaua Nursery \u00a9 Sociedade Chaua 272 measured the survival rates, diameter at the ground and total height; maintenance failures, when present, were registered. B. eriospatha had an average survival of 85% at good maintenance routine against 47% under failures on maintenance. Average increase of height was 0.3 cm/month and of diameter was 0.7 mm/month. C. fissilis presented a large variation in survival rates among sites - from 83% to 6%. In general, it is very sensitive to frost, diseases and to the absence of maintenance. The average of height increase was 0.5 cm/month and diameter was 0.1 mm/month. O. odorifera presented a high survival rate - 96%; the height increase was 0.8 cm/month and diameter 0.1 mm/month. For O. porosa, the same parameters were 90%, 0.4 cm and less than 0.1 mm. Light conditions have a high influence in survival and growth of Q. brasiliensis - seedlings planted in open areas were 25% more successful in survival and they grew four times faster than those in shadow areas. The average survival was 85%, height increase was 2.4 cm/month, and diameter was 0.2 mm/month. Average parameters for T. acanthocoma were 81% for survival, 0.4 cm/month for height and 0.5 mm/month for diameter increase. Despite the whole difficulty to find seedlings of threatened and rare species in nurseries and the lack of information on initial growth for them, these results indicate that these species can be successful on growth and survival parameters in the field, and with good maintenance, can be a source of biodiversity recovery for the Araucaria Forest.

Despite it is considered \u201cLeast Concern\u201d globally, the species is declining in Europe and it is currently Extinct in the Wild (EW) in Italy at the southern edge of its range (Rossi et al., 2013). Threats to the species were identified in the eutrophication of water due to the intensive use of fertilizers in agriculture (e.g. Italy) and to the percolation of organic nitrogen in areas of intense livestock breeding (Abeli et al., 2014). Stratiotes typically floats in summer and sinks in autumn/winter. The Water soldier is a dioecious species which further complicates its reintroduction because of the need to identify proper source material for both sexes. In the specific case of the reintroduction of Stratiotes in Italy, we could identify the original Italian female genotype preserved ex situ in a private nursery, but no local male plants were found. So, as explained below suitable male plants have been identified in other European populations with similar genetic characteristic of the original Italian female population. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Find genetically suitable male plants as source material for reintroduction. \uf0b7\uf020 Identify a suitable release site in the area where Stratiotes occurred in the past. \uf0b7\uf020 Create a self- sustainable population of Stratiotes aloides in Italy after its extinction.

Threats for the species where only supposed on the basis of the available literature (Smolders et al., 2003; Zantout et al., 2011). A specific research to clarify the role of eutrophication in the local extinction of Stratiotes was started with the additional aim to identify suitable sites for reintroduction. Water quality was evaluated in sites where the species occurred in the past and in potential reintroductions sites and compared with current Stratiotes stands across Europe. The study revealed that most of the potential reintroduction sites were compromised but a partially suitable site could be identified in a large ditch few kilometers from the original Stratiotes site near Mantua, within the River Mincio Regional Park (Lombardy). Population genetic analyses were performed to identify suitable source populations for male plants among several European and Siberian populations of Stratiotes. Genetic characteristics of the sampled populations were compared with those of the Italian female plants. The study revealed a complex genetic pattern across Europe, likely due to long-distance dispersal mediated by waterfowl (Orsenigo et al., 2017). However, some genetic similarities were found with male plants from the Netherlands and from the Danube Delta (Romania; see Orsenigo et al., 2017). Implementation: A total of 530 Stratiotes individuals were released in a large ditch near La Piuda (Soave di Porto Mantovano), Mincio Regional Park, in two phases. Thirty plants were released in in October 2011 and 500 plants were released in April 2012. Post-planting monitoring: The post release monitoring revealed that none of the released individuals survived. The 30 individuals reintroduced in autumn 2011 were not found in spring 2012 and one of the hypothesis was that these few plants dispersed in the large ditch. However, of the 500 plants released in spring 2012 only 5% were found in July 2012 and eight individuals were last seen in August 2012. Causes for this quick decline were not completely understood and may be related to the water quality or to the negative effects of long-term ex situ cultivation. We also hypothesized that the ditch was too deep to allow enough light to reach the bottom and stimulate plant flotation after winter. Considering the negative outcome of the reintroduction of the female population and the lack of alternative sites, the project was stopped, and the male plants were not reintroduced. 276 Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Massive production of female plants from few individuals cultivated ex situ. \uf0b7\uf020 Identify the real causes of failure. \uf0b7\uf020 Identify alternative reintroduction sites. Most of the historical Italian range of the species is totally compromised in terms of habitat quality. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Water depth is an important ecological factor to be considered for the reintroduction of S. aloides and other partially floating macrophytes. \uf0b7\uf020 Populations close to a release site may not be the most (genetically) suitable as source material for reintroduction, due to complex dispersal patterns. \uf0b7\uf020 For some species, habitat conditions may be compromised to a point that prevents any viable reintroduction attempt. Success of project Reason(s) for failure: \uf0b7\uf020 The ditch where the species was reintroduced was likely too deep. \uf0b7\uf020 Values of some variables related to water quality (e.g. nitrates) were not evaluated as potential threats, incorrectly. \uf0b7\uf020 Several ecological factors at the release site were only superficially considered (e.g. water temperature, seasonal changes in water parameters). \uf0b7\uf020 Lack of frequent monitoring after the release.

R. Br. (recently renamed Marcus-kochia littorea (L.) Al- Shehbaz) is a suffruticous chamaephyte belonging to the Brassicaceae, typical of the West Mediterranean coastal dune habitats. It is characterized by a disjointed distribution across Portugal, Spain, France, Morocco, Algeria and Italy (Greuter et al., 1986). Due to human-derived threats, such as habitat fragmentation, urbanization, and tourism, it is considered under extinction risk in several regions, including the Spanish autonomous community of Asturias (Fernandez Prieto et al., 2014). It is classified as Vulnerable in the Spanish province of Alicante (autonomous community of Valencia; Serra Laliga, 2007). Along the French coasts, a 30% decline has been recorded in the last 30 years, although it is not yet included in the French Red List (source: http://flore.silene.eu). In Italy, the species is classified as Critically Endangered (CR) according to the IUCN category and criteria (Rossi et al., 2013) and over the last seven years (2012 - 2019), the total number of reproductive individuals decreased from ~600 to ~260. Here, one of the four sub- populations have been completely removed and none of the remaining ones grows within protected or restricted areas. The conservation status of this species has never been assessed at global or European levels. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 To conserve the Italian population through its ex Sand stock flower \u00a9 Sara Magrini 279 situ conservation in seed banks. \uf0b7\uf020 To develop a reintroduction protocol through field trials and experimental reintroductions. \uf0b7\uf020 To monitor the number of individuals of the reintroduced sub- populations. \uf0b7\uf020 To establish at least two new sub-populations in the historical distribution range in order to reinforce the native Italian population. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 To conserve seeds from all the Italian sub-populations of the study species in at least three different seed banks. \uf0b7\uf020 To investigate the best way to reintroduce the species, including a thorough understanding of the species\u2019 seed biology. \uf0b7\uf020 To increase the number of reproductive individuals in the Italian distribution range and decrease the extinction risk in Italy. Project Summary Feasibility: Three sites were selected for the experimental reintroductions, based on the ecology, logistics and historical distribution: 1) Torre Olevola (TOL): This site has public access and is affected by high human impact (tourism and urbanization) and the coastal vegetation is highly fragmented (high disturbance); an area of 1,800 m2 of the sand dune system, facing SE, was selected. 2) Site of Community Importance Litorale di Torre Astura (TAS): This site is included in the Nettuno Artillery Training Area; the public access is limited to the summer season (low disturbance); an area of 2,000 m2 of the well-developed sand dune system, facing SW, was selected. 3) Rio Martino (RIO): This site has public access but is included in the Circeo National Park and managed by the Italian National Forest Service (medium disturbance); an area of 1,300 m2 of the well-developed and lightly fragmented sand dune system, facing SW, was selected.

RIO: Between 2014 and 2015, 50 hardened adult (12 month old) and 50 juvenile (seven month old) plants were planted in plots of five in the interdune (portion of sand dune system between mobile and fixed dunes), keeping the two ages separate. Post-planting monitoring: In all cases, seedling emergence and plant survival was recorded monthly during the first year of the trial. After the first year, visits to reintroduced sub-populations were conducted on an annual basis during the reproductive season, to record the number of reproductive individuals. In TOL, the results of the experiment demonstrated that gap creation facilitated seed germination and seedling emergence. Thus, a significantly higher number of germinated seeds were found in the treated plots compared with the control plots; although only 5% of seeds introduced in the plots germinated during the first year. Since the monitoring in 2012, when 101 adult individuals were counted, this reintroduced sub-population continued to grow up to an estimated 5,000 adults in 2019. In TAS, a very low number of juveniles survived after the first year of reintroduction, compared to adult plants. Even if, initially, more adults survived in the slope facing inland than on the slope facing the sea, the plants planted on the sea-facing slope were able to establish and reproduce better, reaching ~3,000 Researcher planting M. littorea at TAS \u00a9 Sara Magrini 281 adult plants in 2019 against 30 on the slope facing inland. Regarding the sowing trial, no seedlings were ever recorded in the area with a high density of Carpobrotus, while 10 seedlings were recorded after one year in the area with a high density of Agave. After another year, a total of 62 seedlings were recorded and in 2019 a total of 66 adult plants were recorded. In RIO, as in TAS, a very low portion (8%) of juveniles survived compared to adult plants (95%) and in 2019 a total of 112 adult plants were recorded. As a result of these interventions the number of Italian sub-populations doubled (from three to six) with the total number of reproductive individuals increasing from ~260 to more than 8,400. As highlighted in De Vitis et al. (2018), the small Italian sub-populations showed a decreased germination response, compared to other European large sub- populations, as a likely result of the reduced population size.

It is characterized by woody stems, densely branched, with persistent stipules and rachis in the old parts of the branches. Imparipinnate leaves, raceme 2 - 4 flowered and corolla white to yellowish. Seeds are reniform, brown-olivaceous, often blotched, smooth and laterally compressed. The flowering season of A. gennarii occurs from May to June, and fruits mature from June to July (Bacchetta & Brullo, 2006). Astragalus gennarii is an extremely narrow endemic plant to CE-Sardinia, with a single population, consisting of approximately 40 - 45 mature individuals, that grows on Mesozoic limestones in a restricted area of Monte Albo (Punta Turudd\u00f2, Lula; Bacchetta & Brullo, 2006; Cogoni et al., 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a1fe18c-543d-4861-8a42-3bb2d16944b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a1fe18c-543d-4861-8a42-3bb2d16944b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b3430adffa641162c578859cc555bd3629f22b71e7c4a5d86cd96264ee9a928"}, "2": {"node_id": "b89b4a2a-bc71-4f1a-bc6f-535cf614df47", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64d21f7886b45c7c7933b41b24ff5043bd0d287c6789c7f8b014a3f5559a2b6f"}}, "hash": "9626012ed069cfbf2eccf7041cd39423a45ff4188b30932cb5747fb40cd7b93d", "text": "Currently this plant species is not listed in any international, national or local regulations (Cogoni et al., 2014), however, due to the low number of reproductive individuals and for its narrow distribution, A. gennarii was assessed as Critically Endangered (CR) at global and regional level (Cogoni et al., 2014; Orsenigo et al., 2018).

Project Summary Feasibility: Astragalus gennarii is a chamaephytic spiny cushion, whose pulviniform habit is an adaptation to the ecological characteristics of the dry and windy habitats, typical of the Mediterranean mountains where the species occurs at ~700 - 1,055 m a.s.l. (Bacchetta & Brullo, 2006; Cogoni et al., 2014). From a bioclimatic point of view, the species falls in the Mediterranean pluviseasonal oceanic bioclimate, between the upper meso-Mediterranean and lower supra- Mediterranean thermotype and upper sub-humid ombrotype (Bacchetta & Brullo, 2006). Astragalus gennarii is an orophilous plant species that grows in dwarf shrub communities belonging to the Carici caryophylleae-Genistetalia lobelii Klein 1972 (Bacchetta & Brullo, 2006; Cogoni et al., 2014), associated with other endemic species such as Cerastium supramontanum Arrigoni, Cephalaria mediterranea (Viv.)

The main threats to the unique small population of A. gennarii are principally represented by natural factors (landslides processes), negative effects of unregulated grazing, and by tourist and recreational activities, in particular hikers. These threats could cause a reduction of the population and modifications in the habitat quality (Cogoni et al., 2014). In order to increase the number of mature plants, the translocation was planned as a reinforcement of the existing population (Fenu et al., 2019). Implementation: The translocation of A. gennarii has been carried out in an ecologically suitable site near the natural population, where the main threats, 285 related to landslide phenomena, unregulated grazing and human disturbance, were less important. All preparatory activities of A. gennarii translocation (e.g. site management actions and fence erection in order to prevent grazing) were started in April 2017, but due to the adverse weather conditions the translocation was postponed for the following year. In the first phase, seeds of A. gennarii were directly collected in 2016 from the remnant plants and, at the same time, stored in the Sardinian seedbank (BG-SAR) for future recovery or restoration programs and to implement an \u201cactive collection\u201d, which might be used in the future for producing further plants. The plants of A. gennarii were multiplied in a public nursery of Forestas Agency (Agenzia Forestale Regionale per lo Sviluppo del Territorio e l'Ambiente della Sardegna, Autonomous Region of Sardinia) located near the natural population, by both vegetative stems and seeds. In both cases, the substrate of the pots was taken from the natural population area and no horticultural treatments were adopted; all survived plants were cultivated in a nursery for two years before the transplantation. In February 2018, a suitable area was selected and fenced in order to reduce the unregulated grazing and the human disturbance; some preliminary management actions (e.g. natural vegetation removal, superficial plowing of the land, etc.) had been done to open suitable spaces to reintroduce the transplants (Fenu et al., 2019). In early March 2018, overall 350 plants were transplanted in the selected site with the support of the staff of the public administration of Forestas. Each transplanted plant has been labelled for following monitoring activities (Fenu et al., 2019). Post-planting monitoring: The management actions, in particular the natural vegetation control and the restoration of the protective fence damaged by wild and domestic animals, were regularly continuing. Finally, a species-specific monitoring protocol was planned and implemented for this translocation, in order to ensure its sustainability. In particular, during the first two years, all transplanted plants were monthly monitored from March to December, recording the growth, the survival rate of transplanted plants and the effectiveness of fence protection in the selected site. Flowering and reproduction outputs of the established plants and number of new established seedlings are planned to be monitored after three years from the transplanting action. Starting from the second year after the release, the monitoring activities will be carried out six times per year (bi- Translocation by Forestas staff \u00a9 Giuseppe Fenu 286 monthly). From the start of the flowering of the transplanted individuals, the phenological parameters will be also measured, in order to determine the long- term sustainability of the in situ actions. Preliminary results of the monitoring indicated a high survivorship rate of the transplanted individuals.

In our case, the Mediterranean salt meadows are a Habitat Directive protected, but specifically in Mallorca they are not a common habitat. We were lucky that the place of one of the last view populations of L. maritimum in Mallorca is now a natural park, so this means at less \u201cprotection\u201d when our project ends. In the other hand, the other cited population in Mallorca, in Capdepera was not possible to restore because the habitat had changed a lot. It was near a stream close to farm fields, and now there is only fields and the watercourse has been cemented. Besides this, we did not get any seeds from this population at Capdepera. We therefore decided to reintroduce the population in the Natural Park of S\u2019Albufera and to look for another place in the Natural Park with a similar habitat. The other important thing to consider is to have good plant material for the reintroductions. In our case, we used the accession conserved in the seed bank from 2000 expecting a good germination. The seeds are dehydrated with silica gel and conserved in frozen conditions (-18\u00baC). To use them for restoration they need to be defrosted and hydrated again very slowly. The germination of Linum maritimum has no problems with fresh Sea flax plant with close-up of flower 290 seeds, and we proved that the conserved ones were also viable. We use as well seedlings of L. maritimum collected from the living plant collection in the Soller Botanic Garden. Finally, is important to have a good team (staff, collaborators, volunteers, etc.) and as well a group of stakeholders to support the action plan. In addition to the people working in the CARE-MEDIFLORA project, and the team from S\u2019Albufera Natural Park, we had the collaboration of the nearby company Grupotel Parc Natural who give us irrigation water during the first year of the project. Communication with the media has been important to involve and raise the awareness of the communities with this project. Implementation: To implement the Reintroduction Plan, we contacted the Species Protection Services from the Balearic Government, who has the legal responsibility on protected species on the Island. After getting the necessary permission, the second step was to contact the stakeholders who could be affected by the recovery plan. In our case, the Director of Albufera Natural Park who was happy with the project and gave us all the help with his team and as well the collaboration of the company close to the place where the population had to be reintroduced (Grupotel Parc Natural). The land was cleaned of invasive species and competitive ones like some young Pinus halepensis and basically the species Schoenus nigricans. At the same time, in the Botanic Garden we start the germination of conserved seeds 17 years ago and the plant production from the seedlings collected in the Garden. To avoid hybridized plants is important to maintain the collection isolated and to know very well the reproduction biology of the species. Post-planting monitoring: In the original site, we reintroduced 53 individuals during 2017. In the beginning only the survival of each individual was monitored and, during the summer the number of flowers and fruits produced each week. The number of new stems was monitored as well at the beginning as an indicator of growth. From the next spring, we monitored the number of seedlings in three plots of 50 x 50 cm as an indicator of population dynamics. At the beginning, there was a total of 118 seedlings, and at the end of the project in June 2019 only 23 of them had survived. On the other hand, for the new introduced population, the protocol was the same, but until the end of the project in June 2019 we did not record any new Transplanting Sea flax 291 recruitment. We planted 71 individuals in November 2017, and by June 2018, they were all alive and flowering but after the summer, only 38 plants survived. The habitat of the new introduced population was not as good as the habitat for the reintroduced one because of drought. After the first sowing in 2017, we have arranged for irrigation once a week courtesy of Grupotel Parc Natural who give us the facilities and monitoring has been done once a week during the first year and then once a month until June 2019.

In 2018, this taxa was split in two subspecies: valincoana, a strict Corsican endemic of the west coast and crispa on the east coast (Paradis et al., 2018). If crispa subspecies is located in several localities in the northwest Sardinian coast, in Corsica only two little populations could be found. They are found strictly on sandy littoral habitat, and the species suffers numerous anthropogenic impacts due to beach activities on properties without a clear legal status. For many years, different tools were used such as in situ conservation and legal enforcement actions. Due to this we decided to create new populations on managed land in two locations around 25 km north of where natural populations are found. The sites were Gradugine (Serra di Fiumorbu district) and Del Sale (Aleria district), both belonging to the \u201cConservatoire du Littoral\u201d (Cdl) (French coastal protection agency) and managed by guards of the \u201cCollectivit\u00e9 de Corse\u201d (CdC).

Project Summary Feasibility: Anchusa crispa is an endangered species, with national conservation measures defined in the National Action Plan (PNA) (Piazza, 2012). In this document, ordered and approved by the French Ministry of Ecology, new population\u2019s creation in protected areas is expected and the CBNC carried out the operation. This aims to improve the conservation status of threatened Mediterranean plant species in Mediterranean islands of CAREMEDIFLORA program, financed by MAVA Foundation and in Corsica by OEC. First, the question was to find suitable land for introduction. Three major criteria have been implemented: 1) Environmental conditions (land size, humidity, substrate organic matter\u2019s percentage, plant competition), 2) threats (erosion or sandy storm cover, land uses and practices), 3) land legal status (public or private). For 13 potentially favorable sites each criterion were evaluated. Finally, the two best-rated sites have been selected with an appointed expert namely Gradugine and Del Sale (Paradis, 2014). Then legal permits for protected plant collection and introduction have been submitted to the French Environment Ministry office in Corsica (DREAL Corse), and the project has been approved by the Regional Scientific Council of Natural Heritage of Corsica (CSRPN), and the National Council for Nature Protection (CNPN) of the French Environment Ministry. From the program point of view, rules were defined in a partnership agreement between the local project leader (OEC), the land\u2019s owner (Cdl) and the land manager (CdC). Overall view of the habitat, Canella \u00a9 Paradis 295 As conservation is not only a biological point of view, legal and social rules must be always taken in account, even if it needs time, and usually some more in managed areas. But, being on protected and managed land is a security to ensure the sustainability of actions (Godefroid et al., 2010). Implementation: The second and third steps were seed collection and germination tests from the two natural populations. They were carried out by CBNC, and plants were produced on agreement bases by a private nursery specialized in wild species cultivation. In situ introductions were initiated in November 2017 to take advantage of the first autumn rains and therefore increasing the chances of success. All the 172 plants, of six months old, were introduced, without mixing provenance. CdC, CBNC and Cdl carried out the action jointly. Each specimen has been described, mapped and photographed. Post-planting monitoring: According to the protocol defined by the CBNC, monitoring by CdC started in February 2018. This protocol take in account survival rate, mapping, photographing and plant description (character, diameter, phenology, etc.) identifying and mapping seedlings, vegetation dynamics. Monitoring has to be done monthly during the first five years. Afterwards, only an annual monitoring in spring will be sufficient. In addition of this protocol, due to their regular management mission, guards give us extra observations as presence and impacts of wild animals, specific climatic events, activities impacts which is important information for highlighting results. Presently, only 20 months of monitoring have been done, and no serious conclusion can be formalized. Nevertheless, we have first results to share: \uf0b7\uf020 Spring 2018: The recovery rate reached 73% and 87% of them flowered and fruited. \uf0b7\uf020 Autumn 2018: The recovery rate declined to 27% due to the Adrian storm (29th October 2019).

Gerstberger & B. Egli (Apiaceae) is a dwarf perennial, entirely glabrous and extremely geophytic, with a fusiform to cylindrical taproot 1 - 2 cm in diameter. Only about 10% of its total length usually emerges above ground level at flowering time. It is an endemic of Crete, Greece and only found on Mt. Ida (Psiloritis), the mountain range of central Crete, at about 1,500 m a.s.l. This species was first described in 1990 and it is the only species belonging to the genus Horstrissea, which is closely related to the genus Scaligeria. It co- occurs with many other plants endemic to the calcareous mountains of Crete such as Arum idaeum, Asperula idaea, Centaurea idaea, Cirsium morinifolium, Draba cretica, Prunella cretensis. Horstrissea dolinicola has been categorized as CR (Critically Endangered) according to IUCN Red List Criteria B1ab (ii, v)+2ab(ii, v); C2a(i); D ver 3.1. It is also considered one of the Top 50 Mediterranean Island Plants (update 2017) by the IUCN/SSC Mediterranean Plant Specialist Group. As a threatened and endemic species to Crete, it is protected by the Greek Law 3937/2011. The unique population of the species is found within the Natura 2000 site GR4330005 - Oros Idi (Vorizia, Geranoi, Kali", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bba882bf-a8d7-44df-827b-fc850d6f43ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "bba882bf-a8d7-44df-827b-fc850d6f43ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6542c2b3486274c3410a4525d71042af3c7f4647a93e82ca519ac04e23da3b97"}, "3": {"node_id": "721dd9a0-0798-4d05-bdbb-e2914697a01d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cfd79ef36fa440e99ea1f6b73313835be1aab3f6d6645efb52389ce6ebbbe46c"}}, "hash": "187444cf545878a207ef8089741eb2cf03ac82bff07478498872e81a2f6debc0", "text": "Madara).

Project Summary Feasibility: Horstrissea dolinicola grows in a few limestone sinks (dolines) in a region where many goats and sheep graze during the summer season. Its unique population is confined to an area where livestock farming is promoted by policies that support livestock development in the region. The species (and most of its co- occurring plants) is well adapted to withstand extreme grazing pressure, however livestock installations such as small containers for animal feeding and watering establishments, present a threat to the species' survival. In addition, places where it is located are adjacent to the road network. These sites also face the greatest pressure as they are used as car parking areas and illegal deposition sites (stones, etc.); they are also threatened with a possible widening of the road network. Concrete in situ and ex situ conservation actions have been planned and implemented in the framework of the project CARE-MEDIFLORA, funded by the MAVA Foundation (2016 - 2019). Initially, a detailed distribution map of the species population was created and the size of the population was more accurately estimated (approximately 300 individuals); a management plan was elaborated for in situ translocation actions in the area. At the same time, a close collaboration was developed with the local stakeholders, mainly managing authorities and farmers: despite initial hesitations, the Municipal Authority and the local farmers concluded that this unique element of the area's natural environment should be protected; it was agreed to move part of the livestock installations to adjacent areas and administrative measures to be adopted according to the national biodiversity legislation for protected species and areas by the Decentralized Administration of Crete - Forest Directorate of Rethymnon. More specifically the establishment of a Plant Micro-Reserve (PMR) for the species was planned taking the legal status of a \u201cProtected natural formation\u201d (Greek Law 1650/1986 as amended by Law 3937/2011). The official 300 decision for the creation of the PMR of 3.8 ha was made by the Decentralized Administration of Crete (Government Gazette of Greece: FEK D/250 18-5- 2020). Following the project CARE-MEDIFLORA, a new project funded by the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund was initiated in May 2020 in order to continue conservation actions for this plant until 2022. An information sign has been placed at the established Micro -Reserve and monitoring and reinforcement actions will be continued. Implementation: For in situ conservation actions, namely the reinforcement of the natural population, seeds of an accession of 2007 from the same area, stored in the Seed Bank of MAICh, were used. The ecophysiology of seed germination of this species is already well studied (Fournaraki & Thanos, 2009; Fournaraki, 2010): the seeds of this species have developed a rare germination strategy characterized by double morpho-physiological dormancy; during the first year, after an extended period of low temperatures (5 - 10\u00b0C), the release from morphological dormancy is observed, followed by elongation of the underdeveloped embryo, radicle emergence and development of a single cotyledon (pseudomonocotyly). However, the epicotyl remains dormant. By the end of spring, the above ground part (cotyledon) dries out while a small tuber has already developed. During the second year, again under low temperatures, the tuber sprouts (removal of epicotyl dormancy) and produces long petiolate, lobed leaves.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "721dd9a0-0798-4d05-bdbb-e2914697a01d": {"__data__": {"id_": "721dd9a0-0798-4d05-bdbb-e2914697a01d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6542c2b3486274c3410a4525d71042af3c7f4647a93e82ca519ac04e23da3b97"}, "2": {"node_id": "bba882bf-a8d7-44df-827b-fc850d6f43ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "187444cf545878a207ef8089741eb2cf03ac82bff07478498872e81a2f6debc0"}}, "hash": "cfd79ef36fa440e99ea1f6b73313835be1aab3f6d6645efb52389ce6ebbbe46c", "text": "According to all experimental evidence, seedling establishment takes place during the second spring after seed dispersal (occurring in autumn).

It forms small shrubs with erect stems and pink flowers that appear from late spring to autumn (Pignatti, 1982). Flowers are insect pollinated and seeds are dispersed by gravity, lacking clear long distance dispersal mechanisms. In Sicily, D. rupicola subsp rupicola is found mostly on carbonatic substrates, except for a couple of very few-numbered populations growing on volcanic rocks located in the north-eastern sector of the island. This taxon is included in the Annex II and IV of the Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC) and is listed in the category \u201cLeast Concern\u201d in the Red List of the Italian Flora (Rossi et al., 2013) while the species is evaluated as \u201cNear Threatened\u201d at European level (Bilz et al., 2011). The main threat to Dianthus rupicola subsp. rupicola is represented by habitat modification, both in terms of rock quarries or urban sprawl (e.g. touristic infrastructures, etc.) and, likely most severe, by invasive alien species (IAS) as, for example, Opuntia sp. pl.

Project Summary Feasibility: In Sicily, there are just two populations of Dianthus rupicola subsp. rupicola growing on volcanic substrates. One is located within the SCI ITA 070004 \u201cTimpa di Acireale\u201d and another one is found close to the Vallone Calcarone (Militello Val di Catania). Both are threatened by soil erosion and by invasive alien species, particularly by Opuntia ficus-indica. The loss of habitat and the competition with invasive alien species are, globally, recognized among the major drivers of biodiversity loss. To address these points within the CARE- MEDIFLORA project and to preserve the unique adaptation of the \u201cTimpa di Acireale\u201d population, we decided to introduce this genotype to a nearby volcanic islet, namely Isola Lachea, falling within the Nature Reserve \u201cIsola Lachea and Faraglioni dei Ciclopi\u201d. The Lachea islet has been managed as a private property for part of its history and there is still plenty of exotic vegetation on it.

Currently, the introduction area is managed by CUTGANA, an institution devoted to the management and conservation of natural ecosystems. All the actions (eradication of IAS, plants introduction, natural vegetation restoration, and long term management plan) have been agreed and realized by us, in collaboration with CUTGANA. In order to maximize the survival rate of the introduced specimens, we planted both juvenile plants and seeds. The plants were produced from seeds collected from the population of \u201cTimpa di Acireale\u201d, previously tested at the Seed Bank of the University of Catania to assess their viability and germination requirements. Finally, the location of the introduction site within a protected area and the involvement of the CUTGANA staff will ensure the protection of the new population and the monitoring of invasive species. Implementation: The Botanic Garden of the University of Catania, in collaboration with a private company, provided the facilities and the expertise to produce Dianthus rupicola subsp. rupicola from seed.

Epifanio 14, 27100 Pavia, Italy simone.orsenigo@unipv.it 2 - Museo di Storia Naturale di Milano, Corso Venezia 55, 20121 Milano, Italy Introduction The taxonomy of Hieracium L. (Asteraceae) is very intricate since this genus includes numerous taxa that reproduce by obligate or facultative apomixes. The high variability of the genus results in a high number of taxa (over 6,000). One of these taxa is endemic to the old town of Milan: Hieracium australe Fr. subsp. australe (Orsenigo et al., 2019). This taxon was described in 1848 on samples collected from the walls of Milan (Fries, 1848) and after almost one century of oblivion from its last report (Fenaroli & Zahn, 1927), it was recently rediscovered, on the walls of the Sforza Castle (Galasso et al., 2012). In 2016, only four individuals were counted and the species was considered \u201cCritically Endangered\u201d (CR) (Fenu et al., 2016). So, a reinforcement of this population was necessary to avoid its extinction. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Protect the few surviving individuals in order to guarantee their reproduction. \uf0b7\uf020 Study the reproductive biology of the species. \uf0b7\uf020 Produce plants with seeds collected by surviving individuals. \uf0b7\uf020 Reinforce the small surviving population of Milan\u2019s Hawkweed. \uf0b7\uf020 Identify suitable release sites in the historical area of occurrence of the taxon.

An amount of seeds was used to study the germination ecology, identifying the most favorable germination period. Seeds of H. australe subsp. australe show a light physiological dormancy, since a part of seeds germinate immediately after the dispersion (autumn), while the remaining ones germinate in spring, after the winter period. This will probably allow the species to avoid the risk that particularly cold winters, or particularly dry springs, will compromise the survival of all germinated plants. Implementation: Four new plants were planted in May 2017, while at the beginning of December 2017, 39 small pots each containing 3 - 4 plantlets, were planted, divided into three small sites, close to each other. Moreover, 200 seeds were placed in the crevices between bricks of the walls. At the same time, the area where fenced to protect the few remaining adult plants. Post-planting monitoring: Twenty-one pots (54%) survived 18 months after the operation and two of the new release sites showed high mortality rates, only one seedling originated from seeds. Causes of mortality were not completely understood, but could be probably identify with competition with other plant species including the alien invasive Ailanthus altissima (Mill.)

Both sub-populations have been discovered recently (in 1991 and 2009, respectively) and are about 17 km distant from each other (Garf\u00ec et al., 2011). There are approximately 260 and 1,540 individuals respectively, and both of them probably represent the result of century-lasting clonal spreading (root suckers) from two single triploid, non- reproductive, plants (Christe et al., 2014). Hence, Z. sicula may be considered one of the rarest plants worldwide. Not capable anymore to Flowering branchlet of Zelkova sicula \u00a9 G. Garf\u00ec 312 spread out from its refugial sites, this species is threatened with increasingly frequent wildfires and extreme climatic events (Garf\u00ec et al., 2017a). Consequently, translocation probably represents the most effective strategy to ensure its survival in face of the rising intensity of stress and disturbance linked to ongoing global change. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Increase the number of self-sustained sub-populations of Z. sicula. \uf0b7\uf020 Use both known genotypes to form each new sub-population. \uf0b7\uf020 Better understand the ecological requirements of Z. sicula by following its response under new climatic conditions assumed to be more suitable than the current ones. \uf0b7\uf020 Reduce the risk of extinction due to stress and disturbance factors linked with global change, e.g. extreme drought and wildfires. \uf0b7\uf020 Set up the most effective criteria to ensure further translocation of the species in other areas of Sicily. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Number of plants successfully established after planting. \uf0b7\uf020 Growth performance in terms of total height and main shoot length. \uf0b7\uf020 Survival rate after 10 years. Project Summary Feasibility: Due to the sexual sterility of Z. sicula, the design of a dedicated vegetative propagation protocol was needed. Since Z. sicula revealed extremely recalcitrant to either in vivo or in vitro techniques, this task required many trials over a number of years and though finally effective, in the end it allowed producing a rather low number of new plants (Carra et al., 2019). Multi-year field observations highlighted the low fitness of the target species within its native habitat. Therefore, basic knowledge about its ecological requirements had to be improved. This issue took into account the data on growth performance recorded on a plant cultivated in Zelkova sicula two years after transplanting \u00a9 G. Garf\u00ec 313 less constraining conditions (at 820 m a.s.l.), the study of the biogeographical and palaeobotanical literature concerning the niche width of the entire genus, several field surveys of many populations of the closest biogeographical relatives, namely Z. abelicea, on Crete (Greece), and Z. carpinifolia, in Azerbaijan and Georgia. In addition, to ensure long-term conservation and sustainability, protected areas and public properties were preferred for the final site selection (Garf\u00ec et al., 2017b). Concerning this point, sometimes complex administrative procedures for permission were needed; in some cases, where authorization was denied despite the assumptions of ecological suitability, we were forced to select alternative neighboring locations. Implementation: After exploring 19 potential sites located in the mountainous ranges and protected areas of Sicily, four sites were selected for plantations, situated respectively on Nebrodi Mts. (Bosco Tassita, 1,309 m a.s.l.), Madonie Mts. (Bosco Pomieri, 1,340 m a.s.l.), Sicani Mts. (Bosco Ficuzza, 1,015 m a.s.l.) and Hyblean Plateau (Bosco Pisano, 507 m a.s.l.).

Before their transfer in the wild, plantlets were acclimatized for one growing season in a forest nursery located under meso-Mediterranean climatic conditions.

Watering was provided during the first summer after planting to prevent potential drought stress. A micro-weather station was set up in each site in order to collect environmental data useful to address future translocations, namely rainfall, temperature, air humidity and soil water content at three different depths (top soil, 30 and 60 cm). Post-planting monitoring: Immediately after the first plantations and until present, a monitoring activity has been carried out at least once a month during the growth season (April to September). For each plantlet basic data were recorded at planting, such as population of origin, propagation technique (in vivo or in vitro), micro-environmental conditions (light regime, micro-topography, potential competition). Periodical data collection included survival rate, length of the main shoot, phenology, visible pathogens (herbivore insects, fungi) and physical damages (climatic stress, accidental breaks). The amount of plants that have survived up to now is extremely high: in total 169 plants (95%) are alive, five died in 2017 (two at Bosco Pisano, one at Bosco Ficuzza, two at Bosco Tassita) and four in 2018 (one at Bosco Pisano, two at Bosco Ficuzza, one at Bosco Pomieri). The mean yearly growth rate was satisfactory, ranging from 11.1 - 21.1 cm depending on the site and the year. At the three most elevated sites some plants suffered from shoot breaks due to heavy snowfall during winter 2017 - 2018, and in spring 2019 also due to low temperatures. Significant insect defoliation was observed during two years on the plantations at Bosco Tassita and Bosco Ficuzza, whereas a number of plants in all sites showed low vigor, probably due to excessive shade from the pre-existing tree canopy. Therefore, it is planned to carry out thinning trials during the next winter. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 The setup of effective in vivo or in vitro propagation techniques has been extremely time-demanding and still needs refinements to improve the success rate. Heavy snowfall damage at Bosco Ficuzza \u00a9 G. Garf\u00ec 315 \uf0b7\uf020 The low number of available plants for translocation limited the possibility to test a wider range of ecological conditions in order to assess the most suitable ones. \uf0b7\uf020 Underestimated insect damages and breakage due to heavy snow significantly reduced/prevented the potential yearly height growth. \uf0b7\uf020 Unexpected cold stress may be invoked as the responsible for the low vigor of some plantlets at the most elevated sites. \uf0b7\uf020 The administrative procedures needed to obtain the authorization to select and perform the plantations have often been time-consuming and hampered by excessive bureaucracy. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Site selection must be done after obtaining the full support and agreement of all local stakeholders. \uf0b7\uf020 Since the release in public areas is believed to be an essential prerequisite, the time span necessary for granting permission should be adequately evaluated in the translocation planning process. \uf0b7\uf020 Based on a cross-control of the growth rates and the few casualties that have occurred up to the present day, some of the selected sites seem to be too cold (at least during winter season). Hence, a longer time-series of local climatic data is needed to identify the real climatic niche of the target species in order to find out the most suitable sites where further nuclei could be released. \uf0b7\uf020 The shade regime should be the object of accurate evaluation through time and the eventuality of specific silvicultural interventions (e.g. thinning the canopy of pre-existing tree cover) should be included in a post-planting conservation planning. \uf0b7\uf020 Up to present the plants issued from in vitro propagation seem to respond better in terms of overall growth rate and vigor.

Project Summary Feasibility: Habitat: Androcalva perlaria occurs on sandy-clay in seasonally-waterlogged sites adjacent to Eucalyptus occidentalis wetlands, growing with Anarthria laevis, Acacia cyclops, Actinodium calocephalum and Patersonia occidentalis. Due to extensive clearing and other impacts, site selection was a significant challenge. After extensive review, two sites were deemed potentially suitable: 1) large wetland reserve (Mettler Lake Nature Reserve) that appeared similar to natural A. perlaria habitat, and 2) site where A. perlaria already naturally occurred. The second site was a proposed minesite to act as a control, as natural A. perlaria plants within this population were very healthy, and there were no signs of diseases, pests, or grazing. Species: Androcalva perlaria is a quick growing seeder shrub that is readily propagated via the use of seeds, cuttings, and tissue culture (Nikabadi et al., 2010; Whiteley et al., 2016). It is low spreading and grows 0.5 m high by 1 m wide. Flowers are light cream and observed between September & December. The fruit is green-grey with a velvety hairy covering (Wilkins & Whitlock, 2011). Plants produce large numbers of small black physically dormant seeds, which form a persistent long-lived soil seed bank that is stimulated to germinate in response to fire (Turner et al., 2013). Seedlings reach reproductive maturity within 12 months of germination. Socio-political & economic: The implementation of the translocation was viewed as unlikely to cause significant adverse social and economic impacts as both of the sites selected for the translocation were either a Class A nature reserve with secure long-term conservation tenure or on a proposed mine site which had already been approved to be cleared thus the nature for undertaking the translocation was for research outcomes rather than purely for conservation purposes (Department of Parks and Wildlife, 2014). 324 Implementation: Translocation: The site at Mettler Lake Nature Reserve (~400 ha) had been burnt several years prior and was also fenced to exclude herbivores. The translocation site (~50 x 50 m) was located on the western side of the wetland and situated on the side of a gently sloping ridge within seasonally waterlogged wetlands. The site selected on the proposed mine was a similar size but left unfenced (no herbivore activity). This site was also open with relatively sparse overstory and understory present. Tubestock (derived from cuttings and seed) were produced six months before field installation in July 2014. Within each site, 80 plants were randomly placed in lines 1 m apart, numbered then measured, with a subset also receiving fertilizer and/or an anti-stress agent (aspirin solution). Cultural/tribal: Indigenous communities interested or involved in the region affected by this plan have not yet been identified. The Aboriginal Sites Register maintained by the Department of Indigenous Affairs does not list any significant sites in the vicinity of both translocation sites. However, not all significant sites are listed on the Register (Department of Parks and Wildlife, 2014). Trans-border: Not applicable. Veterinary/phytosanitary: Re-introduced plants were propagated using standard horticultural hygiene practices and grown in an accredited nursery (Kings Park and Botanic Garden Nursery) prior to field planting. Post-planting monitoring: Monitoring regime: Monitoring was undertaken after the first month and then every six months for the first year and then annually thereafter. Data collected included recording the number and health (1 to 5 rating system) of surviving plants, height, plant width, and reproductive state. Other metrics recorded included soil temperature and moisture, soil physical attributes, soil chemical attributes and details of the vegetation communities present.

It flowers once in its lifetime, usually from June to September. The occurrence of species is bound to fens. It requires mucky and boggy soils that are rich in calcium. It only grows on moist soils with permanently high level of groundwater. It does not tolerate stronger drying out of the rhizosphere, but is not adapted to longer-term flooding either. The decline of the species in the Czech Republic was caused by several impacts. Most historical localities were in the past strongly influenced by ploughing, draining (including pumping of drinking water) and input of nutrients from fertilization of surrounding fields. At present some of the biggest problems are unstable water regime, overgrowing of the habitat due to insufficient management and devastation of plants by non-native slugs. The restoration of Marsh angelica population required relatively small funds. At the beginning of the Action Plan larger amount of money was needed for restoration of sites (restoration of water regime at the last site of Marsh angelica, cutting down self-seeded shrubs and trees, sowing of regional species mixture to low-diversity grasslands originally restored on arable land). After establishing the ex situ culture of Marsh angelica the cultivation of the species is easy and high amounts of seeds can be produced with relatively small funds. Most costs go to habitat management with special mowing carried out in places with populations of Marsh angelica forming only one third of this money. Implementation: The ex situ rescue culture was established at the end of the late 1980s from the remaining plants at Hrdibo\u0159ick\u00e9 rybn\u00edky site. Attempts to restore a population of Marsh angelica have been going on since 1990 but regular activities started in 2000 when the Action Plan for Marsh angelica was approved. Activities aimed at reintroduction of Marsh angelica took Searching for seedlings in a site flooded by European beaver \u00a9 Jitka Uhl\u00edkov\u00e1 329 place at Hrdibo\u0159ick\u00e9 rybn\u00edky and \u010cernov\u00edrsk\u00e9 slatini\u0161t\u011b sites. Marsh angelica was reintroduced by planting of seedlings, but mostly by sowing of seeds to 1 x 1 m plots and later with enough seeds also by larger scale sowing (~3 plots of 10 x 10 m yearly). Activities focused on regular management were also part of conservation activities. Two studies focusing on genetic variability and relationships among populations of Marsh Angelica from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Germany were carried out. The study from 2010 showed that genetic variability of the Czech population is smaller than the variability of the Polish and Hungarian populations, but it is still high enough to keep relatively good likelihood of survival for the species. The study from 2016 used sequencing of selected chloroplast regions. The data showed that the Czech population is somehow unique compared to the neighboring countries. Post-planting monitoring: Population size is assessed every year. Monitoring consists of counting flowering plants and non-flowering plants with leaves bigger than 15 cm. This size limit was chosen because it is nearly impossible to count plants with smaller leaves in tall vegetation. Other data such as infestation by insects or slugs are recorded and then the conservation status and trend of the population is evaluated. Ground water level is continuously measured by automatic data loggers. The Action Plan seemed to be successful at the Hrdibo\u0159ick\u00e9 rybn\u00edky site until 2013. A spontaneous population was established at Hrdibo\u0159ick\u00e9 rybn\u00edky in 2003, but seeds were added in the following years as well, ending in 2011. More than 2,364 flowering plants of Marsh angelica were recorded there in 2013, which was the highest number of flowering plants since the beginning of the conservation activities. In 2014, the site was flooded due to activity of European beaver and only five flowering and 30 non-flowering plants were present. The large seed bank present at the site after the intense flowering in 2013 was very likely destroyed by the still water that remained there for the whole summer of 2014. Further restoration of Marsh angelica population was negatively affected by Spanish slug consuming the seedlings. Only few dozens of plants were found in the last two years. Attempts to reintroduce Marsh angelica to \u010cernov\u00edrsk\u00e9 slatini\u0161t\u011b were not successful.

The species is an obligate serpentinophyte and thus it occurs only on serpentine. M. smejkalii prefers sunny habitats with sporadic vegetation such as rock platforms, shallow serpentine soils and sparse grasslands in open pine forests. M. smejkalii is Czech endemic species, whose worldwide distribution is limited only to two nearby areas, both included in the NATURA 2000 network. The first area is in the \u017delivka Site of community importance (SCI) - in part of the territory protected as National natural monument (NNM) Hadce u \u017delivky (six populations). The second area is in the Hadce u Hrn\u010d\u00ed\u0159 SCI (one population). M. smejkalii was reintroduced to one site in the \u017delivka SCI in 2018, where the species occurred in the past, but went extinct in 2012. Further, three current populations were reinforced. Minuartia smejkalii in natural habitat 332 Goals \uf0b7\uf020 To restore habitat condition at project sites. \uf0b7\uf020 To maintain the species in ex situ populations to preserve its genetic diversity (in botanical gardens and in private gardens). \uf0b7\uf020 To increase population size at three selected localities. \uf0b7\uf020 To re-establish viable population at one historical locality. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Self-reproducing ex situ population containing at least 600 individuals. \uf0b7\uf020 Creation of network of local gardeners cultivating the species including 10 gardeners for each site. \uf0b7\uf020 Self-reproducing viable populations on three recent localities (at least 100 individuals depending on the size of the locality) and one historical locality (at least 600 individuals). Project Summary Feasibility: M. smejkalii prefers open serpentine rocks or open pine forests. The decline of the species was caused mainly by changes in the land used, e.g. absence of forest grazing or raking of litter.

Such conditions led to increased shading and competition (P\u00e1nkov\u00e1 et al., 2011). Suitable source of materials for species reintroduction was determined by genetic analysis and hybridization experiments. The results showed that plants from both areas should be kept separately, seeds from different populations within each site should be used for species reintroduction and only native seeds should be used for reinforcement of populations (Stojanova et al., under review). Implementation: Restoration of sites as well as species reintroduction was based on Management plans for both areas (Re\u0161lov\u00e1, 2011; Klaudys, 2012), but the extent of these actions was more intensive then described in these documents. We thus needed special permission from the state organs of nature protection. The action was implemented by the financial contribution of the EU, the Life program (project LIFE for Minuartia, LIFE15 NAT/CZ/000818, www.kuricka.cz) and the Ministry of Environment of the Czech Republic. The first step of the project was restoration of habitat conditions. Some trees and shrubs were cut to open the pine forests. High humus layer, together with ruderal species and mosses, was removed from the site manually and by a digger to uncover serpentine bedrock. Serpentine rocks covered by serpentine vegetation were created for ex situ conservation: large rocks (more than 30 m2) were created in Botanical garden of CAS in Pr\u016fhonice for Hrn\u010d\u00ed\u0159e area and in Visitor Centre Vodn\u00ed d\u016fm for \u017delivka area. Small rocks (~5 m2) were built in the private gardens. The major limitation was availability of seeds in the nature. Seeds were thus collected in several subsequent years and also population reinforcement and reintroduction were divided into two years. We used seeds collected in native 333 population for population reinforcement and seed mixture from \u017delivka SCI for species reintroduction. While ex situ population in Visitor center Vodn\u00ed d\u016fm was established from mixture of seeds from several populations in \u017delivka SCI, private gardens obtain seeds only from the largest one. Ex situ population in the Visitor center Vodn\u00ed d\u016fm was established in 2017 by sowing 2,300 seeds and planting of 400 juvenile plants. Additional 1289 juvenile plants were transplanted in 2018. Ex situ population in the Botanical garden in Pr\u016fhonice was established in 2018 by planting 150 individuals. The network of private gardens is continuously developing. Currently, we have 20 gardeners involved in the project, who care totally about 1,500 individuals. Reinforcement of populations was done in 2017 by sowing of more than 9,000 seeds and by planting 472 juvenile plants. In 2018 additional 111 individuals were planted. Species reintroduction started in 2018 by planting 1,101 individuals. Additional ~500 individuals will be planted in autumn 2019. Post-planting monitoring: Total population size, plant survival and size (e.g. plant size, number of flowering and non-flowering stems, seed viability) and number of new seedlings is evaluated every year in natural as well as in artificial populations. Size of all natural individuals is evaluated, while transplanted individuals are evaluated only in permanent plots. Seed viability is evaluated in standardized conditions in growth chambers in the Institute of Botany of the CAS. Habitat conditions are described every year by recording of phytocenological relev\u00e9s of 1 x 1 m, evaluation of temperature and soil moisture, chemistry (prior and after management interventions) and canopy openness. Additional parameters -gardeners care and state of the rock are recorded in the private gardens. Monitoring showed that sowing is not successful method of species support since only 14 individuals established in the nature (zero in the gardens). Planting of young plants was more successful, although we had problems with low stability of the newly created rocks in the gardens leading to high mortality of plants in some gardens in the first year. Nevertheless, plant survival was high in the first year (72% in the botanical gardens and 74% in private gardens), but declined in the second year (22% in the botanical gardens and 28% in private gardens), but new seedlings were able to substitute the dead plants so the populations are increasing.

Project summary Feasibility: The LSP is a perennial aquatic plant that grows especially in unpolluted, mesotrophic, 0.2 - 2.0 m deep water on humic or sandy soils, clayish, muddy or peaty beds. It occurs in lakes, river floodplains (river-oxbows, pools), moderately flowing water, ponds, and reservoirs. In most localities, LSP grows in neutral to slightly alkaline waters. The species is endangered by eutrophication, which results in high phytoplankton and filamentous algae biomass and low summer water transparency. Parts of shoots covered with algae necrotize and die (Prausov\u00e1 et al., 2015). Eutrophication of the Czech localities of LSP resulted in its being replaced by natant broadleaved pondweeds, Nuphar lutea, in small and shallow pools with littoral species and aquatic moss Calliergonella cuspidata. The growth of LSP is also limited by the influence of animals, especially herbivore fish Ctenopharyngodon idella and Mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos). Czech populations reproduce only clonally even though germination tests confirmed a germination ability (after interruption of their dormancy) of achenes gathered in Czech localities (Prausov\u00e1 et al., 2013, 2015). The success of seed germination and subsequent growth of its plantlets in natural sites in the CR is unlikely because of low water transparency, threat by herbivores and competitive organisms, and disturbances like floods. Clonal growth and a rapid extinction of most of the Czech populations caused a current very low genetic variability of LSP in the CR. Activities implemented from the Action Plan include a selection of potential localities (both native and established). Localities for reintroduction of LSP, a regular site and LSP population monitoring, and mainly revitalization of the OR and an insurance of sustainability of sites with LSP populations. Considering reintroductions, the first step was to select suitable localities for this measure. The best localities were searched in areas where was LSP formerly found, i.e. in the Orlice (East Bohemia) and Plou\u010dnice (North Bohemia) basins. Optimal parameters of water in selected localities were: summer water transparency more than 0.5 m, total alkalinity of at least 1.5 mekv.l-1, (moderately hard or hard water), 338 pH 7 - 9 (neutral to mildly basic), shading of water surface 15 - 50% (protection against overheating), electric conductivity 110 - 410 \u00b5S.m-1. Important factor also was a character of sediment on the bottom (only a thin layer, i.e. 2 - 5 cm, of mud on sandy or clayish sediment), and a plant community composition (absence of competitive broadleaved plants, aquatic moss and filamentous algae). The plants used for reintroduction and supplementation of LSP into selected localities and OR came from the rescue culture at IB CAS. The reintroductions have been performed since 2005 to 2018 into about 40 localities. Only two localities showed to be suitable for this species (Ka\u0161parovo Lake in the Orlice River basin, He\u0159mani\u010dky - oxbow of the Plou\u010dnice River in the North Bohemia). Success of reintroduction was negatively influenced by unpredicted weather development, and sudden change of water level and floods that damage planted shoots with an undeveloped root system. Negative impact of herbivorous fish, ducks or chemicals - pesticides occasionally occuring in water of Orlice River, were observed for several times. Implementation: At first, all required administrative matters had to be taken care of in advance. This included or example official agreements of relevant conservation offices or permissions from watercourse manager (i.e. Povod\u00ed Labe, state enterprise). The number of outplanted shoots depends on the number of successfully grown shoots in IB CAS in a particular year.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41f46ebd-6089-455a-a1b7-024452edf1d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "41f46ebd-6089-455a-a1b7-024452edf1d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab17492ccb0b03908f7dd62d62aaafe66d28e46e9140ddf7961689c6a5503596"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc0a6ca7-1725-4ef7-be00-2ba61fa65177", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2063d33815df9a52cfe7515436c497996a76fa9ed44e221b3699da836c1df6eb"}}, "hash": "dd258e3684407132e956f5d512f1a37534a39d4e4b85d946eb8b2000a8032f1e", "text": "Since 2011 were plants for reintroduction grown from apical shoot segments of a tissue in vitro culture.

The number of bunches and particular shoots (all, fertile, sterile) have been recorded during monitoring every year. Microsites with LSP population were localized by GPS to get a more detailed picture of its occurrence. The failure of the out- planting could be caused by using a low number of planted shoots, plants of small size and their low adaptability to the new environment. It is really complicated to predict weather development and the time of sudden change of water level or flood. Shoots carried away by the stream have a very low possibility to take root in a proper site. Using of pesticides and fishing (mainly herbivorous species) show to be strong and unpredicted factors in success of LSP reintroduction. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Unsuitability of most of historical localities for the LSP reintroduction (irreversible changes of their site conditions). \uf0b7\uf020 Unpredictability of weather development, sudden changes of water level and floods. \uf0b7\uf020 Insufficient protection of localities against occasional pollution by pesticides. \uf0b7\uf020 Insufficient protection of localities against illegal introduction of non-native herbaceous fish, semi-wild ducks (hybrids of domestic and wild ducks). \uf0b7\uf020 Frequent changes of site conditions correlating with climatic fluctuations and extremes. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 It is extremely important to outplant LSP to a suitable habitat and to ensure it will stay suitable in the future (that means mostly ensuring needed site conditions). \uf0b7\uf020 The time of out-planting to adapt to the weather and consequences of sudden changes of site conditions. \uf0b7\uf020 For both reintroductions and supplementations, to use more than 100 shoots with well developed rhizomes/locality. \uf0b7\uf020 Needed cooperation with watercourse manager (i.e. Povod\u00ed Labe, state He\u0159mani\u010dky - oxbow of Plou\u010dnice River with reintroduced population \u00a9 R. Prausov\u00e1 340 enterprise), and Czech Fishing Union (mainly regional association). \uf0b7\uf020 Proper coordination and communication with all involved partners and public influencing the landscape in a surrounding of LSP localities is necessary. Success of project Only some success indicators have been reached in reintroduction and supplementation so far and the consequences of revitalization of the last native locality are expected. The number of localities with particularly successful reintroduction is less than what is stated in the original plan. Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 Proper theoretical preparation and planning, use of experience collected from literature or own research. \uf0b7\uf020 Yearly availability of shoots for planting thanks to the tissue in vitro culture. \uf0b7\uf020 Unpredictable development in weather and sudden changes of water level and floods. \uf0b7\uf020 Complications in communication with fishmen and public influencing the surrounding of localities (use of pesticides, etc.).

Throughout China, there are 21 Abies species, typically distributed in the mountains of the northeast and southwest regions. Four of the 21 species are endemic and found in the mountains of southern China, namely Abies banshanzuensis, A. ziyuanensis, A. yuanbaoshanensis and A. fanjingshanensis. Living beyond the typical distribution range of Abies species, these four types of firs are considered as relict species of the Pleistocene glaciation (Xiang, 2001). Among them, the Yuanbaoshan fir is confined to Yuanbao Mountains, Rongshui", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b82315d-782c-4e0f-a7c4-b1f1e157e7b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b82315d-782c-4e0f-a7c4-b1f1e157e7b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d9fc5f79962c2a90bdee0d37897daee3b258245e4474f4eeb108138e26d4cae"}, "3": {"node_id": "692a4d4d-21e6-40ce-b826-037790775e14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be816dd1906b797aa6a96e248379a28ea311953e698368b92a3a1b146a8e9d38"}}, "hash": "124f30789311ce2fd1d9178dab9695161685b65419eaabdbcd382923ac612ce4", "text": "County of North Guangxi. The Yuanbaoshan fir occurs from 1,750 to 2,050 m a.s.l. with a very restricted distribution of 18.6 ha on the top of mountain and a cool and wet climate (Li et al., 2002). Goals \uf0b7\uf020 To initiate the reinforcement of the Yuanbaoshan fir enhancing its resilience in the face of climate change over the next 40 years. \uf0b7\uf020 To understand the adaptive capacity of the Yuanbaoshan fir outside of its current range. \uf0b7\uf020 To apply the experience and lessons learned from the Yuanbaoshan fir to the reintroduction of other tree species in the future. Yuanbaoshan fir \u00a9 Ding Tao 342 Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 At least 400 - 500 Yuanbaoshan fir planted seedlings survive after the first phase of the project. \uf0b7\uf020 No human disturbance found around reinforcement sites. \uf0b7\uf020 The seedlings have been planted outside of their current range, in three habitat types with different altitudes. \uf0b7\uf020 A mechanism for long-term monitoring and after care for seedlings is in place after the first phase of the project. \uf0b7\uf020 The comprehensive plan and annual report of the reinforcement has been issued after the first phase of the project. Project Summary Feasibility: Yuanbaoshan Nature Reserve was gazetted in 1982 and the habitat of Yuanbaoshan fir has been well protected (Huang. 1998), but the total global population is found in this reserve - around 300 mature individuals and 600 immature trees. Sub-adult trees are rare, many of these trees are less than 15 years old and regeneration is limited. From 1999, the Guangxi Institute of Botany started their research on this species. This has including the ecological and biological characteristics, discovering maturity of this species to occur between 40 - 50 years of age and the species preference for cool, wet, mountainous habitat. According to research on the scattered and restricted distribution pattern of the four fir species in southern China (Xiang, 2001), it has been concluded that, with a warming climate, the species\u2019 range is shrinking and it is being confined to the tops of the mountains. With global warming continuing, they are most likely to become extinct as they have nowhere further to go (Xiang, 2001). From 2012, direct conservation action started including quadrat sampling monitoring, regular patrolling, sustainable seed collecting, breeding, community engagement, community participatory conservation, genetic diversity research. This has been possible through the support of FFI China/the Global Trees Campaign, Guangxi Biodiversity Research and Conservation Association, Yuanbaoshan National Nature Reserve Management Bureau, Guangxi Institute of Botany and Guangxi Forestry Department. By the end of 2015, direct conservation action supported by these partners led to significantly reduced anthropogenic threats including trampling by tourists and cattle, grazing and non-timber forest product collection. Yuanbaoshan fir cones \u00a9 Ding Tao 343 Furthermore, in 2015, 2,000 seedlings were propagated successfully and the reintroduction plan was approved by all partners. Implementation: Prior to the first phase of this reintroduction project, running from 2016 - 2020, some specific preparation was conducted. The nursery and seedling propagation techniques were developed, genetic diversity analysis was conducted and release sites were selected. Site selection was conducted by all partners, based on distance to a water source (minimized), distance to human disturbance (maximized) and in the Experimental Zone of Yuanbaoshan Nature Reserve as the rule of nature reserve only permitted the experiment to occur in the experiment zone. The result was a group of five sites, at the altitudes of 1,500 m, 1,600 m and 1,700 m, all under the altitude of the current habitat. The site above the altitude of the current habitat will be selected in other nature reserves for the second phase. The nursery was built and managed by Yuanbaoshan Nature Reserve, supported by FFI China, Seedling propagation and genetic diversity research was managed by Guangxi Institute of Botany. The genetic diversity research on the fir using ALFP (Amplified fragment length Polymorphism) approach showed a very low level, and does not show any likely sub-population (Wang et al., 2004), this indicated that seeds should be collected from mother trees.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "692a4d4d-21e6-40ce-b826-037790775e14": {"__data__": {"id_": "692a4d4d-21e6-40ce-b826-037790775e14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d9fc5f79962c2a90bdee0d37897daee3b258245e4474f4eeb108138e26d4cae"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b82315d-782c-4e0f-a7c4-b1f1e157e7b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "124f30789311ce2fd1d9178dab9695161685b65419eaabdbcd382923ac612ce4"}}, "hash": "be816dd1906b797aa6a96e248379a28ea311953e698368b92a3a1b146a8e9d38", "text": "In total, 2,300 seedlings were propagated from the 31 mother trees, fieldwork aiming to maximize genetic diversity of seedlings collected also factored in ease and safety of access as well as seeds availability.

Post-planting monitoring: Immediately after planting and every six months hence, seedling height and basal diameter were recorded. Seedlings were cared for during weekly patrols of the reserve by forest staff. Any weeds or branches within a 75 cm radius around seedlings were removed and, in the dry season, watering took place weekly over the first year following planting.

By the end of 2019, across the five sites, there was an average height increase of 3.1 cm with an average 0.4 cm basal diameter increasing. There has been a high survival rate of 93%, with all 18 seedling deaths attributed to drought or the impact of fallen branches from the canopy. By the end of 2019, analysis of the mycorrhiza- containing root soil data showed that seedlings survival and growth in the two soil types was not significantly different. However, we believe this experiment should be repeated and, going forward, we plan to obtain expert guidance. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 The Yuanbaoshan fir reaches maturity after 40 - 50 years, so it is difficult to see an impact on the population even after a successful first phase of reinforcement. This impacts the degree to which all partners feel committed and motivated towards delivering the reinforcement plan over the long term. \uf0b7\uf020 The Yuanbaoshan fir tree is located on steep mountainous terrain in dense forest and is between 15 - 25 m in height which makes canopy seed collection and the monitoring of health and phenology challenging. \uf0b7\uf020 The cone-bearing of the Yuanbaoshan fir exhibits a cyclical pattern in terms of cone quantity, which significantly varies between years (Tang et al., 2001). Over the whole Yuanbaoshan fir population between 2006 to 2019, cones appeared in large numbers (more than 200 cones on every tree) on average every fourth year. This irregular production of cones means collecting seeds for the nursery is very opportunistic leading to low numbers of seedlings. \uf0b7\uf020 The research on mycorrhiza-containing root soil of the natural habitat needs to be refined and developed over time. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Basic biological, ecological and genetic research have been extremely important to prepare appropriate seedlings and choose planting sites. Without this basic research, much time and resources would have been wasted. Post-plantation monitoring - Luo Dingming Yuanbaoshan Nature Reserve 345 \uf0b7\uf020 Achieving zero human disturbance in the nature reserve, especially in the core zone of the Nature Reserve, through enhancing patrols, awareness raising and increasing community participation through the piloting of ecotourism has been crucial to the project\u2019s success. \uf0b7\uf020 Effective collaboration between the scientific team and the reserve staff and managers has enabled the success of the project and a joint stewardship of the data generated. This has been due, in part, to a stable workforce and regular communication between the partners involved. \uf0b7\uf020 Actively ensuring low project costs through promoting in-kind funding has maximized the sustainability of the project, especially considering its long term nature. Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 By the end of 2019, 250 seedlings have been prepared and planted, with a reintroduction plan supported by all partners. More 250 seedlings will be planted in 2020 and 2021, and there are 2,000 seedlings growing in the nursery. \uf0b7\uf020 The scientific team have been cautious and within this first stage carefully considered the adaptive capacity of the fir in the plan of the reintroduction, and so the sites selection have been implemented carefully. \uf0b7\uf020 Clearly defined roles within the team along with a sustainable monitoring and after-care regime in place, that have make sure the sustainability over a long time for the success of the reinforcement. \uf0b7\uf020 The comprehensive plan and annual report of the reinforcement has been established which will lead to future monitoring, evaluation and adaptive management.

Uchiyama in Suanbo area, South Korea and recorded in 1937 as a variant of A. altaicus by Kitamura. It is endemic to Korea, and is called \u2018Danyang aster\u2019 in Korean. Rosette type of above ground parts remain in winter and it blooms in the following year. Wild habitats are in the channel fill deposits and soil is composed of sand and gravels. It is known that the species is distributed in a wide range of the channel fill deposits of southern Hangang River. However, currently it is found in very limited areas. In 2005, the Ministry of Environment in Korea listed the species in the Second Class of Endangered Species and the Korea Forest Services listed it in 2002, as a Rare and Endemic Plant. The population size of the species depends on the geographical conditions of the habitats, i.e. flooding (NIBR, 2010). It has rosette form to tolerate the harsh ecological conditions such as low minerals in soil, and high temperature and radiation in summer (Matsumoto et al., 2000). Germination of seeds begins spring but it last longer period because of the moisture contents in the coarse sandy soil (Mitsuko et al. 2005). Danyang aster in its natural habitat 347 The wild habitats of the species became narrower due to the construction of dams or barrages that block water flow, and dredging. These pressures changed the seasonal flooding pattern, introduced the competitive vegetation like Gramineae and became unfavorable environment for the species (Muranka et al., 2012). We have been monitored, since 2002, the population of the species in a natural habitats on Dori Island, Yeoju, Korea. The number of individuals in the area and the size of the distribution kept decreasing dramatically. Some sub-groups of the species on the Island disappeared during monitoring. We aim to reintroduce propagated plants to prevent the extinction of the species and to increase the density/number of individuals. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 To plan both in- and ex situ conservation strategies of A. altaicus var. uchiyamae. \uf0b7\uf020 To reintroduce and recover the number of individuals to the level in 2012 (minimum number, 23 plants/m2). \uf0b7\uf020 To connect with fragmented populations in Dori Island. \uf0b7\uf020 To remove competitive and invasive vegetation and sediment preventing plant growth. \uf0b7\uf020 To implement a regular monitoring to the translocated site over 10 years. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Natural increases of individuals from the reintroduced ones. \uf0b7\uf020 Density balances of age classes. \uf0b7\uf020 Connecting the neighboring meta-populations. \uf0b7\uf020 Red List category of the species changes from endangered to vulnerable.

However, the natural habitats have deposited clay and sands covered with the gravel that has resulted in the invasion of competitive vegetation. There is a need to remove excessive soils, gravel and rocks and resulting competitive vegetation.

Project Summary Feasibility: Bulbophyllum maxillare was first collected by J.S. Goodenough at Kranji in 1890 and was last collected by the director of the Botanic Gardens, Henry Ridley, from Kranji in 1892. Since then, the species has not been rediscovered and became nationally extinct. The species was propagated from seeds by using nursery materials from Peninsular Malaysia. Implementation: Seedlings culture: Propagation of seeds is the most effective way to conserve orchid species. A modified KC medium is used for the germination of seeds; once germinated, seedlings are transferred to a second medium (Arditti, 1977; Yam, 2013; Yam et al., 2013). Seedlings are grown to about 4 cm tall, which takes about 12 months. They are then ready to be transferred to the nursery. Propagation of seedlings in nursery: Seedlings should generally be planted in groups of about 30 into community pots, using small charcoal pieces and brick chips. When the seedlings are well established, they are divided and planted individually on slab of wood. Plants are ready for reintroduction when each seedling has three to four new shoots and a healthy root system. Reintroduction: The seedlings were planted on trees during the rainy season, from the beginning of October to December. . Time of planting: The best time for planting tropical orchid seedlings is before or during the rainy season. In Singapore, the rainy season starts around October and lasts until January. Most of our plantings have been carried out from late September through November. Seedlings planted during these periods have established themselves quickly, producing new shoots and roots. Once the roots of epiphytic species have attached themselves to the bark of the host tree, they can absorb water and nutrients directly from the environment. Planting of orchids on rain trees 352 Host trees: Trees that support more epiphytes tend to be better hosts than those with fewer epiphytic plants, as their presence indicates that conditions are suitable for epiphytic species. Of all roadside trees that are suitable for epiphytes, the rain tree fosters the most luxuriant growth of epiphytic plants. The most common epiphyte found on rain trees is Asplenium nidus (Bird\u2019s nest fern) and Dendrobium crumenatum is the most common orchid. Planting: The seedlings were planted under the proper environmental conditions, for this species, they were planted on mature host trees with other epiphytes and with 30 - 50% shade. Slabs of wood with established seedlings were secured on tree trunks and/or branches with horticultural wires and/or nails. Seedlings were reintroduced to Sungei Buloh, Singapore Botanic Gardens, Telok Blangah Hill Park, Dairy Farm Nature Park, MacRitchie Reservoir, Pulau Ubin, Holland Road and Napier Road, Pasir Ris Park and several neighborhood parks throughout Singapore. Post-planting monitoring: Some of the reintroduced plants have grown for more than 10 years in various nature reserves, parks and on roadside trees. Some 80 - 90% of the plants planted under the optimal environmental conditions have survived, and most of them have flowered and fruited. Our hope is that these plants will be able to self-propagate by seed; in this way, our reintroductions can help to enrich the development of the ecosystems in which they have been planted. Their flowers may attract and support viable populations of pollinators, which may in turn allow the development of viable seeds. These seeds may be dispersed to nearby locations, and if mycorrhizal fungi are present, germination will be possible, allowing the recruitment of new native orchids into these habitats.

PESCA NEL MEDITERRANEO Mammiferi marini Dodici specie di cetacei, di due sottordini e cinque famiglie, appaiono con frequenza nel Mediterraneo e possono interagire in certa misura con la attivit\u00e1 di pesca (p.es. predazione di pesci, intrappolati con catture accidentali). Alcune altre specie in presenza minore vengono elencate alla fine di questa sezione. Nonostante la sua rarit\u00e1, la Sousa plumbea \u00e9 stata inclusa in questo documento, perch\u00e9 \u00e9 stato osservato che alcuni individui interagiscono con la attivit\u00e1 di pesca. Un focido (foca senza orecchie) appare principalmente nella regione orientale (sono stati effettuati pochi avvistamenti nella regione occidentale). La conservazione di tutte queste specie desta preoccupazione. Fonti e materiali di riferimento ACCOBAMS, 2015.
